0,Scheduled a therapy appointment and didn't overdose like I wanted.,I just want someone to be proud of me.
1,How to tell your parents you think you have depression?,"I think I’ve had depression for a while now but recently it’s gotten pretty bad and need help, how do I approach this and bring it up to my parents?"
2,I made tacos!,"Today, for the first time in about 5 years, I made tacos for dinner. This matters to me bc not only are tacos delicious, but this is the first time I've made them (or really cooked anything for myself) after being in a volatile long-term relationship, going through a lot of mental health stuff (depression, etc), and an currently teaching art online to elementary kiddos, so my stress/anxiety is through the roof overall. All this coupled with severe financial hardships caused in part by the relationship have made ""self care""....real hard, to say the least. But I made tacos, and they're as delicious as ever, and I'm proud of myself, and it's a start❤️ (pics of said tacos available upon request:) )"
3,small vent,"Ive went from being in the best place that I've been in years I was going out and seeing friends, eating regular meals that I cooked I was just in a really good place but overnight I've went from that to not being able to leave my bed. today I've slept for 16 hours and the only time I left my bed was to get my laptop so I could attend a uni lecture. I have no clue what's triggered this to happen nothing has changed at all I've stuck to the same routine for years because I know having a routine helps but sometimes that isn't good enough. I've got friends who also struggle with mental health but they don't understand what its like they always make jokes about theirs as a way of coping I do too but I just feel like there's nobody who understands."
4,Is there someone I can talk to?,I don't have friends and I kinda don't like therapists...
5,Can this month be over already?,"This month will be 5 years after a traumatic incident. I don’t want to talk much in detail because I’m not ready to discuss. I’ve been crying all weekend due to flashbacks, along with PTSD. I haven’t responded to most of my friends and left group chats in my nursing school courses. This, one of my classmates ignored me in my virtual fundamentals of nursing class. We were in the randomized group set up by my professor. The whole time I was quiet and waiting, the classmate full blown ignored me like I didn’t exist. I did nothing wrong. That triggered me to be upset and cry, that I abruptly left my class.

I’m tired of being depressed. Chronic clinical depression, anxiety, and PTSD suck."
6,How should I help my friend?,My friend has been spiralling out of control over the last few years where he/she has gone from being let go from a reputable profession (unsure what the reason was) three years ago to  working odd jobs within the food and service industry for the last couple years. He/she seems to have these grandiose plans each year which don't materialize because it's too far from what he/she can achieve. His/her personality has changed drastically from who he/she used to be. So has his/her behaviour and body language. He/she has lost a lot of weight but looks quite fit. He/she's extremely formal in his/her conversations (we've known each other for more than a decade) although we've reconnected in the last couple years after almost no contact in the previous 6 years  this shift in behaviour and mannerisms is too drastic for me to accept. A few mutual friends of ours have noticed it as well and have tried to advice but to no avail. He/she is too indenial of the situation that he/she becomes very defensive and too proud to ask for help. Once again became aware of another outlandish idea and he/she is relocating as we speak. Our friends agree he/she needs to go to counselling but I don't know how to approach. I'm avoiding revealing anything too much for obvious reasons.
7,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I always seemed to be the happy kid growing up but as the years went on it just become a task to be that person again. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything and never even spoke to a professional. My mental health issues started when I was a junior in high school but is at its worst right now (soph in college). I’m in my own head 24/7. I can’t stop thinking about all the problems in my life, I get anger mood swings in an instant, then I’ll feel really happy out of nowhere but then a go back to feeling depressed again. 


Most of the time I worry about the most stupidest shit. I think about all the conversations I’ve had with friends and the things that I may have said that was stupid or insulting and I’ll stress over that for hours even days. I can’t bring my self to do my school work even though I know I’ll fail. Things recently started to feel “fake” in a sense, almost like my life isn’t even real. I pretend that I’m some happy go lucky person but it really is just fake. I’m afraid to tell anyone because I’m scared of how they will view me. I really don’t know what to do anymore"
8,"I can't tell if I want to be depressed/anxious, or if I'm actually depressed/anxious.","I know it sounds strange, but lately I've been trying to find excuses to be depressed/anxious. Something a little bit bad will happen to me, and I'll blow it out of proportion in my brain. I'm pretty sure I actually do have anxiety, and that I actually am depressed, but what if I'm not? What if I just want attention? I sometimes purposefully do things or think of things that will make me sad, and I don't understand why. And if I have a good day, I'll get angry at myself, thinking, ""No, you're supposed to be sad, you can't be happy."" It's like I don't even want happiness anymore, and I can't understand why. But, I can't tell if I truly am happy and just making myself believe that my mental health is bad, or if my mental health is *actually* bad. I need help, I don't know what's happening to me, and why I almost *like* being depressed. I don't get it. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?"
9,I feel enraged every time I see a dog.,"Even just the mention of a dog can put me close to a panic attack. 

I've become hyper-fixated on owning a dog. My parents refused to let me have one as a child and it lead to extremely negative feelings. I started to resent anyone who had a dog because in my own mind I deserved one more, could train and care for them better. When I found my girlfriend she was also interested in us having a dog together. A year into us dating she got into an accident with one. Now she (understandably) doesn't want anything to do with them. She's admitted to me that she's not comfortable in owning a dog after that or living with one. I have an extreme fear that I'm going to live my entire life without ever being able to have a pet dog. Every time I so much as see someone in a group chat post a picture of one it makes me feel genuine rage."
10,My deadline it's tomorrow and I have done barely nothing.,"I have to turn in my master thesis manuscript tomorrow and it should be mostly a clean copy plus a review on the discussion. But yesterday and today half of my ""work day"" was sitting anxiously in front of the computer.
Also bf doesn't get that he is asking for something I can't give. 
I say ""I'm hurt bc, yeah, I don't know your classes names but that doesn't mean I don't love you, just that I do it in a different way""
And the answer is ""but I could answer that, I thought you could do it to. Sometimes it feels like you just care about you. Oh, but yeah, you did spend a week visiting me when I was in the hospital"""
11,How to suck it up? &amp; Which is better Meds vs Therapy for laziness?,"Idk where to post this...all over the place. I could really use some help.

First stupid question…

\-Are there any pills that will force you to be a functioning adult? Like force you to have the motivation to get a job, stay in college, and socialize with people?

I'm 21. Unemployed, living at home, and dropped out of college (before the pandemic happened). I don't want to do anything. I don't want anything in life (other than temporary things that may or may not give me happiness). I don't want to get better or improve myself. But if I don't get better my family (mostly aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc...my mother is supportive and doesn't care what I do...I feel guilty) will still be disappointed and ask about school. And if I don't get better I can't move away and have my own space. Also I fell guilty relying on others...especially my mom. So I'd like to rely on no one other than myself. And obviously to do that I'd need to work, go to school, and get my own place. And of course to do those things I'd have to socialize and be productive. So I need something to get me to suck it up because I don't want to suck it up. I go from feeling irritated, angry, and sad to tired and empty. I just want to be alone. But I can't have that the longer I'm lazy and avoidant of people. In order to be on my own I'd have to change...or suck it up.

More stupid questions…

\-Which will help more? Medication or therapy when you're lazy to change?

I have the means for medication and therapy. I just don't know which would help better since I'm lazy, unmotivated and I procrastinate on self improvement and just getting better in general. I really don't want to change. I just want to be alone but that's not an option because I'm reliant on others. So I just need something to help me go on until I'm on my own.

\-Also, are there any jobs or careers with minimum to no socializing with others?

Online is fine but video chats or calls are definitely a no. I was a receptionist once and I felt panicky everyday. My dream (I guess I do want something) if I somehow manage to keep going on this earth is to avoid people 100 percent. Maybe not my mother but everyone else. I'd like to live far away from people in a secluded house far away somehow working from home with decent pay to keep my house running. I know that's pointless in this day and age and very fantasy like thinking but I just don't want to deal with people anymore.

I have bad social anxiety. I've been in and out therapy since high school and I'm getting less tolerant of people. Because when I'm around people I'm reminded how much people can hurt you or make you anxious. So I just want to avoid them. Seriously if I could have my way I'd just avoid people and cut them off 100%. But that's not a very realistic mindset to have :( . I'm way less anxious talking to people online so that's why I'm reaching out for help this way. I'm still looking into therapy. Idk just trying to see if medication or therapy would help better. I know I repeated myself a lot of times. Thanks for reading this mess. If you could answer any of my questions I'd really appreciate it. Also if you know of a better place to post this, please let me know. Also I can remove my post if it offends any guidelines.."
12,I feel like I’m drowning,"I’m in bed balling. I feel like I’m failing, I’m drowning, I’m a loser and I’m ugly. I feel stuck. 

But I have a career. I have an apartment. I’m loved by my sisters, my nephew and boyfriend. I don’t have relationship issues but I feel like I’m so alone. I feel like I can’t breathe. 

Idk what’s bothering me to make me feel this way and cry."
13,Having a panic attack,"i’ve been dissociating for a while and now i’m having a panic attack, don’t know if this is good or not but i would really appreciate support/tips on what to do. sorry if i don’t reply my mind is all over the place lol."
14,Took Some Big Steps Today,"I’m still very new to Reddit and this is my first time ever posting but today was a really big day for me and I just wanted to share it with others. 

I’ve struggled with depression &amp; anxiety for the past 10 years. It’s completely consumed my life but I’ve been too scared and ashamed to ask for help. 

This week I finally said enough is enough. I’m so tired of my depression and anxiety controlling my life and I finally summoned the courage to ask for help. 

I met with my doctor today who was extremely supportive. I have an appointment next week to start therapy. This whole week has been really overwhelming and scary but I’m also really proud of myself for finally asking for help. I know I may still have a long road to go down but at least I’m finally taking the first steps."
15,Mental Health Resources,"Hello,
I’m working for a non profit that is working to make a centralized website of as many resources as possible that could benefit those struggling with mental illness, stress, trauma, or just the burdens on life. Please comment your favorite resources whether it be meditation apps, hotlines/textlines, motivational videos, other websites, etc. Anything is appreciated so feel free to speak up!!!!"
16,Am I selfish if I want others to live despite their pain when I want to die?,"This year has been a hell. My mental health deteriorates and I more hopeless every day. The thing is, I'm selfish if I want to die but I want the others to live despite their pain because I know they can make it? I always imagine them living their lives and overcoming  every problem they have and being happy. I want to be happy but I can't imagine me like I imagine them."
17,"This is difficult, but I really want to overcome this."," I was verbally abused as a kid for a long time and I find it hard to believe that there's any love in the world. I can't imagine people actually meaning it when they say something nice. I find it hard to believe people aren't constantly thinking critical things about me and other people. I just have a hard time believing I'm not automatically hated by everyone. I want to get past this but this is all I've ever known and this is really hard. Growing up, I heard a lot of things that made me feel hated, and a bad person.

I genuinely get really upset when someone asks me to go out or whatever and I think that they're lying and I get really angry. Its like when a bully sets you up, and then says something really mean, but I expect it from everyone."
18,I never feel happy but I don’t feel sad.,"Could this be depression?

I just don’t seem to feel anything and I haven’t for really long time. 

For example, I’m pretty sure most people would be thrilled that their friends planned a surprise party for them. They’d probably be really happy or excited. But I know for certain that if people did that for me I wouldn’t feel anything. Not happiness. Not sadness. Nothing. 

Of course I would pretend to be happy, I wouldn’t want people to think I didn’t appreciate the surprise. I definitely would. I just wouldn’t *feel* anything. You know?


I just don’t seem to feel anything. I see people get happy over the smallest of gifts and I don’t understand it. Or some of my friends will say that they had fun at the park and everyone will agree. But while I was there I didn’t have any fun at all. It wasn’t *boring*, I just didn’t really feel anything. I only pretended to.

This seems to happen in almost every situation in my life. By all means I SHOULD be having fun, or at least be happy. But I’m not. I’m not sad either. Just empty. And lonely. And I don’t know why.

This isn’t some “oh man I’m an edgy loner who doesn’t feel any emotions” kind of post. I’m just wondering if this is like some kind of depression or something. I’ve never really paid much attention to it but I’ve always noticed people seem so happy. And I decided that I want to be happy too. But I don’t know how to do that."
19,Scared of sleeping helppp,Hiii so I had a nightmare i know it’s stupid what an idiot not wanting to go to sleep cuz they had a stupid nightmare but I’ve had this nightmare a few weeks ago and another few weeks ago and another few weeks ago i know I sound so stupid but it was so scary I dreamt I said something that angered the devil inside of me and I felt someone holding my head tight and my leg and I couldn’t move and when I woke up the door was wide open something was in here I tried thinking of what could’ve opened the door but it’s nothing something was in here i hate this sm plssssss help i know I’m so stupid right now but im so scared I’m slowly going crazy and slowly losing myself it’s 3 am I have school at 6 I just want to sleep but I can’t today’s gonna be awful i need this to stop before it gets worse help me pls I’m lost and scared and lonely and tired and weak
20,I do not have problems with myself. It is everything around me.,"Life is SO different than what I thought it would be one year ago today. One year ago, I was a bright senior with good grades and playing many sports. I had a good circle of friends. I was applying to college. I was getting stood up on dates (but my buddies were there for me). Life was endless.

Fast forward through 3 months of winter, and I got deferred from my absolute dream college. I had back ups, but this college was the one. Continue through another 2 months of gruelling AP Lit, and my dream came true. My future became that of a modern fairytale. I got into my dream college. I was enjoying senior year through sports, classes, and quality time with my friends. Life was still endless (WWIII threats and natural disasters aside).

The day after I got into my dream college was the beginning of quarantine. Life stopped. My senior year was thrown in the garbage can. Graduation would be many months later, and prom was erased from the calendar. Well, maybe it will all be over by my first day at college, right?

Here I am sitting at home doing math homework on a Wednesday night. I know nobody at my college. I have been hiding from the world in fear of the infamous virus. I felt like my mental and social health were decimated, but then something happened.

I had to attend a wedding. I had to see the most beautiful act of love a person could ever see. It was amazing. Everything was amazing. Everybody had been virus-conscious leading up to the wedding, so we could all relax. For the first time in 7 months, I could lower the wall. I could talk to people, to friends. Life emerged from the embers that remained from the past, and it ignited for one weekend. Everything was normal.

Now, that fire has not only gone out but also left me feeling colder than ever. I am back in my basement studying math. As I listen to music, I hear the sweetest chimes, and my mind breaks down. I do not think of anything except the beautiful love at the wedding and the sense of normalness that I experienced. Any sweet, slow music tears me apart because I just want the future that I imagined a year ago today. I want to be surrounded by the love of everybody I know or would have met at college. I want to meet someone to love at college. I want to know my professors and go to events. I want to be with friends and to talk about sports, video games, and any other topic with my friends instead if the stale conversation about COVID-19 and doing college at home over video chat.

Surely somebody else feels the same as me. There is no way I am alone."
21,I hate life so much,"I hate life right now. I'm starting to see/hear things that aren't there. For example, I see distorted people, like something you either see from a horror film or a creepy pasta. The auditory hallucinations say things like, ""She's walking over to him."" ""Don't eat that, it'll make you a fat cow."" and other things I'd rather not list because it might be somewhat triggering. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so empty and lost of self identity, it scares me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to tell my parents about the voices, and they said ""Everyone hears things. It's called a conscience."" But, it's not even mine and I hear 3, not 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about dying so many times, but somehow something stops me from doing it."
22,What does this mean,I know how to do my schoolwork and it’s sitting right in front of me. I want to get it done and this sounds crazy but my mind gets so overwhelmed and I almost cry whenever I look at it. I’ve missed so many assignments because I just can’t do them and I don’t care for them. My parents only show affection towards my brother and I feel like there’s nothing left to lose by skipping these assignments. Someone told me this was adhd but I don’t know and I know this isn’t normal
23,"I can't bring myself to talk to my friends, so I'm infodumping on y'all","This year has been hell for all of us, but I have to try to get the last three months sorted out. I'm losing my mind and myself this last week, but I can't afford therapy right now and as much as I need to talk, I feel like I can't keep bugging my friends about this.

For clarity's sake I'm not going to touch on the obvious points of the year. So, back in the summer I had a really bad mental health episode. On July 22nd after a fight with my sister, I bought her donuts and then left to go hurt myself. My intent was to never go back home, but I had the chance to get some space and reconsider before it was too late. I bottled it up while I was trying to find a therapist, until she confronted me and I blurted it out. It's a touchy subject for her, so trying to hide it while trying to get help and deal with the pain was a rough start to things.

Fast forward to September. I had found a therapist and was starting to make a little progress, dealing with a lot of issues and trying to sort them to make it easier on me. Well, I get a phone call at work that my mom had been in a minor accident, but had hit her head hard enough to get a brain bleed. Two days later I'm on leave because I had to be tested for the virus.

During the week and a half it took to get my results, I was dealing with trying to get accurate info about my mom from two time zones away. It wasn't good, or easy, and I struggled with the updates. First it was that we'd be lucky if she made it, then it was we're lucky she wasn't a vegetable, then it was that she was highly uncooperative with medical staff, then it was that she left against medical advice as soon as she wasn't in the ICU anymore.

Then two days later she falls and has a stroke. I get told at that time that she also had a heart attack the day of the wreck. Every phone call I get is more medical bad news, and I'm going crazy as I'm unsure of what the hell is going on. Finally after getting the negative test results, I book a flight to come take care of her- her roommate had to leave for a month for her own family emergency, but my mom absolutely cannot be left alone.

So I fly here. I come to my childhood house to take care of my mom. And it feels like a house you come to to die. At least a decade of neglect, and seeing my mom unable to even walk around her house without a walker. I wanted to break down, but to my own amazement I have not.

I'm here for her. I'm here checking her blood sugar every 3 hours, planning and preparing her meals, administering medications because she didn't have the dexterity in her hands to do any of it herself. Cleaning up everything, fixing everything so that she can use it safely, helping her understand her paperwork, helping her get legal documents and aid in place. Trying my damnedest to make this as easy as possible on her, with so much going wrong.

She no longer has a job. She doesn't remember things that I tell her half the time. But she's not the human vegetable her friend has treated her like. She can still do some of it on her own, and is improving a little each day. I'm beyond grateful for every improvement I see in her. Especially after the day she told me that she wished the brain bleed had killed her, instead of making life hard for us all. It took a lot for me to hold it together and try to keep being strong at that.

But I'm breaking. This place is full of a lot of memories of where my issues come from. There's no cell signal out here, and I don't want her to overhear the things I want to vent about by me using the landline (indoors only) I have no space just for myself, and even if I did I couldn't close the door (showers excluded) because if she has blood sugar issues in the night she comes to me to check the numbers and help her make good decisions. I haven't heard my friends voices in so long, haven't been able to sleep properly during this whole thing because I don't feel comfortable here.

I'm surviving on a whole pot of coffee to myself every morning, and pure determination to not let my mom live in filth and depression. But as much as I try to be strong, I need a break. I don't know when her roommate is coming back for sure, because she caught the virus. And I just really, really need my own help.

But I can't get it here. This place is where my mental health issues started, where I tried to end my life as a toddler. This place sucks the will to live out of me. I'm trying hard to fight it. And having my friends messaging me helps. But I can feel old issues creeping back, dragging me down, telling me that my friends have enough on their plate without me talking about this. I know logically that they love me and want to help me, but the toll this place is taking on my mind is staggering.

I don't know. I'm terrified. I'm out here without pay for at least a total of six weeks by the end of this. My mom gave me a bit of money to help me, but it's not enough to get therapy and pay my bills. And I just... I don't know what to do.

I want to go home. I want to hug my sister and our roommate and the stupid cats. I want to be in my own room, in my own bed, and have the option of hiding away from everyone to recharge. I want to feel normal again, and not have someone's literal life depending on me 24/7 in such a medically charged way. I feel selfish for it, but I'm being honest with myself more than anything.

I don't know what to do. But if there's anyone who read all of this, thank you for listening. I'm still lost in the chaos, but I couldn't keep holding it all in."
24,What is this?,"sometimes when something happens it sets me off the wrong way and at night when i go to bed i just start thinking alot, and then i just start crying and crying thinking about suicide, hopeless things, relapsing in SH, just bad stuff. And when I do this I also kinda just curl up in a ball and hate myself and life for hours until i exhaust myself out. I don’t know what this is exactly, i don’t think it is a mental breakdown, so like what is the name for it."
25,Starting Zoloft and have been EXHAUSTED,"I have recently started taking 50mg of sertraline/zoloft, working my way up, and since starting I am just always exhausted and can't stop sleeping and crawling back into bed throughout the day."
26,It has a nice ending at least :),
27,Will it get better?,"Don't know where else to put this.

My childhood wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best, and I started having mental health issues in middle school. I went through ups and downs in high school, but after high school my mental health got suddenly much worse. I'm almost 19 now. I feel like in some ways, I'm getting better, but in other ways, I'm not.

I think I'm overall getting better because I'm older and smarter, and I know how to make good choices and how to cope. But I'm still so confused. I've noticed that I cling onto this vision of an idealized future, one where I have things ""all figured out"" or at least, one where I understand myself better and have found a happier life. I write a lot of letters for my future self to read, because I really want to meet her and ask her for advice. But sometimes I doubt that things get better with age.

I feel like all the adults in my life are messed up in some way. Like, my parents, for example, they're both flawed and struggling in their lives. Sure, they're doing well in taking care of me and my sibling and they're making career achievements, but they're still... struggling with these issues, mostly related to mental health and their relationship.

 I know things can never be perfect. But to me, it seems like a lot of the adults I know aren't necessarily wiser. It seems to me like the older you get, the more time you have to wrap yourself into your cognitive distortions and look for ways to confirm your flawed worldview. And in a lot of ways, that just makes your life worse.

I hope for myself that my mental health issues are just mainly caused by hormones, mood swings, and the normal stuff teenagers go through. I get that I probably have other issues that I need to work through, but I *feel* like I'm getting better and maybe even wiser. But I'm uncertain. What if my 25 year old self is doing much worse than I am now? What will I be like at 35? 45? Will I even live that long? I have no idea. 

I hear the typical onset for disorders like bipolar and schizophrenia is early 20s to 30s, at least for women. I'm worried that I could end up developing one of these serious conditions. I had a semi-distant relative with schizophrenia, so I have a slightly greater risk of developing that. 

I know being a teenager/young adult sucks, but does it get better from here on out, or worse? Should I keep holding onto the hope that I'll feel better in the future? I just want to know if this is actually true. I know some of the people reading this post are 25 or older, do people in that age group feel that their mental health has improved in the last 5 years or so? There's really a lot that I'm wondering about, and I just don't want to feel like I'm lying to myself when I tell myself that ""It gets better""."
28,New identity,"I seriously don't know who I am anymore, and this is no exaggeration. 

The people who I used to be fond of I see as enemies. I feel like I can't trust anyone, I dislike everyone and I have no desire for anything really. I also feel like I've somewhat become 'asexual' sex makes me feel uneasy and disgusted. Relationships and intimacy seems to trivial and pointless to me. I have to put on a mask whenever I'm with my boyfriend or around my family. My mind is so dark, like my own personal hell - but I don't really mind it. 

All of this I'm okay with, but how am I supposed to keep up with relationships when I can't offer people what they expected from the old me? This has been a gradual process and I am well aware of my transition, but others aren't. Whenever someone gets close to me it makes me feel uncomfortable, I feel aggression and irritation. 

Even when I see old videos of me, I don't recognise that person as me. I'm still being treated as though that old version of me still exists and I just want to dismiss those who are mistaken. It angers me."

I think it’s because Im waiting to hear back from an audiologist about treatment for my misophonia and hyperacusis... 

Also, lately (past month and a half) I’ve been feeling like a fraud. I have some negative self talk that says “you don’t really have ADHD or hypersensitivity/ difficulty with sounds, you’re fine” 

Anxiety and depression have been pretty consistent :/"
32,Does this sound like Bipolar?,"I don’t want to come across as that type of person that is self diagnosing because that’s the opposite of what i’m trying to do, anyway i’ve been diagnosed by a professional with Ocd, anxiety and depression, i’m not on medication anymore i used to be on prozac but that didn’t help me. i’m feeling super unstable and haven’t been to a doctor also i’m pretty bad at explain my feelings in real life and don’t want to get misdiagnosed. I find it hard to concentrate and i go into these “episodes” you could call it, where i just don’t think straight. i kind of feel like my mind is being controlled, and i do hear voices at times. I see things all the time and feel weird things like a presence or like i’m being watched, i always think someone is out to get me, i always sleep with knifes near me to feel safe. i have vivid dreams too. Now for my emotions, they’re all over the place, i can get angry very often and scream a lot. i’ve been trying to stop but i feel a sense of distress and helplessness if i don’t, i know this sounds pathetic and like i’m a toddler throwing a fit but it’s honestly been like this for so long my family parents neighbours are all used to it i’m just kinda afraid of when i have to meet knew people and go out into the real world i’m only 16 rn... As to why i think i have bipolar, i can go from thinking i’m the best person to ever be alive and my confidence can be so high to feeling low (most of the time) and useless, ugly, and hate everything about myself. it’s really stressful. any advice or thoughts/questions would be appreciated a lot."
33,Can’t take it much more,"I don’t have much motivation for writing this but here I am. I’ve been dealing with ocd my whole life, but freshman year of high school for some reason I started to develop pure-o ocd. During my freshman year I started having all kinds of thoughts that were just weird and irrational and I still do. I have been dealing with these thoughts and specifically hocd thoughts every day, every hour, since October 2016. It has completely drained me over time of enjoyment from things and I’m at a point where I can’t handle it much longer. I have been to two ocd specialist, both which were good but I never really improved as much as I wanted to. I sort of hit a point with therapy where it didn’t do anything anymore. I did CBT with ERP therapy specifically. I am now not doing therapy anymore. I also quit my anti depressants which was actually a good thing. They helped for a little sort of but they have way too many side effects for me. I try to manage my thoughts constantly by not engaging in compulsive behavior but it doesn’t help anymore. I’ve basically given up on it. I really don’t give a fuck anymore. The thing is though I just started college and it’s been nothing but a wreck with my ocd. OCD is just pulling me down more every day and now what I’m doing in life really matters. I still have friends and I hang out with them but even that has become a battle. I try to stay somewhat busy but it’s just not working. I want to be successful in life. I have always been very ambitious and I want to pursue my passion and have a future but I don’t see it anymore. I’m at a point where I am done and if my time comes where things get too bad, that will be the end of it all. If you have anything you think could help me, please tell me."
34,Borderline personality disorder,"So I recently had my first psychiatrist visit. He diagnosed me with anxiety and PTSD on the first day. I skipped my next appointments and now I’m finally going back. I was frustrated because it’s hard to explain what’s going on inside my brain when I don’t even understand it myself. 

I really believe I have borderline personality disorder. It’s hard to describe how I feel and what I deal with but when researching the illness I feel like it takes the words right out of my mouth. I want to mention this to my doctor during the visit tomorrow, but I also feel like if I bring it up and he says I have it, then I won’t believe it and I’ll feel like “what if I’m just making it up and manipulating people and not knowing it”. But I also want to mention it because it’s just exactly how I feel, every symptom and everything Ive read about, it takes the words right out of my mouth. I don’t want to self diagnose. Should I mention it or keep it to myself?"
35,Struggling,I’ve been having health problems that make me extremely tired and I’ve already been diagnosed but it’s been really difficult for me to do school work. I tried talking to my dad about it but he basically told me to suck it up and do my school work anyways and I don’t even wanna try talking to my mom about it. I really would’ve expected my dad to understand because he has the same health problems and had to sleep all the time when he wasn’t at work but that’s not an option for me. My grades are really slipping and it’s making me anxious because I think my parents will get really mad at me about it. I just honestly don’t know what to do at this point. Please help me figure out what to do
36,does this count has masochism,"i have not showered in the past 2 months i brush my teeth like once or twice a week, i either starve myself or eat a lot just to feel the guilt afterwards. i put myself in scenarios with the result of extreme humiliation just to feel like a failure. i don’t know why i do this, sometimes i feel like i’m trapped in my head. is it just masochism or something else, maybe just my depression? i’m 16, Female"
37,Seasonal affective disorder,"Hi, I’m new here. I already struggle with borderline personality disorder, depression, difficultly sleeping &amp; type 2 bipolar. 

I’ve been doing really well most of this year even with covid but now I can’t stop crying some days. I’ve had terrible episodes. I can’t get myself to work out. I’ve been eating more and as someone who obsesses over weight, this has been really hard for me. 

Does anyone else suffer from SAD? Does light therapy work? Do you write? Workout? What can I do to feel better?

Thank you"
38,I need help,"Life isn't going the best for me, my partner is getting fed up with me for good reason, they try to help me but I am to difficult, I'm starting to fail school and I'm not doing my work because I don't feel motivated to, I would try to get help irl but my family won't believe me or do anything no matter how hard is tell them I'm not in a good spot. And personal parts like r**e for example and almost killing myself have made me weak"
39,Not sure if I’m suffering from something other than anxiety,"I was diagnosed with GAD at 18. I had constant thoughts of impending doom, thinking I was going to crash and die if I took certain roads or didn’t see certain numbers or didn’t do things by certain times. I also had obsessions with certain things, like have a strict routine I couldn’t stray away from. And certain clothes I had to wear. When I realized my thoughts weren’t normal, I assumed it was OCD or borderline personality disorder. When I told my doctor, she had me test for GAD and I was diagnosed. But I never really opened up completely, and years later I’ve noticed I have very scary angry moments and act very quickly when angered or wronged without thinking. I have sought out to even ruin certain aspects of people’s lives when wronged by them. I’ve also been having thoughts of harming others and myself. And the thoughts are reoccurring. I’ve tried to look up what it could be, but nothing really points me in a direction. Any opinions?"
40,Every time someone gives me a compliment I tell myself the opposite,"If someone says “good job” my instant thought is “eh, it was mediocre; that’s all you are”. It could be the smallest and most innocent thing. Someone could say “nice throw” and my first thought is “so what you think you Aaron Rogers bitch? You ain’t shit, just remember that”"

42,I think I’m struggling with mental illness. Can anyone explain this?,"I’m a 22 year old female. Over the last six months, my anxiety has been THROUGH THE ROOF. 

However, I get most stressed and anxious over small, unimportant things. Example: What I should wear tomorrow, or where I put my passport (when I have no plans to travel), or whether or not I closed a jar in the kitchen (even when I’m almost sure I did) 

When I say “stress”, I mean I’m having full on panic attacks (pacing my room, nervous habits, crying) 

These worrisome thoughts keep me up at night, and when I’m stressing over them, I physically can’t distract myself. Suddenly I don’t want to move, eat, or do anything until I resolve these worries. 

The other day I tried to make a reservation at a restaurant and they were closed. I cried hysterically and felt like I wasn’t in control of my emotions. Normally this wouldn’t bother me nearly this much.

I feel paranoid, like I have to worry about every little thing, and like I need to check to make sure I completed every task. It’s almost like I don’t trust myself.

Can anyone offer me some type of assurance or possible prediction as to what I’m struggling with? I am trying to see a therapist but I’m having a hard time finding someone who is seeing new patients.

Please. I’m desperate. Every day i feel like it’s getting worse. Any help is appreciated"
43,Any advice please,This may not be the normal post for this but here we go. I have anxiety and mild depression and unfortunately one of the casualties of this trash year has been my long term relationship of three years. TLDR I loved this person and still do but was coming to terms over the past few months of never seeing them again etc. I randomly met another person and we live in different towns but still see/talk fairly regularly although both of us have said we need time before we jump into anything. Well recently my ex has come back in saying they’ve made a mistake which I understand because of the year and that I’ve known them since high school so I get them on a deep level. I’m in a tough spot my anxiety is spiking and I’ve been more depressed than ever because I want that back but I don’t know if it or anything is the right choice. The past few days have been dark and I’ve talked with close friends but I have no ideas on how to think or work through this. Anything would help
44,At what point did you recognize your suicidal thoughts were more than just ideations and got scared?,I’ve been really dealing with it and caught myself drafting a note to leave for my parents if I decided to do it. I’m so scared. I would really love to connect with someone who’s been in my shoes. Just things keep feeling worse and worse and I don’t know when they won’t. It hasn’t been this bad before.

46,Strange bouts of anxiety following kinda-almost bear death experiences?,"Good evening all, 

I know, I’m sorry it’s late but now this is on my mind and I cannot sleep. Basically, to cut to the chase I have been experiencing anxiety like I never had before, pertaining to two small events that happened to me this summer. 

First off, I took my first tumble on my motorcycle. Nothing serious, 35 mph slide and a broken ankle. Since then, I just have a pretty big lack of confidence on the bike and I am constantly having dreams of it happening in different various ways and it’s actually effecting my sleep. I absolutely love my bike and I love riding it, however I will say that I haven’t spent almost anytime on it since.

Secondly, I kinda almost drowned, but not really. I was out on a boat in the ocean, in the channel. I had never been in a channel of moving water before and basically something happened that had prompted me to jump in the water. I am athletic mid twenties man, and I’ve never really been the best swimmer but I’ve always been able to handle myself. Quickly I learned that not only was the boat anchored and I was not, meaning I was floating away very fast, I also was experiencing a heat stroke from exertion and dehydration from being horribly hungover. I never in that moment thought I’d die or anything, my friends were all there, all in the boat and all strong swimmers and they had life jackets and everything. I even was able to bounce on the bottom a bit to get some air. However, once again, I’m constantly seeing this in my dreams. What actually prompted me to write this is that I finished watching a show on Netflix, the haunting of Bly Manor, and it has a lot of scenes of people being plunged under water. My heart was racing during those scenes, and my body was physically feeling like I did when I was actually in the water, like I could feel my throat kind of closing and it was like I had to really make an effort to take breathes. It was actually an interesting anomaly and I have no idea why I reacted like that but it was not enjoyable to say the least.

Either way, the thing about these experiences is that, well I was never in any real danger. But in my head I think of everything else that could go wrong. The day before I fell off my motorcycle I rode a friends sport bike and was over confident and took it to 140 mph. Stupid I know but I did it. What if I fell then? 

Like I mentioned, while I was in the water, I found a couple of areas while I was floating that were only 7 feet deep or so that I could hop up and down on to gasp for air. What if that wasn’t there? What if it happened to be deeper or the water faster, or if the boat didn’t start? These thoughts flood my mind, and I feel like these two events kind of made me realize that I’m not invincible, and maybe that’s part of a man growing up, but now I feel like maybe these symptoms aren’t normal? I’m just trying to get some sleep, I want to be able to ride my motorcycle again without fear, and I won’t go in water anymore and I sure would like to. I’m just worried that on my bike or in the water, I’ll have a panic attack and actually have a serious problem. How long will this take to go away and what can I do about it?

Thanks."
47,"Anyone else get paranoid, lose social skills, and drive people away when they're tired?","I've been pretty much alone the past year, living somewhere with no friends, and I just drove a girl I know away online because I was showing to much support for her illness and acted slightly weird. She goes offline everytime I message her to say hi now. Doesn't feel good."
48,My voice sounds really bad and it has caused me to lose all motivation," 

I hate online classes right now, a lot of my test require me to speak.

Personally, i think that shallow learning is caused by unprofessional creativity, since most of my teachers try being creative with their test, but instead make it worst.

I'm a beginner writer, started writing 3 months ago, and my voice is writing sounds much better than my actual voice, recorded or not.

It's such a small thing, yet i grew depressed over it.

I got a low score, a failing grade, in one of my english test after the teacher told us to say what we wrote about our country, i wrote it, but my voice ruined it.

I didn't sound happy, my voice had no life, speak higher and stop speaking in a low tone, thats what they said.

But i can't just raise my voice, and i cant speak without my voice suddenly stopping for no reason, it sounds weird but i just cant describe it, and that just makes it worst.

School doesn't even test intelligence anymore, they test things that you are born with, such as drawing or singing, sports or speaking, no longer writing things about life, test which define intelligence, all they do now is tell us useless facts, and make the test about them completely based off your talents rather than what you learned.

I know many might say, its just your voice, but the weight of this situation just keeps making me stressed.

Even if i write a good essay on something, ill just get a low and mostly failing grade cause i didn't put enough life in my voice even when i cant when i try.

It just hurts for me personally."

50,I did a thing. I've just disclosed my depression diagnosis to my Dad. Have yet to come out as gay but this is a huge step already.,"29 years old, depressed for 16 years now. Started treatment 12 days ago.

He took it well and was nice and all... Like he wasn't in every possible way the very reason I have depression in the first place. His cluelessness to it all was kinda disappointing but that's life.

What matters is, I did a thing, it involved my Dad and didn't blow up in my face for once in my life. Maybe someday soon I'll feel safe to tell him all about how I've always known that I'm gay (earliest memory around age 5 or 6) and have always felt unsafe in a violently homophobic family and encompassing environment, how I'm in a relationship with a man for 9 years as of 10 days from now, everything.

Baby steps."
51,Does talking to a psychologist really help your mental health to get better?,"For the past two years i’ve been feeling depressed and i feel like my mental health becomes worse and worse every day. About a couple weeks ago I started getting suicidal thoughts more and more and also having a lot of mental breakdowns.

I started thinking that I might need a psychologist to talk to, because i have no one else who would help me, but I don’t know if it worth it, because therapy is quite expensive and I don’t know if it actually helps.

Looking for some advice.
Thanks."
52,Is there anyway of getting over a fear of eternity?,"2 years ago i had a bad experience with what i thought was weed and i fell to the ground and my mind started hallucinating and hearing a deafening scream while my head was spinning in a weird circular motion it felt like it lasted forever i couldn’t move at all but my mind was conscious and i remember thinking when is this going to end quickly followed by the dread that it was never going to end and i was stuck in this eternal loop of nothing forever. I briefly broke free but at that point i was already far gone and not sane, i saw my friends leg as i was on the ground and it seemed like i had ripped it open because the next thing i see is blood gushing everywhere. Turns out it was just a hallucination because when i woke up there were only a few scars. 

I’ve smoked countless times after that and never had anything like that happen again but that day still haunts me to this day and it’s always in the back of my mind that when i die i’m going to be in that state of mind, the mental torutre that lasts forver. Im not religious but i feel satanic and spiritual energies around me all the time. I just feel like im destined for doom. i know that sounds dramatic. I don’t know how to cope with this is there any way of getting over this fear? or is what i’m feeling true. honest answers Pm or comment your thoughts"
53,"I (guy, 13) told my dad about how I've been abused for the past 2 years","So one thing I wanna say, I actually posted a bit about this on an alt account a few days ago ( /u/HwaypointH ). I actually owe quite a bit to the few who decided to take the time to read and comment, because you were the reasons I even spoke to my dad.

I'm feelin a little bad for the guy who was doing these things to me, but my dad reassured me it wasn't my fault, still though. I'm happy though, I can finally move on and not be worried about all this stuff. Short and a little disorganized I know, but I just wanted to tell somebody. 

My advice to people who are going through any form of abuse: it will be okay. Just prepare yourself a bit and let it out a little to somebody you really trust, and they'll help you. Just don't wait till it's too late, you do stupid stuff then, and believe me, it's not worth it. Just take care of yourself out there.

54,intrusive thoughts? ocd?,ok i don’t know if this is the right sub for a question like this but this is for anyone who could know what’s wrong with me. basically i have intrusive thoughts (idk what else to call them) where like when i’m driving i’ll like see in my head me crashing into the car in front of me or like when i’m going down a staircase i’ll see in my head me falling down the stairs or when i’m walking i’ll picture myself tripping. (the things i picture never actually happen and they don’t make me want them to happen/ act on them btw) and these thoughts kind of just come into my head when i’m doing something and they will cause me to tic almost? like it causes me to jerk my head or move my arm and then after that they usually just go away. idk if this is tourette’s or ocd or what. i really don’t know if anyone will be able to help me with this but if any one can relate or has any idea what it is please comment
55,Flashbacks,I've been having flashbacks to the psych ward that I was admitted to 3 years ago. Anyone else have a story like this?
56,I don't like competition.,"Personally, I don't like competition. Since I was born, I feel like I've been forced to compete with people for every single thing, weather it be in school, daily interactions, extra-curriculars, jobs, or anything else. I understand that it is necessary, but I just can't get out of this feeling like I am always under-performing compared to everyone else. Does anyone else have similar sentiments?"
57,How can I help a friend,"My online friend and I had a little bit of a falling out about a month and half at and have just recently started chatting again. I know they had a problem with depression, but yesterday they told me they feel numb. And I didnt know how to respond. I hate it, I feel like I'm letting them down. I want to be able to support them and help but i just don't know how to do that online. 
I don't know if this is the right sub. But is there any suggestion as to what I can do to make sure that they know im there for them and maybe even help them through?"
58,Is this life?,"I’m in my 30’s. Spent most of my 20’s doing something I loved. Then had to move on due to needing more money and insurance and all that adult stuff lol. 

Started working for a company 8 years ago. Moved around in the company some but have found my thing here. But lately things have gotten a lot more stressful at work. We got a new piece of equipment that was a test for our location before rolling it out to other locations. Long story short it’s not working too well. I have been tasked to run this equipment and I got a lot of eyes on me. I’m doing my best but feel I have been set up to fail. My mental health has tanked. I pretty work then come home and sleep then do it all over again. 

Is this life? Is this how we are meant to live? Just work work work and wait to die? I always had such visions of an incredible life but they have all gone away. I have asked others this question and they pretty much say yes. This is life. 

I’m so sad if this is how life truest is. I wanted to travel or experience everything out there. But now all I do is work. Please... someone tell me this isn’t all there is."
59,Getting past recent trauma,"I feel like I have to give background to this so.. here it is: My father has been emotionally abusive and manipulative since I could remember. I truly realized it when I was 11 years old, 7 years ago. My mother and father got divorced and he got worse and I didn’t realize how bad it was for a while. He’s steadily been getting worse towards me but it hit a breaking point.

He got in my face, screamed at me about politics of all things. He pulled a gun, and held it up to his head, screaming all the while. He wouldn’t actually do it, he does it to manipulate me and he’s tried the same thing but never actually pulling a gun. I feared for my life but I got out, I’m alive. I confided in my mother and she called the police, which both of us knew wouldn’t do anything but distract him. 
The police came and questioned me beside him, one of the three saying over and over again that it was just a joke. It was the most anxiety-filled evening I’ve ever had and I left to live with my mother that night. It’s been a day now, just over 24 hours. I had to get some of my things from his house, his neighbor reported us being there to him and he called the police for a robbery in progress, though we didn’t know until after we left. 
He’s now been trying to make us more anxious, and I’ve shut out a lot of the other text messages from my head. But I now live in an apartment with my sister and mother, had to give up my ball python because I can’t get him out on such short notice. My sister is terrible towards me, she always goes on about how she’s not allowed to have friends over and how I don’t belong here. My mother has finally tried to stop her entitled behavior but she’s upset now and I can’t mention how stressed it’s making me without her getting upset. It’s just adding to the stress and I’m struggling to find a way to cope with it. There’s just so much, I have to file a restraining order, find another apartment to get away from here, and try and get my things back. 

I feel like I’m suffocating. I’m a trans male in a very anti-LGBT area so I can’t have friends around here, I’m trying to look at apartments, get my belongings back, file a restraining order, and try to deal with panic attacks and heavy anxiety. This is probably jumbled and nonsensical but I’m still shaken up and struggling to cope."
60,I felt like I couldn’t speak properly after a panic attack which then made me have a second panic attack? Has anyone ever felt this?,"I’ve suffered from a panic and anxiety disorder since I was about 10 years old. I’ve been on Lexapro (woo Lexapro!) for almost ten years. I’ve been pretty under control over these ten years, minus some periods of difficultly here and there but that’s par for the course.

Today I had a panic attack that was pretty severe for the first time in a while. I think it was the result of working all day from home, drinking coffee, not enough water and frankly not enough food.

I decided to take my dog to the dog park around 5 pm. It’s about a 20 minute walk and I was fine the whole time. Once we arrived and she was playing I started to notice some auras in my vision. I have had migraines before that started like this and I immediately go anxious that I was going to get a migraine while here at the park and 20 minute away from home with my 8 month old dog. I tried to ignore it and stay calm but I started to feel more and more trapped in the enclosed dog run around other people and responsible for my dog!

My bf works in a hospital and thankfully he was about to head home. I texted him and told him what was going on that that I felt trapped and that I was trying to hold it together. He said he would take an Uber to me to help me and so we could go home together.

By the time he arrived I had started to calm down. The aura had gone away but I felt tired, drained and out of it. We stayed at the dog park a little longer just so I could relax and come back to earth a bit (and so our dog could actually play a little more).

We eventually left and started walking home. We live in NYC and while walking home I started to feel really removed from my body and surroundings. Everything felt hyper stimulating and aggressive and I was clinging to my bf just to feel some reality. I was talking to him but I felt like I kept stuttering over words or flipping syllables or not saying things correctly. I asked him if I was talking strangely and he said no. He’s a doctor and I know I should trust his judgement but I was convinced I was having some neurological problem. I was even reciting tongue twisters in my head just to see if I could and every time I messed up it just convinced me further that something was wrong.

We got home and I drank some water, and practiced grounding myself (5 things I see, 4 things I can touch, etc.) I had a bit of a headache and just felt drained but we went about our night. I kept asking my bf if I were ok and he literally gave me a neurological screening that they give patients just to prove to me that I was ok. 

Now it’s almost midnight. He’s asleep, so are our pets, and I’m really anxious about tomorrow. I tend to get anticipatory anxiety about things and now I’m so worried that this feeling will happen tomorrow but I’ll be by myself. 

I’m pretty sure I’m just rambling at this point but I haven’t had anything like this in a while and while the logical part of me that understands my mental illness KNOWS it was a panic attack likely brought on by my hyper vigilance with sensations in my body (and like...not hydrating properly and only drinking coffee during the damn day), the irrational part of me thinks something is wrong! It boils down to being like the boy who cried wolf - everyone in my life is so used to it being my anxiety and I’m terrified that one day it won’t be that and I’ll be overlooked.

I’m looking for some commiseration or reassurance or who knows what else!

62,I hung out with my friend and I only felt lonelier,"So this is happening more and more recently, but today in particular I felt it hard. 

I, 21M, hung out with my friend, whom I love and care about deeply, and I felt like I couldn’t connect to them. It has been months since I las saw them, and I was so excited to see them for the first time today, but I felt like we were on two different planets. I felt like we were strangers.

I think this particular interaction was just a fluke, but It brought up the emotions I’ve been feeling. I’ve been feeling lonelier and lonelier.
I get a lot of “love you” and “you’re great” stuff on social media, but Where are the people I can laugh with and share a meaningful conversation and adventure with? I’m holding on to the memories I’ve had with my friends and that’s what’s keeping me going right now.

It’s not like I’m not trying to make new friends, but it’s hard. I made a group chat for my chemistry classmates and they used it to make their own group without me in it. I joined and am helping start up a sociology club in my university, but were small and few people stay long (no funding + people just aren’t interested here). 
I haven’t made any long term friends in my 3 years at university and I tried/ am trying so hard. 


It’s hard. People around me are having a hard time too.  I know I shouldn’t complain, but it hurts yknow?

63,Anxiety,"I’m going insane, my cats have brought fleas into the house and I keep finding them on myself and around the house. Any time I itch, which is all the time, I frantically grab at where ever I find them, I found one in my hair at school today, and picked three off my legs and flushed them down the sink about ten minutes ago. I just need somebody to reassure me that we will get rid of them eventually. Please tell me of any human and cat friendly chemicals to get these little craps off with. PPLLEEAASSEE HHEELLPP!!!!!!"

65,"Memory getting much worse, can not remember anything. Anyone else?","I do not know if its in any way related to my mental health, but I thought I would share my problem and see if someone knows or has the same issues.

I have Aspergers, Borderline Personality Disorder and Depression.

I recently started to attend college, and it has been really rough so far... I am really, really, really bad at remembering things. I can barely recall yesterday, and I definitely can not recall anything before that. 

When I need to study, I prepare everything, motivate myself, I study in a calm and quiet place. I tried out different learning methods, and optimized how I do it.

But even after all of this, if I really try hard to study, I can only average 1 page every 90 minutes, which is just insane, there is no way I can learn everything on time. I have 5 classes this semester, and we get about 15 pages of things to learn from each of the classes every week. Thats 75 pages I have to learn every week, aka 113 hours of learning every week, which is obviously impossible. I am already pretty behind and starting to feel bad, like I wont be able to catch up. 

I really tried getting better at this, but nothing helped, its still taking me way too much time. I do not know how some people can read and remember stuff to easily. And I feel like my mind is getting worse as the time goes on. I used to be able to remember stuff easily, and had quite vivid memories of things. Now not only I can not learn the material, but I can barely remember my life. Does not help that I have 0 personal interest in what I am studying.

If I did something very interesting, exciting few days ago, met someone really nice or made a friend, had a good food etc, I wont remember it now. I can not remember a single thing from my life, to the point where I do not even remember people...

&amp;#x200B;

And I am supposed to learn like 1000 pages of text perfectly for the exams in 3 months from now. Dunno how I will manage.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone has it the same? What helped? WHat would you recommend?"
66,I'm having a very tough time mentally and emotionally right now.,"I don't know where else to look for help any more...meds aren't working...severe crying episodes daily...I feel hopeless. I'm mid 30's male diagnosed with BP, BPD and ADHD....kind of just seeing if this will help get me out of my head...I really hate everything right now.."
67,Why tf do I always feel a massive down after having fun,First time I really noticed it was those year when I got out of a class where the teacher was really funny and the class in general was fun. I juste felt fucked up for the rest of the day. Now I got out of a game of amoug us a couple hours ago it was really fun but now I feel like crap. Is there smg wrong with me. The same happen when I do some of my favorite hobbies I'm like full happy for a moment after I go back to being a grumpy bitch
68,What conditions have the capacity to affect a person's willpower?,"As an example, some people with extreme depression can't even get out of bed because their condition robs them of the ability to do so. I'm wondering what conditions could cause a similar effect in a person even if they're feeling happy and healthy.

The reason I ask this is because I suffer a range of mental conditions including bipolar, depression, ASD, and have been found likely to have a Schizoid Personality Disorder. I don't know if one/more/all of these conditions have something to do with the ability to generate and regulate willpower, or if it's something else entirely.

Even on a day where I feel stable and elevated, something as simple as emptying the dishwasher, as an example, can take me multiple hours to get around to doing, and sometimes it's so bad that I don't do it for a number of days.

I understand if this is perceived as laziness, but I know when I'm actually being lazy, and when I am 'locked down' by whatever condition is causing this effect."
69,help me,"Sorry to waste sometime but I have a story to say

For context during this pandemic I work as a full time Nurses assistant  and a full time student.  I work around 36-48 hrs a week.  My mother on the other hand has been laid off during most of the pandemic and was taking in unemployment benefits.  We rent a 1 bedroom for all 3 of us.  Since my mother has been home for most of the pandemic she has been nit picking on every single detail of how the room has been.  I myself has not been a very clean person but I have a certain type of how I organise things.  I go to work around 5am in the morning and get home around 730 pm (I take the bus).  By the time I get home my mom would always talks about how I dont help out in the house and not clean my little area of the room, this room is tiny.  I go to the room to change and it was the same thing as I left it.  She didnt even try to clean it.  My mother's making excuses that her ""illnesses"" isnt letting her do so much.  Recently she calling me as an ignorant and rude child and on top of that she keeps spewing like I only pay for the phone bill ($320) and she pays for the room ($500) even being unemployed.  Also she says that even I pay for the phone bill I have no right on answering back to her, she thinks she is always right.  For the past 2 years I had been contacting my school's stress and some of my counselors on what should I do.  The thing is I really cant leave yet since the pandemic is happening and the rent pricing here is really expensive (hawaii).  What should I do about this, its really taking a toll on school and work performance as well.  Since I had to work and attend online classes I barely get time to actully do the homework they give us due to the constant battling with me and her."
70,What are your thoughts about guilt as a suicide prevention strategy?,"- *”Think about the loved ones that you’ll leave behind.”*
- *“Suicide doesn’t take away the pain. It just passes it on to someone else.”*
- *”Your parents / kids will feel absolutely heartbroken and think it’s their fault. Do you really want to do that to them?”*
- *“If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for someone else.”*

If you’ve ever sought support while suicidal / lent support to someone suicidal, I’m sure you’ve heard or said or seen at least one of these phrases before. The intent is great — rationalizing suicide and how a completed suicide may affect someone else. But the delivery, specifically themes of guilt for making someone else feel worse — do you think it’s a good suicide prevention and intervention strategy? 

I know it differs from person to person, and it has its merits and some swear by it, while others detest it. I would love to hear your thoughts, maybe even have some healthy discussion. 

•••

I’ll start — personally, I don’t think guilting me into sticking around for someone else is going to make me feel better. Phrases like these (used by friends, family, and even a former therapist) only result in me feeling worse. If I’m already vulnerable enough to think about suicide, if I’m in that much pain that demands to be felt, telling me to think about someone else’s pain is invalidating. I just want my pain to be seen, heard and acknowledged without it being diverted to the pain of someone else. 

For once, let me be the one that matters. Maybe if I felt like I mattered, that my pain in itself mattered, and that my life (and the uncomfortable mess that comes with) is allowed to take up space, I wouldn’t be as convinced that suicide is an / the only option."

I started working out, trying to eat better and do better in school. I feel like i’m failing at all of those. I can’t tell my girlfriend about the way I feel because it’s hard to put it into words and she’s got a million other things to worry about. I used to feel so safe in my own head. I used to be able to rely on myself for everything. I feel cracked now. Like there are flaws in my brain that I can’t figure out and can’t decipher. I know something is wrong but I feel like my parents will think i’m just being weird if I tell them or being stupid I don’t know. I get shit for sleep and I am bad at eating. I feel stupid because I suck at school no matter how hard I try. I think about everything that’s happened in my life and I literally can’t be left alone with these thoughts with my brain. I feel like i’ve got another half of my head that only comes out when i’m by myself and that half is fucked up. I just do the same thing every week. I’m going no where in life. All I do is wait for the next weekend to go out with my friends. All of these things affect my mental health a great deal. I just want to feel different. I want to feel something else"

They subsided for a bit this year but a couple days ago they came back really bad.  I’ve been diagnosed for anxiety and depression, but my doctor said that I didn’t need to take an OCD test. Should I go back and take it anyways?"
75,i think i’m suffering from Existential Depression,"Possible trigger warning: depression, self harm, substance abuse

   my depression started when i was in high school in the form a general dislike of myself, feeling like i’d never be good enough, every day became an uphill battle just to get out of bed and do the bare minimum it took to survive.
   i made my way through high school and started my life as a young adult with really no plans because i never thought i’d make it that far, as the first 3 years went by it got deeper and deeper until i ended up in a facility do to extensive self harm and drug abuse, i was released on a PCP order and continued therapy for a while after that; as i got in a better mind state of myself, my mindset towards the world got more resentful, i realized i didn’t hate myself, or at least not as much as i hated the state of the world i’ve been forced to live in.
   fast forward a couple of years to today and i’m at the point where there isn’t any hate, it’s just exhaustion. i’m tired of this world, not a single thing or person can hold my interest for any significant amount of time, even to the point where the thought of food bores me. i see the world around me and know there’s nothing left for an everyday person to do that isn’t part of a mundane experience.
    I get told that “life is what you make of it” but what is there to make of this life anymore? i can become a cog in the machine that keeps this corrosive world turning, get a job, get married and have a kid or two, but why would i want to have kids when this is the world i would bring them into? i could go against the grain and try to start a movement to try and change the world, but why? just to be shut down and labeled as a “extremist” or a “radical” or the be canceled out entirely because of a mistake i made when i was young? i just don’t see the point anymore.
   

tl;dr -i just don’t see what there is in this world anymore and everything seems to pointless now that i just don’t get it. everything a normal person can do has been done, and existence it’s self seems so null and deprived of potential"
76,Struggling to cope with not having much to do during this pandemic.,"Hey everyone, I know this is a difficult time for many people and I hope everyone is making it through okay. I’m struggling a bit with being unemployed and not having much else going on right now. I had to move back into my Moms place now at 25 and that’s also getting me down. I’ve got some prospects for the future—I’ll be moving around the middle of next year to continue college elsewhere—but at the moment I don’t really have much else going on. 

I’m trying to find work but that’s been really tough and the more I apply the less motivated I become because I never hear back. I think if I could start working I’d feel a bit better, but living at home is taking a toll on my mental health. This is likely because of the pressure of some deep-set societal expectations for being a certain age and living at home, but I just feel really stuck at the moment.

I’ve got a bit of an addiction problem too, as in I tend to jump from one addictive behavior to the next—I quit smoking weed a few months ago which has really helped my mental health, i jumped to gaming and then also quit that because it negatively effected my mental health. Cutting those out freed up a lot of my time and now I’m having a hard time filling my days with productivity. So now I’ve jumped to internet addiction and I really want to cut it down a lot but there’s nothing else I feel like doing most of the time. I work out a few times a week, and take one online class once a week, I’m also in therapy twice a month. But beyond that my free time is dominated by me constantly being on my phone. I’ll see friend occasionally but still there’s tons of time where I feel bored and disconnected. 

The job search is still continuing so hopefully once I can get a full-time gig I’ll feel better about this whole situation. Until then though I’ll just have to try to kick this internet addiction and start reading or something."
77,How to tell your Arab parents that you need therapy,"Hey so I have anxiety disorder, possibly depression too, and I want to get help, when I get a panic attack it’s usually just not being able to breath properly, feeling dizzy and losing my appetite after and feeling nauseous. Not that big of a deal.

Today was by far the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had, it was during a class I don’t particularly enjoy and out of nowhere I can’t breath, started crying uncontrollably and the only thing that stopped it was sitting on the floor and crying until I could manage my breathing, still feel shaken up by it and I don’t know if I can handle this happening again, so I wanna tell my parents. 

Please help me, they already don’t take me seriously and I’m seen as the disappointment/ the dumb one of the family but I want to tell them at the slight chance that they will take this seriously.

Sorry if this sounds ranty or if the English is bad."
78,My Dad has detached from reality.,"So I have dinner with my parents about once a week and for about a month or two my Dad doesn’t show. He’s always been a workaholic so it wasn’t totally out of the ordinary, but this was a particularly long stretch of not seeing him. Eventually my Mom admits she hasn’t seen my Dad at their apartment in like 3 months and she thinks he’s staying at work overnight. My Dad out of nowhere calls me the very next day to meet up and so I ask him flat out what’s been going on. He tells me he’s been avoiding his apartment because an autistic teen who lives above him has been attacking him with hypersonic weapons through the walls. He has confronted other neighbors about the kid who they all deny exists. His explanation for this is that all of his neighbors are covering for the kid for some reason. He’s pointed out and taken pictures of “burns” and “welts” on his body that don’t really seem to be there to me and has even spent his days at various parks where he believes the kid might hang out. He also was staying at my Uncle’s house until he started being “attacked” by my Uncle’s upstairs neighbor as well. That’s when the .001% chance in my mind that this might possibly be happening to him in reality went out the window. He is still highly functional and working a very respectable job despite spending all day at parks and sleeping at his office. My Uncle, sister and I are currently coordinating to try and get him help but he is 65 years old, never had any issues like this is the past, and will likely not seek help himself because he is so stubborn. We have talked to some medical professionals and I am not necessarily expecting anyone to be able to tell me what is going on as it could be dementia, Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia or any number of things. I was just wondering if anyone had ever personally dealt with something like this because I am just totally at a loss here. I’ve done reading on “targeted individuals,” “gang stalking,” delusional psychosis, etc and it all is eerily similar to what my Dad is describing. It just seems weird for this to happen to him all of a sudden in his 60’s. Or was this something that was always inside of him and he just covered it up for that long? I guess I don’t have a specific question or point, I just wanted to get this out there because it’s a fucking lot and I just don’t know how this ends. Thanks if you made it this far."
79,"I know that it's just in my head, but why is it so hard to change what i think or feel?","If i can think it, i can do it ,right? It's just a matter of perspective. They say happiness is fleeting, and you can just find it everywhere when you want to. It sucks. I know what to do ...but i feel otherwise. Every damn time my head says i shouldn't feel this way...because it's not reasonable...i know what to do. Why is it so hard to just do it. To change how you think about things and just be someone who can survive and cope daily."
80,I get a very constant feeling of being eavesdropped on/being watched and it makes me very uncomfortable,"Whenever i am on a call with my friends I cant shake the feeling that my parents/at least somebody is eavesdropping on me. If my friends ask me even a slightly inappropriate question i will either quiet my voice down or say it in a very vague way. whenever i search/upvote/generally give attention to something that isn’t even inappropriate but is perhaps embarrassing, I always get very uncomfortable, even in complete privacy. My parents give me space and I at least dont think they eavesdrop and what could this be about/what could it mean? It doesn’t necessarily feel like my parents either, just that somebody is looking at what i do and is judging me for it."
81,What is normal?,"I have never talked to a therapist. Mental health is not something I even thought about until recently. I don't think I have any problems with mental health but I don't really know. I follow up with a physician, dentist and optometrist regularly but I've never seen a mental health professional. 

What is the normal routine for consulting a mental health professional? Do you wait until you have a problem or is it better to have regular checkups? How often do you talk to a therapist and when  people start? When would you elect to see a psychologist vs a psychiatrist vs a behavioral therapist etc?

I've scheduled my first appointment with a therapist to see what it is like but I don't even know what to expect or what to talk about."
82,i dont feel anything anymore,"as the days go by, im reminded of nothing more than what nothing i have. i had dreams once, but those are behind me now. all i am is nothing and no one. i had an aspiration to be somebody, to mean something. but nothing seems to mean anything anymore. i have never been more alone, and more accompanied. i dont feel happy, i dont feel sad. all i feel is nothing. all the voices say the say the same thing. that i matter, that someone loves me, that someone will miss me. i hear these voices in an empty room staring at a blank wall that could have once held something beautiful. but its just a wall. just an object. i dont feel anything anymore. a part of me still wishes that i mattered, but another part knows thats in the past. i dont remember my past and i dont see a future. all i am is now, nowhere. if i were dead, i wouldnt be surprised"

84,My fiance is struggling with death anxiety and I don’t know how to help,"He just turned 30 years old and he has been having episodes these last few months where he can’t sleep well because he says he has death anxiety. The best sleep he gets is lying close to me on the sofa while I watch netflix or play games, I try and give him that as much as I can, but I need to go to sleep too, and that makes me feel selfish sometimes. 

I too have struggled with the same problem, but it often helped me to change mindset, like cherish the life I have, because I know we all will die someday, and we are so lucky to have health, love, good economy and a safe country. I’ve tried to get through to him by talking but it doesn’t help he says. He won’t go see a therapist, atleast not now.

Do you guys know any videos online that helped you with this? Like videos to look at during an anxiety attack or educational videos to help him change his mindset? 

Thank you."
85,Paranoia at night and sleeping with a nightlight that I'm too old for,"I am 19 years old and for about a week I have been very paranoid at night. As it gets dark my anxiety has been flaring up saying ""someone or something is watching me and I am not safe"" and I don't want to sleep with a light on, so I've been staying up until sunrise (not on purpose, I just can't sleep if it's dark because I don't feel safe) and sleeping for a few hours.

Well tonight I decided to turn on my salt lamp and try to sleep, even though I am an adult and I shouldn't have to sleep with a light because I'm scared but I don't really know what else to do. I don't know if I should feel ashamed of sleeping with a light, I haven't needed a nightlight since I was a very little kid. 

I don't know what is making me so paranoid, but every little sound, every movement coming through the window, and even the clothes in my closet, make me freak out, and I think it's someone/something lurking waiting for me to fall asleep so it/they can kill me or hurt me in some way, but that's crazy. I know I'm safe and nothing is in my house, my door is locked, my windows closed, no one can get to me and I'm safe. 

I just can't shake this paranoia.. I need help.. any advice..?"
86,I just lose a competition and I can't stop feeling ended it all,"I spend a whole year to this design competition and the outcome is I am 3rd, it was a big deal to me because it can build a foundation of my furture, losing it means all are lost now and I have to come up with a new plan.and I don't want to, I know there is hope but I just don't want to lose anymore.i lose enough...

what kills me is I really try my best , I lost a lot of hair I even dream about how to make it better but I still end up losing and a giant stamp of 3rd mark on my forehead. It's worst than getting nothing at all.

And I can't stop thinking this reflect all my life.I am just not good enough on anything. I am ok on anything, but not good, never best.not good enough as a son , not good enough as a designer , not good enough to love or be loved. I am just a OKAY dude and no matter how hard I try I will still be like that, then what is the point of living this ok life that I kinda like but always have something I can't fulfill...what is the point of being a beta bitch loser, who make people pity me and use it as a weapon so I can attract kinds like me... I am just fucking pathic loser and I have no point to keep on knowing that I will just be ""OKAY"" it's not okay for me to be OKAY, I want to be the best and I never will.if I know that then what is the point of living , hold on..."
87,Sudden urges getting the best of me?,"Lately ive noticed that whenever i seem to go through any conflict or difficulties in my life i do things that i know ill regret, it almost feels as if im going through manic episodes but i dont want to self diagnose. 

A example of my thoughts is i've recently gotten into a relationship that has me extremely happy. However ive noticed that anytime theirs a conflict between us my first thought is ""breakup with them"" or that i just completely cut them off. I feel so bad because i know its being toxic but i dont know how to deal with difficulties or i almost feel like ""it wont matter"". Ive even gone as far as saying lets take a break when i know the next day ill regret and it wont benfit me at all. I feel as if i have no emotions. Ive noticed this has happened with friends also. Every single time I feel as if i disappointed them or the blames on me i just cut it off. I hate it so much because i know its so toxic which fuels the self loath and isolation even more.

I have experienced some heavy trauma such as losing my mother to suic*de and having my sister put in a foster home. I feel as if my past trauma fuels into me being use to people wanting to leave or feeling as if theyre going to leave me anyway. 

Im not sure how to get through these 'episodes' but any help is welcomed. Its really effecting my life negatively and i want it to stop."
88,"I'm a worthless, stupid, selfish, childish, overly emotional, lazy and unfilial mental baggage to my family.","Don't worry, I won't die yet... at least until the time I completely snap and drink 12 gallons of water. Sorry for my incorrect grammar and improper words, as I can't type properly while trying to stop crying at the same time. Oh and yes, I just found this subreddit today, so please excuse me.

I'm worthless. I can't do anything right. When I do something, I end up f\*cking it up because of my clumsiness and idiocy. Multi-task, and I end up being scolded because I focused on just one. Follow errands, and I'm scolded because I don't do my own tasks first. Do my own tasks, and I'm scolded because I'm not doing any chores at home. I can't understand my f\*cking modules, and I still have to tutor my relatives. I need to use my laptop to try and understand the modules, but I still have to lend it to my family as soon as they borrowed it. I can't refuse because they'll scold me or get angry at me. When I tell everyone my opinions, especially if it's about my own f\*cking life, my mother only gets stressed out by me and tells me to stop. I can't choose for myself, and I ended up suffering in a school I never wanted to go to. No, no one's bullying me. It's just that except that time when I wanted to skip the last year of pre-elementary school, I never went to the school I like, the friends I like, or the people I like. I can't be heard crying, or they'll scold me. The most I did for myself is buying the cheapest coffee at 7-eleven because my mother will scold me once I ""waste"" money on something not needed. One time, when I bought notebooks and pens with my own money, I even have to be careful not to slip out to my mother that I just bought it because I feel like it. When I receive money from someone, even from my mother, she'll ask me and my siblings to lend her our money. She said it's spent for us in the first place, so the money almost never comes back. I have to be that behaved and obedient child at home, but I'm tired of it. I currently have a scholarship (which my mother applied ""for me"" against my will) in a ~~major~~ ~~private~~ school at my province which I don't even want in the first place. Everyone may say that I'm lucky because it's a scholarship, there are people who want that scholarship, and other bullcr\*p, but it just caused my ""mild"" depression and anxiety to become a full-blown depression with suicidal thoughts.

I want to cut ties with my toxic Filipino family who'll control and suppress their own children's lives and feelings for the sake of ""helping the family"" and acting and looking good towards ""relatives"" and ""friends"" I never even met. F\*ck being hospitable. F\*ck being kind to everyone else. I want to go away from here. I can't even express myself. I want to be free from my family's decisions (and gossips, most of the time), even if I know that my mother is still dealing with my father's death for two years and counting.

I want to drop out of my school and give up that ""precious"" scholarship, even if my mother will be very angry at me for wasting the opportunity to go to college. I'd rather go to a public school, even if I experienced traumatic events in one, or apply for military enlistment instead of slowly chipping my life inside.

F\*ck you, Filipino keyboard warriors who'll ever burn me here because I'm destroying the Filipino pride and face. I'm not having any of that sh\*t today. Not now, when I almost thought of overdosing myself with over-the-counter drugs and then drink lots of water until I explode while I'm typing this rant.

God of the Roman Catholics, if You exist, please let me reset this cr\*ppy life of mine, or at least give me the courage to do the epilogue of this life. I dreamt once of You telling me to not give up, but I can't, and I'm not even a Catholic at heart! This society and my family are the ones who decided my religion at the time when I can't even cr\*p by myself. Will I be marked by the Church as a heretic now? I don't know.

I'm trying to not give up, or at least ignore that invisible ~~mental~~ chain I feel physically strangling me. I'm even listening to my favorite song (which is neither an OPM or Hollywood-released song which the majority of the society is listening to without cringing just because it's from an anime) that saved me once in high school, when my mental health is in its all-time low, ~~when I'm afraid to go down the stairs because I ""see"" every single way for me to die in every step, and when I let the made-up people friends in my mind take over my body when I can't deal with the problem anymore because they know what's really the best for me~~. It calmed me down a bit, but it's not a long-term solution.

89,I want to kill myself today,The title says it all. I’m exhausted and feel like an inconvenience to people because of my mental health. I just feel everyone would be happier if I just disappeared.
90,What do you do when you can’t sleep?,"
Preface: I work night shift, however I’ve been doing this for over three years now and don’t understand why my body hasn’t adjusted yet. 

I’ve never had good sleep patterns. Even as a teen, I would lay down for bed and end up laying there for hours before passing out. I’ve never been that person that “woke up on the wrong side of the bed.” I’m conscious for every move I make in my sleep, and unfortunately I move a lot. I toss and turn. I don’t ever remember a time in which I slept so soundly that I don’t remember getting to the position I woke up in. 

Recently though, things have gotten worse and I don’t quite know why. I haven’t made any changes to my medication or really anything else in my life. So I’m not sure what’s wrong. Same ol depressed me. 

I can’t stay asleep. My body absolutely will not let me sleep more than 5 hours max. It’s a never ending cycle that I can’t get out of, because I’ll wake up around 3pm and can’t go back to sleep. Have to go to work at 11pm. I get off at 7am and when I get home around 8, I’m so sleepy I can barely hold my eyes open. I try to stay up every day until at least 10. Sometimes I can, most times I can’t. And 3pm seems to be that number. I just can’t sleep passed that. 

I started smoking again because of this, and while that’s helped, financially I can’t be consistent with that. Melatonin puts me to sleep, but of course does nothing to keep me asleep longer. 

I’ve tried meditating, ASMR, soothing music, a hot shower. I just don’t know what else to do. If I can’t afford to buy pot, I don’t even wanna think about a doctor bill. And I’m just getting so mentally exhausted with the physical exhaustion. 

I need out."

I'll have a small argument with my partner and he'll tell me its all sorted but I won't feel okay for days on end because i constantly think he's gonna leave me. Even if he constantly reassures me he won't.

I'm constantly on edge that we'll break up and i can't eat or sleep even thought a voice in my head is telling me he isn't. I just don't know what to do :("
92,"An endless, dark, and dismal void inside","This is my first time posting here in this sub, I'm not usually one who likes to reveal or discuss when things aren't great. I normally prefer helping and talking with others. Just lending my ear, being a friend and providing as much support as I can. I know that many people need that, especially during this time we're in.

Some days I know and believe that I do this because I care, care about others and listening to them when other people won't. It's why I pursued the degree that I did, in Psych. Other days I worry that it's to distract myself and remain sane, to avoid dealing with the void and emptiness I feel inside.

I haven't felt it to this extreme in quite some time. Since she and I separated a few months back this feeling of worthlessness and wanting not to wake up the next day has come back with an intense earnest, like a deep, dark pit that I just can't crawl out of no matter how much I struggle. The first month was the worst of course, but every time I think it's going away, or that at least I can keep myself distracted, it comes back all of a sudden.

Sorry for the depressing read and rant, just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere, anywhere really. It felt like I was drowning and suffocating tonight, and just I thought writing it out might do some good, or at least provide distraction. I might delete this post later, as I genuinely do not want people to see or know of this side of me.

And finally, my sincerest best wishes to all suffering out there, I'm sure that many are dealing with darker demons than even I am."
93,Positive mental health subreddits?,"Hi everyone, I am struggeling a bit atm and looking for positive communities regarding mental health, loneliness, unemployment because of a mental illness and self-change in general.

I know that venting is a big help for a lot of you out there and that's ok, but it has the opposite effect for me.

What communities do you visit to get some positive vibes? Are there any apps you can recommend? These don't *have* to be mental health related, a positive general subreddit etc. is fine, too."
94,What happens after a failed suicide attempt?,"*I'm not suicidal, just want to know more about this.

Will they force the person to go to therapy or get a diagnosis if they haven't already been to therapy before, if so is it a single or a few appointments or will they followup with more after you get discharged? How long do they keep you, and what makes them transfer you to a psych ward?"
95,Bringing up my problems with my boyfriend. What are your thoughts?,"Recently, I've been really considering going to a doctor to ask about the things I'm struggling with and if they're normal. I just graduated from university last year and have my first ""big boy job"" but I find that I am having a lot of struggles with it and I want to know if there's anything that I can do about it. I also had these same struggles during school, but I never really pushed myself to get help for it. I've brought it up to my boyfriend of almost 2 years and his response (when it comes to mental health generally) is that he doesn't think things like anxiety/adhd/add really ""exist."" He doesn't see them as 'disorders' but they're just ""mutations of the human brain,"" and you can't expect everyone to be following a cookie-cutter of what a human should be. 

I kind of get where he's coming from and that this is a pretty traditional Asian way of thinking. I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about when I say that, but I'll try to give an example; it's like when people are depressed, Asian parents would think, 'you have nothing to be sad about so just stop moping.' Anyways, I'm just trying to write my thoughts out and I want to (and will) get help from a doctor but talking to my bf makes me feel like nothing is actually wrong with me and I could just be giving myself excuses? I'm not even sure what the point of me posting here is... Maybe I just want to hear all of your thoughts about my situation and my bf's view on mental health."
96,Worried about my boyfriend. Struggling with my own mental health. Advice needed please,"So I’ve noticed my boyfriend has been liking some really worrying/depressing memes, ones that r talking about suicide or fantisising about death ect. I messaged him about it multiple times asking if he’s okay and if he needs to talk i’m here, but he always insists he’s fine. I asked him why he liked it and he literally replied with 🤷‍♀️.  And then immediately changed the subject by sending some random meme. 

I don’t want to pressure him to talk to me if he doesn’t want to so i just left it alone, but i really am worried for him. I don’t know what to do.

I always talk to him about how i’m feeling but i feel like he never shares anything hes feeling with me. Idk if its just a guy thing bc they’re so pressured to not show weakness in society or whatever, but idk it kind of throws me off. But i understand some things are just deeply personal and i have no right to be pestering him for information. I am just so worried for him.

I’m really fucking struggling with my own mental health at the moment and this makes me feel worse. my bpd brain is telling me ‘oh it must be ur fault, maybe he’s unhappy with u’ or some shit like that. 

I don’t know what to do or think. please, any advice would be appreciated x"
97,Struggling mentally and emotionally this pandemic,"Hi, I am new here and sorry if this is gonna be a long post ahead.

I’ve been struggling the past few months this quarantine. Everyday I’m crying and breaking down and sometimes I can’t even figure out why. My appetite is very irregular and I barely eat and mostly sleep the entire day. I’ve lost a decent amount of weight, my skin is breaking out and I’ve never had acne this worse. Everyday is a battle of negative thoughts and a downspiral of overthinking. 

My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship temporarily. He works far away in the city as a medical frontliner, I’m stuck here in a rural area since its much safer. I’m always worried about him since his work makes him exposed to the virus. Sometime’s i’d have nightmares I’ll lose him. I just really feel so lost right now, like nothing really makes sense. I’d usually feel a whole lot better after crying a lot but Im getting tired of crying everday for months. I’ve had anxiety before but I haven’t fell so heavy and have so much toll like this ever since. Anyone else dealing with these lately, I really feel so alone and empty right now."
98,Strange memory problems,"So as I’m sure everyone here knows memory loss or poor memory isn’t an uncommon among those of us struggling with mental health problems. But I’ve been concerned about two things as of late. My memory has just been getting worse, I’ve forgotten to eat, to workout, I’ve forgotten that I’m hungry or that I’m thirsty, I’ve forgotten that I’ve ate and I’ll eat again and again, I’ve forgotten that I’ve taken my meds and take a double dose. Stuff of that sort, simple yet important things that I should remember to do/that I’ve done. I’ve dealt with just forgetting things and being forgetful but forgetting that I’m hungry is something that’s never happened to me before. And recently I’ve felt like my memories are lying to me. Like the memories from long ago, when I was a kid. They fee altered in some way. It’s strange because I can barley remember anything before 7th grade and if I really try they feel altered somehow. Like they’ve been implanted or altered. They fee different but like they’re pretending to be the same as always. I am not sure how else to put that other than it feels like I’m being lied to by my memories. My family has a history of Alzheimers and Dementia. Has anyone else had something like this? Should I be more concerned? Is this a problem with my mental health or early warning signs of a memory problem?"
99,Truth telling urge,"Hi. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'm curious whether some of you also have similar experience. If so, do you associate it with any mental condition?

I have a really deep urge to tell the truth. Since my childhood. I'm capable of lying, but often admit that I lied after short time. I also feel that I have to confess all of the things I did against my conscience or all of my failures. If you ask me about my health and I feel bad that day, I might say that I'm fine but will feel deeply uncomfortable with it. I also feel like people around me should be filled with updated information about me, although it is compeletely irrational. Strangers, friends, teachers - I must tell the truth and restraning myself costs really much energy. I won't tell your secret, but keeping it makes me uncomfortable. On the other hand, I don't have obsessive thoughts about it. In my childhood no one forced me to do this.

It's not about any joy in saying stuff (I hate it), spreading rumors or complaining about my life to gain support. It's just... I hate hiding something or being dishonest. Anyone with similar problem?"
100,I got rejected for an internship I really thought I'd get,"I'm (20F) from a CS background. Ever since quarantine started I've really put in my best efforts to learn/study more about the fields I'm interested in and genuinely thought I'm making great progress.
After getting rejected or miserably failing in almost every internship test I've given, I finally got called for the interview round for one company. I was so excited and I spent alot of time researching about it and the things that company does.
I had two interviews. The first one went very well. For the second one the interviewer was late and he mixed up profiles. He didn't seem interested at all but I was still able to talk about all the projects I did on my own and i thought he found it pretty cool too.
I know this is a small issue but when I saw I wasn't selected I was so crushed. I have bad anxiety but I still managed to push myself through the interview week which exhausted me completley. I really thought I did so well. I wish I was better."
101,"Am often told I appear completely under control/confident/cool &amp; collected, but I have anxious tendencies - is this high functioning anxiety?","Hey everyone.

Something  has made me think for a while. I've been through some things the last  few years, and during the most intense moments people have often been  oblivious to my plight or some friends/acquaintances remark the  following

""i'd fall apart in your situation I don't know how you do it""  
""  i'm honestly shocked you just asked me for help for this now, i'd  usually rely on you for stuff like this and I thought your question was a  joke. You always seem under control/confident/mature, you always know  what to do, at least it looks like it""  
"" you always look so happy! What's your secret"" (colleague while I was right in the middle of a really bad situation)

Recently  I had to submit a video of myself for something, and although I was  undergoing a semi-medical emergency during it, I looked back at it days  later and was shocked at how calm/collected I appeared.

But  I know for a fact that I have a history of anxiety, depression and  PTSD, so what on earth gives? Is this just a manifestation of high  functioning anxiety?

Would really appreciate your thoughts! :) Thank you very much,"
102,i don’t know what to call this,"i sometimes feel like i act like a different person, and not like in the sense of “putting on a different mask around different people”. it’s like one day i’ll wake up and the way i speak (as in the way my voice sounds) and act just changes, it’s not something i do consciously either i just do it. and sometimes i will look back on photos or videos that were taken of me acting different and even thoroughly convinced that it isn’t me who is talking/present in the photo. i don’t know why i do this, i really have no reason to and again it’s not really a conscious choice. i’ll just be acting like that. the only thing i can equate it to is some level of depersonalization or dissociation, but it’s just weird to me and i don’t understand why i do it. any thoughts would be helpful 🖤"
103,Talking with my self.....,"Hello, i dont even know if im writing this in correct subredit or if i should write this at all, the thing is i am having full on loud coversations with like a difirent version of my self, im a 25 year old male, im a heavy smoker and im not like fat but my belly is larger that it should be compared to the rest of my body and the other me is like pestering me about stoping smoking witch is not that easy and starting to work out, to fix my teeth and other like real stuf i should work on and i know he is right but some times the voice just does not let me focus or do my job and other stuff, i just keep hearing him like he is standing right beside me. This started couple of months ago, and as far as i know my family has no record of mental ilneses or stuff like that, i did not had any traumatic event. I guess im trying to ask if i should go to doctor or something or i should listen to him and do things he sais i should. 

Sorry for my english, its my 3rd language, and i will be turning off my net and notification sound and try to sleep. I hope i will read some good suggestions when i wake up. Thanks."
104,1 year therapy anniversary,So as the title says i went to therapy every week for a whole year now and i made some steps in the right direction. I have a moderate depression and severe anxiety. My therapist is a real blessing for me and became a really important person in my life. Thank you so much :)
105,Impulsivity,"I just enlisted into the military. 
I’ve never even considered it to be an option for myself. Graduated at rank four in my senior class five months ago. I guess it was a combination of social pressure and stagnation due to the pandemic that made me join.

Really hope it’s not too late to get out, as I am completely mentally unfit to make literally any commitment like this.

I’ve never been diagnosed, but I believe I was just in some sort of manic or hypomanic episode.
Over the years, I’ve found myself leaning closer to BPD, so this really alarms me.

Please leave any relevant resources for Houston, Texas."
106,I don’t want to sleep because of nightmares . How can I stop dreaming?,"I don’t want to sleep

I’ve been depriving myself of sleep because I really don’t like having nightmares and I get them almost every night lately . My nightmares are always very very personal and always go into my deep fears and I hate them . I’d rather have nightmares about being chased by a murderer than the ones I have because I actually dream about my real life fears and it upsets me so much because I always think they are real life . What can I do to stop dreaming ? I know weed can help with stopping dreams but I don’t like smoking all the time"

*A child so small,*

*You had the power to touch us all""*

Many women who lose a baby in pregnancy can go on to develop mental health issues that last for months or years– even when they have gone on to have healthy babies. 

The language used around miscarriage and stillbirth can be traumatic in itself – terminology referring to an “incompetent cervix” or a “blighted ovum” can be distressing. 

So I hope and wish that parents who used to deal with this hurtful challenge would know that, don't worry, they're happy in another life and you can go through with that."
109,i'm probably gonna get called out for plagiarism tomorrow from my one of university's teacher/lecturer,"my teacher emailed me hours ago asking about a recent assignment, and wanting to have a phone call tomorrow which did sound like a serious matter. honestly, it was just one assignment, but i just felt lazy whilst feeling super down (a lot more lately), had no motivation/intention to do the assignment (im forced to do a subject i dont want to do for my physics degree), so from back the back of mind, i chose an easy topic that just simply explains the equation, and went on wikipedia. paraphrased a bit and wrote straight sentences (because it seemed like there was no other way to explain it). i just wanted to get the assignment done with and go back to wallowing in misery. right now im just putting in the bare minimum effort to pull through and using the least amount of effort for uni work, because i just don't feel it. but then again there was no way check it in with turnitin, idk i think i may use that for my defense. a few mins ago i check with other websites and they mention my assignment being 58% to 61% plagiarism free. im just hoping that the teacher/lecturer won't call me out for plagiarism, im just simply in a bad state of mind (which has always been bad since post high school but heighten over the years) and even since this pandemic, have no eagerness to do anything"
110,I need real help,I think i’m a little bit suicidal but i have no one to talk to about it. i forget its a really deep and hurtful subject to just talk about with friends and tonight i hurt my boyfriend a little bit by talking about my thoughts. to me i don’t think of it as that big of a deal but i forget other people do. i need to talk to someone like a therapist maybe but my parents would never let me see one and i’m too young to see one by myself. idk whatbto do as this could get worse since i’m stuck bottling it all up. idk how anyone can help me i just needed to let this out.
111,Thinking very much about suicide.,"I've been thinking about it a lot for the past couple of days. I feel so disconnected from the world and alone. Sitting in my online classes I feel so empty and I have no true motivation to do anything really. I feel so pressured, but I pressure myself most. I made some changes in my life that I don't think are good for me but I can't undo them and now I have to live with them for a while. Usually  I don't think about suicide that often, but I do think about why I was born and why I have to suffer so much, wishing that I could just disappear without leaving a trace of me behind. Now it's just plain suicide. The only thing good in my life is my family and if they knew how I feel right now I'm sure they would be devastated so I'm trying to be ok for them. I don't think I would act on the suicidal thoughts but I feel as if they serve as a comfort to me that I don't always have to suffer like this.."
112,I feel Guilty,"Hi,

For starters I am not native English so sorry if my English is bad.

Created extra account because I don't want to post it with my own account

A couple years ago I was Admitted in a mental health clinic because I wasn't doing well and was very suicidal.
Of course you're getting in touch with the other people there and I created your friendship with somebody there.
She committed suicide in the clinic. Now, 4,5 years later, I still feel guilty. I should've noticed that something was going on. Ofcourse I know she was she suicidal just like me.
But I feel stupid that I didn't notice anything the day before that I wasn't there in the morning when she was in the group room. Some others told me that she wasn't looking very good that morning.  I should have been there.
For a long time more than one/two years my mind sometimes go to the point I want to go to the cops to turn myself in. Tell them it is my fault it happend. That I should be punished for it because I really think I deserve that.  I should have done someting. Should have sended her a text that morning (I Actually did send something but that was later in the morning and I don't know if she already has done something at the moment of time) I should have seen the signs. 
I don't know what to do about it.

The person in the room next to her called me that they that something was wrong.  I allready heard the alarm sounds from staff just couple seconds before but that it was a test. I run over to the room from that person and I was there untill my friend was on her way to the hospital.  Everytime I hear a siren from things like police or whatsoever my mind shutsdown and I'm back in that room.  Also if I just see a police oficer. I hate it.  I hate myself for it.  I can't complain it feels like my fault.
Allready tried 3 times(many sessions every time) EMDR and exposure on it over the last years.  All failed. 

Maybe if I turn myself in. My mind will stop the flashbacks all the time."
113,Am I okay?...,"Hi guys, I've been thinking about this lately. I haven't consulted a psychiatrist before, never had the chance to. Before I start, I just wanted to say first that English in not my first language, so I'm sorry if my grammar would sound weird for ya. So about what I am concerned about, I don't know if my parents are also aware of this, it's something about my personality and behavior. There are times when I feel like everything is too boring, sometimes I just feel too lazy to even try something new. I'm an introvert person. I do have some friends, but only a few and I don't feel like I want to make more connection to other people other than those friends that I already have. Sometimes, I feel somewhat lost in my own thoughts. While I'm in the middle of thinking something, there are times when I forget what I was thinking about in the first place and why I was thinking about that particular thing. There is also this stupid feeling that sometimes happen to me where I would just lie about random things and deep inside I love it. I know to myself that I'm just joking around with that person but, the more I do it, the more I want to do it again. Deep inside me, I also think that it's funny and there are times where I laugh and giggle in public when I think about it. Also, I find it hard to sympathize with another person's feeling. I don't know if I can really feel the emotions of other people or if I'm just lying to myself that I get how it feels at all. I don't know if this is something that I should be concerned about, I mean, I think I'm ok. Is this normal? Cause I think a lot of people is also like me right? I don't know, that's why I'm posting this here. I hope you guys can help me."

115,"My bf sometimes has phases where he ‘feels nothing’, anyone know what this could be?","So my boyfriend, 33, sometimes feels nothing/ is emotionally numb for hours. He has this 1 or 2 times a week, sometimes longer and more and sometimes less. In this fase he feels nothing, he keeps to himself and doesn’t like to interact much. He snaps into it as quickly as he snaps out of it. He is generally a happy or more so content person and does not have major issues in his life. He is rich, enjoys his work, loves his pets, we have a good, loving and stable relationship (no kids) and he has hobbies and close friends/family. He had had longer periods in his life before where he just didn’t really feel anything, for months, in his 20’s, but as he aged he began ‘feeling more’ somehow. He all tells me this and can tell me when he’s feeling like this so I know and I kind of leave him alone. He really doesn’t know why this is happening and nor do I. He doesn’t really care for himself as it doesn’t effect him too much (it doesn’t make him sad just numb) but he cares for me as he’s just gone... we don’t live together and when we do see each other 1 time a week and he’s like this for a few hours it can be difficult. Outside of these phases he is very open, kind and loving. He’s not the most chatty and bubbly person but he can communicate well. Does anyone has experience with this, or might know what this could be? He’s not the type to seek out help much so that’s why I’m making a first step here. Maybe it’s something bigger..


I don’t know if it matters but he is an introverted person (INTJ) and he has been very busy lately. These phases etc go back further than Corona time."
116,I thought I would be great,"But I’m not, I’m nothing. I’m 30 and I haven’t done a thing. I’m useless and shouldn’t exist. This is a waste."
117,I feel like I'm in prison and I can't escape,I live with a roommate (ex) extremely toxic living situation it's her dad's place and I basically live locked in a room waiting for my food and coffee like a fucking inmate because I'm not liked by him but she won't let me leave when I try she freaks out and sits infront of the door and cries and blames me but this has been such a dead relationship for years now we basically can't even make a friendship work my mental health is destroyed and I've lost the will to live or try anymore I can't do anything until I get away from her but I have no money nowhere to go and no family so I don't see options and I'm seriously considering ending it I hate this life and I just want to actually live again I feel like I'm being held prisoner somewhere no one respects me and I really need help
118,Treatment-resistant depression that may actually be bipolar?,"(Disclaimer: I am not looking for medical advice or a diagnosis. I just wanted to see if anyone has been in a position like this and what their experiences with it were.)

Is there anyone here who's had long term, treatment-resistant depression that eventually turned out to be something else? My mind is particularly on bipolar II but anything is of interest.

If yes: did this lead to a change in treatment? How are the medications treating you? I'm a bit leery of the lithium and anticonvulsants, especially in terms of side effects. Did they stabilize you, and what kind of mood did you settle in?"
119,I don't know how to feel,My grandma had breast cancer and had it removed and got the all clear last Christmas but a 2 weeks ago I was told that it was back and has spread everywhere and was told yesterday she has weeks left she seems to have just accepted it and I don't know what to feel. Everyone is saying that I need to process it but I can't as that means accepting it and I can't.

121,What do you do when you can't go to school?,"My English isn't the best as I'm from Germany, sorry in advance.

Hi. I'm 20F, dropped out of school 3 years ago because of bullying. I was bullied for 10 years and couldn't take it anymore. 

In these 3 years my narcisstic parents have made my life to hell and I've been to mental health hospitals 4 times. I don't have any friends and never had any because I have severe social anxiety and don't talk to anyone.

 Now I'm back in school. I went there for a week and then I told my teachers I was ill even though I wasn't and now I have been missing school for almost 3 weeks. I don't know what do anymore. I can't bring myself to go to school there as I'm very suicidal at the moment and any social interaction will completely destroy me. 

Do you have any idea if there is like a school for mentally disabled people or just something? I'm so lost and I don't even know if I can do this anymore. My parents are getting more abusive by the day and I just can't take it anymore. I think I'm hopeless. I guess I should just end it.

TLDR: I have been missing from school for 3 weeks and can't bring myself to go there anymore due to mental health problems. What do I do?"
122,my sibling is suicidal. how can i help them?,"we found out my sibling is suicidal again. we want to get them help but they freaked out last time that happened. but they need some help. 

they dont know that i know and i was told not to let my sibling know that i know. in what ways can i help them out now? i don’t know what to do and my family is worried

i dont want to make it obvious that i know what’s going on in case they freak out, and i’m a generally quiet person so i don’t want to push too much suspicious random support, but i still want to support them. i really dont know what to do right now. i think my parents are gonna help to take care of it but what can i do to help"
123,"My family keeps fucking up my mental health, and they don't care how I feel unless I am extremely upset","I was was in the best mental state since I was 12. I was being more positive, actually getting stuff done, and I felt safe in my house. I didn't hate my birthday, and was working on building relationships with my family. And of course, dumb fuckers had to mess it up. My little brother, who is 16, started doing this thing about three months ago where he would say something that hurt my feelings, and then when I tried to talk to him, he said that it was a joke and acted like it was funny. This has happened 14 times. I have tried to talk to him, explaining that I didn't like being talked to like that. The last time it happened was Monday. I asked my dad to walk faster, not in a mean way, just in a normal tone of voice. Then my brother looked me in the eyes and interjected and said"" Alex if dad wanted to move faster he would"". I then asked him to mind his own business, and that fucker, had the nerve to say that he wasn't talking to me, that he was talking out loud to himself. He lied straight to my face. I fucking hate living with these people."
124,unsupportive parents,im a sophmore in highschool and ive been doing not so well. My parents keep nagging me and im still trying to find out how to motivate myself and keep myself and my parents happy. I recently dropped cross country due to an injured knee and i hvent been able to get back because my parents dont want me to and would rather me focus on school.

125,Staring a mental health page/ poetry page on Facebook ~ IG: Insightsandflourishment,"Hi 💜

《Disclaimer: This isn't to self promote or anything, I'm not selling a product or anything that will bring me revenue,  its quite the opposite,  it takes up time and needs a lot of effort &amp; it's all for free. I'm doing this to help others who are struggling》

So after thinking hard and long enough how to help people who are struggling with their mental health I have finally I have actualise the idea of making a platform for people with mental illnesses. I've started both a Facebook and instagram account. The reason is because I myself went through a lot of things for many years which isn't mainstream, and which I couldn't make sense of. They were soul shattering on many levels. It took years of seeking, reading and compiling information which I grounded through analyzing patterns and reflecting on to understand what I went through.  

Much later therapy wasnt to help neither because they couldn't understand.It was also a quite isolating experience, also I didnt know what those struggles meant from an islamic perspective. 

 I'm planning to gradually increase awareness on topics I wish was more in mainstream psychology , and general things that people really need to know. I will also write about spirituality and knowing yourself , because there is no gift one can give him or herself like learning about themselves. I truly want to empower people to understand themselves and not wander confusingly. Poetry will also be part of the page , because it is part what Jung called 《symbolic healing 》 and has been an essential part of my journey.

Really hope it will be to help for people out there

I'm not sure if this is allowed but I'm a journalist/pre-med student doing a story on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to talk about how you're handling your mental health during this time. How COVID-19 has affected your mental health and care. I'm extremely passionate about talking about mental health and breaking the stigma surrounding it. I think this is important to talk about, especially because no one else is right now. All names can be anonymous. I'm looking for people all over the world so I would love to hear from anyone. Thank you in advance &lt;3"
127,My mom had me diagnosed with mild autism and it has ruined my life,"Ever since I was diagnosed, it has had a major impact on my self esteem and how I see myself.No matter what sort of self improvement I engage in, it doesn't make a difference. I have always had trouble maintaining friendships and relationships. I started going to the gym back in 2019, I go 5 days a week. Despite, losing 80 lbs I still feel like I'm not good enough to have friends and intimate relationships because of my autism and the way people treat me. At age 24, I'm  scared of being alone for the rest of my life and its starting to influence suicidal thoughts. I also feel like everyone in my local community thinks I'm inferior and crazy.  I just want to be treated like everyone else.... 😞😞"
128,feeling really stressed,"i'm not sure what's going on but for hours on end since yesterday i feel really stressed and like i can't breathe properly? idk but my chest gets really tight and my legs feel shaky almost like how i feel when i have to public speak but constant and for extended periods of time

does anyone know how to help please?"
129,Question about BPST,
130,How to overcome inferiority complex ?,"I am a 15 y/o kid from India ,and inferiority goes rampant in my mind , it's really wearing me down"
131,An article I came across on the relationship between mental health and art,[https://www.stirworld.com/see-features-william-utermohlen-s-critical-works-reveal-extent-of-alzheimer-s-disease](https://www.stirworld.com/see-features-william-utermohlen-s-critical-works-reveal-extent-of-alzheimer-s-disease)
132,Was university the best or worst decision I've ever made?,"Before University we was all in lockdown from March to August in the UK (6 months). I haven't been at sixth form. 
I applied for university games art and design degree. And I'm here now. 

I am really enjoying the social aspect, and I've met a girl who is beyond perfect. Weirdly perfect
However my course is beyond stressful, and I'm questioning if it was the right decision to make.

Before uni I was in the most positive mental state I've ever been in. I never had to try and not feel crap, because I felt that good. Nothing got to me. I've never been happier. 
I've come to university. I have felt myself over the past 2 weeks trying to not fall back into a bad mental state I was in a while ago. And the fact that I've been trying to not fall back into it, shows that my mental state is getting worse. 

Everyone wants to see me at uni. But the stress is that I can't. I have never worked so hard in my life. I knew I Was going to be working hard. But even my friends are saying I am being over worked.

My FIRST week of work. I did 30 hours outside of my lectures. And the following week I got told I hadn't done enough work and they didn't like my character Idea. So I was told to start over.

Because of Covid. I cannot use the universities facilities and software. My laptop cannot run the software they want me to use. I'm getting told off for not being able to afford a powerful laptop (the one we need to get is a minimum of£1.3k.) they are really harsh. Also they are saying we will need to invest into Zbrush which is £400/year.

I am paying the MAXIMUM tuition fee of £9.25k/year. And my tutors are dreadful. And I cannot use any of the facilities I need to use to pass. 

I am starting to dislike art, and I'm only 4 weeks into my course. I don't have the patience for it because I'm not working as fast as they want me to. And my only thoughts right now are to drop out. Part of it is the work load. But the main reason is because I'm not even getting the bare minimum for how much this is costing me. 
However, I have made some amazing friends, I have an amazing girlfriend. And I don't want to go to a different university and make friends again
I have no friends at home. This is the most at home I've felt in a long long time. 

I have been doing work for about 3 hours today. And I just haven't got anywhere near as much as I hoped to get done. And I've had a bit of a mental breakdown from the stress. 

I really don't know what To do. I don't know if it's worth leaving. I've never felt so at home and with a FamilY. But I've also never been under so much stress :("
133,What is up with my brain?,"There's something confusing about myself that I want to talk about, it's a problem I've had for a really long time.

I've just come out of a period of self hate by focusing in on my identity and who I am, but I have these random thoughts that still manage to break my defences.

I don't know how to explain it but it's like half of my brain is constantly working against me over the smallest of things. Like for example I'll be chilling playing a video game I really like when a random thought comes into my head like ""Hey, is this game really that good?""  I'll try to get rid of the thought and justify why I like it only to have more thoughts come in at too fast of a pace for me to keep up with.

Now apply this to negative things about myself. It's hard to keep up when half of my brain is spewing negativity. ""Are you really a good person?"" ""How do you know you don't deserve to die?"" And a hundred other thoughts as well.

Even if I don't try to justify them and just ignore them it gets worse, because the more I think ""No, I don't want to think this"" the more I think of it.

How do I stop this and get the other half of my thoughts to just stop, or how do I hone in and focus on a single good thought?"
134,My (32m) fiancée (30f) has just left the country to be with her family due to mental health.,"My fiancee is from the US and I am from the UK. We met online when she was working in the UK 5 years ago. Since then we've suffered a myriad of visa issues that ultimately meant us maintaining our relationship long distance with a occasional visits (maybe 3/4 weeks out of every six months). We did 2.5 years of this. We really managed it very well and eventually in January this year we got our visa to settle in the UK.

However, once she arrived here, covid happened. We couldn't marry, which meant she couldn't work and the lockdown meant she was stuck with absolutely nothing to do. Her mental health deteriorated over the months. I also work from home so we were in each others company 100% of the time. The NHS in the UK has been struggling to deal with the mental health crisis and was not much use to us. It did seem like our need to marry immediately was going to be pushed out 2 years due to visa circumstances. This all changed when our lawyer said you need to book a wedding right now. Well, with 8 months of cabin fever, declining mental health and a staggering lack of purpose it was too much, she couldn't do it. I absolutely didn't help by being extremely blasé about the prospect of marriage.

She decided she needed to go back to the US to be around family to get proper medicine, therapy and familial support. She left yesterday and because we called off the visa process there is no immediate path to get back together permanently. In fact, it's not even possible for us to visit each other again until travel bans are lifted.

One of the private therapists we briefly used (but couldn't continue because of money) very quickly decided that she is bipolar. Something which my sister in law (a trained counsellor) said she absolutely agrees with last night. Her mother is also bipolar. Also, on our last night together we talked endlessly and a whole bunch of stuff about her childhood came out that she never even told her therapist when she was young. It also came out that the same issues and emotions she was feeling were not new, and existed before I was a part of her life. If this all turns out to be true did we ever really have a chance to succeed with untreated bipolar in between us?

We haven't spoken properly yet and she's still only just getting back and will have jet lag. Neither of us wants to give up. The last message I got before she boarded was ""I love you and I am going to fix this and I’m so sorry""

It is my belief that we do have something special. We share similar outlooks on life, what we want out of life, we influence each other in the right ways, we have respect for one another and I think most importantly, we make each other laugh. I always tried to explain this throughout our hard times and she would be dismayed at why even though she totally agreed, she wasn't happy.

Myself and our two dogs are in a lot of grief right now and trying to figure out what to do. It's so painful but my instinct is to give this a few months until around Christmas when she's had some solid therapy and medicine before I say you need to either commit to us getting back together somehow, someday or I need to move on. If I break this off I lose my best friend and my confidant.

Would love some advice and input on this situation. Love and respect to anyone else struggling today."

136,I've slept two hours in the last two days and I don't feel tired,So. I've been under a lot of stress lately and I've noticed I've had an inability to sleep. I've put it off to work as in a shift worker however I've slept 2 hours in 2 days and I don't even feel tired. I'm still sort of functioning. But I keep closing my eyes and lying down and nothing will happen. I tried to drink myself into a stupor the other day but my brain would shut down. So sober or drunk I don't seem to be tired and I'm coming up on my third night and I'm kind of worried.
137,I don't like anything,"I don't understand why this happens. Why I don't like doing what I used to like. I feel like i just don't want to do anything.

Read some blogs and they said it's your brain and body asking for a break. I did that. Took break for a while like months and feelings haven't changed. Spoke with a councillor, and he said identify when you get frustrated in what you do now or at least look for clues as to what makes me don't like what I do. I'm trying to observe but I don't see what the trigger point is.

I need help in understanding why this is happening and what is the point of the feeling, for sure i feel it's the sign that I don't like what i am doing but i don't know what to do which can satisfy that feeling.

Some people and blog says explore more things so you find something interesting. I did try exploring things but i don't seems to come across anything that's interesting but if i still force myself i begin hating doing that too. 

For sure i don't want to just sit around till my last day. So, what is the problem? Followings are some of the things I think maybe they are the problems

  
1. I'm just trying to gain people's sympathy  
2. I'm too stupid to do anything.

3. I've no talent. 

4. My mentality is lazy or i'm lazy

No, idea."
138,"My aunt , who is loving, told my cousin now to not mention to me that they're going on another roadtrip and I know exactly why","This sucks. You know? This shit just sucks. 

I have an aunt. She is on the happy, stress free life and doesn't want issues around her. Okay. She is fun to be around since there is not much on her shoulders. And she /is/ loving. She is. And supportive. All for doing things. 

I don't have many friends here, okay yes. In my hometown. Yes, I am mostly me and the few things I do. BUT, BITCH I DO THEM. I WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND I AM PROUD OF ME AND I TRY LITTLE BY LITTLE TO DO THINGS AND I AM A GOOD AND FUN PERSON TO BE AROUND EVEN WHEN I AM NOT AS CHIPPY AS YOU. 

My aunt loves trips and anything refreshing. So they go on roadtrips every now and then. She calls makes the planning and takes her family with. Awesome. I have never begged her to take me on one and I have never begged for their companionship. 

Her words hurt me. Because 1. Why should my cousin not tell me since you tell me eveey Monday already about what you did on the weekend? And 2. Yea, yea, i am miserable and quiet and whatever else in your eyes. Eventho you love me, you find me too stuck up or what? 

Bitch, I am fun. I am wonderful. And I can enjoy things without being on someone else's shoulders while they're in pain like you do my uncle. Yes I said it.. 

I am not a parasite and I am not negative energy crap just because I had a horrible childhood. I am LOVE."
139,Encouraging mental health discussions among men,"I recently joined a fraternity, and getting together to support eachother has been rough because of Covid. I suggested a group chat with the purpose of allowing anybody who is struggling to reach out if they need it, but the response was lukewarm. The guys weren't too comfortable with the idea of opening up about their struggles to 60+ other guys at once. I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations on ways to encourage mental health discussions among the group that feel natural or aren't forced. Thanks much!"
140,does anyone else feel like this?,"i don’t know how to word it but sometimes when things happen that impact me emotionally (doesn’t matter if it’s something i enjoy or if im scared of embarrassed or anxious) i feel this sensation in my fingers like i need to rub them and squirm and hurt them to make it stop like i feel like i have to cut the tips of my fingers for it to stop (i haven’t done self harm yet) like my brain is telling me it’ll stop if i let the feeling flow out with the blood? 
i also get overwhelmed with and scared for no reason, even when i’m hanging out with the people i appreciate, i just want to leave. 
when im anxious i can hear my heartbeat and i sweat so much.
people have also told me that i flinch too easily for no reason, even when i think my guard is down (i have no history of household abuse) 
are these real things or am i just what my mom calls me?
“a brat that follows their lust too much”"
141,Guy tried to kill a goat at a child marriage in India to try and curse the ceremony and stop the illegal marriage without calling the cops.,"A close friend I had since highschool, went in India for a year as a volunteer working with an NGO. This NGO was advocating for girls education around the world and against analphabetism and child marriages.This story he didn't told me himself first his family did, but we were eventually able to talk about it together. He is better now but quite traumatized I think he spend a lot of his time alone in his room just doing nothing and depression.

He was giving free English lessons to kids although he wasn't a teacher (no diploma). Untouchable Kids from a very poor and difficult background.
After like 8 month there one of the girl from his class got forced into child marriage by her family she was only 15 years old and wanted to study to become a doctor.

The context is that apparently this is a very common custom /tradition in some of the rural backward area  in India. Where girls aged from 13 to 18 are married to significantly older men aged around 18 to 30 (And it also happens in many other countries I'm not trying to specifically point a finger only at India here.)

The girl was the daughter of the handyman and school janitor who where living in a house at the school doors as ""guardians"" supposed to control who goes in and out of the school. The irony

Well on the day of the marriage he wasn't told it was going to happen not by the local staff of the school who knew it was going to happen and told no one.
They even all waited for the founder of the NGO to be gone and he wasn't around town he was gone for a vacation with his wife that week. 
And so random people with fancy clothes started to come onto the school ground slowly from 20 people to About 60/70 people from the village and other people from the groom family.
The old men sat in a circle and the women from the village started singing. Traditions and shit. 
It's at this moment he realised that something was off and that things like that wasn't supposed to happen on the school ground so he looked for the local staff and asked them what was going on and they were his Indian friends so they told him.

And he just lost it at this moment he felt so betrayed and lied to. he insulted everyone and cursed everyone even threw the Prasad in the trash.
Went to find the girl she was locked up in a room with another volontier was crying her souls out with fear and disper.
He called the founder and head master of the organization and asked him for help the guy answered he was busy and too far away. 
The girls family were his friends and the school staff too so he didn't want to call the cops on them.
Would also possibly mean the closing of the school.
So he grabbed a bad handmade foldable knife without people noticing from his stuff. First Went to the neighbors field and caught a goat from the herd 
Went back in the school over the wall still carrying the animal and proceeded to murder this goat in front of the cheerful crowd while cursing them to hell. The goat actually didn't die though apparently had to get stitched up at the veterinary and was probably traumatized for life. But the girl also didn't marry that year. What is the real better option also dialogue with the family wasn't leading anywhere the  father being a backward alcoholic and violent.

After that he was expelled and flew straight back home. The marriage didn't happen that year but the girl could be married now even him, he doesn't know.
With corrona and confinement the people from the NGO couldn't stay on Indian ground.

After that he was really wrecked and didn't see much people he was obsessed with this and was always trying to figure out a way that he would have saved the day without using such violent ""solutions"".
He also went to a psychiatrist because he thought he was psychotic or something.

What do you think of this ? What would you have hypoteticly done in this situation ? 
Do you think he is crazy ? Or do you think he lost control but still was right in a way ? 

Pretty long text but I think it's hard to understand if you don't have at least that much context."

143,Mental Health and wellbeing for students,"My experience of University was great but as in life I had my down periods where I was pretty depressed, stressed and contemplating just giving up on it all. I had friends who suffered more and became dependent on drugs or had suicidal thoughts but through it all my mates and me got kept at it. 

After this I worked for a university within the student welfare department and saw the huge range of issues facing students today in the UK and did my best to make a difference to those in need. I also saw how the system was strained to breaking point and in need of relief. 

I'm creating a course for higher education students which focusses on mental health and wellbeing through proper diet, exercise and stress/anxiety relief through mindfulness and yoga. I hope to both empower students to take control of there own wellbeing so they can achieve and also relief some of the pressure on the mental health support system. 

I would love to hear from students and those working within mental health on what they think would be the most valuable and important parts of such a course ?"

145,suicidal fiance... dont know what to do,"Strap in... it's a long one.

My (f26) fiance (m35) told me two weeks ago that he was feeling suicidal.

He suffers with PTSD from childhood trauma and abusive ex-girlfriends but hasn't had any depressive episodes while we've been together. Since Covid he had been out of work for 7 months, issues with said exes means he isnt being allowed to see his kids and in July he was spiked by a 'friend' which led to a psychotic episode that lasted a month.... it's a lot.

I also suffer from depression and have felt suicidal in the past and knew that if I could just help him keep his head above water, it would pass. Instead, I had to take him to A&amp;E on Thursday after he told me that me being there wouldn't stop him from doing something, and that he's desperate enough now that he would do it even while I was at home, if he found the opportunity.

The main trigger is our home. It is where he was spiked and spent his whole psychotic episode, and he's described a day where he felt like he had died, that his heart had stopped beating and his whole body had gone cold. Our flat is old and has no central heating, and we don't have much money so we cant keep it warm.

Being here keeps him anxious and depressed and I've been trying to look for somewhere else to live, but again, we have no money.

He started a new job on Sunday that I was hoping was going to be enough of a distraction for him, and that a routine, being away from the house, and interacting with people would be good for him but he still tells me he wants to end it all.

I wouldn't usually bring something so personal to Reddit but I'm truly at the end of my rope. I think I just want to know that he's going to pull through. I've listened to him, gathered resources, taken control of all our finances and household responsibilities, encouraged him... I dont't know what more I can do?"
146,I feel suicidal due to my alcoholic father,"I (17 F) have been seeing my father suffering from alcoholism since I've been born. He stays sober for only about a week in a month. He verbally abuses my mother, screams at her, he can't even go to washroom by himself. The situation is getting worse day by day. He has become paranoid and also gets hallucinations. We told him that we will fully support him if he wants to recover from alcoholism but he doesn't even try. My mental health is deteriorating day by day. Me, my mother and my brother don't even get proper sleep because he keeps shouting whole night. My grades have started to drop due to this one of my teacher asked me about it and told me it is disappointing to see such a good student like this. 

My brother always stays in his room and I've seen him crying by himself. I can't see my mother and brother suffer like this. We are also financially dependent on my father.

I want to either kill myself or my father. My mother is really strong but I'm not that strong it's getting harder to survive. My mother is the only reason I'm still alive, i know it's selfish but I don't want to live like this, I want to end it all !"
147,I keep falling apart and never see it coming.,"Has anyone who has experienced this got any suggestions?

More and more I find myself collapsing in tears over small obstacles because of anxiety and sleep deprivation.  I get sleep deprived due to night time anxiety attacks.  Some weeks I can sleep fine, but this week I have not been able to fall asleep as I do not have my usual audio recording that helps me unwind.

I don't have caffeine or alcohol, and try to eat homecooked meals and get fresh air out the back of the house every day.  But I keep going from ""I'm great, I'm doing great"" to crying and losing 2 hours."

149,My thoughts about anxiety?,"Now, I understand why people say anxiety is a bitch, your mind becomes the most toxic thing you know even when you do good. You mind focuses on the bad. It's whole a lot of fighting and not trying to drown in the sea of thoughts. Because if you drowned you're done. Just pay to god, even my “anxiety”is mild and it is Scary when you all you think about is am I enough or why am I unlike that person. It's really toxic."

151,ADVICE NEEDED - Sister having psychosis symptoms,"Hi everyone,

My sister (28yo) started showing psychosis symptoms a couple of months ago. At first we thought she was telling the truth but now it doesn't make sense and the symptoms are getting more serious. So I'd appreciate any advice on what to do next. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Her symptoms: a few months ago she started telling my family that she's being spied on. She said that she had to stop using her phone, laptop, email... because ""THEY"" can hear and know everything (I will address these people she claimed spying on her using quotation marks). She told my mom that ""THEY"" were spying on all my family members, that ""THEY"" can listen as my mom talks at home even when the phone is on lockscreen. 

One time I called an electrician in for an issue, he showed up 30min earlier than scheduled. My sister said that he was told to come early by ""THEM"". 

Recently, she's been talking to the air a lot in English. I don't live with my family and my parents can't understand English so they couldn't know what she was saying. But she just keeps talking to nobody, no phone in front of her. Sometimes she cries for no reason, while having dinner, while driving, at 3AM. Last night my mom said something (probably trying to convince her to seek professional help) and my sister started screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have tried: my dad tried to gradually talk to her, she wouldn't tell him anything. He's been very patient, he said something along the line of ""tell me what happened and who they are, I will do anything to protect you"". She wouldn't let him finish his thoughts so he decided to write a note to her. Then when she saw that she started screaming also.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now we don't really know what to do. We can't talk to her much. She's not even eating much. She refused to see a doctor so I want to know what we can do right now"
152,I’m really struggling,"I have had anxiety since 5 (parents divorced) and active depression with self harm tendencies since I was about 10/12. I’ve gone through a lot and just kinda brushed by my mental health with a smile on my face, but last year I started to try and get help. I’m on an antidepressant and I’ve been trying to find a therapist that works with me. 

It just feels like now that I’m trying to better myself I feel about 1000 times worse. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t wake in the morning. There are days I’m short and snappy with my fiancé and son (I apologize as much as possible.) I just don’t understand why this wave has been going on for so long. 

I understand the it gets worse before it gets better, but when? Another year? Two? Five? I just want to at least function how I used to before but I don’t want to let people down and give up."
153,Do I have ADD/ADHD?,"I am a freshman just actually started in person high school (I was doing online due to covid) and I really can’t focus on anything. I have anxiety when talking to many people. I have trouble making friends because everyone wants to be “cool” and I’m not wanting to risk my life and give up my personality over people who don’t have any true goals other than getting laid and doing drugs and bs. I can’t finish my school work in the allotted time due to me not being able to focus at all. Whenever I try to do something difficult or time consuming I just give up. I don’t try to choose not to listen in class but I just mentally leave the situation. I am behind on assignments because I couldn’t pay attention even when I literally just had to put an assignment in a basket. Today I had a 0 hour for school and I missed the bus back to school, I had a panic attack and I called my dad. He picked me up and now I’m having a “sick day” today. I have some friends but they are in only one of my two lunches. I do want to go into the navy when I’m 18. I know I should go to a doctor to correctly diagnose something like this but I’m just wondering if it is actually a serious problem. Should I go to an actual doctor or am I just nervous? (Sorry if I came off as offensive with me “risking my life” I just don’t want to be a popular kid who does drugs, gets in trouble, etc.)"
154,Trying to fight isolation in a depressive episode,"My mental health has been pretty low for the past two or maybe three week, I can’t remember. I’ve been trying to fight isolation and the urge to cancel all plans as best as I can, cause I know being with my friends really helps. I haven’t seen anyone for about a week now. Today has been the roughest day in a while. I’ve been shaking the whole day cause I’ve been so anxious and haven’t really gotten anything done. 

I was supposed to go to a cottage with my friends today but couldn’t cause of work related reasons. My friends said I could come tomorrow by train. The trip is only about an hour or so.

I can’t really decide if I should go or not. I know that if I go I’ll have fun but I don’t know if I have the energy to be around people for the whole weekend. I don’t know whether staying home will improve or worsen my current mental state.

We’ll also be drinking, so I don’t know about that. I don’t want to end up crying for the whole time, although that’s not guaranteed maybe I’ll just end up having a great time. Not drinking isn’t really an option cause I’ll get too anxious about being the only one sober. 

So, I’m just trying to get another persons perspective. I can’t seem to make any decisions at the moment. Any advice?"

We started talking about common issues in managing software development agencies, customer relations, and other stuff while showing each other some pictures, joking, and having a couple of drinks. That’s how I met [**Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/donaldj.trumpforpresidentinc./) Campaign Manager.

Frankly speaking, Brad’s story is truly inspiring for me. From the owner of a small web agency in Texas that made a $1000 website for one of Trump’s real estate projects, he became responsible for managing all the digital operations for Trump’s presidential campaign. Brad was Trump’s first call when he decided to run for president. The entire campaign launched by Brad and his agency cost Trump some $98 million. 

Once I returned from the conference, I emailed Brad, and you know what, he did reply to my email. I was pleasantly surprised, but I already knew that he is a pretty down-to-earth guy who treats others with respect, regardless of his high social standing. He is a living example of why you should never reject small projects, and I’ve already mentioned his success story in a couple of articles and interviews. 

A couple of days ago, I remembered this story and decided to google how Brad was doing. It turned out that [**he had an emotional breakdown**](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article246174240.html) at the end of September. First, he was arrested by the police because of his suicidal threats and being suspected of assaulting his wife. Sometime later, he announced his complete retirement from the election campaign. He was involuntarily hospitalized, and the arrest footage was posted on the Internet.

Dealing with high risks and continuous exposure to stress is an inevitable fate of every entrepreneur, and I know it from my own experience. Anyone can burn out: not only an employee but also a business owner, especially if one is working on something really huge. This is when the “work-life balance” comes to mind: indeed, it’s a must-have these days. **Switching your focus from work to other areas of your life**, recreating, meditating, having a therapy session, and vacationing - all these are essential for our long-term well-being. Business is both your work and your life, which is probably the root cause of all meltdowns in entrepreneurs.

&gt;*Dealing with high risks and continuous exposure to stress is an inevitable fate of every entrepreneur, and I know it from my own experience.*

Speaking of work-life balance, I cannot but recall one of my employees who has been struggling with chronic overworking for the past two months. She is the kind of person who monitors her emails in the evening just to make sure our client gets a prompt email reply or can make an urgent Zoom call, even though her workday starts at 7 am. For product releases, she volunteered for a few night shifts. Although all her overtimes and night work were compensated, money cannot instantly cure physical and mental exhaustion. I decided to reward her with a one-week vacation for two to the destination of her choice fully paid by the company. And of course, her workload for the next release will be closely monitored, as we don’t want to lose her to burnout.

&gt;*Although all her overtimes and night work were compensated, money cannot instantly cure physical and mental exhaustion.*

As for Brad, I really hope he will recover soon and start a new fascinating chapter in his life. I’d love to read at least one more success story about Brad, and whatever he chooses to do in the future, I hope he pays double attention to his health because when you are a boss, you are the one in charge of your well-being.

156,"I start laughing suddenly when i am too sad or about to cry, is that normal?","I am a 19 yo from India. I was mostly alone and depressed since i was a 10 yo kid. I was usually able to handle it all these years and felt bad about opening up to other people about how I feel, so I've never talked about it with anyone except two of my close friends. But lately I've noticed that I'am growing more and more depressed for no major reasons at all. And when I feel too sad I feel like I am about to tear up but then I start laughing or smiling. I was reluctant to ask for advise or speak about this but this action bother me too much. is it normal?"
157,My Dad is a stranger to me.,"I hardly recognize his face and sometimes I don't even look because it's just black. Like a shadow, and I can't remember what he looks like because I can't see it. I hear his voice but I don't know his face. And now other people have shadow faces and I feel like I'm losing my min."
158,How do you guys chill out or de-stress?,Looking for advice on how to relax :)
159,Have you guys tried CBT? How was your experience with it?,"I'm evaluating CBT as a sustainable solution and would love to learn more about your experience with it.

How you started?

What exercises helped you the most?

How do you track your progress?"
160,How much time is appropriate for personal leave?,I am in such a bad place mentally and asked for personal leave from work. They were very understanding and took me off the schedule effective immediately. Now I'm stressed because I don't know how much time is appropriate before I should go back. I  get really stressed about counting time until things. I don't know how long is appropriate to take until I need to return.
161,Does anyone else have problems with emotions?,"As of recently I think I can only feel loneliness, frustration, shame, and small amounts of concern, and besides that pretty much nothing else (don’t really feel anything at all)

For example, recently some family members got into a massive fight and I should have felt some kind of empathy or concern or something but I didn’t really feel much I just sort of avoided them

For a while now I feel like the way I do when zoning out in class for example, but way more often and not only in class

Is something wrong with my brain what do I do"
162,How do I stop believing that I did things that I do not remember doing?,"I fear that I cheated on my boyfriend by sexting with another guy I talked with, but I do not remember doing it and it is unlikely that I did. However I feel guilt and I cannot stop wondering if I did it or not, I am even convincing myself that I did it. I feel like I need to be forgiven by my boyfriend but I have never thought about sexting with another guy. It has been one month wondering if I cheated or not on my boyfriend and I do not remember things."
163,I know I don't have much time left,"This is gonna sound crazy but I know I don't have much time left, another 4 years at most. I can feel it in my bones. Something bad is coming for me but I don't know what. I don't have any hope for my future (or lack there of) but its just his weird bone feeling that tells me my body doesn't have much longer. Hopefully it will come sooner or later so I can face eternity head on and can get out of the awful narcissistic, selfish body that I live in."
164,My brain won’t turn on???,I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I am in bed and i can’t move?? I can’t make myself GO. My job just called. I should be there by now. But I can’t get out of bed and i’m starting to panic because I can’t move...what’s wrong with me??
165,Psychiatrists are giving me anxiety,"Sorry for the rant, but I was in need to talk to someone. I made this account just to do this. 

I am working on depression, heavy anxiety and CPTSD. Started going to psychologist because it was impacting my work and got send straight to psychiatrist. 
It's been one year and half and 3 different professionals, and it is being so hard. I fell anxious only thinking about it.

I do not know if it is only my bad luck, or where I live it is usual but the professionals I have talked to always are kinda rude, always late and show a big disinterest. 

First doctor wanted me to keep using pain medication that made me feel bad longer than the ortho recommended. But I was happy because the medicine he gave me to anxiety/depression had finally made me fell good for the first time since I remember. And also, all the 4 or more appointments with him, all of them he delayed from 30 minutes to one hour. The last straw was Corona, where we did a virtual talk and then waited 4 days to receive the prescription renovation to be delievered, already without my meds, and through messaging him he says to me stop bothering him. I felt so bad. Ended having to go take it in his building because he never sent it to be delivered. 

Second doctor only asked what I wanted and renovated my prescription. 
Third doctor, I then could talk how my depression had not improved and change medicine. I felt like he was a little inpatient while we talk but I am very bad talking with person, always fell like they are mad with me so I dismiss. Then appointment of yesterday was set and there I was, waiting for 40 minutes to the doctor to come. It was my lunch break so I could not wait anymore. 
Today I called to make another appointment, and I hear that the doctor will not accept appointments with me anymore because i left. 

It's so hard for me. I just want to stop it, never put myself in that position again. But I fear that my job will be affected more than already is being without the anti-anxiety medicine.

So here I am, looking through the list of doctors from my health insurance, imagining how any of this names is gonna make me wait and be rude.

Sorry again, I am just frustrated with a lot of things."
166,"I cant leave for surgery because my boyfriends in a manic episode, im scared to leave him alone.","I have osteomycilitis and the nurse there called me and said to go to the er. I'm sick and in a lot of pain but I cant go because I'm scared to leave him for a few days. He told me not to go because he would be even more manic while I was gone, and possibility kill himself. Visitors aren't allowed right now because of covid. He said wait until our friend brings us pain killers today, I hope they come through.. But he says mental hospitals are hell and he doesn't want any antipsychotics because they take away any feelings or emotions he has. He says he has it worse than me right now. (Which kinda hurt my feelings) ive been up cleaning the house all night (roughly 7 hours), and there's still a ton more trash to clean up, but I'll have to do it, he says his minds too messed up.  He has a psychiatrist appointment next month. But he keeps crying and I feel so bad for him, but I'm not in a good mood either and I really don't want to snap on him (I have bipolar 1 and he's bipolar 2). He insists that its only fair that he gets half of my prescriptions (ativan, gabapentin, opiates) he says he will give me half of whatever he gets, but he never has prescriptions, and I don't want them. I just don't know what to say or do here. I'm not trying to complain, I could just really use some advice here. Thank you 💜"
167,what's happening to me? what's wrong with me ?,"Hi so I'm 23 yo man living in a country called Algeria

168,What is a legit nootropic supplement that has been proven to work?,[removed]
169,A bad day.,"I feel sad. I feel so sad. I've been doing so good. And today it feels like so many pieces of the puzzle just...fell. 

I didn't meditate. I wasn't clear on whats on my mind or plans. I lied to my mom about what type of job opportunity I got instead of the one I got because that's the only way I will ever get her support. I lied to my aunt too to get the bravo comment. I spend half my day listening to my aunt's anti mask rant. I didn't spend time with me. Then i came back home, told my mom what happened w my aunt. Now I've made her sad too. And now i am also full of anxiety because my sister who is the biggest bully in the whole house (dont even ask) said she wants us to cook her a meal too when she is back and i only am cooking for me wnd only left very very little pasta left which means my mom will have to get anxious abt that too and my sister will annoy the crap out of us. I hate this. I hate my sister. I hate this anxiety cycle. I hate feeling I've failed this day. I just... Fuck. Why."
170,Is there anything wrong with me?,I am having these bad violent thoughts that I am overthinking. I am not violent and my parents say that I am a good person and caring but I keep getting these images recently and I get anxiety and worried that I would actually do it. And I know that I am not a psychopath because I am not violent and I just have this thought that I can’t get rid of. I don’t want to do this thought but it pops into my head. What do I do?
171,i kind of need help,"so i (minor closeted ftm) have been getting intrusive thoughts and it is getting worse and worse, but i dont know how to tell my parents.. i feel like if i told them what i think about, they would just call me crazy, and i dont really want them to spend like $32 per hour and waste their time on me, since the cost will add up every month. i might give it a shot, but i get really nervous when talking about sensitive things, so i dont really know  how  to tell them. if you have some advice, i would be really glad if you helped me"
172,Concerned about mental health,"I’m currently in a real low period and I don’t know how to get myself out of it. I went through a similar thing this time last year and it eased up a bit over the lockdown period funnily enough, which is strange because you would assume it would be worse during that time. My mental health is very up and down but bad periods such as this are normally triggered by a negative event in my life which then spirals and spirals until I work myself into a really bad headspace which seems impossible to get out of. These periods are usually characterised by persistent self degrading and irrational thoughts, lack of any proper motivation, loss of self esteem, feeling lonely despite having a good group of friends around me and just a general struggle to feel happy even if I’m doing something I enjoy. I know a lot of people isolate themselves and shut people off during periods like this but I’m the opposite which is confusing to me, I need to constantly be doing something or meeting up/talking to people to combat feeling lonely or letting my negative thoughts get too loud. I’ve never really spoken to a professional about my mental health because It’s only been the last couple of years where I’ve noticed it decline (I’m 19 btw), idk if it’s something which requires a diagnosis or medication or if I’m just overreacting, it’s all a bit of a grey area for me in terms of getting help so any advice would be appreciated"
173,I need help.,"I’ve been depressed since I was a kid, so I’ve never really been good about expressing how I feel. I just started my first kind of serious relationship, and it’s one of the best things to ever happen to me, but my inability to express my thoughts are going to ruin it. Before it was just me stumbling over words trying desperately to tell her how I feel about her, but last night I had a bit more serious of a fuck up. She was upset, so I sat and talked with her. She told me about her biological fathers recent passing and her mixing feelings about it and her grief. And I listened and hugged her after, but then she asked for my thoughts. I had previously had so many thoughts on it, but the moment she asks, my mind is completely blank. So after stammering for bit, I ended up saying “It be like that”. This did not go over well. It was then that I realized I have a problem and need to get better, but I don’t know how. How can I even start repairing my emotions when they’ve been stunted for years? I just want to be able to say what I think like everyone else does. They all make it looks so easy but for me it’s just not"
174,Mental Health Is Not Always Clear To See,"You don’t know what a person is going through. Sure, they might show off a smile and a few laughs, but that doesn’t mean they’re okay. Inside, they may be struggling. So, what does this show? Don’t be a bully, always show appreciation to everyone you see and be kind, always. 

Everyone suffers tremendously in life. It can be down to several reasons... family problems, work, financial issues, problems at home, a death in the family, a regret, past mistake, depression, anxiety... as I said, there are several reasons. Nobody has it easy in life. Just because we don’t show the suffering in person, it doesn’t mean we are not going through it. A dark life can be lived brightly. 

An average person has many problems in their life, many things jumbling around their head but, unfortunately, they don’t have what it takes to speak up about it. In that case, they will remain silent and say nothing, to anyone, which makes matters even worse, by suffering silently. 
Everyone suffers some injustice in life, and what better motivation than to help others not suffer in the same way. 

Help others, be kind at all times and show respect to everyone. Being kind is free, it doesn’t cost a single penny. :)"
175,"Are our inherent personalities set in stone? Can they be genuinely and truly changed, or just masked over?","Not sure if this is the right sub, or if I’ve articulated my question very well... I guess an example would be: Could someone who is naturally cautious and prone to anxiety, change into someone with an abundance of confidence etc. Or are the traits we’re naturally predisposed to the ones we’re set to have for life?"
176,I've hit rock bottom,"So the other night my bf and I went out clubbing. We got really wasted and I started puking and occasionally blacking out. He dropped me of at his place and continued clubbing with his friend. 

I've been dealing with mental health issues for a long time, that my bf was aware of. But something happened that night, I can't remember. I had a lot of blackouts. So I assume something triggered me. I blacked out and sliced my arm wide open. I can't remember much of it but I woke up in the ER, my bf's flatmates took me.

I woke up to the nurse asking me a bunch of questions, apparently I lost a lot of blood. When we got back to my boyfriends apartment, everything was okay at first. But then he stopped talking to me.

He was upset at me. He barely spoke to me after that. Rightfully so. Apparently he got into a fight with his friends when they told him I was in the ER, he thought they were exaggerating because I usually self harm. But when he went into his room he saw the pools of blood and realized the severity of the situation. 

And today, he's feeling like we're not good for each other. He wants us to take a break or something. He said we can take a week and see if we feel like a we're good for each other. But he sounds really set on letting us go, despite my protest. I'll fight to keep us a float but it feels like I already lost him. 

He asked me if he can vent to his mom about what happened. Of course, I didn't say no. But I'm feeling scared, that he'll hate me even more. And that his mom will hate me. I mean what part of ""My gf sliced her arm open and littered my room with blood"" doesn't sound like a toxic mess? 

I brought it upon myself. I feel like I've lost everything. I know things weren't going well with me, but I was coping. And sure, my bf and I had our ups and downs but I was generally really happy. But its as if almost killing myself actually killed me inside. And now, it's like my eyes are open and I see what mess I made. 

Im 24 years old and I'm still a student, my academic life if a disaster. I'm stuck with a supervisor that doesn't give two shits about whether I graduate or not. My mother absolutely despises my existence. I don't really have friends left, they all moved away. Those that's left here only cares about me when they need something. I'm so damn lonely. I have no one to talk to, hence reddit... I should be visiting one of my friends this weekend that moved away. I saw her a year ago. But I don't have the strength for it. For putting up a happy face. The worst part is my health insurance won't cover my therapy anymore (literally heard it two days ago). So I am truly alone.

I don't know how to cope with everything. I wish I had someone, anyone. All these issues and problems... They were there, but I coped with it. I took my meds, went to therapy, everything was quite okay. I was happy. I was so fucking happy.

But I slipped up. I just want to be happy again. But I can't handle this empty feeling."
177,"Well, one positive of depression is that you learn to really appreciate the good days","Well today I woke up before my alarm, worked out and edged up the yard before I went to work. Earlier this week I was in a terrible fog of bleakness and suicidal thoughts. Crazy how this shit goes huh? All I wanted to say, thx"
178,I failed,"A few days ago the front driver side brake started squealing.  I went and got brake pads yesterday to change them.  One lug nut on the driver side does not want to let loose.  I take the car to a local shop that I have had work done before.  They try using their impact drill, they try using things meant to remove stubborn lug nuts.  They say they can't get it loose and ask if I would allow them to use 'extreme measures'.  They use a chisel and a grinder to get the lug nut off.  It costs me everything I have in the bank.  

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I say that I have failed, this weekend starts my vacation with my girlfriend.  We have no money for our vacation.  We had talked about where we would like to go and what we would like to do, friends that we had not seen in a while that we could go socially distant visit.  Now we can do none of that.  It's my fault, I should have tried to do this sooner before the grinding.  Now, everything is messed up and I feel like I can do nothing right.  It feels as if something wants to never have joy in my life."
179,My psychiatrist said that my situation is ridiculous and i don't know how to feel about myself :|,"I am 24 yo and after year of unemployment I forced myself to go get mental help because i just can't make myself function properly as an adult should. I had to stop renovation of my apartament and go back living with my parents.  
I fear making phonecalls, dealing with official matters, making friends, taking responsibility for myself, often wanting to just disappear.

Now i am on some way to something. I had psychiatrist appointment and i will have my 3rd with my psychologist soon.  
Psychiatrist told me i am wasting my life(like.. duh? thanks for telling me, i didnt know :/),  
Told me she dosn't buy me telling her about my suicidal thoughts(guess i am alive for too long for her), that i don't have any physical disability, and that i have more of a personality disorder than a depression as i thought was diagnosed years before in high school.  
That overall its an abnormal situation i am in :|..  
I felt like she thought of me like some loafer that is looking for a easy way to get away with being unemployed, or that i should just get myself together because others have it worse. 

she perscribed me antidepressants tho, and i am taking them for about 2 days now. also she wants me to start going on a group teraphy session which i am fucking terrified of. Terrified that i will have to open to strangers and that they also will think this way. 

Is my problem with anxiety really just something ridiculous? :|"
180,Any advice please,"

This may not be the normal post for this but here we go. I have anxiety and mild depression and unfortunately one of the casualties of this trash year has been my long term relationship of three years. TLDR I loved this person and still do but was coming to terms over the past few months of never seeing them again etc. I randomly met another person and we live in different towns but still see/talk fairly regularly although both of us have said we need time before we jump into anything. Well recently my ex has come back in saying they’ve made a mistake which I understand because of the year and that I’ve known them since high school so I get them on a deep level. I’m in a tough spot my anxiety is spiking and I’ve been more depressed than ever because I want that back but I don’t know if it or anything is the right choice. The past few days have been dark and I’ve talked with close friends but I have no ideas on how to think or work through this. Anything would help"
181,school fucking sucks,"i’ve been depressed for a year and for about a month ish i was feeling better due to being around my friends again. the novelty has worn off and i’m remembering why i isolated myself from everyone. i’m doing okay in school apart from 1 subject. 

whenever i even look at the assignments from that class i break down crying and just lay there doing nothing for hours. i’ve got a few missing assignments and i’m trying to catch up on them now and it’s taking everything in me to not just go cry then sleep. i don’t have notifications on for gc and i just clicked onto an assignment and saw a comment the teacher left. she told me that she spoke to the head of the subject and the head of my grade and that if i don’t upload the work by lesson 3 tomorrow i will be having a call home and a misconduct log. the misconduct log doesn’t bother me as i know it doesn’t affect anything but i’m still shaking and on the verge of breaking down. 

the head of my grade even knows about my past mental health issues (suicide attempts, sh, ed, etc.) and i’m a bit surprised by her. man i hate school. what’s even the point anymore lol"
182,My Friend Is Acting Strange Lately,"I don't want to reveal our true ages, but let's say that we're both less than 16 years old. Me and my friend both chat every day, and I had been noticing some strange behavior in her. She keeps on quoting sad lyrics and saying that they are relatable. and most of the songs she quotes are about non-understanding family, pretending to be happy, and suicide.

This is quite weird since she was normal the first year I knew her (we know each other for 2 years). She also has another friend that she knows for 6 years (I knew her friend once, but because of a dispute we can't stand each other), who is depressed for 2 years. I feel like her friend has a negative influence on her, but I guess that's selfish of me to say. 

If you need more information, I'll be available.

Recently, she said that if she were to jump off a building she'll send me a text prior to her jump so that I could tell the authorities where her body would be. I'm honestly so worried right now.

So my questions are:

\- What should I do and how should I react?

\- Should I tell the school counselor or help her by myself?

\- Does her friend have a negative influence on her?

I'm honestly so lost right now."
183,Mental health,How do you achieve mental peace?
184,I just need to talk about it,"I feel so very tired and emotionally drained. For the first time in 3 years I reached out to someone, I didn't manage to tell them much. But since hes my teacher he send an email to my homeroom teacher. Today the homeroom teacher asked if I wanted to talk about it more. But I said no, I'm not even sure why. Probably because I'm scared of what will happen if everyone would know. I'm just so tired. I cant even bring myself to study or do homework. Tomorrow I have a very important test and I didn't study. So here I am at 8 pm venting about this shit instead of being productive. It just feels like the only thing I can do is lay in bed. Even at school I'm not able to act myself/happy in front of my classmates. I just wish I could live a life where non of this existed. I would not say I'm severely suicidal, but it seems like the only solution these days. I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't think I want to die."
185,"A few points for people who want to police or gatekeep how people use this sub. Specifically, people who are upset at ""I Love You"" posts. Here are some points you should really attempt to grasp.","This is a mental health board. If you want completely grounded and sane topics only to be posted, you are in the wrong place. Many people on this sub (shocker) are mentally ill. Their first thought when they post MAY not be whether or not their post is 100% on task for what YOU believe should be the operative use of this sub. You are entitled to your opinion, but if your opinion is that people are using this board incorrectly, you kind of are missing the reality of why people come to this sub. 

If someone posts an ""I Love You"" post, there is a great possibility that they, themselves, are not in a great place. Or maybe they ARE, but they are just getting out of a bad place. Or maybe they are posting what they believe they might have wanted to hear when they were in a bad place. 

I've seen people actually post on here calling ""I Love You"" posts disingenuous. That they are only made to make OP feel better. 

I am kind of dumbfounded at that statement. 

It really resonates with the way the world is right now. 

To say, boilerplate, that all of these posts are disingenuous and need to be removed from the board because they aren't useful is shocking. 

What that means is: 

""I have come to this free platform that I did not create and was not involved with from it's inception, but I have come to use this free service, and I feel that certain people are using this free service incorrectly, so I feel that I should call on an arbitrator to silence these posts based on my projection of what they mean."" 

That is such an ugly, 2020 view of things. Some critical thinking would lead you to the obvious reality that this is the internet. It's not here for your limited view on how it should be used. 

Wanting to censor people from posting positive affirmations to strangers because YOU project what it means is no more valid than their post. If you want people to stop posting affirmations and positivity, maybe you aren't actually interested in whether or not people here feel good."
186,I want to kill myself.,"My fiance and i have been having a rough time and we went to a counseling appointment last night and it went well. So i thought. Then afterwards her aunt was waiting outside to drive her and our daughter to her house ""for a few days"" and they came home and packed up a bunch of her shit and just left. More than ""a few days"" worth. My fiancee wouldn't even look at me and her aunt just fucking played bodyguard like I'm gonna fucking beat her up or some shit. All i wanted was an answer to ""Are you leaving me"" and apparently that's asking too much. This hurts worse than when my mother died and i want to fucking kill myself and nobody fucking cares and everyone thinks I'm just a fucking piece of shit cuz my fiance talked a bunch of shit about me and i feel completely alienated by people who are supposed to be my friends and I would rather fucking die than continue to feel this way. Fuck my shitty fucking life. I don't deserve this."
187,Frustrated that my older parents are not taking covid seriously!,"I’m not sure where to post this rant but since this is mental health maybe here is good. 

My parents who are approaching 60 and in good health want to travel. It’s their choice I know because they are grown ass people but it concerns me because they ARE older. Even if they don’t respond poorly to getting sick they could be asymptotic and get someone else sick. I just think flying around the country is not a good idea right now.

They want me to dog sit and I feel like saying no because I don’t support this travelling. 

Am I overreacting? I don’t know what to do but this stresses me out. Ugh!! They should just stay home. It won’t kill them!!! Covid might."
188,Please help me!!,"Hi so basically I got diagnosed with OCD when I was 11. It manifested itself in me having to do stuff eg check doors, panic attacks, dark intrusive thoughts and anxiety. So I got CBT and was put on setraline which helped. I stopped taking meds the summer after GCSEs cuz I was fine and I was fine during year 12 (but then again I didn’t do any AS level exams cuz of corona). Now I’m 17 and I’m year 13 and I am worried I’m relapsing. Recently when I’ve been in exams my hands have started to tremble, I can’t breathe and I feel  my heart beating really fast. Twice I have had to leave the lesson before or during the exam in order to calm down. In the end I got the test done but it was still really traumatic. I tried breathing during the exam ya know but when I have the clock right in front of me all I can really think of is that my time is running out. When my hand trembles I try to continue writing but my handwriting looks trash, eventually my hands steady and I can carry on fine if a bit anxious still. I am applying to Cambridge for English and I had this nightmare about the ELAT in which I failed and was literally begging the examiner to give me a second chance. I woke up at like 4am terrified and panicking again. Then today I had an English test (not like a huge one but still) on the tempest and that’s when I had my whole having to leave the class cuz of having another panic attack and stuff. Everyone tells me that I’m gonna do fine in my exams, that it’s just an exam and I get it - but I’m someone who prides them self on being intelligent. And people think I’m just naturally smart and stuff but I have this huge fear about maintaining it and not disappointing people. I told my form tutor about this and I’m meant to see the school counsellor tomorrow. But oh my god I’m so fucking terrified cuz what if this happens during my actual A levels, during my ELAT which is next month, during my other exam tomorrow or next week. I can’t fail I just can’t. I feel like I’m drowning. I don’t want to relapse I feel like I’m back to being 11 and I just feel like all the progress I’ve made meant nothing. My mum said I shouldn’t be disappointed in myself and it’s fine to go back on medicine but I can’t help but still feel like this.    I don’t know what to do, I hate this life so much - all I wanna do is be better."
189,You are loved.,"I came across this song that I'd like to share it's called [""My Soul to Keep"" - The Creepshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW_6yTM1L88).

Even when you're at your lowest, there are people who still care. Sometimes we need a reminder."
190,Idk what to do.,"I'm 13 and my parents have want I call multiple big fights a year. Each year they do this and pretend that they are going to divorce but they never do. At this point I wish they leave each other. 

One day I asked my mom if she would have divorced my dad if it wasn't for me being born. She said yes. I wish I was never born, so my mom and me never felt this pain.

I keep looking back on all the fights they have, I can't help it. I don't want to think about it but I can't just forgot it either. They say forgive and forget. At this point I've done that too many times to count.

I just want to leave, but I can't. They say don't be in a hurry to grow up because adults have it hard. But, I still wish I was 18 because then I could move on with my life. I don't know how I'm going to last until then. One day they are happy and nice, the next their fighting. I never know whats going to happen. They are always stressed and depressed even if they don't know it. My dad gets angry at my mom and the other way around. 

I remember one fight a few years ago. They both were in a big fight and threatening to divorce each other. I don't remember ever little thing that happened but I will try my best. My mom went to go see a friend and left me alone with my father locking me in the bedroom. She didn't take me with her because dad could say she was taken me without his consent or something like that, it was bs, and she just should of taken me. She knew that dad could try and get information out of me, of where she was. I was in the room reading scared but trying to stay calm, I had this little phone that I could use to text my mom. 

Soon after she left dad came knocking on the door, trying to open it. He wanted to know where mom was. I don't remember why though. Soon he found the key and came in trying to take my phone from me incase she told me where she was. She didn't, which just tells me she knew something would happen. He tried taking the phone from me but I was stronger. He left then. I went on the bed and started crying. He didn't care about me just where she was. He would come in and out trying to take my phone saying nothing, just looking for my phone. This went on for maybe a few hours. I'm not sure, time just went by like minutes. He got my phone later on, and I didn't even care at this point. 

Before he got my phone, I was just texting mom telling her to come home quickly. She didn't come home till much later on, even though I begged her to. I was scared of what my dad might do. When he got my phone he tried bringing up and evidence of us talking bad about him, pulling anything he could find. All he did find was us just making jokes, nothing serious. He knew that my mom talked bad about him to me a lot.

Things go blurry after that. I think at that point I realized that I they both never cared for me. Everything was brushed off, but it's hard for me to brush it off to. They always make up and leave me to be the one thats still mad at what had happened. So, I'm almost forced to give in and forget it all happened. 

Idk if I can forgive them. I can't tell them because they will make a big deal about it and pretend they understand, but do nothing to help the situation. I learned that the hard way. I guess I will wait until I'm 18 to move out and start my own life."
191,Does anyone want to voice or video chat?,"I'm 27 and female. I have read a lot on psychiatry and therapy. I have also been in both treatments for five years and improved a lot. I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I used to be diagnosed schizoaffective, but I've been stable for almost three years. I was hospitalized (mostly involuntarily) ten times over the course of 3 years, and the only good thing about being in the (inner city) hospitals was the conversation with other patients. Sometimes I want to voluntarily commit myself just because I am lonely and walk to talk to people.  


I really enjoy chatting with strangers. I love learning about people from all walks of life and I'm not easily bored. Any ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, etc. I give all people who come into my life equal opportunity to earn my respect and attention.  It doesn't matter if you struggle with English.  I'm not passionate about left or right wing politics. I focus my life on helping others, and so not being judgmental of either side. However, I still work hard on being knowledgeable and aware of current events, so I can help people struggling with their own views.  


Basically, whatever your beliefs you can feel safe talking about them with me. I want to help you, and I never want to make you feel bad, I just want to give you some new perspectives or information you might not have heard of before. I can also refer you to books, documentaries, videos, etc that might help you understand something, or see something that bothers you in a new way. I also understand that a lot of the times people just want to vent and feel understood, so if it's obvious you don't really want advice, I'm not going to push it on you either.  


I read A LOT of books (especially on history and spirituality) so we can get into some really detailed conversations or even deep dive into learning about a subject or reading the same book (we can also read to each other). Right now I am obsessed with ancient history, particularly the Sumerians and the legends of the Annunaki. I also love art, and I can constructively criticize visual and text based arts (or just oo and aw at them if that's what you prefer :P). I also own a successful business and can give really good advice if you are wanting to become a business owner or independent priva te contractor.  


I have been extremely suicidal, psychotic, manic, and depressed in the past. Whatever your issue, I probably have a good understanding of what you are going through and can help you. Honestly, just talking about things is so helpful. And if you are psychotic, you will find it extremely difficult to find a therapist that is even trained to talk to you, or experienced with psychosis at all. Since people with psychotic features only make up 2%-5% of the population, they focus on the other 25% (larger customer base) that have much more milder/simpler conditions.  


I have been talking to some strangers online for over 7 years. I like to build long-term relationships with people over the internet. However, if you just want a drinking buddy for the night I am down for that too. If you are in a crisis and desperate for help I am available almost 24-7. I work from home and set my own schedule, and can usually take a break to talk to someone if they really need it ASAP.  


I prefer discord which is a free application you can download on your desktop or your phone. My username is TaranaDolmeto#2982. Feel free to add me if you want to talk or send me a message here if you want to use a different app for some reason."
192,Does anyone know why this happens to me?,"At school (it’s happened 8 times now) when my teacher is talking about something to do with blood or illness I get really pale, I get hot but feel cold, my mouth goes dry, my vision starts to go blurry, I can’t hear anything and my hands start to buzz. It’s happened so many times now that I don’t hyperventilate or stress, I just put my hand up and ask to go to the toilet (new teachers often get worried because of how pale I look.) 

This always happens when they are talking about something pain or blood related and today it was because my food tech teacher was talking about blood anemia, anorexia and a condition where you don’t get enough calcium and your bones turn spongey. I think I started to panic about if I didn’t have enough iron or calcium and I’d have to deal with stuff like that. It mostly happens recently when I tell myself not to feel sick over it, today was the first time I was able to breathe through it but the teacher kept talking and I lost it. It doesn’t make me feel like throwing up and it doesn’t feel like a panic attack because I don’t feel it deep rooted in my heart, just feeling giddy and overwhelmed. 

Does anyone know if this is a mental problem like anxiety or something else?"
193,I dont have anyone to talk to,"Hi everyone

I dont have anyone to talk to about how I feel. Thats it. I have some friends and stuff but from the moment i’m sad they just stop replying. 
I have borderline personality disorder which makes all my emotions 10000 times worse and I just cant deal with it on my own. Im just so so tired of feeling like this. Getting headaches, looking sick. I really dont know how much longer I can deal with this.
You dont have to help, I just wanted to get this of my chest."
194,How does one handle it when they have a friend who wants to help but gets anxious and can’t handle the fact that you don’t get better in two days like them?,i have a friend who has been helping me through one of my biggest slumps ever. but today she lost her shit at another incident and said this week shit just keeps happening. it felt like an attack on me and i don’t know how to handle it.
195,How do I find motivation im anything,"Basically what the titles says, I wanna draw, exercise, play games, but I just cant find the strength to do it. And when I do try them, I just get sad. Anyone have advise?"
196,Looking for good therapy workbooks/journals,"Writing out my thoughts has always helped me, but I've never been good at keeping up with journals without outside help. I'm looking for an anxiety/depression or even ADD workbook that has prompts in it each day. It would be helpful if it touched on DBT, mindfulness, or CBT so I can keep up with things I've learned in therapy. If anyone has suggestions for something like this, I would really appreciate it!"
197,I'm just trying to figure things out,"It's like...

everything was going so fast when I was a kid that I didn't have time to breathe or think.

First, I'm autistic

I've always been STRESSED. Always. My mother used to say that when I was little she'd take me out to the park with my sister and I'd enjoy myself, but I would always throw up afterwards. 

We had this saying ""Good stress, Bad stress. It's all stress."" because both excitement and distress just took me the fuck out. I'd start getting hardcore worse with anxiety starting in October, you know when holidays began, and my headspace would get so much worse.

Christmas was horrible because even though it was fun. The anticipation was too much and I couldn't stand it. I don't celebrate it anymore lmao. 

I could barely sleep. Everything always felt like too much. When I was little, I used to sleep under the covers because I was terrified that something was going to be there if I looked out. It was hot and uncomfortable, but I was terrified. I just knew there would be something there.

I was constantly anxious. Obsessively anxious. I used to have Self-Hate O'Clock. Where my brain would make everything horrible around 5PM-7PM and then until bed where I had trouble sleeping.

I used to sleepwalk when it got really bad when I was little.  

My mom tried explaining it to doctors and then I tried when I started to be able to put it into actual words. Was I explaining it wrong? My mother seemed to get it. She was around to see how truly awful it was. She was was a stay-at-home mom and she took care of me and my sister.  

She fought for my meds because they didn't want to medicate a kid my age. It had gotten really bad when I was 10 and was transitioning to middle school. I was kind of suicidal, but in the way that was just like. Wished I didn't exist, rather than actively. I was put on Zoloft and it was the first time I was calm in my life. That particular med lost it's potency pretty quickly. Went through a lot more that either died out or caused mood swings. 

I didn't talk in school because I zoned out enough to be there. It was hard to drag myself back for communication. I would just like go away in my head and then I'd come home and I'd have good hours and the I'd have Self Hate O'Clock until bed. 

It got really bad around high school to the point that My mom had to take me out of school in the middle of my junior year because I was kind of not there? I don't remember a lot of it. 

Then post high school, a year or two afterwards. The Break happened. I really don't know how to describe that. But I was numb for about two years. I couldn't think right or do really anything. I came back.

I'm on good meds now. They break up my concentration a lot. I'm on antidepressants (2) and take a tranquilizer that is like an extended release med. 

I don't know what the fuck any of that was. I don't think I described it right to any professionals. I don't still don't know how to get it out correctly. I always feel like a child when I try explain it. 

I kind of want to try therapy again. I don't live in the best area for it and now there is a plague. The few times my mother took me to some, it was always a disaster. One of them immediately said my problem was that I wasn't taking enough responsibility for my mental illness which hit all of my insecurities at once. That ended up being a really bad day.

I feel stupid. Like nothing was wrong. I've heard the phrase 'We all have anxiety' so many times. I always feel like 'how can I make what I'm trying to say sound like something'. Like it's not severe enough. It always seems lighthearted when I talk about it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong when I was trying to get people to get it.

I'm gonna post this before I lose confidence."
198,Why do i think about death so much?,"Everytime I listen to music I think about death, doesn’t matter the genre. Sometimes I think about my friends, family or me getting killed. Maybe by a robber, a car accident, a shooter, a fire, ect. Sometimes I think about killing other people. And sometimes myself.

Everytime I cycle to school I think about a drunk driver hitting me.

Everytime I think about killing myself I think about, where, when, what I will kill myself with, if i’ll write letters to everyone, what i’ll write in those letters, what i’ll write to my penpals, what i should leave behind so they remember me. 

Why do i keep thinking about death? And why does my heart hurt when i think about it? Do i want to die? Do i want to live? Idk at this point. I know i won’t do it because im to weak to pain. But i still fantasize about it.

What do i do?"
199,I’m a total idiot,"Hi, I’m pissed bcs I feel unloved. I don’t know why, because I know that there are people who love me but since this break started I have kept to myself mostly and I feel GREAT. But I feel alone and like no one cares enough about me. I feel like I’m floating through life without being  here, but I feel really good.
I think I’m bipolar and have been thinking that for sometime and I think I’m manic again. I’m doing stupid shit and not feeling anything at all. I cut my hair yesterday, spent 1,500 dkk and two days before that I boned my besties ex boyfriend. Bad friend I know. 
Though I feel alone and unloved I can’t feel sad or anything like that. I feel comfortable, but super uncomfortable at the same time. 
I kinda tried explaining this to my friend (who I’m also in love with) but regretted it bcs I felt selfish. These days she can’t eat and I just got back from not eating and here I am helping her, but I just had to also have a stupid problem? Urgh! Why am I like this?
The guy I mentioned earlier is kinda trying to convince me to let him come over tonight and I’m bad at saying no bcs of all of my shit, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. I didn’t really wanna when we did it last time either..://
Basically I’m mad bcs I’m like this. I’m selfish, stupid and I don’t feel anything. I’m in love with an amazing girl (who just sees me as a friend(for now XD)and I go fucking my besties ex? Like why? Wtf? I don’t even really like him... 
I’m basically sitting in my basement hoping that one day someone will show me as much live as I give out, but how can anyone love me? 
I give this girl little notes everyday reminding her that she’s beautiful and perfect, I try to help her eat and I show her love. I do my best for all of my friends. I think I do this and it’s so important to me bcs no one does or ever have done this for me. Probably bcs I’m awful I guess, but I really do try. 
Sorry for this messy post, I just need to say it all out loud I guess. 
I wrote her a short film. I haven’t filmed it yet, but I wrote it. It’s supposed to be beautiful and show her how I see her and tell her about the day I actually almost kissed her, but I don’t know, maybe it’s dumb... 
I give up. I’m at the point where I just wanna stay in my room forever and never come out... again. 
And yes I’m totally open for opinions and shit. And yes I am considering letting him come over..."
200,"20 yo College Student, Who to Talk to?","Good afternoon everyone, 

I am new here on this sub so please forgive me if this isn’t the right place to ask. 

Background Info:

I am a 20yo Male college student studying at a big university in Minnesota, USA. I am studying business and marketing and getting a minor in economics. I am also in the midst of developing my own business theory. I have never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety but my mother has. I haven’t had many big hardships in my life, which I am thankful for and acknowledge, but I feel like I am sinking into a bigger/ deeper hole. I try and mediate and do things to alleviate the stresses on my mind. I do not use substances to cope. I drink a few times a month with my friends to kick back and catch up because they are either states away, working full time in their careers, or busy with school and part time work like myself. I do not feel this is an issue but I’m open to opinions on it if you few the need. I have seen a therapist a few years ago for some high school issue my mom felt I needed to talk to someone about. That was a good thing because I really like the man I spoke with but he deals with people under the age of 18. I tried two others near the end of high school but I did not resonate with them and it felt like a very  “cookie cutter” experience. 

Reason for Post:

I am reaching out today because I feel my mental health gets a little worse each day. I haven’t seen a therapist recently because my schedule seems to be too binding. 

I am fully online for school and I am doing well in 4/6 of my classes. My course load feels quite heavy because I learn well in “in-person” classes. I am struggling with time management, despite my continual attempts to write out and schedule my school work, and understanding the material. I feel there are some parts to this: 1) I do not enjoy starting at a screen for hours on end for school and my job is outlet on my phone as well. 2) 3 of my prospers are at the university for research or graduate studies so teaching isn’t the main reason why they are there (which is common at big state universities). 3) Because I am online, I am at home saving money for rent for the upcoming semester, given that our classes are in person. 

I would like to reach out and ask if there is any specific  medical profession or therapy you guy would recommend? I do not know what to call these professions other than therapy but I do not know what to exactly search for to get some professional help. 

I write this as I find it hard to talk to my loved ones about this because I feel vulnerable if I did. I know it’s the stereotypical male complex to bottle up feelings and push forward without figuring out my issues. 

I would really appreciate suggestions regarding which medical practice to seek. I would also love it if anyone has ideas on things I can work on from at home such as mediation, organization, or anything that has worked for you within the comfort of your own space. 

TL;DR 

I am seeking any guidance for what professional practice to talk to or any “at home” remedies to help ease my depression and anxiety a little bit. 

I am sorry if my post is slightly incoherent; I needed a brain dump to just finally reach out to the wonderful world of the internet.  Thank you for taking the time to read and offer help. I really appreciate it. My DM’s are open if you don’t feel comfortable sharing publicly."
201,Wearing something I don't like gives me anxiety by just thinking about it,"Fellas, I had to get glasses done but the specific design I wanted for the frames wasn't remotely available in the place I got them done and I hate them, later I checked out another place and had the exact design I wanted at the same price. For the moment I'm hoping on getting new ones done cuz the idea of having to wear permanent glasses that I don't like give me massive anxiety and discomfort. Anyone know if it can be related to my diagnosed OCD, ADHD and being in the autism spectrum?"
202,Which mental health illness causes awful day to day choices?,"Sorry this is a genuine question, I'm concerned for a loved one.

He (50M) has had anxiety and depression for 10 years and he has been on antidepressants throughout.

He has gotten worse and worse with day to day activities, he is incredibly lazy and chooses the craziest shortcut for things. He was a really lazy person before becoming mentally ill but this is too much.

I.e. because he couldnt be bothered to find scotch tape for his car permit, so he used super glue. Permits renew every year... 

Or he refuses to use plates and chopping boards so he dirtys counters tops and tables with his food. Like chopping onion on the counter top and refusing to clean it etc. Because... dishes.

I don't know how much I can and should put up with. Is he pulling my leg or is this an actual thing I should try get him to see someone about?

Please help, I am really sorry if I said anything wrong. Its just out of fraustration but I really want to understand."
203,no matter how good things are getting I can't help but feel depressed and suicidal,"i just turned 18, I got a job I like and a bunch of cool friends and even met this super cool girl that I spent my birthday with last night, I'm going back to school and I have a plan for my future, things are really good considering what they were like before, but I still end up getting super depressed and wanna die at the end of the day and I'm just really sick of it I wanna be happy about all the cool things happening, but ultimately I'd rather just be dead, I think there's something wrong with me"
204,pls don't forget the professional help,"just a really important kindly reminder for those who suffer with depression and anxiety symptoms: please search for professional help such as psychological therapy and psychiatrist. sometimes we think the problem is the anxiety but it maybe just a symptom of something you have to look for deep into yourself... there are many syndromes that can be associated with that so... don't self medicate nor diagnose. ❣
it's better to treat the actual problem then to disguise the situation."
205,Can i have some advice,"Im sorry if this post is too long/short, i dont really post that much

im sorry this post most likely doesnt make sense because its late at night and im really happy at the moment

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment i am really doubting myself, if i am mentally ok.  


\[context\]

It all came down today, My and my family were watching television while eating pizza. Ceaser (the dog guy) came on, he started with an overly active big dog

\[what happened\]

my mom started talking about the dog, and eventually the dog my uncle came up, she said she has always found my uncles dog scary because he was unpredictable. i answered and said ''  he wasn't that bad I would say he was playful. I have experienced worse, but with my little sister I understand that you found it scary ''.

my stepdad reacted to that saying that i just should acknowledge her feeling, and that i was not really listening. this is a discussion we have had alot

&amp;#x200B;

to keep this short, the conclusion of the argument, that i never think emotionaly but always, idk if the word rational is the best word, logically, factually not thinking emotionally

&amp;#x200B;

i dont really know  what i am/what i need. i do feel like i have emotions, i have been \`\`diagnosed\`\` with an extremely high IQ what commenly makes EQ suffer (emotional smartness) i dont like the words  highly intelligent, i dont know what i am anymore if im sociapathic or a bad person overall

&amp;#x200B;

im sorry this post most likely doesnt make sense because its late at night and im really happy at the moment

thanks in advance"
206,I seriously don't know what to do with my life.,"I recently dropped out of college because it just didn't feel like me. I had no energy, I was miserable, and I was homesick. Now I'm on unemployment income, can't afford food for the rest of the month, and I'm afraid that's all I have in my life. I've been art blocked for 7 months and I don't think it's going away.

I thought I had a good plan. I was going to school to become an art teacher after New years but then I told my family, and they thought it was a dumb idea, which makes me think it's a dumb idea.

And now I'm so unsure. I can't go the academic way, that'd drive me insane, I can't take care of my chronic illness if I get a job in a factory. And now my plan is dumb. I want to apply for art school, but they only want contemporary art. I do surrealism and that's about 100 years too old.

With the current state of the world, I feel so unmotivated and uninspired. I can't think about a future now that the future of humanity is so uncertain. The only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is my boyfriend. He's having a hard time too. I'm trying to be happy for him and motivate him.

Honestly fuck all this."
207,I feel like I'm not entitled to go to therapy since the pandemic is putting a huge load on a lot of people who might need the help more than i do.,There are so many people who seem like they are suffering more than me. How can I get myself to look for a therapist?
208,I feel like I cant do this anymore,"I'm a college student and this is my first semester and im at home. Its so stressful at home and my parents don't understand the stress im under. They appreciate and applaud the work my older sibling does but they get mad at me for not doijg the chores at home when I have work to do. My eating disorder has gotten work and all I can think about is suicide. I dont want to live in this house anymore but I know they won't let me go to an apartment near my campus, despite the fact they let my older siblings go. I cant talk to my family about this cause they call me selfish and I feel like crap."
209,Therapy,"My psychologist keeps pushing this idea of ""parts"" of myself that have things to say and try to protect me. She has mentioned this last year too, where I have ""parts"" of me. I looked more into it and I think she was referring to alters, a concept relating to DID. I want to ask her more about it in the next session. I'm mostly just putting this on here because I have nobody else to speak about it. Having no social support apart from your psychologist and counsellors sucks lol. Well... most of it was my fault anyways. All of those self-sabotaging behaviours and isolating coping mechanisms served its purpose. I have isolated myself from getting hurt from everyone but in turn hurt myself more. 

Yada yada rant rant"
210,How do you do things,"I commonly find myself talking to people who feel similarly to how I feel, but there’s always one big difference between us; they can still function, so my question is how do you do things when you can barely get out of bed in the morning without someone else forcing you to get up, or even feed yourself without someone else telling/reminding you to eat. I feel like a unproductive, helpless, disorganized, lazy, useless, tired, worn out, stupid, worthless, pathetic, miserable, disappointment and I hate feeling so negative but it’s to painful and tiresome to feel any other way."
211,Feeling Purposeless,I feel like I have no hobbies or anything I really like to do and I’m just surviving instead of living. I wish I had a hobby or something that could help me enjoy life again. Any suggestions of hobbies that I could pick up that have worked for you? I am not able to do physical activities so none of those please. Any suggestions would be appreciated thanks.
212,Worried about my gfs niece.,So I recently moved in with my gf. Her niece is 23 and shares a room with her dad. She never goes out from the room only to use the toilet as they have a sink and tub on their side of the room. I can't imagine it's good for her overall mental health to stay shut inside 24/7.
213,Do you know if Mental Health professionals are overwhelmed with patients in this pandemic?,"Hello, 

This deep depression has become a part of me. It used to be a temporal thing. Now its just a part of who I am. I haven't searched for a mental health professional because I believe that they are overwhelmed with patients. I have no proof of this other than the articles I read online about how much the mental health crisis has increased during this pandemic. Do you guys have any idea how things stand? Are psychiatrists and psychologists overwhelmed with patients? Thank you."
214,I don't know how to move,"Heads up, I've both never used reddit beyond lurking before and I'm a little drunk so please excuse my utter lack of knowledge of how this wworksand thee unstructured ranty nature of this.  


Quick background, if it's useful for anyone: I'm a male in my mid-20s heterosexual, living in australia.

So I guess I'll start where I'm at now and add context, I'm depressed and have pretty bad anxiety wreck, I live with my dad and I've recently (ish) gotten over it enough to speak to people at shops, and can leave my house without having bad panic attacks but otherwise I struggle to hold conversation with people I don't know well when not intoxicated in one way or another, it's worse with women, I struggle to talk to eveen the women I feel close with, with the sole exception of my mum.  


About \~5 maybe 6 years ago I went to my doctor and was very adimmant I wouldn't talk to anybody, he reluctantly perscribed me some drug that was supposed to be both an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication, 1 week in and I ended up overdosing on about a 2 weeks supply at oncee, apparently I shat myself and pissed all over the floor, I was delirous for several days but eventually became lucid again, to this day I don't reeally know what happened but I've not spoken to dad about that since. Afteer this episode I went back to my doctor, finally feeeling like talking to someone would be the only way, he forwarded me to some kind of mental health expert, I'm not sure whether it was a psychologist or a therapist or what. In any case I had a very bad experience, they bought out things but I couldn't handle them and this causeed me to spiral out a bit, I lost maybee a year to pretty substantial drug and alcohol abuse after that, a lot of that year I don't really remember at all, I know I overdose on some kind of amphetamine at least once, but never went to the hospital and again eventually I sobered up and despitee a feew fragmented memories of wigging out I don't really know what happeneed, eventually I dropped the harder drugs (more from broken friendships, lost contacts and no money than an intentional decision) and began smoking marijuana and drinking instead, the weed stopped me from drinking too much because I'd just spew it back up so I at least have some memory of the time after, eventually though my tolerance grew that I could drink plenty without it mmattering, and eventually the weed slowed and I beegan drinking more and more, that continued up until this year and is still ramping up. I'vee been leaving the house more, but only to buy necessities + alcohol &amp; cigarettes, and I still struggle to talk to most people. When I first start leaving the house it felt like there was change like after a while I could talk to people and though it was hard and I tended to tremble in public when sober atleast I could work my wway through it, but that plateaud  and now I feel stuck.  


I've been wanting to post this for months, longer but it's takeen this long to write this up even on a throwaway account and even then I've had to drink just to force myself to say \*sommeething\* about it, even if it amounts to nothing.  


So I guess I don't know what to do, I wwant to change but I don't know how, I can't bring myself to go back to the doctor, to see another therapist or psychologist, bring myself to talk to my friends about this, even when I'm drunk it took such a long time to work up the couragee to speak to completee strangers even with anonimity. I try to eat healthy, I try to excercise and even things as simple as being in the sun more or drinking more wwater but at the end of the day nothiing seems to change and I can't help but go back to drinking all night and just pretending not to be hungover to dad. I've lost all my hopes of long-term plans, I don't even know what keeps me here apart from mmy fear that the accumulative brain-damage caused by my repeated half-assed attempts at suicide are making it harder and hardeer for me to live a normal life.  


I don't expect anyonee here has any answers for me, or eveen if they do that I would have the ability to accept them and follow through but I guess if nothing else then I've beeen able to get part of this out of my head so thanks for that I for whatever it's worth. Anyway, I should probably go to bed, it's getting light. Deepeending on how I'm feeling when I wake up I might comme back to this, but I don't know whether I could work myself up to do this twice."
215,I have a feeling my friends don’t trust me,"My best friend is 16 y/o and a female. I have been with her for six years. A few months ago she told me and a few other close friends she was raped when she was about 6 or 8 y/o in a refugee camp. She didn’t tell her family. Of course this shocked me. But we were all said that if she needs anything she can talk to us. An other friend and her talked on FaceTime and i was not there. I was not there for my best friend, i feel so bad. I wasn’t there when she needed me the most. I found out two days later that they talked. TWO DAYS. AM I STUPID. WHAT HOW COULD I NOT.... anyway..

A week ago she told us she found a video on her family friends phone where he was undressing her in her sleep. FUCKING DISGUSTING, SHE IS 16 AND SHE WAS ASLEEP. Again we were all shocked and helped her in anyway we could. She didn’t tell her family. She said she felt gross and said that maybe he thought she asked for it. SHE WAS REALLY THINKING THA-... of course we were all like wtf- in what way would he think that you wanted it. We told her she was not asking for it and she is not gross or disgusting, he is. We talked for a bit and she left to get some fresh air. After a few minutes she didn’t respond. We were all scared something happened because that man was still in her house. Later that same friend from before said that she messaged her and she is save.

Why didn’t she message me? Im i not her best friend anymore? Am i just a friend now? Is she still hung up about that i wasn’t there when she needed me? I feel like I’m being replaced a little bit. Maybe I’m just thinking about it to much. 

I don’t have a lot of friends and i love her so much and I couldn’t take it if she leaves me. We already lost friends because they hurt her and of course I chose her easily. If she would jump of a bridge so would I. But now I’m scared i’ll say something wrong and she’ll hate me. 

I hope she won’t leave me and get angry at me for being jealous.

One time 3 people had a secret among themselves and i wanted to know so i asked whats the secret? They said they cant tell me. I asked if it was about me. They said that i wouldn’t know the person. So why wont you tell me then? I felt left out. Turns out one of my friends sister had a boyfriend.... you couldn’t even trust me with that secret? What? I don’t even know her family.

I think I’m just to insecure but i feel like they think they don’t trust me.

(That friend that talked to her is also one of my best friends. And i love her too)"
216,Stressed,Lately ive been getting a lot of homework and ive been getting too stressed since i dont understand everything please i need hell in having less anxiety over it
217,My story.,"Hi. im u/Bubbleking01. ima 17yr boy. since 14 ive been struggling with my body (i always felt a bit fat compared to the others in the class or friends), or how i look, never feeling satisfied with how i look, and ultimately resulting in bad selv-image and confidence. all the kids would go down to the beach and swim, and i never felt comfy doing it because of how i looked. i was never the athletic type, sports never really interest me, other than badminton but that was mostly for the social aspect of it. through the ages 14-16 i hated how i looked and would complain and cry to my parents about how i look, and i always got the same answer ""then just do something about it"" which at the time was really frustrating to listen to, cuz i felt like they didnt understand and i really didnt think what they said helped. suddenly Corona came around and the start of the this year. i where i live all the schools were shut down and classes were virtual, so i would wake up, do my homework. and then lay in bed all day watching netflix(brooklyn 99 was my jam!) feeling sorry for myself, and just not doing anything. than our PE teacher gave us a challenge, to run as much as we could, and the winner would get a prize. so i thought to myself, ""hey imma do this, and imma fucking win"". now keep in mind that i was never in very good shape at least not in my opinion. so the next day before anyone had even started i went on a 5k run(not a good idea for the first time ;) ), when i came home i felt like trash, but i knew it was for a something good a bigger goal, not only the ""prize"" but ultimately for myself. so i ran every other day for the next week of quarantine, as people from my class found out how to cheat and get higher onthe scoreboard, i gave up. i didnt see a point if i was gonna lose. so i dipped again, into the netflix and the self-doubt. one day i thought ""what if after every episode of the netflix show i went down and di 20 push-ups"". so thats what i did. and i slowly built a tolerance and routine for it, but after a week or two i quickly got tired, and needed something new. so i ws scrolling through Tiktok, and saw this guy doing ""easy at home ab workout"" so i took a couple exercises from that, as my stomach was what i always hated, and i had a bit of a belly, still do! so i slowly put that ab workout things into the usual pushups. and i felt good, i did that up to the summer holiday, where i went to meet up with some friends on the beach, feeling pretty good about myself, i also did some training before i went down to the beach just to look a little more puffed up and buff. so i met with my friends, who i felt comfortable with. we hung out played some football on the beach, had a good time. then one of them says a couple of other people from the year were also coming down to join in. this is when my anxiety kicked in bout my look and how i look. they came down at to beach, and one of the girls i am really close with, we are really good friends, and she told me afterwards how shocked people were seeing me, i usually always wear big t shirts, cuz of my stomach. so they were shocked to see my and what i look like, i had lost weight, both from the running, basketball which i played with friends and the pushups etc. i look pretty good and that point. and since that the pushups and basketball, have evolved into a  **Calisthenics** routine, and better food. 

and now i am happy with my body, i know it was a bit of a jump, but whatever you are struggling with

i know it sounds dumb but ""do something about it!"" and it does get better. if it has for me, i will for you. trust me

&amp;#x200B;

This was my story...."
218,Feeling completely lost,"Im really trying hard I'm giving my best to everything I'm doing. But haven't seen any rewards or outcomes. Both in my professional and personal life. 
The one whom I loved the most more than myself has completely lost interest in me and started avoiding me. I totally suck at making friends. I hardly have friends and they have made up their own lives and have no time in spending time with me. 
Im trying to give my 200 percent best in my career but my bad... repaired my laptop and now im in a circumstance where affording a new one is so challenging due to financial crises
Im trying to stay positive but at the same time I'm feeling I have failed in everything.
Feeling empty and full at the same time."
219,when will my parents help me,"i f16 have been struggling with mental illness since i was 11. all i remember is getting diagnosed at 11 and my doctor recommended medication and my mom said no. then at the same age my mom thought my depression was due to a thyroid issue as i had just started puberty. she took me to get blood work done and the place was closed and she never went back. that was the last time she had ever tried to help.

i think my parents are in denial, still. my mom also struggles with mental health which is why i also dont understand why they wont help me. my dad ""doesnt believe in mental illness"" despite having diagnosed anxiety. my mom also has diagnosed depression and ptsd.

i have a lot of issues and i need therapy, ive known this for a long time. but mental health really isnt a discussion in my house, even though my mom says i can tell her anything i feel like she always dismisses it bc her problems are worse than mine in her eyes. the times i do end up opening up nothing gets done. my mom told me she would ask my doctor about anxiety meds over 2 years ago and still hasnt. my mom told me she would try to get me into therapy way over a year ago after i had the longest depressive episode of my life and the most she did was call one place in summer 2019, and they never called her back.

it's like they just ignore the obvious signs when im in a depressive episode and they even make fun of it. my mom ignores it until she feels bad for me after ive not left my bed and barely eaten in days. but she never does anything to help me. my dad will just make jokes about how i sleep all day or how i never get up. and when my legs or back hurt from barely moving in days he'll guilt trip me about it because it's  ""my fault."" one day when i was in 7th grade i had the worst panic attack of my life and i passed out and 2 days later my mom was joking about it at the dinner table.

i wish they would just help me."
220,We finally got a house!,"I have an 18 month old and we are currently in very run down supported accommodation. During my pregnancy I was homeless.

Have been dying to get out of this supported accommodation for as long as I've been here, there's just issues after issues. Before I got pregnant I lived with my mum and my brother, the household was very abusive and as a result shouting and screaming makes my brain shut down. The neighbors are constantly screaming at eachother like they're all being murdered and this makes my day to day life very difficult, especially trying to be in the right frame of mind for my baby. 

Today I got a call saying I'm being offered a house and it's made me the happiest I've been in a very long time! It's probably going to take a while to get everything sorted so I can move in but I'm just so happy to be able to start over c: 
I have no idea what my new neighbors will be like but from what it looks like on Google maps it seems like a quiet residential area"

223,I think I saw a dead man today,"I pulled up to the gas station to get a drink and saw him lying on the ground with his shoe off and his foot bleeding. He caught my attention because he looked really bad. I yelled to try and get his attention and see if he needed any water or something from inside and he didn’t respond. I moved closer to him and saw he had flies all over him. I got a bad feeling and went inside to ask the cashier. She said people had been telling her about him all day but we went inside this morning and bought alcohol and she thought he was just passed out drunk. He had apparently been in the same spot for a the entire day and hadn’t moved. I went back outside and around the building to where he was and tried to get his attention again and saw he already had a hospital band on his arm. He was bleeding and not moving at all and completely unresponsive. I called 911 and told him and they told me to try and get his attention so at this point I’m screaming SIR? ARE YOU OKAY? And I get no response. At one point I saw his hand twitch but that was it. I told them he didn’t appear to be breathing, if he was it was very shallow, and he had flies on him and hadn’t moved all day. She said that someone was coming immediately. She got my name and number and told me to go home. I’m hoping the hand twitch meant something but I don’t know. I just had a bad feeling. My city has passed out people on the streets and stuff pretty frequently but this was different. I hope he’s not dead and just passed out but I don’t know I’ve never seen anyone just passed out like that and the flies? Idk.

My best friend was murdered 4 years ago today. I was on the search team that found them. It was fucking horrible and today was already hard enough and then this? I hope the man is okay and not dead just passed out but it was just such a flashback to this day four years ago and now I just feel numb. I have made it through the multiple stages of grief and no long suffer from extreme PTSD symptoms but this was a lot. And I’m trying not to make this about me, this is about the man lying on the ground unresponsive, but damn."

Found this good video on the influence of diet on mental health, especially depression. It's very interesting how our gut health has such a big impact on our mental state - most of our serotonin being stored in the gut.  

Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation improved mental health in some studies :

Also deficiencies in Omega 3 Fatty Acids could lead to mental health imbalances, so increase omega 3 intake. Magnesium and Vitamin D also seem to have a role in mental health.

225,I hate people (I think? I used to say this as a joke but now I'm worried it's true).,"I hate people. They want me to go and tell them how I feel and they tell me that im not alone, cool. But, when you tell them these problems they naturally start giving advice. When they give this advice they're shocked to find out that that advice doesn't help, in fact, every piece of advice I've been given has been stuff I've already thought about, and no, I'm not trying to act smart. Then they regret even trying to help me, did they really try tho?, and so they get frustrated when I'm the one who's frustrated over you thinking you could magically fix my issues. You don't really listen either, I didn't want you to tell me what to do in the first place and I never look forward to hearing your false hopes, so don't get mad at me for not being grateful. 

Grateful for what exactly? Waste of time? You're the one who wanted me to pipe up so I did. I already know what my problem is, I'm too busy stuck in my own head or how my parents put it ""You don't seem to care about anyone else"" and ""you act so selfish and hateful."" Thank you, I'll take that to my grave mixed in with all the other helpful anecdotes over the years. 

Hating people is a very new mindset for me, I used to never hate people, actually, I used to love people. Person makes mistake? Good, we all make mistakes; that means that person will learn from it and it also makes me, a very imperfect person, look better too. No, not anymore. I have less and less tolerance for it, especially from myself. 

When people hear you say you hate people they suspect you're some kind of narcissist. Not even close, I hate myself more than anyone and everyone from anywhere around the world no matter what time in history. People say they want to live in another person's shoes, I want someone to live in mine. Not as in my life sucks but because they would do better with it and would enjoy it more. I've wasted my life as an educated suburban, white, male, cisgendered, straight person. You'd think with all of this privilege that I would atleast have something to my name. At the end of the day, I'm ignore, accused of being something I'm not like an Incel or some shit, taken advantage of, and then I'm by myself all alone doing nothing but pathetically scrolling through Reddit. 

I have my parents though! I can't be alone if I have parents in the same household! Yay! Yknow strangely enough my dad reminds me of his and my mom's mortality a whole lot more than I would've liked. It's cool though, they seem to already see me as an uncaring person so why should it matter? Why should it matter that I'm 17 and hate thinking about the future much less tomorrow. There's no reason for me to still be here besides the possibility of an unsuccessful suicide attempt which will just make life even more unbearable. ""Oh, b-but dude, do you know about all these other people with worse problems than you? You should really stop being so self-centered."" It's crazy to think that I still love the idea of having a soul mate even though I won't have one. ""But what does a 17 year old know?"" Stop, stop giving me false hope. 

Out of everything I mentioned, false hope has to be the most painful for me because its like I failed at getting something that wasn't even there. No, more like failed at getting a stupid fucking carrot on a stick that you keep dangling in front of me and when I try to get it it slips out of my grasp as you yank away from me. In the future that carrot will still be there taunting me. Seriously, how can I go back to all of those motivational quotes and say they were wrong after the fact? Wouldn't matter anyway I guess. I just hate people, I hate your positive messages like ""its going to get better"" when it won't, atleast not for some. Idk maybe if you're lucky, but when I call out on your bs other people come in and tell me how toxic I am or how cringey my reply was and how repulsed you are by me. 

First of all, you could never treat me worse than the way I treat myself. Second, I have nothing to complain about, I don't understand why the fuck I'm angry and no I'm not about to self-diagnose myself as being depressed or whatever because I'm not. I'm just fucked up. 

I've said my peace now please leave me alone so I don't have to go through another scary episode. That's right, I'm scared. Yeah, I'm a worthless whiny bitch, I get it. Even more reason to just let me be. This isn't towards anyone here, you all are just fine. This is for my school, for ignorant adults and for people who can't comprehend how having friends, fun, and a life isn't a given. Thank you taking the time to read this long ass message. I think I'm going to sleep now lmao."
226,Are humans still psychologically adaptable into their 20s?,"So, I was a mute child because I hid away from people mostly throughout my teenage years. I never spoke. 

I'm 17 right now, so can I train my brain to become fluent at speaking, like really well? Or is the muscle in my brain fixed?"
227,"Does anyone else experience a very odd state of mind when you suddenly feel hyper-conscious of everything around you and what you are doing? It's very hard to explain, it's sort of like dissociation, but you're feeling like did the last few hours/days/weeks really happen? And then you snap out of it","You snap out of it after a few hours. It's almost like a dissociative episode, maybe it actually is. I don't know for sure."
228,Depression is MASSIVELY underestimated,"The fact that depression is considered the ""common cold of mental illnesses"" is a problem.  The fact that people can just shrug it off when they hear that their friend is depressed is a problem.  The fact that (some) healthcare providers just nonchalantly prescribe SSRIs for depression without delving deep into their patient's psyche, memories, motivations and desires is a problem.

In my opinion, **depression is the worst possible thing that can happen to someone**.  Being diagnosed with terminal cancer, contracting AIDS, even losing all of your limbs for whatever reason are all better fates that depression because **while afflicted with those conditions, you still have the possibility of experiencing positive emotional states**.  **When you're truly depressed, there is no chance of feeling anything meaningful, joyful or good, and that is a fate worse than death.**  Of course, those conditions suck ass and increase the likelihood of developing depression.  Regardless, I don't think the majority of people can comprehend the sheer magnitude of the disease, and the profound changes that depression induces in one's experience of life."
229,"I always feel watched and I have weird habits, I'm scared of telling anyone beacuse I don't wanna be judged","So I always feel watched. It's hard to explain, but every time I meet someone new like a teacher, friend or counselor at school for example, but also strangers. I feel like they're watching me, and I get these voices kind of saying rude things about me and saying I'm worthless, but they say it as if they were that person. I'm 16 female. And I've had this going for a few years but I haven't told anyone cuz I don't wanna be judged. I used to go to therapy but I thought she hated me, beacuse that's what I always feel. I'm very restless and I can't sit still for long or I'll get nervous. I'm also always tense and looking behind my back. If there's just a towel or something I'll jump beacuse I feel watched. I also have this stupid thing where I feel I have to sort everything in 2 and 5. And it has to be symmetrical, like if I touch my hair with my left hand I have to do it with my right hand too, if not I get shaky and I can't focus. Is there something wrong with me or is this all normal? I'm also not very social and don't like physical contact like hugs etc. I can elaborte if anyone has questions, I just really need advice"
230,First video psych appointment with new psych - what to expect?,"I've handled my anxiety disorder really well for years but I experienced my first ever 'mental break' at work two weeks ago.

231,alone in such a big world,"I am clean for 7 months of morphine, alprazolam, ritalin, but I am thinking of going back, I feel bad, alone, I can be in a room full of people, yet it seems that there is something separating us, before I was clean I spent the day well, I wasn't thinking about dating and stuff, I was busy stealing to buy drugs, my libido was inflamed by drugs, but she came back and this sucks, but I want to have sex, I'm thinking of using it again, at least I'll be fine, of course it has its bad side, you get sore by the needles this is really bad but at least i will not be alone in such a big world."
232,Anxiety and mental health,"Anxiety is real and it's hard it's tough and people will say
 'we all have anxiety grow a pair'
Or something similar and think that is helpful.
Friends may say they understand but how can they and do they actually understand. 
People often think it's an excuse for an action, but actually when you say it's anxiety that makes you act a certain way an understanding friend or human should listen and want to listen.
The fact is people are selfish and think about themselves. so remember your happiness comes first. If you don't want to do something because your anxious it's ok not too.
Don't be pressured don't bottle it up and never be silent. HOPE who ever reads this has a superb day and do 1 thing that makes you happy even if it is scratching your arse. 🤞👍😋"
233,Just venting I guess,"Why does everything have to get worse before it gets better? I recently moved across the country to get away from my bf using what little money I had, and now it's impossible to get a job. Nowhere is hiring. More specifically, not hiring me. I've applied to over 100 jobs in the last month, I've never been fired or anything bad like that. I was able to get a small job and made about $400 until they let me go because I couldn't keep up with the physical requirements. I tried filing for unemployment but I don't qualify. My car will be repossessed unless I get a job soon and I'm freaking out. If I lose my car idk what I'll do. I apply to something new everyday and I've been working on art to sell but no one is interested. I've also tried door dash but in this area I basically just earn gas money"
234,Attachment issues,"Apologies in advance, first ever post and I’m on mobile
From Canada btw

So I have a bit of an issue, I don’t really understand it but I think it could be called attachment issues or abandonment issues maybe? 
Anyways some context:
I (18m) have a best friend (19f) she’s pretty much my only friend and we hang out often. Sometimes daily. That’s not the issue, the issue is that whenever we make plans and something on her end comes up where she has to cancel, my brain has a mini freak out and basically goes through the stages of grief. I get really sad and try to reschedule but sometimes it just doesn’t work out for about a week. I don’t really understand why I get so sad and moody about it, does anyone have some advice?"
235,am i depressed?,"i just kinda need to post this somewhere and i need another opinion, so if you have a minute i'd appreciate it :)

(writing this on a phone, also excuse my english) 

i'm f16, second yeah of high school. i've been feeling really down for the past year or so. not just down, sometimes really fucking sad or straight up empty.
i'm always so tired emotionally and physically. my legs hurt for some reason all the time??
i experience slight mood swings occasionally.

sometimes i just wanna isolate and ignore everyone.
i can't focus, i can't study, i can't fully relax. as a smaller child i was relatively smart, now i feel like i can't do basic math. it takes me long time to even get out of bed, or do basic tasks. i'm really fucking insecure about everything and i always worry. 

i feel like i'm a bit anxious. i can't function in large groups of people, it's too overwhelming.

my friends know about this, some of them say i am depressed, but we're all 16 year olds with no psychological degree haha. my parents don't know about my mental state because i'm worried they wouldn't understand. last december i cried every fucking day for like 2 or 3 weeks. mom noticed that, and she was there for me. few months later it was sunday, round 8 pm and i was playing mc. she said that i should be studying and if i get an f that she wouldn't comfort me like she did in december. so i gave up on the idea of telling her all this.

i'm not suicidal tho. i don't particularly want to exist rn, but i don't want to kms.

oh and my memory fucking sucks. it used to be so good (at least i think?) and now it takes me ages to remember stuff.

my eating habits are shit. sometimes i eat just a meal a day, sometimes i overeat. and i don't workout (covid and shit, but i also fucking hate working out, covid is just an excuse tbh) 

also, maybe worth mentioning, i have aphantasia.

i don't wanna self diagnose, and i don't feel like i'm incapable of being happy or something, but i fell like i'm getting worse.

anyone got any advices because i can't be like this anymore, but at the same time i can't really find a way out."
236,I guess that I just wanna rant,"My boyfriend told me about Mike the heroin addict who fought and recivered against it and got better and made something of his life and did better than he ever probably even thought that he could be. Unfortantly unlike Mike the heroin addict, I ain't got much to fight for in that aspect, I have no fucking future, I will never have a proper job or friends or a life, never do half the things that I want or ever even wanted to do, I'll never make it to who I want to be, dreams are reserved for sleeping and even then it's just nothing anyway, I feel like all I am is a drain on everybody around me, like a weird little leech that can't even latch on properly through such Catholic guilt over nothing at all. I am nothing. I am noone and that's all I will ever be. And you are better off without me. You all are.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not going to do anything stupid, I'll stay alive, I always will cause I know that some others need me, but then at the same time obvs I guess that I just kinda needed to vent.

Who am I really? What? What am I worth?

I'm an anxiety ridden agoraphobic with major depression, ptsd, an unhealthy fear of medical and mental health professionals, anorexic with arfid and extreme anxiety about eating, I'm an ex drug addict and minor alcoholic, I have bpd, can't control my emotions properly let alone understand and express them well, the things that I want to be good at, my dreams and all, I'm shit at. Where do I go? I have severe severe ocd because of the stress it has now flared up as well, what am I doing? Barely sleeping and when I do its all at fucking odd times. 

I feel like I am already living in palliative care, cause no one's body can survive this forever right?

How do I get out, where do I go? How, when will I finally see the light again?

Cause everything seems a funny colour in here.

I'm already paranoid and suspicious, I feel like people are only doing things to spite me or mock me or demean me, I hate it, I hate this and I hate me. 

Thank you."
237,What exactly is disassociating and how do you know if you disassociate?,Is it like psychosis or completely different?
238,Constantly afraid of being arrested,"I tried explaining this (except for the part I specifically said I didn't tell her) to my mental health worker and she didn't seem to know what my problem was. She just told me that I was catastrophizing and should increase my antidepressant. I feel like I'm going insane and no one is going to help me. I'm so stressed out all of the time. 

Here's the situation. I have several small pets and sometimes one of them will have an empty water bowl or a piece of poop on the floor. I try to refill and clean them ASAP but sometimes life gets in the way and it takes me a few hours to get around to it. I keep my pets in a room that's visible from front door. I'm scared that someone look through my front door when I answer it, see a water bowl that's empty or see a cage with some poop in it and report me to animal control. Animal control will seize all of my pets and euthanize them. Then the police will arrive and arrest me for neglecting them. 

I've been having vivid daydreams about killing myself. In one I'm standing in my kitchen and cutting into my arm from elbow to wrist with a steak knife. In the other I'm sitting on my bed with my eyes closed and a pistol in my mouth. I haven't told my mental health worker because I'm afraid she's going to think I'm actively suicidal, call the cops and they'll see the empty bowls or poop. Then I'll get arrested after my trip to the psych ward. 

I have a young daughter who throws toys everywhere. I'm afraid that someone will see how messy my house is through the front door and call CPS. I'm afraid CPS will see an empty pet bowl or poop and call animal control on me. What is wrong with me? This fear started out as an occasional what if thought (I have what if thoughts about random stuff all day every day) and it has turned into something I'm afraid of every single day of my life. What the hell is wrong with me?"
239,Why does upholding social contacts feel like such a burden too me?,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I wasn’t ever a ‘social butterfly’, don’t feel like I ever had friends or people who liked me besides members of my family. And that’s literally my only goal in life. To have a friend, to be happy.

But recently I noticed this pattern if one wanted to call it that. I’m really bad at upholding social relationships. Even if it’s just calling another person or texting them because I want to ask them how they are, I won’t do it. I won’t take the first step, so in most cases I just do nothing. Even if they are family members. It’s so, so hard to actually text back or call them. 

Example: My cousin has moved to the region I live in and has expressed interest in meeting up once in a while. He’s great and I like him a lot and want to meet him but... he’s not like me, he’s busy, he has friends, a girlfriend and we don’t have any particular ‘bond’, we only see each other a few times a year, so we aren’t exactly close.

Maybe I should reach out to him but can’t bring myself to even ask him over text. Because I feel like a nuisance. And I don’t know how to talk to people. I’m just awkward and always second guessing everything I think or say. It doesn’t feel right. And it’s exhausting and draining.

I know I’m pushing people away with this and I know I am a terrible person but everything social is always so overwhelming to me. Like all other people are moving at twice my speed and I cannot possibly keep up. Maybe it’s because I’m a boring person. I don’t have cool hobbies, I can’t tell jokes, I hurt people’s feelings easily without even knowing I did, I’m not particularly smart either and know nothing about how the world works. 
And I won’t take action until someone pushes me. 

I don’t know why staying in contact with people is so hard for me. I don’t mean to ghost anyone. I care about other people and their feelings. Or at least I choose to think so. I would like to not be that person. I would like to be able to talk to people how others do. It seems so easy for them, while I seem to avoid having to interact with other people for as long as people. 

But maybe it’s better that way. All people I know have their own social circle. They would be fine even I didn’t exist. Maybe they would be even better off. Without me making things awkward and not texting back. 

..... 
that’s it, thank you for reading:) Sorry for the self loathing and whiny-ness. Just needed to vent. First time I was able to actually write this down, maybe that will help? :/"
240,I Just Got Booked for my First Psych Appt.!,"Ive been really struggling w my mental for 3 years at this point, ive been able to stave it off but I turned 18 this year and ive been getting crushed by my anxiety/depression. I finally told my parents about it (who I thought would shun me bc of them being extremely conservative) but my mom just booked me an appointment for next week! Im both excited and a bit worried, Ive wanted to go for a while but like i saod ive always been scared to let anyone know about my struggles. I hope it goes well."
241,I am planning to go to psychiatrist and I am scared,"My state is getting much worse last couple of weeks so I decided to seek medical help again but I am realy scared because if doctor will tell me that I am healthy, I will lose all my hope. I know this probably wont happen but I am just realy scared for some reason. Is this happening to anyone else?"
242,How do I build self esteem?,"I suffer with depression, anxiety and ADHD. I have a very low view of myself, to the point where I can't really name anything I truly like about myself (whether that be physical appearance or personality). 

Whenever I try to come up with something I don't hate about myself, my brain always tells me I'm being full of myself. When I try to be positive, my brain tells me I'm being cheesy. When somebody tells me they're proud of me, my brain tells me they're patronizing me. My gut reactions always keep me in such a negative place.

It feels impossible for me to ever not hate myself, but I have to try. I'm miserable."
243,Shoulder injury,"[Discussion] shoulder injury

Shoulder injury

I don’t really know where to start I’ve just been feeling down about an injury I have to my shoulder and thought writing down some of what I’ve been going through might help a bit. Last year I had been going to physio all year cause my shoulder was bothering me it kind of helped but my shoulder wasn’t healing up so after about 8 months of physio I decided to rest and get an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed that I had inflammation in my ac joint and my doctor recommended I get a cortisone shot. Fast forward a month the cortisone shot didn’t help and I felt quite annoyed because I couldn’t play basketball properly (I was looking to walk on to my university bball team) or do any kind of working out with my upper body. At this point I’ve basically lost all the muscle I had in my upper body which took a toll on my self esteem especially since it was summer and I was now 6 foot 2 and only 160 pounds. I went to my doctor again and requested an mri. It ended up taking about 3 and a half months to get my mri because Canada has ridiculous wait times. This was another 3 and a half months of not being able to do much in terms of activity with my upper body which is quite saddening for me. About a week ago I got these mri results back and it says I have suspected partial separation of my labrum and now have to go for another mri arthrogram to accurately asses my injury. My doctor is going to get back to me within the next week on the wait time for this mri but I just feel very down because this now most likely means that I have to wait even longer just to get a proper diagnosis. I know my problem is very minor compared to a lot of people out there but I was just feeling quite sad so I decided to write this."
244,"Fear of bees and wasps disable me from taking walks outside and hiking. How do I stop it from paralyzing me? How do I go out there and walk, hike and be outdoors?","I don’t know if it’s a phobia. Nothing traumatic happened to me with them. When I was a kid I was chased by a bee when I had an icee on my hand but that’s about it.

In my 20 years of life I was stung twice by a honeybee by it flying into my shirt. They just came out of nowhere, flew inside my shirt and stung me.

In my home country I never saw wasps but here in the United States there’s lots of wasps and I’m very scared to the point I only check my mailbox at night because I feel like they’re less active at night. I have progressively stopped hiking trails and I don’t like walking outside."
245,As i slowly understand my current mental state ive also realized that explaining or asking for help to the wrong people can be extremely dangerous.,"Without having to say much ive realized that my parents and pretty much the majority of people in my life dont understand or are willing to acknowledge my condition and when they end up offering help things can end up getting worse. Giving someone pity can sometimes insult them or make them feel less of a person and due to this trust and accountability isnt entrusted to you. Which is why i personally recommend to sometimes keep things to yourself and only explain to them in a very simple manner that all you need is privacy, distance and time in hopes that they understand. Hope this helps some of y'all."
246,Any tips to alleviate boredom in the psych ward / psych hospital?,"I’m in the psych ward and ready to blow my brains out from boredom. I’m trying to spend 23 hrs, 50 min of the day doing anythingggggg I can while locked up. The only scheduled time is 10 min with the doctor.

I’ve been through this before so I know I can occupy time on my phone, reading, writing, drawing, word searches.... I’m thinking maybe TV on my phone but not sure the battery can handle that and of course the charging cords are with the nurses.

Anything else? There isn’t much patient interaction due to COVID. And I’m not super interested in sitting alone in the common area hoping somebody will eventually come up and say hi.

I’m on constant observation at the moment and it’s making it harder. It feels weird doing anything with a person sitting by the door watching me."
247,"My anxiety is literally robbing me of my life, and the loneliness and sense of failure eats at me every day. My recovery is starting slowly, I think I'm on the right path!","I apologize if this seems all over the place. There's just a lot of shit in my head and quite frankly, I don't ever talk about this stuff except with one person so I don't know how to properly express it without it being all over the place yet. 

I have been extremely lonely my entire life and have a lot of emotional trauma from my childhood. Thankfully I was never physically or sexually harmed but the neglect has absolutely taken it's toll on me. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get along well with kids at school through middle school, but at high school my life improved but once it ended my life really just fell off a cliff.

I wanted a more supportive environment, so I finally moved out of my home to live with my partner at 19 and it's now a little over a year later. In terms of personal freedom and my ability to just breathe and be myself, it is the best thing I have ever done.  But holy shit, economically, it is probably going to be the worst decision I've ever made in my life. I am currently paying for vision therapy on top of rent and college to solve some longstanding issues I had no idea were even related to my eyes and I'll be done with that in March 2021. I really need mental health help NOW, but I can't afford it, straight up. I can't stop this therapy and prioritize mental health either, because if I do that, then my eye condition can actually get worse. Thankfully, the eye condition is very related to the anxiety so it should help quite a bit. Strange, huh? Amazing how everything in our bodies all works together and coordinates.

Anyways, so... what do I deal with now that I'm on my own? Every single day I worry. I feel lifeless. I've had shit self esteem for a long time, I recently found a paragraph I wrote about myself when I was 11 that was seriously disturbing for someone that age to say (the feelings of worthlessness are unbelievable for an 11 year old to say. Even I was shocked at myself for writing such a thing about myself).  I go on my phone or computer the entire day, if I don't, racing thoughts come at me like absolute wildfire and I soon find myself checking online to find the answers. I have absolutely no substance or anything without computers in my life. I want to get away, but the anxiety is just fucking murderous. This kind of behavior makes my emotions kind of cycle, though admittedly, my emotional health has taken a fat shit and I barely even feel anything anymore. I feel a weird separation, in addition to the eye coordination issues that kinda exacerbate this (everything looks flat bc my 3d vision isn't that good), I almost feel like I'm watching my life as opposed to occupying the space in my own body. It's like watching my life come out on a tv screen. I operate like a robot and say whatever is best for the person I am currently speaking to. I feel like I don't even know myself anymore everything just feels BAD. I don't know what I am or what I've turned myself into trying to take the easy route with my anxiety / difficulty socializing. It hurts a lot. 

I have no long term goals (which I'm sure is a huge %age of my problems) other than I want to get better at cooking and I want to stop feeling weak. I'm an accounting major and I seriously don't give a shit, I work at Best Buy at the Geek Squad and I really do enjoy helping people there. I would much rather pursue a career in IT using the customer service skills I've learned here (after some certifications) after  I've signed up for a gym and started to do some basic lifts, bodyweight stuff, and cycling, and man I feel AWESOME after a workout, I just really need to work on my diet to make it count and cut the shit foods out! 

I feel like I'm finally going in the right direction. I am now attempting to eat better, I know it won't be perfect from the word go, same with my experiences at the gym. My eye therapy is about a month in, and I have 5 more to go. The other day, I did an exercise there and for about a minute afterwards, I felt completely normal, it felt more like I was present in the room. It was the strangest sensation... but if this is what this therapy is going to cause then I'm super excited what I'll be like at the end of this! I'm a little confused on what to do with the socialization thing, I get along well with people, but I am terrified of trying to take friendships further than what is kinda automatic (think, people at school and work that you wouldn't otherwise see outside without extra effort). My super ridiculous anxiety is also an issue, and it makes it hard day to day to stick to trying to better myself because I just feel a constant push to check and check and go online to find answers and get reassurance. 

I just wanted to make this post to vent, not really ask for anything. I know I need to get mental health help but I just flat out cannot afford it right now, especially with the extra expense of my vision therapy until March. I will definitely be trying to find someone as soon as I am completely healed from my eye coordination problems. It's really hard being in charge of myself while at odds with this anxiety, but I WILL win, I am not letting this thing steal my life and youth from me any more."
248,I'm 22 and I don't feel like my age? I don't feel like im ready for ANYTHING,"I'm 22 and im terrified of getting a job and becoming independent. I don't even have my license. I have awful anxiety and depression that keeo me from just DOING what I want. I hate leaving the house snd I hate doing anything related to the work force, like applying or interviewing for jobs. If I could just lay at home and focus on myself for the rest of my life, I would. I don't have any real focus right now and COVID definitely messed me up mentally when everything's started. But I also don't know how to handle my emotions. I get extremely heartbroken and depressed even if a simple plan changes so I definitely don't think I'm capable of handling stress of a job or my own place. At least not right now. But idk when of if I'll every be ready. 

I feel like such a disappointment to my parents. My brother is literally studying to be a doctor and I just like to sit at home, eat unhealthy food (I also suffer from binge eating) and watch anime or cartoons or YouTube.

250,How do I help my friend,"So to summarize I have a friend who suffers from manic depression and recently something happened to him that hurt him so bad that he to try to drink himself to death. Luckily hes fine now. He said he doesnt want to tell me all about what happened which im fine with but I do know that part of it has to do with a girl who broke his heart. He even started smoking cigarettes' which he quit like 3 months ago. I brought it up to him and he said ""Not anymore with what i'm going through."" Me and him went to the gym yesterday and we talked and laughed like normal but I could tell that he was still off. He would zone out alot and just stares off into the distance. Ive been reaching out to him to go to the gym because I know its good help that person get out the house sometime. I've told him that I'm there for him and that i'm here if he needs me even if its just to talk or help get his mind off of it but I feel like theres more I can do for him. Any help is appreciated, I'm really worried for my friend"
251,My girlfriend,"My girlfriends going through a bit of a tough time recently, she feels like her friends don’t want her, and she has no one, how can I help her? I want to be there for her"
252,My inability to open up to new people is screwing me over,"Does anyone have any tips on how to be less quiet and reserved? I have a very low self esteem as a result of bullying (about my appearance) by my old friendship group and as a result I’m incredibly reserved and have developed symptoms of social anxiety disorder which I have been displaying for probably two years now. 

A year ago I moved to a new area and so a new school and have struggled to make any friends. I’d sit in the corner of all of my classes and not interact with anyone. If the spotlight is on me, I feel like my appearance is being judged and I just want to hide away. I’ve started to sit with some people at lunch instead of sitting on my own but I struggle to be myself around them. I’m still really quiet and struggle socially which makes me think they’ll get bored of me and a potential friendship will just fizz out.

The issue is that I’m not actually a quiet person. Around my old friends I’d talk a lot, when I get home I end up talking constantly at my parents because I’ve bottled everything up in the day. I feel happy and energised after a social interaction which implies I’m an extrovert but the anxiety I experience before and within a conversation leads me to try and avoid them. 

TLDR; I’m trying to figure out how I can start being myself around others, does anyone have any tips?"
253,"Should I have stayed on the meds, or was I right for asking to change?","I tried my first antidepressant with fluoxetine (Prozac) (20mg) around three weeks ago and I decided to speak with my doctor on Tuesday about stopping them. I had severe side effects, to the point where I basically couldn’t function over the course of those two and a half weeks, but my doctor seemed really hesitant and said I was ‘giving up’ and they should have started to clear up soon. 

I was on the meds for extreme up and down mood swings, where I’d have spend a week extremely high, then a week extremely low (for more detail you can look in my post history). Within three days of getting in those meds my mood was straight up. Then down. Then up. I have been switching everyday or two ever since I’ve been on them, going from extremely out of it and up (to the point where people questioned if I was on drugs), then literally waking up the next day wanting to die. 

On top off all this I had issues with clumsiness, balance and spacial awareness, racing thoughts to the point I can’t think, zero concentration or motivation, severe constant dissociation (to the point where I couldn’t control my own body), extreme tiredness and the inability to stay away when tired (I’ve never napped in my life and now I can’t stop), not to mention problems with my memory where I’ve forgotten what I’ve just wrote or in the middle of a conversation or even sending 30+ audio messages and having no recollection of what I’ve sent. I’ve also experienced weakness, weird dreams, diarrhoea, dry mouth, unusual sweating, and generally feeling weak and lightheaded with headaches. Also extremely bad tremors in my hands and jaw whenever I got stressed/anxious/dissociated. Overall I had pretty much every side effect you can think of, on top of my crazy mood. 

I had a breakdown in collage Monday morning where I cried for three hours and had my first panic attack in months. All of my friends and mental health team at college were telling me I had to go back to the doctor - I was completely apathetic about everything, couldn’t do any work, and was consistently having breakdowns and severe dissociative episodes. I’ve never experienced suicidal ideation like it (and unfortunately relapsed last night with self harm after 7 months). 

My doctor was extremely hesitant to let me give up however. I don’t have a diagnosis, was not weaned on or off the meds, and he spoke as though I was pathetic for not being able to just push through it, saying the side effects should wear off after a week or two (despite being nearly at week three with them only getting worse). 

Half the people around me think I should have gone and my doctor is being unprofessional, but some people think I gave up too easy and should have just pushed through it. I honestly don’t know whether I was in the right or not by stopping. Am I being pathetic for not being able to take the expected side effects? I don’t have any answers and I don’t know what I should have done in that situation - I can’t stop rethinking that appointment."
254,I did my first EMDR session and I feel awesome!,"I had been struggling with processing a traumatic event I witnessed and my therapist recommended we try EMDR. I was having multiple anxiety attacks a day, not eating, unable to drive, wasn’t sleeping. I hadn’t been able to even talk about the event without crying. Well, today I had my very first EMDR session and talked through the entire event in a linear timeline (big deal for me because I bounce around), and never stopped. It just all came out. 

It was a weird sensation and I disassociated for a few minutes. But I feel so much overwhelming relief. 

Anyways, that was cool. I feel relaxed for the first time in months."

What is wrong with me?"
256,I hate it (lil shit me),"I hate it like idk these days I’m just doenfjenekdrmrntk and I hate the fact that I just over eat cause I just wanna go but can’t like 
Why couldn’t I be like the type that doesn’t want to eat like why the fuck do I need to gain a shit ton of weight and be fat than lose a shit ton without eating like if I die it would be a bonus but god please stop this circle
I just wake up eat and then I need to do my assignments for school I just start to eat again and then when I get anxiety of like panic or stess over something I eat again 
And the thing is I’m constantly stressed without doing anything so I eat again like my family their fights my parents they just stress me I even got white hair bro my mom even said wow you are just 17 and got like white hair like I can’t do anything about it I feel like puking cuz of the constant stress and then later I start eating any shit that is Infront of me

But I don’t have the motivation or energy to exercise or do my homework.

It’s like the only thing I can do is eating and scrolling though social media and just feeling empty until my mom comes and asks if I didn’t eat too much.
I wanted to lose weight too or get my life together and then lose weight but
Nothing works out...my mind makes me crazy sometimes I just want to punch anybody

Or just kill someone every human being on this earth gets on my nerve..(sorry not you guys on Reddit) but the ones I know or met."

258,I feel watched by people that don’t exist.,"Ever since I was little, I had an issue that caused me anxiety; that issue being that fictional characters would get stuck in my head and I would feel like they were watching and judging my thoughts and actions. The sad thing is, these characters can come from shows/movies/etc. that I enjoy. Why should the things I enjoy have to cause me (sometimes debilitating) anxiety? Sometimes I hate being awake because of this; I’d think things like “I would feel relief if I were able to go into a self-induced coma for a few months.” I’m on meds (Zoloft and Abilify), and my anxiety has been helped greatly by it, but this still bothers me on-and-off.

I know I should just block these people, but I just feel bad doing it.

On the opposite side of the abandonment issues coin is the “you’re not responsible for other people’s emotions.”

260,How do I get rid of ED as a young male?,"Before you go and report me, I can't post this on askmen and I don't know where else to post this. Sorry. 

So I'm a 21 year old male who is on two mood stabilizers, one anti depressant, one anti psychotic, and one blood pressure pill for my tremors. I think the anti depressant and the blood pressure pill are the same thing, I don't know anymore. 

Something in that combo is giving me ED, so I asked my therapist if there was something she could give me. She prescribed me cialis. 

So I took it last night to see how it'd work and, well, nothing happened. You have no idea how poorly that made me feel. I get that anti depressants and anti psychotics give men less sex drive, and I'm fairly certain it's the blood pressure pill that's causing this, but holy hell. I feel like shit.

Idk. I'm sorry if this was gross, I literally have nowhere else to post this afaik. Any advice would be great."
261,Scared of Hospitalization,"This is a side account, which is why it’s so new/empty

I tried to speak to a counselor today. I’m in college, and struggling immensely. (I’m in America, not sure if that explains anything.)

When I spoke to her though, she explained how she thought I should be hospitalized. I immediately panicked, and tried to explain to her that I’ve never been to a hospital and they honestly scare me. I tried to tell her I don’t have the time or money to stay at one either.

Then she explained to me that if I don’t willingly go with her, she’ll contact law enforcement and have them hospitalize me regardless. I’m scared of police too.

After I was panicking for a minute or two, she eventually proposed a ‘safety plan’ so I wouldn’t have to be hospitalized. Basically it involves me messaging her daily, or she’ll send somebody to me to make sure I’m okay and possibly hospitalize me.

I regret going for help. I’m more stressed and scared than i was before the meeting. Part of me is paranoid that I’m going to be hospitalized even if I do what she says. I wish I never tried to get help. 

Is there any advice? Anything I can/should do? This just made everything 10x worse"

Any tips please let me know.,"My boyfriend and I are trying to have a baby so I got off my medications for my depression and anxiety and took out my IUD. Since then I’ve been an emotional wreck. I’m crying all the time, never feel good enough/feeling worthless, super irritable, and I’m starting to feel anxious again. I don’t know what I should do to alleviate these feelings without the use of medications and I’m scared that it’s only going to get worse when I’m pregnant. I really don’t want to take any medications while I’m pregnant even if some aren’t as bad for pregnancy. I’m also afraid that if I’m already super depressed when I’m pregnant that postpartum it will be much worse due to hormonal changes as well. Thank you for any tips you may have."

I cannot afford to be alive at this point and I am living off £6k a year which is abismal.
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I had help with my CV from the careers advisor at university and I have 4 years of customer service experience.
I just really don't want to be alive anymore, I have money to live on and feel useless."
265,I didn’t relapse c:,"5 months since i last cut. i want to do bad right now but i won’t. for once i am proud of myself, but does anyone have any other alternatives to maybe help with the urges?"
266,My therapist wants permission to speak to my son's school psych.,"I didn't know where else to put this. I've been seeing a therapist for about a month now to treat my PTSD. Today she emails me asking to sign several release forms so she can speak with my medical doctors which makes total sense to me but added in the mix is a release of information request to speak to the public school psych about my son (6). Which makes no sense because the school psych is not currently seeing my son and my therapist is treating me not my kid. My son is literally doing fine in school. 

Yes I've mentioned how hard it is to single parent a kid sometimes in therapy but nothing that should be concerning for a counselor. Otherwise it feels like an egregious reach outside her purview. He's not her patient. What am I missing?"
267,Things just keep getting worse,"I try to keep a positive attitude and tell myself that eventually things will get better but I've had persistent depressive disorder since I was a child and honestly my life has been on a slow downward trajectory and today's just one of those days where I want to end it all.

I feel like thinking that things will get better is the same as thinking the grass will be greener on the other side. I thought high school would be better, then I thought university would be when things finally came together for me, then I thought money makes the world go round so maybe I just need to work full time. All these stages of my life have come with their own disappointments and problems. 

Everyone wants to think we have so much more control over our lives than we actually do. For mental health everyone just wants to go on about therapy and exercise and proper sleep and they just don't take you seriously when you say you've tried all that, or that you are actively doing that, they think you're either lying or doing something wrong, there's always something to critique. People always make it out to be like there's an easy solution to your problems, I still get asked if I wash my face because I have acne, like, yes, believe it or not I do wash my face everyday twice a day and have since I was eight, I've also tried thousands of dollars worth of face washes, toners, serums, creams, face masks, and even prescriptions both oral and topical. Sometimes we just have to admit that there is no known fix for our problems and sometimes we have to give up looking for one. It sucks, it's like admitting defeat but there's only so much time, money, and effort you can put into something before it consumes you.

Today it was work (ongoing theme) and my doctor (one of them) that made me feel like this. I was so happy to have started this job in March, decent pay, kind coworkers, and in my field, then we had a change in management and it honestly feels like they are trying to get us all to quit now. I applied for an office job, I was supposed to work at a set site, have my own private space to work out of that had decent ergonomics, benefits such as your own parking spot, a staff kitchen, and a staff washroom and the security of always having team members around and being able to kick unruly clients out of the office if they were becoming aggressive. Now, during the middle of the freaking pandemic, we've become outreach workers and spend half our time in shelters and soup kitchens. I'm a petite woman with RA (so I'm very weak) and I'm in the men's shelter, I wouldn't feel safe there even if I was perfectly healthy and covid didn't exist. I hate driving and suddenly a major part of my job is driving to all these different sites. There's no washroom for staff, no space to eat, no microwave, no fridge, no kettle or coffee maker, you don't have the authority to ask the men who get aggressive or don't wear masks to leave, you don't have the safety of having other staff around. It's scary enough when someone goes off at you in the office, now I'm expected to deal with this in a room removed from everyone else.

Since I have RA I identified early on that being expected to carry equipment around and sit in a folding chair for hours on end would be a problem for me. I asked if there was any way we could get a better chair in the space, not specifically for me, I might be in more pain than my coworkers if I don't have an ergonomic set up but folding chairs are hard on my coworkers too. When I was asked why I was asking for that I mentioned my RA and my new supervisor made a big deal out of it, said I'd have to get my doctor to fill out forms so that they could provide such an accommodation. HR sent me the forms and they don't really say anything about accommodations it's all about returning to work after an accident or injury, I mentioned this to them but they assured me that's the form I needed. I didn't think too much of it, I sort of worshiped my RA doctor, so knowledgeable, so nice, suffers from RA herself so she understands it, she had told me if there was anything I ever needed, whether that be medication or something for work, to just let her know, so while I hated that work was making a big deal out of getting a proper chair I thought my doctor would still help me. However, when I asked she started telling me about all this other paperwork she has to do and that she doesn't really feel comfortable filling out forms like this because it asks about how much you can lift and how long you can walk/sit/stand etc. and that's not something she measures or tests, she said she could probably write me a note but I'd asked HR about that and they insisted upon these forms. She said she'd send me for more tests and once she got those results would take a look at the papers to see what she could fill out. Now though I feel like an idiot because here I was going through this whole procedure, meeting with the supervisor, meeting with HR, booking off work for this appointment (and now these tests) and now it sounds like my doctor won't support me with this so I feel like I'm going to come across as a liar to my employer. I wish I had never brought any of this up because the moment I mentioned this situation to my doctor she went from warm, caring, and understanding to cold, dismissive, and almost demeaning. 

I don't understand why me trying to do something to lessen my pain and therefore make me more productive at work has to be such a big and difficult process. I just don't want to suffer more than I already am or further ruin my body or catch covid and die because my immune system is already compromised. Now I feel like I'm gong to have to suffer anyway and I've jeopardized my relationship with my doctor and employer.

All I've ever wanted from life is to be healthy and happy with a small place of my own a few close friends and some kids with a job that could support that sort of life and wasn't soul sucking. I was closer to achieving this as an infant than I am now."
268,I’m literally falling apart,Title says it. I just feel empty and unmotivated and so so tired. I’m tired. That is all. I see my goals slipping further and further away and I’m just not good enough
269,Stress Over School," I've built so much hate against school that when I even think about it I get so stressed the next day I get sick.

Whenever I don't get sick my EDS acts up and my joints start hurting so I can't move without being in indescribable amounts of pain. This COVID-19 shit is fucking up my life. At least last year I was able to make it to school and just go to the nurse. Now everythings fucked.

I honestly don't know what to do I spend more time having mental breakdowns about school than actually doing it then I have a mental breakdown about having a mental breakdown about missing school."
270,Anxiety,"I’m a man and occasionally I’ll feel horny when I get anxious, but I have to be like really stressed and anxious. Am I the only one, or is this just a thing that happens sometimes?"
271,If only you knew my wish,"I wished you could understand me 
I wished I can tell you about my mind and you understand me and undedstand how I feel 

Some days I'm happy like I'm on cloud 9 
Some days I go on binges; drinking smoking amd snorting new things to feel again 
Some days I can't even get out of bed to take shower and care for me 
Some days I cry with a heavy heart
Some days I just don't feel nothing 
Some days I don't even wanna be here anymore 
Some days I wanna scream and yell 
Some days I'm mad and angry at the world and god for the way I am 
Some days I just wanna have some control over my mind 
But mostly some days I dont even recognized myself 
Like I dont know who I am 

But I can't tell you that can i? 
I wanna scream and cry it out n tell you but I cant. As I know it isnt your fault you just wouldnt get it Hell who would i barly get it myself 

I told you I have a appointment and you tell me I don't need the pills but how can u tell me what I need when you dont know whats going on in my head I can't stop the thoughts ive had some close calls and almost vanished 

If anyone knew how bad it gets theyll call me crazy ive been called a liar and dramatic for trying to express it so I learned to keep it in but how long will that last 


I just wanna be normal 
I wanna be like other people 
I dont want the thoughts 
I dont want the feelings 
I dont want the dark nights and long days 

I'm tierd of using other stuff to either forget or to feel something 
 I just wished you could understand me and be there for me but you can't becouse you don't understand or been in the situation. its why you ask why I'm acting funny and ask why I have to get on the pills again. You think I'm switching up on you but I'm not 

If only you knew what actully goes on deep inside me  
Kinda funny becouse if you ask people who knows me im the happiest person in the room amd the funniest 
Thats because I make it a mission to make everyone smile at least once and laugh thats because I know what can actully happen behind close doors amd when your alone amd how people dont smile as much as they should 
Or maybe its because I wanna hide my hurt or maybe I'm just a nice person 

I just wished you could understand..."
272,Is this trauma? Or am i just weird,"So...idk why i felt the need to tell strangers about it but maybe people have words of advice or anything really...
To put it frankly me and my friends would preform foreplay on eachother in the 3rd grade. 
This all started when i moved from california to Washington state for about a year, it was my first time experiencing a move as a little girl and i was scared and exited all at the same time. Me and my old brother were inrolled in a new elementary school that spring and it was their where i met a group of girls in my class. I kindve remember their names..but just for privacy reasons i wont put them. Their was 4 of us including me. We would talk everyday and we became very good friends, but one day one of the girls said that they read a page in a magazine for teens, somthing like ""how to be a good kisser in 4 steps"" so being curious we all wanted to practice on eachother in recess. This went on for a couple days, and along with that we would all go home ans serch pictures or videos of kissing on the internet. One day one of the girls came across lesbian porn and we wanted to try it... and from that day on every recess me and my friends would go to the girls bathroom stall (the big one meant for the disabled) we would preform oral sex on eachother. This went on up until i had to move. I never thought much of it but growing up i have always been such a sexual person. Even my boyfriend of 4 years cant keep up with me. I have to resort to other ways of relieving myself alone... i started watching porn since the age of 10 up until now, is that weird? I watch it almost every other day. Ive never talked about this to anyone in depth. I dont think im traumatized or nor does it make me feel horrible. Should I? Idk its weird. Maybe someone has input."
273,Does anyone else do this?,"That part of me that nobody really knows and I may be even ashamed about, I've seperated from ""myself"" and act as if those thoughts and feelings are a seperate identity, and I don't associate with them at all other than letting it live in my head

 (I can't get rid of those sense/ view/ perspective of things but I'm aware they're toxic, hence 'living in my head') 


and talk to me (talking by willingly accepting that part of myself for a brief moment and talking in/ influenced by that sense/ view/ perspective of things)

I try not to let that part of me influence me at all but even as I try to seperate that part from myself, it is still me and it knows how to ""convince"" me to do what it wants because deep down, that is what I want. it sounds confusing but is really simple, and wonder if anyone does the same/ feel the same?"
274,"Help with ""frenzies""?","Hey all, so I experience what my wife calls ""frenzies."" When I'm overstimulated, or stressed, or sometimes for no reason, I enter a frenzied state. Here is an example:

Last night I was writing a paper, there was music on in the room, one of my sons wanted to play xbox, the other wanted to watch a movie, and both were trying to talk to me at the same time. Rather than help them in any reasonable way, I ended up *literally running around the house. I shuffled the xbox games around but never put one in the xbox. I opened disney+ but never ended up putting a movie on. And I was snappy with my boys, who had done absolutely nothing wrong. 

Sometimes I get these results if I am taking the trash out and my wife asks me to do some other small task. 

Sometimes it happens for basically no reason at all.

My family is supportive and doesn't make me feel bad about it. Other than a little bit of light hearted joking, but my boys are old enough to make a lot of life long memories, and I don't want them to remember me like this. 

Any suggestions? I have had depression issues in the past, but not clinical. I also saw a therapist as a child for a couple years but don't exactly remember why. Otherwise, totally clean mental health history and no drugs or alcohol ever. 

Thanks guys!!"
275,I’m happy when other people are sad. Anyone else feel this way?,"I guess what I’m experiencing is a mixture of schadenfreude and morbid curiosity, but it bothers me a lot. I think it’s been exacerbated by quarantine—I find myself gravitating toward YouTube videos about terminal illness, hospice, dying children, etc and frankly, it disgusts me how I find other people’s pain...entertaining (for lack of a better word)."
276,I have extreme procrastination (possibly due to ADD?) and it's ruining my life,"My procrastination is really, really extreme and I'm also recently starting to wonder if it might be a symptom of ADD. (+ For reference, I'm 16F and already struggling with social anxiety and an undiagnosed eating disorder)

With practically every exam or assignment I've had this year, I've procrastinated them until the very last minute - the morning of any exam, after pulling an all-nighter of doing nothing but browsing the internet, I'd just break down and beg my parents to let me stay home instead of having to face the exam, then after at least an hour of my parents giving me an angry speech about how disappointed they are in me and how this happens EVERY single time without fail, they usually cave in and let me stay home to study. 

You would think that after this I would learn my lesson and make sure to study before going back to school the next day but instead, I spend the entire day relaxed, knowing I now have the rest of the day to study, only to go back to extreme stress at around 10 pm when I still haven't studied at all, that stress again preventing me from even trying to study, even when I know that I would be able to do it if I really tried. This loop continues until the next week when I go back to school knowing I no longer need to take the exam since it's been over a week.

But I really do care about my grades. I feel extremely guilty every time this happens, and even while procrastinating instead of studying, the intense feeling of anxiety from the fact that I am not preparing for the test is constantly in my mind, yet for some reason, no matter how much I try, it's practically impossible for me to get around to actually doing it.

My parents started taking me to see a therapist about a month ago, but out of fear of being judged I decided not to mention the procrastination at all, instead deciding to talk about my social anxiety, another issue that is affecting my life, but a lot less serious than the procrastination. As a result, my therapist thinks I just have social anxiety without much else to be concerned about, when really, I have a LOT to be concerned about.

I used to think this was just extreme laziness and procrastination as a result, which it very well might be, I'm not sure, but after recently having a conversation with my friend who mentioned that she had ADD, I realized that my current issues are similar to her issues before she started treatment, which apparently made a great impact on her life. 

I'm starting to wonder if I should ask my parents to go get tested for it, since alongside procrastination, I have a couple of other symptoms - having trouble paying attention when others are speaking and forgetfulness, but nothing else. however, the thing is my parents are the typical Asian ones who don't have much belief in mental illness, and although they would probably let me get tested since it clearly is a problem at this rate, if I end up not having it, it's just going to become a confirmation to them that I'm just their lazy, useless child that keeps causing problems for them. I've considered talking to my therapist first, but I don't know how to integrate it into our sessions now that it's become basically entirely focused on social anxiety.

On top of this, the school is now demanding for answers to why I'm absent so often (my attendance has now reached below 50%), and if I don't get a diagnosis, I'll have no proper reason to provide to the school. My other mental issues are also factors, but I don't think they'd take my social anxiety seriously enough + I'm scared to get my ED diagnosed since I'm not at all ready for recovery. I'm really scared about getting expelled on top of being extremely stressed about everything, and I know this is a long read (if anyone even bothers to read it) but if anyone could give me some advice it would really be appreciated."
277,why do i keep purposely triggering myself,i found a side of twitter that just triggers me so much n i cant stop looking at it n its just making the voices in my head tell me 2 hurt myself more n it just feels like my arms r heavy n they feel like they wanna be hurt bht i just cant stop !!! triggering myself on purpose !!!

279,I feel like I've acted so crazy that there's literally no way I will ever deserve to be loved again,"I've been a mess for 4 or 5 months.

I've always been an overthinker and have a tendancy to jump to the worst conclusion (which is usually wrong). For this reason, I started turning to Reddit for advice in my personal life. A lot. Way too much. So much so that I've had multiple accounts suspended or banned for posting similar stuff over and over for help. I just don't trust myself or my judgment on *anything* anymore. I have no idea how many accounts I've made, could be as high as 60 on the last 5 Months? I sound so deranged.

The problems really started (and the addictive posting for relief for my anxiety and other opinion), when I started thinking hard about bad stuff my boyfriend did in the past. My boyfriend has undiagnosed (but textbook and an online therapist agreed) OCD. I was terrified his OCD wasn't OCD and he was just a bad person/creep. It causes him extreme guilt if he doesn't tell me something bad/weird he did. I've heard all about incest porn he read as a teen, the times he pegged himself with a toilet brush, the time he tried to steal someone's girlfriend so he could get sex (she had a huge crush on him). My boyfriend's OCD also makes him think disgusting, immoral sexual thoughts and it'll make him panic that he enjoys him. It's like torture for him and I often hear them. He also gets doubts about me/his feelings a lot. Sometimes he will confess these outright and they really hurt. Other times he has this zoned out or pained expression and I just *know* he's hurting and when I ask he'll confess what doubt he has about me or disgusting sexual image/doubt. 

I have often acted like a hypocrite after he confesses his OCD thoughts and I get hurt by these images or thoughts and accuse him of faking his OCD and secretly being a monster because *if he really had OCD he would get help so he wouldn't hurt me anymore*. This is so abusive on my part and I'm ashamed. To try and cope with my fears he was a bad person or faking his OCD, I posted practically daily about whichever doubt/thought of his worried me most for reassuance. I did this so much I got suspended and kept making new accounts. All I wanted was reassuance my BF was just a good dude with OCD and he still loved me. I posted daily, often reposting the same question if I didn't get enough replies to feel ""better"". I even made 2 new Gmail accounts just to make more accounts for more reassuance.

I feel like I've gone so far and acted so toxic, I have to leave my BF and let him find a nice, normal person. I also feel terrified that I've acted so crazy no decent dude will ever want me after my BF, even if I get therapy and get my crap together. Who could be happy with someone who acted as crazy as me, even  if I get better."
280,I have no purpose,"I feel like I have no more purpose in my life. I wake up, go to work, come home, and sit on the couch until it's time to go to bed. I'm so tired and I never have any energy to do anything else. My birthday is on Sunday and I'm honestly dreading it. Life is so dull to me anymore and I don't know what to do to change it"
281,My Psychiatrist asked all the wrong questions.,"Sorry, this will probably be long, but I really need to vent. 

I (f20) struggle with Anxiety as well as undiagnosed Adhd and am possibly on the spectrum which has led to depression and self-harm in the past. Pair that with some nice, juicy childhood trauma from a narcmom and you got yourself a ball of anxiety and weird behaviours, obviously leading to problems here and there. This year I found a psychiatrist through an acquaintance of my boyfriend and he finally half-diagnosed me with Anxiety. I say half-diagnosed because his demeanor is vague to say the least. He outright refused to even entertain the idea that I might be on the autism spectrum which already took me aback and he also seemed to view me as just a basic college girl that struggles with talking to the big scary professors. 

So he prescribed me a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and made extremely sure to tell me not one, not two, but FOUR times that it would be unproblematic if I got pregnant. The first time he mentioned it I was like „oh no worries, I don‘t want to have children. Ever“ (also have tryptophobia - fear of pregnancy, but didn‘t mention that)

 Any decent person, not to mention a Psychiatrist would respond akin to „ok, just fiy, it’s not an issue“ Of course, being an oldschool man (cough cough chauvinist) he just smiled and told me I would probably change my mind, since a lot of young women do. Bitch? You‘re a psychiatrist, you‘re the last person to spout bull like this. But I know people like him and was desperate to get my at this point extreme Anxiety under control so I just smiled and nodded. 

I have been looking for a new psychiatrist for a while because not only do I not like him as a person and don‘t think he actually takes me seriously, but also because the meds don‘t seem to work all that well. Even more, I recently relapsed on my self-harm, seemingly out of nothing, as I‘m albeit a bit stressed, in a good place right now and nowhere near the state I was in when I last did it. Well, I talked to my MIL about it and the amazing mom she is, she researched it and guess what she found? The Meds I‘m taking can cause self-harm and s****dal thoughts relapses and even more so if you‘re under 18 (which is obviously close to 20, even more so with possible adhd/autism). 
I never told him about my self-harm (first time talking to a mental health professional, private person etc.) and he *never* asked me. 

But of course he made exceptionally sure to grill me on every state of my uterus and also btw told me (an asexual woman) multiple times the meds may cause me not be able to orgasm. Bro. My dude. I‘m going crazy because my mind constantly tells me everything is wrong, that I‘m probably gonna die tomorrow and everyone hates me. I can’t focus if my life depends on it, I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown every time I have an assignment for Uni and I can barely hold my life together. Orgasms are the very last of my worries. 

Damn Idiot. I really didn‘t want to go to another appointment, but now I wanna go, kick up a storm and make him feel real stupid."

&amp; i know that your past doesn’t necessarily define you because what matters is your effort to make your present and future self better but the things i have done.. i look back &amp; i’m like “wow, i must be seriously deranged to have done this shit”.  i won’t go into the details of what those things are (don’t worry i didn’t kill anyone) but like— i look back &amp; when i did those things, i didn’t really feel guilty?  it wasn’t until afterwards that i felt bad— after i was either caught or the fear of being caught hit me.  i’ve lost dear friends due to my fuckery &amp; my family has distrust in me now.. i know that i have a heart &amp; that i’m capable of love but it’s like i have absolutely no respect for myself like why do i even deserve to exist?  i still have friends and people who claim they support me &amp; love me but like do they really?  i want to become a better person but after everything that happened and everything i’ve done, i feel like i don’t even deserve a future."

But ever since then I’ve had a pain in the center of my chest that is sometimes dull, sometimes sharp but always there. I’ve seen things were chest pain after a panic or anxiety attack is normal but that they only usually last a couple hour after? It’s been constant and is companied with shortness of breath that when I try to get a deep breath in it makes my fingers and face go numb (like it did during the attack). I guess my question is if the chest pain is because of the attack or if it could be because of something else?"
287,"Social media is cancer, especially when you suffer from mental health problems","And I am not even talking about the dark parts of social media, about cyber bullying or general meanness that can be found around every corner.

Just browsing the frontpages of facebook or instagram gives you a feeling that you are lagging behind, that everyone around you is doing great. Even though you are aware that Most of what is shown there is fake, that still does not make the feeling of inferiority go away.

What helped me personally was talking to my friends, those with the Most beautiful pictures, the widest smiles, the perfect lives.
It helped me to realise that they are Just as sad and scared as I am and it helped them by giving them someone who really listens.

Anyone else?"
292,Why would i want to be alive,"This world seems so evil. Humans are horrible.....how can anyone want to live like this? Why would anyone want to live in a world ruled by hatred, selfishness, and greed? I can’t stand it anymore. Why are people so mean, why are people so full of hate and prejudice. Why would I want to live in a world like this? Even if some people are good, there’s too many people that are just..evil..i dont know. I’m so tired. Why is everything a competition? Why is everyone constantly so judgemental? What is even happening anymore? Yes i know a lot of people are good, thankfully. But i am losing hope. Even if I were truly happy, would i still actually want to be alive when we as humans have turned out like this?"
293,Future isn’t here,"“But the future is still not here, and cannot become a part of experienced reality until it is present. Since what we know of the future is made up of purely abstract and logical elements—inferences, guesses, deductions—it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise enjoyed. To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead”

294,I cant live with myself anymore,"Hello.
I dont know where to start, probably just say that i cannot handle it anymore. I hate being myself, i hate having mental health issues, nothing seems to be helping. My psychologist is trying to make progress, but there is none.
I feel empty, i sont see joy in my life, nothing interests me. I am also unemployed after covid stuff and i dont know nothing. I had worked as a waitress, but it was just a bar with food, no experiences. I would like to be something more but i dont have the strenght.
Also i am the worst girlffiend ever i guess. I make a lot of mess, i try to clen but cannot keep stuff clean. My boyfriend is annoyed for everything i do and tells me he is sick of me almost daily.
Istarted working out, the only thing i love but they closed the gyms again for who knows how long. My boyfriend doesnt take me anywhere, just plays videogames, probably bc he doesnt want to be with me..... We havent beenon a date for almost a year now. (been together 1.5 years)
Alao my bf told me he cannot live with my panic attacks. Today i got one, i asked for help and he left. I didnt know what to do, i felt like im getting a heart attack so i had to call my friend. But felt like a burden.
I dont want to live with this personality, my psychologist said i have to learn to live with thia, it is not possible to change it. I am really out of breath, just want this to go away. I dont want to kill myself, just not exist.
Sorry for the rant, probably no answers expected, but i needed to get this off my chest."
295,too bad,"I don’t think it used to be like this before the pandemic started but I don’t usually like being touched now; it’s ok when is ok. I know that sounds weird. But I guess it’s jus random or idk. It’s just me being dumb I guess lol. I suppose I’m more comfortable when it’s me who’s initiating the physical contact but I guess that just makes me selfish. My dad tells me “oh I’m not a stranger I’m your dad” and yeah I’m just being selfish I guess just hghhggg

Another thing is this... it might sound oddly specific but anyway: repeating the same phrases/sentences regularly, at the same time of day with the same words. This one is incredibly dumber than my first point and I’ve accepted that I’m genuinely being a poo. Oh wait I’m messing up whilst typing this ajdsksi what happens is that that (people repeating sentences) is something that bothers me. I actually sort of do it but idk it’s just sometimes, like I say “sorry sorry sorry” which may just be scrupulosity.

I don’t know but I think I have ocd and I don’t know but I think other people repeating stuff all the time could be a sort of — dare I say it — trigger. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to self-diagnose or anything which makes me feel bad for talking about this but yeah. Basically my dad is like “I’m going to work bye”, says “bye” about twice more and it just reminds me of stuff that makes me feel bad. Then when I’m doing writing or stuff he says to me, every day, “ok you’re going to read, you’re going to write, I like it when you read and write” and yeah, same thing, it just makes me feel bad. I was thinking about this just before he did that which made me do this laugh but it wasn’t because I was making of him (ie what he interpreted), it was more like that meme with a guy with a mask on that has a smiling face but underneath, his actual face is extremely tense and tears are cascading down his cheeks. So then I explained to him that and his feelings were hurt and he got angry so yeah, I apologised and I tried asking him why he does that and tried to have a good conversation but ironically at that point he started saying we \*never\* talk so I guess that wasn't his idea of having a good conversation and idk this is worthless and yeah idk this is my first post in a while idk how to form my words and write down my thoughts without rambling, I could go back and make the post better but idk

about the ""sensitive to touch"" thing, I think there's a chance I could be autistic. idk im so sorry if I seem super shallow and like im looking for attention but yeah, there's other reasons though. I took a quiz on what seems to be a good site about neurodiversity but idk I know there's more to it than that. anyway, it said there's a high chance I am but idk. 

and ironically, there's the ""not liking that type of repetition"" which is basically the opposite of the commonly known trait of autism, liking doing the same things the same way over and over again. but idk I don't think it's completely the same thing but yeah. gosh that sentence probably wasn't grammatically correct. jdnvskv. but yeah anyway I do know autism is a spectrum and not every autistic person has every trait of autism but im gonna stop talking about that before anyone spontaneously combusts of cringe from the superficial, shallow, attention-seeking nonsense I am spewing.

tl;dr I am sort of sensitive to touch and I don't know if it's because of coronavirus anxiety or not. I don't like people repeating the same things routinely which could be because it reminds me of repetitive ocd things. also I think I could be autistic but that's another story."
296,"Tired of intrusive thoughts, PTSD of my psychoses.","I’ve been stuck on this shit 2 years. I had started smoking weed in college, but it wasn’t causing any noticeable problems. I moved into a house with my best friend, but he started cutting himself, and shortly thereafter I took an edible and had a very gruesome psychosis. I stopped smoking after that, but had another one where my mom had to come get me because I was naked shivering in a closet with delusions that my mom was the devil and I was trapped. My third one was less noticeable, but it was one while I look back on it where I was scratching my face while watching a movie as if I was etching the plot. Then this spring I had one before covid in a public place where I was throwing a fit on a bus. I knew what was happening, but had no power to control it. Ever since I’ve had thoughts about it that cause more unwanted thoughts, and on top of that Covid shit and isolation, these past few years have been hell. And on top of that, I feel completely shattered and unidentified with my past self that held a lot different values and interests than I do now, so it feels like I don’t even know myself."
297,happiest i’ve been in weeks.,"long story short, after feeling lost for so long and not knowing what life had for me, 2 years ago i finally got my DREAM job at only 20 years old. it was at a nonprofit that many years before, i was a recipient of their services. their mission is so dear to me and i had felt like i finally found exactly where i wanted to be. my coworkers were great, the work environment was great and of course getting to help kids and their families was the biggest reward. i lost this dream job of mine at the end of august. i have been crushed and not knowing what to do with my life. finding a job right now is hard and i couldn’t imagine myself working anywhere else. i had never planned to work anywhere else. 

But, today, i got a call for an interview at a different nonprofit in my city. i have been so defeated and finally feel like i’m going to be back doing what i love. of course, i don’t for sure have the job yet but i am so excited to finally have something to look forward to. this is the first step to digging myself out of the depression hole i have been in."
298,I can’t deal with my family,"My parents caught me with a vape and instead of acknowledging that my depression *might* have caused me to turn to drugs, my dad has been harassing and shaming me for it. My dad is the only reason I do drugs and self harm and now I just want to go to the mental hospital again."
299,Suicide Threats from Breakup w Borderline,"I was dating someone a little younger than myself (33) in whom I recognized signs of BPD. I asked him to get therapy, and he started, but then in a meltdown said the therapists are too easy to lie to.

We only dated about five weeks but he got very intense, very fast, and I felt really uncomfortable (I've been in relationships like that before and they never end well). I just can't be the sole support system for someone, when my own mental illness takes so much out of me.

I told him today that I couldn't continue the relationship and the ensuing messages were everything from You broke my heart, to You are a user and a monster, to I'm going to end my life.

I am concerned about the threats. I did have someone I cared for follow through after years of threats. He knows this. I told him I would call for outside help if he said anything else like that and he doubled down.

I want to ask the community, those who suffer with BPD especially (which I relate to and used to feel shades of myself)--should I call someone? He lives with his family, but I don't know how to contact them. I don't want him put on a hold if it's going to be detrimental to his mental health. But I also want to take the threats seriously, though not by continuing to respond to his ongoing messages as I am concerned he is just using them to try to pull me in and keep saying hurtful things. I need advice 😓😓😓"
300,I don’t want to go home,I’m finally happy. Well not at happy as i could be. But I’m happier than i have been in a while. I finally feel like I’m in a good place and I don’t want to go home. I don’t want to go home to all the shit between my parents. I don’t want to have to deal with that shit. I cried for the first time in 3 years last week just thinking about it. This is the first year we are going to have Christmas in two different houses. It’s been pretty awful the last 4 years. Maybe now it will be better my parents are separated. Or maybe it will be even worse. I know I’m going to get stuck in an argument between my parents. I always do. I always have to mediate their shit. And every time i have a disagreement with my mother she says I’m just like my dad. I don’t want to be like him. I can’t even have a disagreement with him because he never fucking talks about anything meaningful. The only freedom i have there is my work. 30-40 hours of freedom away from them. I feel more at home and welcome at work than i do at either of my houses. I’m dreading going back. I don’t know if i can do it. And if i do i don’t know if i will survive it.
301,"hi i have nobody to ask but i had a fucking out of body experience today and literally, it felt like i was dreaming and my mom got really mad at me. what the fuck happened",this happened before but i for some reason lose chunks of my day so i dont actually fully remember what happened here. not trying to be labeled. does this happen to everyone?
302,anyone here find any value in this?,
303,Does anyone else have these types of thoughts?,"*Trigger Warning* - Extreme Violence




I have BP1, BPD, and Social Anxiety. Everyday, just about, I get these thoughts to either kill or harm someone or an animal. I don’t have a therapist at the moment because I don’t have insurance or a job, but I will be soon. So I cannot talk to anyone about them, but on here. I’m embarrassed to tell my family, because most of my intrusive thoughts are about them or our pets. I’ve been having these sorts of thoughts since I was 13. They were very bad when I was 15 because I would have blackout rages and really vivid flashes that seemed so real that I actually thought they were happening. They got a tiny bit better since then, but it’s still any everyday occurrence. Just today I thought about throwing my dog against the wall. I could visualize myself doing it and the blood. Every time I have one of these thoughts I have to clench my fists and I shake like I have a cold chill until the thought goes away. Does anyone else have these thoughts? Also if I told a therapist this or doctor would they commit me. I don’t want to do these things, but the urges are really strong.

Thank you."
304,I want your thoughts on my thoughts on ‘retroactive jealousy’,"If you don’t know what retroactive jealousy is then probably look it up before reading, or don’t bother with either lol

Retroactive Jealousy is framed as a type of OCD.

What if your gf has told you how great her ex was in bed on multiple occasions, as in my case, plus a long list of other such comments (telling me she has a sex tape of her ex that she doesn’t want to delete for instance) and an incredibly extensive and adventurous sexual history to go with it.

the instant response is ‘it’s OCD’, laying the responsibility squarely at the feet of the sufferer, with the implication being that someone without OCD wouldn’t feel this way; this of course is a type of logical trap, because the moment someone does ‘feel that way’ then they are told they have OCD, so it can never be refuted. This is a problem with mental health diagnosis across the board for reasons I go into below. (The fallacy imo is ‘someone without OCD wouldn’t feel this way’).

I feel that it is a cop out and massive oversimplification. At a certain point circumstances can be too much for even a psychologically ‘normal’ person to deal with and they (magically) start experiencing OCD (or, in my opinion, they have a psychologically normal reaction to the stimuli).

The reality of mental illnesses is that they don’t really ‘exist’ in the same way that, say, cancer or diabetes does, and this naturally applies to OCD also. Mental illnesses are best thought of as capturing one end of a certain dimension (those particularly high on social anxiety may find themselves diagnosed with ‘social anxiety disorder’ for example). This is the way many psychologists are increasingly viewing the field.

It goes without saying that from this view (that mental disorders are not things that you either ‘have’ or ‘don’t have’, but rather denote that you land past an arbitrary point on a continuum) that your ‘symptoms’ at any time - your mental health - is truly at the mercy of inner and outer stimuli (unlike, say, diabetes, which really is ‘real’ I.e. biologically instantiated and with actual scientific tests to discover it, not bogus pseudoscientific questionnaires). I am aware I am indulging in some oversimplification here, but am quite convinced the essence of what I’m saying is correct.

Soldiers who went to WWI mostly had no ‘mental illness’ before they went; many came back with anxiety disorders, shell shock, PTSD. Ultimately we’re just dealing with brains and chemistry.

You wouldn’t blame the soldier for their PTSD; you’d blame the conditions of the war. What does it even mean to have a mental illness ultimately, if it is clearly triggered by circumstances."
305,How to help mentally a ill mother?,"Hello my mother is exhibiting signs of mental illness

306,I can’t do this anymore,"I honestly believe that life has no meaning no purpose and no point! And all I do is endure hardship after hardship! My heart is broken, my soul is empty! And I haven’t been able to get out of bed for days! I don’t believe I can be satisfied or happy! My therapist and family believe i can be happy but I don’t! I have everything you could want objectively my life is amazing! But I am suffering so much more than I’m thriving I go to sleep with dissatisfaction 9 times out of 10! I don’t think there is any level of wholeness or success I could find in this life that would satisfy me! I feel so so deeply bad that’s the only way to describe it! I just want to end it all, this misery! I just don’t even know what to do I believe I am strong enough to overcome this but I don’t rlly want to because I know ill just end up back here at some point!

307,what is wrong with me,"i over think everything, im scared to tell people i disagree with there opinion, i make promises i can and almost know i will never keep, and i sit there knowing im bailing from my promises, i turn my phone to silent and try to think about anything other than me bailing. my fathers birthday was june, dont ask me what day cause my insensitive ass doesn't even remember, but i woke up and my mom told me ""dont forget, its ur fathers birthday""...... and when i saw him i panicked, i knew what i had to say and i think he knew what i wanted to say but i just didnt say it, and then i saw him again and didnt say it, and again and again until i came up with some sad exuse for a present that i through together and made it seem like ive been all distracted with his present, and i still didnt say happy birthday. i think people like me more than they actually do, then i get left on read, and not just by the very few women ive talked to in the past 3 years but the dudes i thought were my friends as well, i mean someone im gonna see tomorrow at work even. this is such a rambaly mess, im sorry about my grammar, the school system failed me but at the same time i essentially failed myself, i mean fuck how can i blame people who tried to help me. sorry"
308,I am having an identity crisis as diagnosed with Bipolar 2,"I finally reached out a psychiatrist and now being managed for Bipolar 2. She asked me questions but some have stricken me deep. Will be starting medication tomorrow. 

Who am I when Im not on my depressive and hypomanic state. 

Those who have been medically diagnosed as bipolar, how did you know what your normal/stable state like? Did you have sort of ""identity crisis""? How did you feel after 2 months on medication, did you feel ""normal""?

My psychiatrist thought I have been this way for a long time, the reason I ""lost"" my touch of self-identity. Both my girlfriend and I have no idea since I am almost always at both extremes.

PS. Copy-pasted my own question on MentalHealthPh"
309,Kinda stuck?,"My names Jules, I’m 18 and I’m currently homeless in Yuma Arizona, I’m originally from Manhattan, Kansas. I have bpd w psychotic tendencies, extreme anxiety, major&amp;manic depression, odd, adhd, pmdd, and with a lot of the physical and mental things I’ve been experiencing lately I’m beginning to think I may be on the spectrum-was tested as a minor; negative results- I have been here for the past year or so taking care of my terminally ill grandma. I was booted after revealing that I was suicidal and wanted to try and seek out help. Had all of my possessions stolen by a tweaker prostitute and her 15 yo runaway ward of the state son. Attempting to arrange civil standby was pointless. All I have is a now serviceless cell phone, and clothes. Was on an SED waiver as a minor in Kansas, weekly therapy and psych meds+ many long&amp; short term hospitalizations. I’ve never been on my own before. I don’t have insurance as an “adult” and am now lacking legal identification to receive it at this time, because the tweaker has my purse/wallet. I’ve been accepted to awc-Arizona Western College-but am unsure of how to continue on that path or if I should. I have no money. I’m also like 70% sure I’m absolutely NOT in a good enough place mentally for college to even be a logical option. I should probably be hospitalized honestly, but being as mental health facilities are lacking in my area, I kinda have no clue where I even am, and I have no way to get back to my hometown where I’ve been offered places to stay, I don’t really know what to do. 
Um... help? Maybe? Lol"
310,How quickly can a memory be repressed? (TW: talk of possible sexual assault),"So I tried to look this up on Google but I wasn't getting any answers so I thought maybe someone here could help me out with this.

To make a long story short there was a family get together I attended when I was younger where I was rough housing with some distant cousins of mine where I ended up pulling the ""I'm actually your little cousin so you have to be nice to me"" card when I decided I didn't wanna play anymore, and the oldest of them, instead of just apologizing then and there, literally took me into the bathroom, sat me on his lap, and hugged me while apologizing, and I remember thinking it was a really weird thing to do and nothing more, but then when I left my parents were outside and immediately came over and asked me if I was okay and what happened and I was like ""uh nothing he was just saying sorry for hurting me"" and it took me years to realize that they were thinking I had been molested or something, and as far as I was concerned I wasn't because frankly I don't remember anything like that happening but now I'm worried this creep DID do something to me and my brain just immediately wiped that part of the memory for me :/"

24 years of failure. 24 years of disappointment. 24 years of inadequacy. 24 years of being ugly and unlovable. It all ends tonight. No more being disgustingly ugly. No more being alone. No more pain of failure, rejection, and hoplessness. Tonight I’m going to hang myself and cut my wrists and die on my own terms, destroying the body i was cursed with. 

I never posted on this sub, but others delete my posts for some  reason and I’m only doing so as my very last post on reddit to say that I hope my parents can accept the love i put into my suicide note. 

Goodbye."
313,Need advice on my sisters mental illness,"Hi everyone. I don't know what to do about my sister, and I am seeking advice.

My sister had everything going for her. Was going to law school, not far from finishing it. She had a home that the school was letting her rent out. Life was going good.. 

Fast forward 2 years later. 

 Suddenly things changed. She quit school, lost her home and now for over 2 years, she literally just lays around.  And when I say lay down, I mean everyday for 2 years she does nothing but LAY DOWN ALL DAY LONG. She will sometimes go to the store but that's it.

Shes also had some very bizarre behavior. Like going missing, and being found by the police sleeping in some strangers backyard. That's just for starters.

Shes also very disrespectful, with a very bad attitude every day. 

She's been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder but flat out REFUSES to take her medication. She's also had 2 trips to the mental hospital but that hasn't seemed to help.

Now I'm having to take care of her kids. 

It feels like this situation will never improve and I just don't know what to do. I've had to stop my entire life just to take care of her and her kids and its becoming a financial burden.

I love her and her kids, but she refuses to do anything to help herself and I just don't know what to do.

Has anyone else ever encountered a situation like this? 

I just don't know what to do and it's going to make me go crazy.

I try to talk to her about it, she just ignores me. I tell her I want things to change but she acts like she doesn't hear me.

What do I do! Help me before I lose my own mind!"
314,Any stress management tips?,"I posted this on the rant subreddit, but come to think of it it's probably better here. So, my dad is going insane from sleep deprivation, my grandma is showing early signs of alzheimers or dementia, my mom has been out of my life for almost 19 years, most of my ""friends"" were fake cunts, I lost my job, I started getting politically active as the country is on the brink of civil war, most of my family knows nothing about me other than the fact that I'm tall, I've been experiencing random bouts of hopelessness, I keep being told by those around me not to shoot for my dreams because it wont yield immediate results, and to top it all off either the stress is getting to me or my appendix is going. I've developed several stress-related tics (stuttering, twitching primarily in the eyes, insomnia, hand wringing, etc.). How the FUCK do I manage all that?"
315,i just need to post this,"so, as I've posted before my girlfriend was raped 3 months ago, and it's been tearing me up inside, the guy who did it is in prison, but just fuck, the only way I feel I can be comfortable is if that fucker had a bullet in his brain, so that way he couldn't remember what the fuck he did, and couldn't ever do it again because he'd be rotting in the fucking ground, id want my girlfriend to be able to forget what happened, but I would have to remember, for the sake of not making the mistake that caused this shit, I fucking hate myself because I know damn well it was my decision that caused this crap to begin with, the only way id feel fucking comfortable is if I was the only one who remembered the trauma"
316,I am angry at myself for not being in pain enough.,"  I feel the constant urge to be in physical or mental pain during all my waking hours. Once I realize I’m feeling good, I feel so so so guilty, like I’m a fraud and I’m somehow invalidating myself + others. 

  I accidentally trigger stressful thoughts because it’s all my brain will ever be able to focus on in that state. I try to think about something else, my fave TV shows, drawing, or games with friends, but it just doesn’t satisfy my mind. I can either think about awful things or I can think about nothing at all and stare off into space/sleep my troubles away. (Which hasn’t worked lately, I’ve had trouble sleeping)

  Sometimes I wish I had it worse (stronger intrusive thoughts, stronger anxiety and fear, crying), so that I would have an aversion to these bad feelings. I don’t want to get a rush of joy when I get hurt, I don’t want to find it funny, I don’t want to look at scars, or realize I’m trembling and blush/smile. I know that sounds edgy and cringe, but that’s what I feel.

  I would tell my friends about this, and not slap it on Reddit but I feel as if they would be extremely hurt by it. They’ve gone through worse than I, and I think they might be angry with me if I voiced that desire to be in that much despair.

  I feel nasty and awful deriving happiness from this.
It isn’t how it’s supposed to be."
317,Positively portrayed characters with psychosis?,"So I was talking with my friend the other day who’s on the Autism spectrum about how he’s so glad some modern TV series and movies are starting to have positive and accurate Autistic representation, and I’m really happy about to too. So as we got further into the discussion I realized as a teenager battling Psychosis I started to realize my disorder is very rarely represented in media without being severely demonized, and I couldn’t help but start to want to see characters I can relate too a little bit. So I was wondering if any of you have book/movie/tv show recommendations with positively portrayed psychotic characters? Thanks!!!"
318,How do I stop ruminating after 5 months?,"I can’t stop thinking about a very close family member to me passing away and all I get are panic attacks and it just hurts. I’m not depressed yet, but my chest really hurts from overthinking and I want out of it."
319,Am I the monster you tell me I am?,"I was with a wonderful girl for 3 years, we had a child late last year. It wasn’t always perfect but I loved her and gave my hardest. When the pandemic hit things changed, she got stressed and scared and one day she disappeared when I was in the shower. I didn’t know where she went for 3 weeks until I found a Facebook post that she had gotten back together with her drug dealer ex and was getting a place with him, time went on and eventually they broke up, he almost killed her in the process, and ended up in jail. Since she’s gone from place to place eventually ending up in a homeless shelter, I helped her out during this time and helped her move her things but eventually I broke off contact again when she returned to her lying and abusive ways. 

Now she just calls me occasionally to threaten me, call me a monster. Sometimes I believe her, but all I ever did was try to help her. Why am I the monster for caring about myself more especially after everything she’s done to me"
320,Anyone else wear earplugs when they’re out?,I found out the hard way that auditory stimuli can trigger panic attacks so I started wearing ear plugs at work(service job. Very loud)and it made an enormous difference. So much so that I’ve begun wearing them out more often than not. It’s been very nice. Highly recommend.
321,I was thinking about gaining weight but my dad made me changed my mind,"I have been underweight in my entire life. I used to eat very healthy or normally but was still underweight. But then I got depression and gradually lost my appetite, from one skip meal to two, or nothing at all. The reasons why I don't eat are 1. I admit I am a picky eater, but I usually cook my own meal afterwards 2. During meal time my family would berate/nag/insult me 3. Not eating makes me closer to death, even thought to starve myself to death. 

These past few years my mental health was terrible. I usually eat one meal per day and rarely two, My sleeping schedule is a mess, it is more often I oversleep but sometimes I don't at all, usual suicidal tendencies, and occasionaly self harming. It also took a toll on my physical health, I weigh 85 klbs and my period shifted it's cycle. I would often be shaking and got goosebumps from not eating a for awhile. And there would be times I would vomit and sht back and forth, light fever,  be dizzy, and headaches, for a day. This would happen every 2-4 months. 

Yesterday I skip two meals and woke up to do some schoolwork in 2am. Soon everyone else was awake, I decided to cook for me and my siblings. I ate and decides to rest for awhile. I was lying down and my dad shouted at me to do the dishes. I said, I will do them and I am just resting. He then said, I just ate and now I'm tired?!! 

This just reminded me why I was suicidal and depressed. My parents downplays my illness, they view me as a lazy and problematic teenager, and my parents I must say can be toxic. I am currently off my meds and can't afford theraphy. 

I view me eating a big deal, an achievement. I have only eaten 3x a day, three times this year. The first time I did that, is the first time in two years. This just makes me want to be stuck in my bed forever."
322,"Are these thoughts and feelings “normal”, or should I be concerned?","So I guess I’ll get straight to the point, I’m 14, AFAB non-binary, and I’ve been having weird thoughts for the past year or so. I almost constantly feel like something is out to get me, or that something bad is going to happen. I also sometimes have this feeling that someone or something is in my room or my house or watching me that shouldn’t be, and it happens when people are in the house and when I’m home alone. I feel like people I know are lying to me, or talking about me behind my back, and even though I don’t really have proof, I just have this feeling they are. And the ones that bothers me the most is this thought that people can hear what I’m thinking, or that I’m talking out loud and saying what I’m thinking and people hear me, even though I’m pretty sure I’m not. Another one that bothers me a lot is that I’m scared of cameras and microphones, I have a habit of covering up my phone cameras, and tilting my computer screen so that the front camera can’t get my face in view, and I’m constantly checking and making sure my microphone is muted in classes, even when I’ve never turned it on and it’s never been turned on. 

The weirdest ones are occasionally I’ll hear someone really close by is talking to me, when there’s no one there, or I’ll see some sort or shadowy person stilling I’m my room, or walking around my house. When they speak, it’s usually quick, just a sentence at most, and they never say anything bad, just some random thing like “what’s that?” Or “what is she talking about?”. It started maybe 10-11 months ago and It doesn’t happen often, barely once a week, and it doesn’t really bother me, it’s just weird. The shadow doesn’t do anything either, it just does it’s own thing, and I let it be. It just all black and its sort of fuzzy around the edges. I’m pretty sure it’s not a shadow, it likes to sit on the couch or on the extra desk chair, and it like to stand and watch the TV with me. I’ve tested turning on and off different lights and it doesn’t leave, so it’s not a shadow. 

I can’t really imagine these are normal thoughts, but should I be concerned, or is it not something to worry about? Should I talk to someone? Could something be wrong with me? I haven’t told anyone because at first I was scared to and I thought they would go away. They started around the time my aunt died and we found out my bà nội (Vietnamese for grandma) was dying from cancer, and I thought maybe I was just stressed out over that and overwhelmed, but they haven’t stopped and I’ve story of gotten used to everything. The voice is pretty nice, and it sounds like they would be my friend, and the shadowy person creeps me out sometimes, but it’s sorta nice to watch TV with it. 

I’m just asking because my mom is sending me to therapy at some point when she can find someone because she’s worried I might be depressed, and I’m wondering if it’s something I should bring up or just keep to myself."
323,"Please, I need help.","I live about an hour west of Houston, Texas. I’m in major need of anyone that can help with OCD. I’m having a really REALLY rough time right now and I NEED therapy but I can’t afford it. I’ve got a daughter so I rarely have time, much less money to pay for a therapist so, please, anyone that knows of any low income resources, I’m desperate. Please help me. I don’t know what else to do. It’s ruining my life. Please, god, Reddit do your thing."
324,What online therapy apps do you use?,"I’ve been knowing for awhile I need therapy but something recently has actually pushed me to the limit. Everytime I go online and try and look for an online therapy service I get very overwhelmed&amp; anxious and just give up. There’s just so many of them and I’m unemployed so I don’t wanna sign up for one and have me not like it. I preferably need someone that specializes in ptsd &amp; domestic violence. I am not currently on any medications but I feel like I could benefit, so I need to be able to be able to get a prescriptions. Any advice would be very helpful."
325,I need advice or thoughts (Beware; Long post),"Im sorry this is so long, but I really need to get stuff off my chest. I’m also sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes.

So, I’m a 17 year old and I haven't had a therapist for almost two years. (I’m already diagnosed with Anxiety) I stopped going just before an incident that happened where I was taken to the hospital cause a police officer found me having an anxiety attack outside a gas station after I ran out of my house. (Will explain more about this later) but even with the therapist I couldn't explain anything the way I wanted. I ended up shrugging most the time and when I did try to talk I stuttered and blanked out everything I wanted to say, leaving out most of it. I just kind of gave up on it. But Im at this point where I cant handle being like this any longer and I just HAVE to share what I feel with someone, anyone really so Im posting it on here. 

My sister had Borderline and its hard. I so hope Im wrong but at the same time it would make sense from what Ive researched and observed from my sister. So Ima explain what I feel. Not everything makes sense because at this point Im just ranting, but here goes:

Whether it be my brothers, mother or friends. I can go from absolutely adoring and wanting to stay with them forever to completely loathing them and wishing they did not exist in just a few minutes. My mother and I's relationship is the worst. One moment I could literally wish she died in the most twisted ways to loving her endlessly in two minutes.

My self image isnt the worst. (Thats a lie but just ignore it) But I doubt myself constantly, I wonder if I was someone else than what I think I am (sorry that doesn't make sense) or trying to supress my true self without realizing. I long to be anyone else. My hobbies flip and flop constantly, sometimes I love what I do and then I hate it and it swaps all the time. (Which I think is normal if Im not wrong?) Sometimes I love being me but most times I completely hate myself. Sometimes it feels like I shouldnt or dont exist truly at all. 

During my fits of anger and depression I end up hitting myself. I punch my thighs and head, slam my head against the wall, scratch and pinch my arms, and when its really bad I end up cutting (or attempting too, pathetically) I cant really stop myself. While its happening I feel like im elsewhere completely. I sometimes feel that things won’t get better so I just die and move on to whatever cruel afterlife there is.

I run out my apartment during the night when I’m stressed (it happens so suddenly I dont realize Im actually doing it until Im a few blocks away from my house. Its blurred and feels unreal) But the incident I mention early was triggered by something different. (Still not there yet, sorry)

Anger is my worst symptom. The best way to describe it is being thrown underwater. It could be the smallest thing can set it off but it feels so intense I have to take it out on myself or things around me. Its like a rush of heat that I cant shake off and it gets worse and worse until the kettle blows. Its hard to supress and get over. I breakdown crying as well. The most recent was last week when my youngest brother wouldn't stop arguing with my other one. I started to scream and cry even though I really didn't want to. It doesn't happen anymore but I used to literally scream at the top of my lungs :') I also get pangs of anger and annoyance at the smallest of sentences or even looks (though im not sure of that counts) the best I can describe it is like a wave of heat in my brain that passes in a minute or two. Moving away from anger sometimes I feel so hyped and giddy I have to literally jump around my room and talk to myself until it wears off.

I disociate a lot as well. Like Im watching myself without actually being there and lose track of anything Im doing and once I realize whats happening I cant regain my focus no matter what I do. Most of the time I pretend Im someone else, anyone but who I am. Im not sure if its bad but it helps when I start to hate myself. Paranoia is also a big one as well. I feel like everyone hates me or is talking about me behind my back. Thats not the only paranoia I have either, its not as bad as it used to be but I always feel like something is there, watching me or sneaking up on me. It got so bad at one point I would have panic attacks. A plane passing overhead or a motorcycle speading past on the highway could be a bombs, or a car passing by slowly on the street can kidnap or shoot me. Its so embarrassing to think about but once this dude got into a car while I pased and it felt like he was following me (It was a one way street) and I bolted all the way to my home in a panic because I thought he was a thug gonna shoot me. (I cant tell if this is something else or just my anxiety)

Even though I have plenty to do, I feel sooooooo bored. I could be doing 3 different things at once and still feel like I could be more entertained. Then sometimes I feel like a shell, and I just exist. I feel like not a person but an entity just wallowing in the world watching everything around me. Not sure if that counts as emptiness but it happens often. Its not for long periods of time. Twenty to twenty five minutes has been the top. 

I dont think this counts as fear of abandoment but sometimes I feel like no one wants to be around me. That they are only talking to me because they feel they have to. I have so many people I want to keep as friends but Im so scared that If I say the wrong thing or even have one wrong look on my face that they'll drop me right away. Sometimes it feels like Im just following people around and the more I do, the more they hate me. I also cant read tone AT ALL I feel like what people say is patronizing or condescending when it doesn't actually mean that. Also if Im ignored or dismissed I get depressed, which I cant shake off until I get proper acknowledgement. I also overshare waaaayyy too much. I ended up telling lowly aqiuntances about that one time I got found in the street at night and taken to the hospital. I wanted to bury myself in a hole when everyone stared at me blankly after  😭😭

I cant help but feel like Im being overdramatic. Maybe what Im feeling is normal but the things I feel are so intense I can hardly function. Even writing this right now Im fucking crying like tf. I jus hope im not completely wrong in what I feel. 

I fricken hate self diagnosing, cause Im most likely completely wrong but ya know, a hoe can't help but worry. A lot of what is said Is probably just my anxiety as well soooooooooooooooo idfk. Good Therapists in my area is hard to come by plus Im poor af and not everyone takes my insurance. Im scared with getting stuck with a shitty person who doesn't listen to my stuttering self at all. 

My mom makes me feel like Im not allowed to have feelings either. When I was younger it was physical abuse not just mental. When I cried my mom would scream at me, choke me, and punch me in the head. Once she almost smashed my head in with a hammer while I was having a panic attack. And another time she ran at me with a knife, That was the same night I was taken the hospital, and as soon as my mom got there she told me ""You are ruining our lives."" When she found out about my self harm she got mad at me saying I was pathetic and started to cry. 

Sometimes, I want to share what I feel with literally anyone so bad it hurts but Im scared that I'll be disregard or ignored. 

Theres so much more. But I have to stop. Writing this much has exhausted me. 

I really dont know what to expect people to respond. But literally anything will do, even a simple ""yes, you actually are crazy"" can do wonders. 

Now im finna post this before I change my mind."
326,Is it just me or is a lot of advice for mental health really patronising and not helpful?,"So recently I’ve been having panic attacks and really depressive moods due to a year of workplace abuse. Most of the advice I’ve been given by councillors have just been breathing techniques and mindfulness attempting to rationalise the fear (although I feel I’m already not logistically validating). I have finally been given some medication whilst waiting for talking therapy, (Sertraline antidepressants and anti anxiety medication) but looking at the side effects of both and what people have reported online I’m not sure if I’m better off not taking them than risking the adverse side effects. When looking online a person I found also concerned but already on said medication was worried about their side effects but people are again filling in with advice on self care breathing exercises when clearly the issue is pharmaceutical at this point. I feel at least for me I need more help to be able to understand what is medically happening to me and be able to separate it from just the idea it’s not in my head, then I can focus on self care ect, otherwise I’d just feel helpless. I think in terms of the Sertraline, it is well known about the adverse side effects especially when not weened off correctly. Unless I’m in extreme cases I really wonder if it’s worth avoiding instead of focusing on just dealing with side effects and practising mindfulness. Sorry for the rant, these are my own options and aren’t medically verified at all. Any opinions on the matter or personal experiences with the medication would me most appreciated."
327,Inflated Ego Issues,"I don't know if anyone else experiences this but I feel like my ego has been inflated and I feel isolated because of it. Most of my adult life I've lived in an echo chamber. Everyone compliments me and tells me I'm doing a good job, I'm attractive, I'm smart, I'm hard working, etc, etc... At first the compliments were nice but now it's just annoying. I watch the news and see people struggling in society, my friends with student debt, insecurities, etc. I'm to the point where I donate and try to lift others up and remind them of their strengths. However, I constantly live in fear others will be jealous of me if I open up and I feel very lonely. I want to do right by those around me and feel like it's my responsibility to be the provider for everyone, but I also understand that's unrealistic. The best way I can discribe this feeling is the same as when someone else is infatuated with you to the point it pushes you away. Except, I'm infatuated with myself and love everything about me but the infatuation disgusts me. What is this feeling and how do I get rid of it.

Tl:DR I have a weird mood/feeling I want to shake and can't. I'm infatuated with myself and love everything about me but the infatuation disgusts me. What is this feeling and how do I get rid of it."
328,Wanting to get better so I can help someone else.,"I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since I got out of the military in 2012. My divorce was finalized soon after and I went from weighing 180 to 250 in few short months today I weigh 300 pounds. About two months ago I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed Bupropion and had gotten set up for sleep apnea test well I have severe sleep apnea. When I got out the military i didn’t return home, I moved away for college and struggled alone with undiagnosed depression. I let my depression and anger lead me to an engineering degree. My fear has been running into my ex-wife if I was to return home and she would see a loser, we divorced because she cheated on me twice and I tried staying with her but I couldn’t get over it and I did treat her badly because of it. 

Well everyday of my life has been hard I moved ten hours further away from home after college graduation because I am still afraid of running into my ex wife, I am working as an electrical engineer but I must look like a slob to everyone else, and people are nice to me because I fill they can tell I’m depressed, I am very low energy   because of the sleep apnea and depression.

I have an extreme conflict because my life’s greatest desire is to move back home so I can see my family and be with my younger brother and sister who I love very much, we been through a lot together growing up are parents had an ugly divorce and we lost our home to a natural disasters. But that fear has prevented me from moving home. I know if I got under 200 pounds I would have more confidence and move back home.

Today my brother and sister are kind, none of us do anything bad or what is considered illegal we are each very attached to our mother and we love each other very much. Well my baby brother who is seven years younger than both  me and my sister I’m 29. Has been struggling with his mental health lately I have just learned and has developed extreme anxiety, he is brought to tears and is having a tough time maintaining himself at work. 


My brother grew up with a learning disability and growing up in a small town and a mother who didn’t graduate from high school he was not adequately helped and struggles to read, he has worked at Walmart for about 3 years now. And I can tell he doesn’t believe in himself so I have tried to push him to try harder in the past and I now realize how wrong I was because although he appears normal and you would never know he has a learning disability I might have just been hurting his feelings. It anger me because his disability is overcome able and I fill since we grew up poor and in a small town he never received help other kids receive who are able to over come it. 

I am not lying when I say this but my brother is kind and innocent he is really a good person. He tries his best he doesn’t have much but he cares for others. He really takes things hard, harder than an average person would take things, he fills pain for other people’s losses, world events and the violence really weigh heavy on in him, for instance when Koby died he was really depressed. He is terrified of catching vivid at work and passing it to our niece and nephew our sisters kids, who my mom baby’s sit for, he lives at home with our mom.

I cried for my brother tonite because I am not there for him and I have wished so hard I could overcome my depression and anxiety so that I could finally move home, but I have tried and failed to get over it for years, this bupropion has not had any effect on me, and I have no self control and have grown fat my room and apartment is full of trash from eating out clothes are thrown everywhere I am embarrassed of the way I live and had not had a girlfriend since I got divorce, my car has trash from eating out as well and is an embarrassment inside as well.

But now I fill that I can overcome my anxiety and depression, I fill that I can lose weight, I have begun cleaning my apartment I have prevented myself from eating out which I do for every meal. I have began forcing myself to do the things that have been so hard for so long, because I am ready to fill better so I can go and be there for my brother whom I love very much and I know misses me if has been since last November since I have seen my family but I am going to take vacation and go visit them. I know how important family is and I would hate if my brother does something to himself and I wasn’t there for him because of my own depression and anxiety. I hope that I can succeed and have never felt so determined as I do now, it’s funny that sometimes what you can’t do for yourself you can do for others, I am going to succeed and move back home so I can be there for him."

330,Do you invent conversations?,"I usually have conversations alone. And when I'm in conversations is that I'm talking with other people, who can be celebrities, friends, family, animated caracteres, invented people or even unknown physical nonverbal voice. Is this something common for you? It helps me reflect any topic... I'm not worried just curious about it... 
What I mean by conversations is deep thinking with an answer from another person sometimes is an answer that no one is saying, and no I don't hear voices or anything like that, I just talk alone to other people that doesn't exist... 
Pls tell me if you know something about it..."
331,School and the pandemic has ruined my mental health,"I am an overachiever, my perfectionism has lead me to be top of my class throughout elementary and middle school. I am now a freshman, I am going to a medical preparatory, the work is unlike anything i have ever done before. The stress of school and the new rigor it brings has me feeling empty, like i am missing a part of myself. I can’t find joy or happiness in anything i do, not even when I succeed. I contemplate suicide on a regular basis, I simply do not see a point in living every day of my life not enjoying life. I go to bed every night wishing i die in my sleep. I don’t know what is wrong with me, I want to be a winner, i want to live my life, but there is an internal confliction. My mental state has gone down the gutter, i talk to myself and can carry a conversation with invisible figures in my imagination for hours and i am beginning to lose my memory. I have met with a counselor and she has done nothing. I have brought up the idea of moving schools, but my dad essentially said i was a pussy and started the whole spiel “back in my day”. I don’t know what to do, I have come to terms with the fact that i will not live past 30 and that i will die most likely at my own hands. I don’t understand how people can look forward to being adults. I don’t understand how adults can be happy working a job they do not enjoy, it is simply not a future i can imagine. I don’t know why i am the way i am, why i am so un-resilient, why i live everyday in constant mental pain. The effects are getting to me physically, they have been for the past couple months. I have lost close to twenty pounds and i cannot sleep at a reasonable hour, i only receive 3 hours of sleep. I just want it to end, this miserable existence."
332,A realization,"Note - The job is food service.

Disclaimer: I'm not looking for professional levels of feedback, I just want to see if anyone can relate/share things that may've helped them. All in all, I just feel like I need to get this out somehow.

About 2 months ago, I started a new job and it's been a smooth but bumpy start. This was a job that I had done before back a few years ago. Same company, just different location. Anyway, despite the tasks being familiar, there were some things that they do differently which is no problem. Depression has felt kind of heavy as of late though, and anxiety has also flared up. I'd worry about things like if my performance was lacking or whether I'm doing a good job, yada yada. Then there was another thing that kind of kept happening. 

Mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes. Big and small. A lot of which I shouldn't be making, but alas the amount of mistakes I'd be making on said job did impact how I viewed things. I wasn't being certified on more areas of my location and it made me feel like that the clumsy mistakes I made as well as my own performance caused them to not even consider let alone want me to be scheduled let alone certified in certain areas (i.e. Cash register). Haven't really spoken to anyone in management about this specifically because a lot of the time, we are very busy. I don't want to bother them. 

Sometimes when co-workers need help with something (i.e. a CW needed bread for the sandwiches but I had no idea where to get said bread), I just get confused and almost freeze in place. I try to ask for the help of someone more experienced and well, they are in the middle of something. I find that in the beginning especially, it was hard to understand a whole bunch of things that the trainers would tell me. Hell, I even had some grievances towards another coworker of mine who literally gets on people's cases (esp mine it seems) as to how they do their job and what to do on said job.  

The last time I worked (which was earlier this week), I sort of realized something. My depression may impact me on the job than I originally thought. Now, what I mean by this is that I remembered hearing/reading about depression impacting one's psychomotor skills. In other words, impairing someone's psychomotor skills. Confirmed it with my former therapist about the accuracy and well, it's true. It has impacted my understanding of everything, my speech, my ability to maintain balance, and even the ability to keep eye contact. I feel like this is has been happening to me for more than just a few years. 

I'm on medication for my anxiety + depression, but it of course doesn't help everything. Either that, or I'm just hyper-aware of psychomotor oriented things as of late. I have yet to meet with my therapist about it. I'm trying to figure out if I should bring it up to my employer to perhaps explain things a bit further, because it might be the polite thing to do. Obviously, I'm aware of having a learning disability and that impacting my training but I think the negatively impacted psychomotor skills play into the difficulty/ies on my end. 

Anyway... Can anyone relate to this?"
333,Interests,"First I must provide that I am diagnosed with BPD and I find a lot of difficulty in making decisions for myself and therefore I just coast by most of the time.

Now onto the show haha,
I have thought a lot about myself and why it is so hard for me to connect with people or form basic friendships. I have come to the conclusion that this is because I have never done anything interesting, I have any hobbies or passions, I don’t go out of my way to try new things, I barely even do my school work, hell, I haven’t ever even asked a girl out.
Through these realizations I have decided that I need to find a hobby to hopefully discover myself again and hopefully discover other people as well. 
Please help me think of hobbies or passions that I can look up and hopefully get into."
334,My father passed away from COVID 19. What do I do.,"Recently my father passed away, he passed away 10 days before my birthday. I’m 18 years old now but I feel like I’m not ready for the world. Many would say 2020 is the worst year but it truly is the worst year for me. This year I got cancelled, and the my father passed away from covid. The last thing he said to me was that he loved me and he’ll see me after he gets better. Now all I could think is how much I’ve been a disappointment and I just wanted to say I’m sorry for causing so much problems. I’m a freshman at college and I don’t feel motivated anymore. I’m behind in every class and I just want to sleep. I just feel sad, and every time I think of my dad I want to cry but he told me as a man I shouldn’t. I feel like suppressing my emotions would help me but I feel like I’m falling into a deeper hole of depression. What do I do."
335,Why am I so lazy and unproductive? I have no self-discipline,"I'm just wasting my life away basically, especially now that I haven't been working due to covid and relocating and Instead of trying to make use of my time, I just stay up late until 3/4 am and wake up at noon the next day. I keep saying I want to learn this or that or I want to do yoga. I start with something and maybe do it a few days and then I just stop,,I always discourage myself by thinking oh why am I learning this, what will I get out of it or I'm not sure if I want to do this or do something else more. I make up any reason or just stop for no reason..I have no real motivation to keep going and I've always been this way with anything I start, I never finish. I'm so sick of having no accomplishments and I'm almost thirty. I don't even think I'm even fit to be a mother someday with this unproductive mentality. I don't know what to do to change as a person and become more active. Any advice?"
336,Was I schizophrenic as a child?,"Hey there, not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here goes in case anyone else out there has experienced this. When I was a kid, from as early on as I can remember (so around 3 or 4) I would regularly experience auditory hallucinations accompanied by tinnitus. This lasted until I was around 8, and I can’t remember if they stopped or just grew less frequent or what happened. My first memory of experiencing this was when I was probably about 4 and I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom just listening to a quiet conversation between a man and a woman; it sounded like it was in the room with me. I know for a fact my mum was not in the house at the time because I went looking for her after this, and my dad didn’t live with us. Just for the record, we didn’t live in an apartment building or anything like that, and we also only had one TV and it was turned off. I would hear these indistinct voices for around 30 seconds to a minute before my ears would start to ring, and it began to happen more frequently. The last major episode that I can recall happened when I was around 8, and I was staying the night at a family friend’s house. I remember waking up repeatedly in the night, pacing around the room for hours, and every time I tried to lay back down I could hear so many indistinct conversations at once that it sounded like there was a whole goddamn city inside my pillow and I could just not get the noise to stop. It was literally like laying in the middle of a busy restaurant.

I had no idea at the time that this was not normal, so I ignored it and I’ve never spoken to anyone about it. My childhood was pretty traumatic and while I did suffer regular panic attacks and depressive episodes, I was never diagnosed with anything beyond a standard anxiety disorder. I’m 20 now and I don’t think I experience any of the textbook symptoms of schizophrenia, but I’m curious if anyone has a similar experience and I’d appreciate any input. Thank you in advance!"
337,"I (M16) have problems with isolation, hating who I now am, and get into bad habits and thoughts to the point where it affects the people around me.","I have developed a problem since late last year where I sometimes disappeared and didnt answer anybodies calls or text for days and it affected my life and how I work massively, Before this year, it was never a real problem, I would just got for a bit and come back and nobody would bat an eye after I just say I got grounded and had to do homework.


But this year I met someone that affected my life really significantly, she gave me my sense of style, my taste in music, my opinions on a lot of things changed and she made me an all around better person, I can honestly say I loved her and she never did wrong, I crushed on her and she sometimes kinda crushed, it never went further then that, she was taken quickly so I didnt bother but I still appreciated her in my life. There came a point tho where something in me just made me leave her and a bunch of my other friends, I isolated myself and ghosted most of them and stuck with around only 4 people, I would say that I was marginally popular but I hated it, I prefer being in small group but what I did was so fucking dumb. She is specifically all I think of when thinking of the people I ditched, she had a lot of problems at home, her parents where crack addicts, she lived in the ghetto, and her dad brutally beat her mom to the point of bleeding, and we where so so so so close, but when she was pretty much at her worst, I left, I really just fucking left like that, when she needed me most, she told everybody how much she loved me and how im her only and best friend, but I was so fucking selfish and left when she was probably at her lowest she probably hates me now and im glad, I hope shes happier without me, she doesnt need someone like me in her life. I dont see an excuse for what I did, it was horrible, and I havent felt the same since. Before this I thought I was a good person, I was always forgiving, I gave people the benefit of the doubt and always came off as nice and friendly and loved to help people, but that was just a good lie, I dont think im a good person, I hate myself, I am on the fatter side but have developed a problem with eating where I basically dont eat at all for a bit, not because I dont like how I look but because I now just see food as a waste of time and a shitty distraction that adds nothing to my life.


I know who I am but have always acted the same, I never faked myself for somebody cuz I never really needed to, but recently I felt like I lost that shine I had, that happiness and playfulness and absolute fucking idiot I had its not there, I recently just started acting like who I was a couple weeks ago to please and not bore people, I dont want to lose anybody else, I keep forcing myself to stay and not isolate because I genuinely love the people have I left in my life but I feel worse the longer I stay, I feel like there is an obvious change in me and that how im acting to be now is just a more annoying version of who I was a couple weeks ago, so I dont know if the better option is to just leave with a good impression, stay and fake it till I possibly get better but drive people away by the time I do, or stay and be my current self which is more boring, awkward, and less eager to talk. 


This year I have really hit my lowest I have never felt so lonely even tho I have all the people I want in my life, I feel hated by myself and everybody else, I nearly attempted suicide a couple weeks ago but failed to do so, it seems like I have no future with how shitty my grades are, and I have lost a lot of my faith after being religious my whole life and have started failing school and have missed my abusive dad for no reason, he is a horrible man and my mom is an incredible caring women but I just sometimes wish I could say I love him, as much as I hate him, I think that if he saw me now, I would really disappoint."

339,I Want to Cry but I Can’t,"Needless to say, this year has been rough for everyone. For the past few days I’ve wanted to cry so so so badly, but little to no tears come out. I’ve cried a lot this year. Could that be playing a part in why I’m unable to cry now? I’ve never experienced this before."

341,I recently lost a friend,I lost a very close friend after he turned toxic. He has been friends with this toxic guy for years and he started being toxic himself. I couldn’t take being almost bullied everyday and I miss him i tried everything. How long will I feel depressed and unmotivated like this and how are some ways to stop feeling like this?
342,I feel like I’m being watched?,"i have looked this up countless times, and it seems to be a normal thing that people feel sometimes. however, i feel this, all. the. time. and it’s starting to affect my daily life. i act as if someone is always watching me. when i shower, i cover myself. when i walk into an open room, i feel as if someone i know is looking at me. it fucks with me so much and i don’t know what to do. it’s not like i feel that someone random is watching me, no, it’s like my friends or an old friend is watching me. like an old boyfriend or maybe a girl from my club. it messes with me so much and i don’t know how to handle it. i know it’s not real, but at the same time i don’t? i feel like i have never felt truly alone. when i talk to my mom she simply brushes it off as “your ancestors are watching you :)” and it invalidates the hell out of me. i feel like i’m going crazy??? what would a psychologist say? i’m not hearing voices or hallucinating, i just feel like someone is there, even if a room is completed locked, no cracks or windows. help????"
343,"Coming off Paxil, any advice?","I've been taking 20mg of Paxil since January. While I was on it I was able to feel well enough to realize a the source of my anxiety and depression was ADHD. My therapist and psychiatrist treated my for ADHD, and now we feel there is no reason for me to take the Paxil anymore, and yesterday I started reducing the dose to 10mg. Yay me!

However I hear such horrible stories about withdrawal. I am going to wean off as slowly as possible. I am genuinely scared though. I accidentally went without it for about five days a while back after I moved to a new city, and the side effects were so horrible. It's been one day and I already have headaches.

Any advice for dealing with symptoms, or encouraging words in general, would be greatly appreciated! And honestly some success stories would really boost my confidence right now! How did you guys deal with withdrawal symptoms?"
344,Is mental health something that can be turned off when they want and be used as an excuse when they are caught doing something?,"Someone I know can act a certain way around people but when people who can discipline them are around they act completely normal and accuse us of calling making them feel crazy. Also when they are called out for doing something they shouldn't, they claim its their mental health. I want to know if this is attention or if its something actually wrong. Thank you. Asking cause of someone I know does this."
345,"hello, i am a 16 y/o student and my exams are not even a week away, and i thought i needed help.","so this week i have been feeling very down, low energy-ed and depressed. i cried tears out of nowhere, and everything in reality seemed so far away from me. it felt as if i was standing behind a glass wall and everybody else was on the other side enjoying their lives and i was just standing there watching, not being able to do anything. celebrities i used to be obsessed with didn't catch my interest at all, because i seemed to have lost interest in everything. i skipped meals because the school cafeteria felt so far away, and it felt as if it was a huge task to go there and eat. i also have lost my appetite, and i have been barely eating one meal a day now and even that is hard for me. obviously i am a student and it's the week before my mid terms and i cannot study- at all, when i'm feeling depressed. that depressing feeling has taken over my life almost every day and every hour now this week, and when the feeling is not there, i start to feel anxious about why the feeling is absent, as if the feeling was a part of me in the first place. i also have experienced some time of emotional confusion when the feeling was not there and kept on questioning myself what this feeling is, as an attempt to get a grasp of what this was, but was unable to figure it out. i also had several breakdowns, having locked myself in a bathroom stall alone trying not to worry anyone. now my exams are not even a week away and i am dealing with extreme guilt which has come from the feeling that i didn't try my best as a student, and my heart aches every time i think of my parents or my teachers. i have never been through this type of stuff before and this is affecting me by a lot, can someone help me or try to figure out what is going on with me?

I am afraid to talk about it because I feel they will just judge me, or won't understand me and what I am feeling. The times I have tried expressing my feelings, it just doesn't make sense to them or I am unable to explain it. 

I don't consider what I am going through to be ""hard"". There are a lot of worst things out there and what I am going through is nothing. But it is stressful too and annoying to have your brain constantly overthinking and it never stops. ugh!"
350,I feel depressed,Hi guys so I'm 24 engaged and a mother to two beautiful boys (2y &amp; 1y) we just recently bought a house and for the most part my life is great there's nothing I can pin point to tell you why I just feel so down all the time. I hide it but sometimes it gets to me ya know? Sometimes it's so bad I think of relapsing (I use to self-harm when I was younger ) I also feel hopeless sometimes like I'm just getting by. I feel unmotivated and like I'm not enough. I'm self conscious about my weight. ( 160 pounds) yes I know that's not over weight or anything but it's definitely pushing it. After I had the babies back to back I feel it was hard to bounce back to my original weight of 130. I know it seems like nothing but I feel like everything has been getting to me and I feel very sensitive. Any advice?
351,Please Anyone Just Help Me Stop Please,"TW for panic attacks. Just trying to be conscientious.

I had my first panic attack on Tuesday. Since then, I’ve had 4 more and I am losing my mind. I can’t take time off from school, I can’t go online because then I don’t learn, and I can’t go home because my parents are too far away. I am so scared, and I don’t want to think about these happening every day for the next month or something because I am going to pieces now. I just want to get away, and even though it’s been only a few days, I just know there’s no where I can go. 

I already know I’m probably blowing this whole thing out of proportion, but would it be possible for me to just go inpatient for a few days? I just want to get away from life, because it’s tearing me apart. I’m in Ohio, and I don’t know the laws around here for mental health. I just don’t know where to go, and everything is moving too fast or too slow.

Thanks for listening, I just need help."
352,Where can I go to ask what I have?,Based on the symptoms I feel like it’s schizo-affective but I don’t wanna just slap that label on myself without knowing more about it. Anywhere I can go to see what I have or it seems like i do since therapy isn’t an option right now.
353,What does this mean?,"I take great pleasure in the pain of getting slapped, cut, punched, bitten, and pulling my hair. Is this normal? If not does this mean anything?"
354,Can panic attacks be triggered by rage?,"I think I had a panic attack a few weeks ago. I've never had anything similar before, but I think it might be it based on how people describe it. 

You see, I lost something precious to me, and was unable to find it anywhere in my room. I even asked my mom where it could be, to which she answered that I should know. I was angry at myself because I couldn't believe something like that could get lost without me noticing right away, and that I was an idiot for not leaving it somewhere else (I often have the thought that I just can't do anything right, and everything good that happens to me will eventually be ruined by something stupid I'll inevitably do). I was pissed, truly. I think I would have punched myself on the nose if I could. 
I began to feel this horrible pressure on my chest, and I ran to the bathroom so no one could see me. I couldn't breathe, or at least it felt like the air wasn't reaching my lungs. I felt like I was slipping away somehow, and I could hear my heart hammering on my ears. I've never had a panic attack, but I think this was it, but I have my doubts. 

Can a panic attack be caused by anger instead of, well, panic?"

356,dissociating might cost me my job,"i’m not sure if i should put a trigger warning but just in case here’s your warning because i’m gonna briefly mentioned an eating disorder. i’m also sorry if this is long or if it looks funny i’m using the mobile version. 

so i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and binge eating disorder my senior of high school. at the time the only part i understood is the paranoia because my paranoid has ruled my life since i started high school. so everything else i didn’t quite understand what mania meant until about a year ago. but coupled with those issues i tend to dissociate. i didn’t realize whenever entering a depressive episode or a manic that i would also dissociate either during the entire thing or bits and pieces. i thought it was just normally to feel like all the days blend together or to disconnect from my surrounds and so forth. i’m still learning a lot more about my mental illness it’s not something i discuss with my family mostly with two close friends, my significant other, and of course my therapist. i’m coming to the realization that i can dissociate for weeks and months. which explains why the end of 2019 and the first three or four months of this year has been big blur. just a bunch of puzzles pieces with no pieces that fit. 

my manic episodes tend to last for some time. normally two weeks the longest a month. but i think this summer it’s gone on for the longest. at the time i didn’t think i was feeling or acting manic but now that it seems like it’s coming to an end or that i’m more aware i’m experiencing it. i just realized were in october i can’t recall anything that’s happen in august or september. i’m physically okay i haven’t harmed myself but other parts of my life have been damaged. so this is the part where i can potentially lose my job because of dissociation. half way through my shift today my manager brought me down to our lost and prevention room where i spoke to someone about stealing. part of it was a mix of external loses (people stealing clothes or giving counterfeit money) and internal loses( so employees stealing) and at first i thought maybe this is just a training but the person speaking to me asked if i was aware of any employees stealing. i recently heard some people who got fired so i said yeah and i happen to work with them in the fitting room which he already knew. we’ll call the worker who got fired Q for now. we spoke more about what causes an employee to steal and clouded thinking and it was right around here i realized oh i think i’m being interrogated. he started to say that Q was overriding stuff that wasn’t approved by a manager or stuff that employees didn’t qualify for. Q said i was apart of it. so he started asking me questions if i ever received any of those benefits. he also asked if Q checked me out in the last year that i answer yes cause it’s likely that they did. and of course i tell him no and any other questions similar or along the lines i still answer know. for bit i spoke about my relationship to Q and at some point he asked if i took something home by mistake. which at that point i admitted three years ago i took home a clip on button tie that comes with a shirt on the kids floor that i didn’t know i took home until i washed it later that week. he said he believed me and we joked about the button tie. it wasn’t a terrible conversation i didn’t feel like i was being  treated like a criminal but finishing the rest of my  shift left me in shambles. i thought everyone was looking at me as if i was a thief. i thought they were gonna call the cops on me. just all the worst case scenario thoughts. 

i thought they would stop there since it seemed i was in the clear but what’s giving me anxiety now is i realized i don’t know if i gave honest answers. like i wouldn’t steal from job there’s nothing there i need that badly so when he asked if i participated of course i said no. but i didn’t even considered that maybe this is something i could have done during my mania and i wouldn’t remember because i was dissociating.so now i’m kinda panicking thinking when i go in later today they’ll show footage of me stealing and be like can you explain this. and i wouldn’t know how. like i just told them i’m not part of this and then i’m gonna be like my mental illness causes me to disconnect from my body. just thinking about all the ways this can end makes my head hurt. 

as far as not wanting to lose my job during the middle of a pandemic i’m worried i might have done those thing. and maybe they understand and i don’t lose my job but because of how long i dissociate i’m worried they won’t think i’m capable of working so i’ll get my hours cut. 

i’m really sorry this turned out to be so long and potentially poorly written. i’m just really stressed and i feel like i can’t speak to my family about what’s happening or anyone like some how talking about the situation makes me guilty."
357,I don't have any talents.,"Lately it seems like I don't have any talents. I used to be pretty good at drawing and even animating, but for the past month I haven't been able to do either, nor have I really been in the mindset to. Whenever I 'just buckle down and do it' I often feel even more dissatisfied, and can't produce anything I'm remotely happy with at all. I'm not exactly smart either, so this kind of makes me worry I'll never be able to do much in terms of a career, like I'll be stuck in an unfufilling job that I hate for my entire life."

359,Sometimes I'm not sure how many more Octobers I can survive. [TW Sexual Abuse],"When I was really young something really terrible happened in October. I don't remember what it was, but I assume it had to do with sexual assault of some kind. I don't recall much of it, but from the ages of 3 to 5 I was sold for sex by my birth parents, and the effects of that have carried with me into my adult life no matter how much therapy I do or medicine I take. Every time October rolls around, I feel like I'm counting down the days until my depressive phase hits. It's been taking longer and longer, but honestly the intensity never gets any better and there are times when I genuinely wonder if I can survive through another year. I feel so sad, like someone really important died, and it hurts so bad that I feel like I'm going to cry myself to death. I honestly can't stand it and I don't know what to do. Nothing is ever enough.  


Sorry for the rant. I just have no idea how to make it better and I don't want to be a burden to the people I love anymore. There has to be some kind of solution, but nothing I do seems to help the sink."
360,I'm recovered by my eating disorder still owns me,"So I had anorexia for about a year or two, 2-3 years ago. I've been at a healthy weight for a while, but it seems like I was kind of forced to recover so that no one had to deal with me, and I still have a lot of unresolved issues with my body and eating habits.  My parents never really expressed much other than fear and confusion/minimizing behavior about it, and my mom is constantly hating on her own body, like CONSTANTLY. 

But anyway, I want to work out and be healthier, but my real motivation is losing weight. I don't care about my health, I just want to be thinner, and so I've basically avoided working out for a long time out of fear of starting the cycle again. Part of this is also laziness, but I have no real motivation to find time to exercise, other than losing weight. I'm not overweight, but I want to get a flatter stomach and all that jazz. And that's my only motivation. Is that ok? 

I still have thoughts when eating about restricting, and find myself questioning most food decisions. I tend to go ahead with eating junk food from time to time, but I tell myself it will cost me, it's exhausting. I constantly feel bad about my diet, and I know in general I should be healthier, but it's hard when living with my family since all the stupid junk food is right there. Also, I'm an EXTREMELY picky eater, so much so that sometimes eating just feels like a chore, and while I feel hungry, nothing satisfies it.

I guess I don't really know where to go from here...I have a therapist, but I just don't feel comfortable talking to her about this, I'm super trash at therapy...lmao"
361,Unhappy with school,"Hey. So I can't switch any of my classes at all, I dknt have any friends in my class which is all in the morning (830 to 1130) and all my friends are in the afternoon class (1230 to 330). It is basically impossible to switch over so im stuck being lonely in all my classes not talking to anyone and just doing the work.

It isnt fun, school isn't fun, with friends it was tolerable but without them im losing my hope and happiness.

Because of being unhappy my grades are going from 90s to 80s and slowly into the 70s. Which does not help with how I feel about school."
362,I need to talk to someone ASAP,"is anyone awake? i need to talk to someone asap abt relationship shtuff as soon as possible. im afraid i might kill myself tonight at the least, or soon."

I realize that certain laws for this vary state by state, but in general, could I be mandatorily placed in a psychiatric hospital for disclosing this information? What about contemplating suicide? If anyone has any specific knowledge about a situation like this I'd appreciate hearing it."
364,I’m so tired of everything hurting,"Normally I can escape some of the dread of having to act like everything is okay and I’m doing great by going to sleep or taking a nap or something. But I haven’t slept well in over a week. I just have nightmares, whether they be about me or someone that I care about (usually dying or missing or something). Every night I already dread having to wake up and face another day. It’s so tiring and I hate it. I hate feeling like this. I hate when it hurts so long that it becomes comfortable and a part of me wants this pain to last. 

Everyday I want to die. I keep crying and I’m so tired. I’m so tired of living being so draining. I’m so tired of being trapped in my own head. I’m so tired of crying for help. I’m so tired of feeling alone. I’m so tired of not being able to express this kind of emotion to my therapist. This isn’t living. How am I supposed to keep fighting everyday?? Why do I even have to? This is exhausting. I thought I lost the will to live weeks ago but I guess I didn’t, but now I just feel myself getting weaker. I hurt myself the other day. I swear I have a mental breakdown nearly every night. Idk how much longer I’m supposed to keep this up until I’m convinced death is a better option. I’m just so tired man. I don’t even understand why I came here to say this. Maybe it’s just me crying for help again."
365,I told my best friend about my trauma and she made fun of me,"So a few days back I ended up telling my best friend how I was abused as a child and now have a traumatised life where I can't act normal like I can't talk to others without panicking. At the time she supported me in her own way. She told me to call/message me anytime you want. This was the reply I expected.

367,Help for writting an Essay about mental health,"So for one of my high school classes I gotta write an essay about a social movement or revolution that I find important. I asked my teacher if I could do one about the mental health of men and they were fine with it.

As a person who deals with mental illness, I kinda find that men's mental health is kinda overlooked when compared to the amount of coverage that women and members of the lgbtqia+ get. 

I've tried looking around on the WHO and CDCs websites (among others) for information about men's mental health but almost all the information is either general statistics or is about women. Im not sure if It's me doing a poor job at researching, if its me not doing enough research, if its an issue that men's mental health isn't research as much as women's mental health or a mix of all of them thats causing me to have some difficulty with coming up with information for my essay.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is if I'm right for assuming that men's mental health is being overlooked by most and if I should write about men's mental health specifically or if I should change my topic to be more general or just change it to something else all together (I think I still have enough time if I need to change it completely)."

I take otc lithium because I don’t have health insurance... I feel like I put in the effort and do what people say to do. 

But sometimes it’s just so overwhelming to feel so much despair. I feel like I’m in this deep impenetrable fog and I misconstrue how I’m supposed to react to situations. Things can hurt so deeply but at the same time mean so little. I don’t think I’ve ever been closer to suicide in my life. I won’t do it - and honestly - I don’t really want to talk anymore about it. It’s just nice to speak to the void a little bit and hope that I’m not as alone as I feel I am."
371,"i was being groomed by my friends, my boyfriend cheated on me, now i’m stuck in my own head and can’t get out.","i need someone else to hear what’s been happening with my life lately. i’m really struggling and i just need help. i’m so confused. i’m sorry it’s so long. 

so basically my current boyfriend and i have been dating since february. we dated briefly last year, but broke up when i found out he had another girlfriend and i was the other woman. recently i found out that since we started dating again he has been sexting other women. i immediately broke up with him when i found out because i was so unbelievably hurt. 

During this vulnerable state two people i thought were my closest friends used my vulnerability to manipulate me. i actually realized a few weeks ago that they had been grooming me for several years. they let me live with them for months buying me food everyday and supplying me with drugs at no charge. they even at one point convinced me to have a threesome with them, which i thought was normal, but apparently isn’t. they also took advantage of my mania and convinced me to move to hawaii with them. so they bought me a one way non refundable plane ticket and told me it was a gift because they knew i wanted to escape. i’m pretty sure i was in a cult. we are all really into learning about cults and serial killers. they even asked me for my blood which i thought was just like a joke and nothing would come of it. so i gave it to them. they keep it in a jar with blood from some of their other friends. i know i’m dumb for doing that but at the time it sounded like such a good idea. 
when i had broken up with my current boyfriend they used it as an excuse to ruin his life. they knew that if they kept me high/drunk enough i wouldn’t question them. i was also severely depressed at the time and they used that to cause intrusive thoughts so they could control me. 

eventually my boyfriend and i started talking again. we have patched things up for the most part, but there are still times when i question everything. when my friends found out they basically just told me that i was the stupidest person they ever met and that they hoped he cheated on me again or that he abused me. it was around that time that my other friends started telling me they were worried about my friendship with my two friends. that’s when i started to realize that something wasn’t right. 

another thing that my so called friends did was try to set me up with their roomate immediately after me and my boyfriend broke up. he’s a really nice guy who i thought of as an uncle. keep in mind i’m 20 and he’s 41. they kept telling me to fuck him and that he wanted me. i was extremely hesitant, but both my friends and him used my unstable mental state and the fact that i was high 24/7 to take advantage of me. their roomate kept doing nice things for me to the point that he bought me little gifts all the time. he would tell me he just wanted fo see me smile. then one night he’d laid out rose petals and invited me to his room to watch anime. he claimed he was just trying to make me happy because i was sad about my boyfriend. he got me high and gave me alcohol and then tried to fuck me. when i said no he begged me to make out with him. he kept telling me that he had strong feelings for me and that one day we would be together. i didn’t want that and i told him multiple times. he just kept on trying. he would touch me without asking and try to kiss me. when i told my other friends i was uncomfortable they ignored it and just said they he knew i didn’t want that. he cried to me one night about how i was leading him on and i felt really bad about it because i didn’t want to hurt him. i still had feelings for my boyfriend. he said i was never allowed to complain that i didn’t have a good guy because i could always have him. it made me feel trapped. he even would write poems to me about how intense his feelings were and that my boyfriend was a monster. he posted them on facebook too. i ended up spending time with my boyfriend and their roomate found out and had a full on mental breakdown, broke a window and cried to all his friends on facebook about how i was a horrible person and hurt him. his sister seeing how distraught he was put roots on my boyfriend. my friends didn’t care and said they were glad my boyfriend had been cursed. 

when i mentioned my anger about it to my friends and their roomate and how i wanted my boyfriend to continue being in my life they basically said they didn’t care. that if he was in my life they didn’t want me. another thing was before i started basically living with my friends i lived with my boyfriend. i was taking meds for my bipolar and bpd, going to therapy twice a week. my friends convinced me to stop taking my meds so i could do drugs with them and told me that therapy was a waste of time so i stopped going. they just wanted me vulnerable so i was easier to control. both of my friends are also bipolar so i thought if they could do it why shouldn’t i.

my boyfriend and i ended up getting back together. i realized that a big part of him cheating was because when i was with my friends i literally acted like he didnt exist and wouldn’t talk to him for days at a time because i knew he wouldn’t approve of the things i was doing. i do hold him accountable for the fact that he cheated as well as acknowledge that my neglect of him was definitely a factor. he also has bpd and goes to dbt every weeks to deal with his own trauma. i love him more than anything and i want to be with him, but because of everything my brain is so chaotic. i have the worst intrusive thoughts all the time about him cheating again. it doesn’t help that my friends who i blocked on everything got so far into my head i genuinely do not know how to differentiate fantasy and reality anymore. when i start to get these thoughts it’s their voices playing in my head telling me that the cycle will just repeat. i don’t know how to get them out and i’m just exhausted and i’m getting so close to my breaking point. i really do not think i can handle anything anymore. i go to therapy every week and take my meds regularly again, but i’m still struggling so much. i just need some help or advice or kind words. anything to get me through all of this. i worry that i’m just gonna break."

they have home problems and depression and eating disorders etc 

and i’m just tired.. 

i just wish i could be brave like them. they were open and honest and i can’t do that. i just feel like crying constantly and hiding away because it’s just the constant feeling of drowning and guilt 

i don’t know what’s wrong with me.. i was so happy years and years ago i don’t know how i ended up like this.. 

i don’t want to be like this.. it’s exhausting putting up a mask constantly and i really just want to go back to bed and stay their till i die 

i don’t know what to do anymore.

well i have the meeting with my head of pastoral today at last lesson.. 

i just really need to talk. but i’m not brave like them.. i’m scared that i won’t say enough or that i’ll end up crying before i can explain.. 

i’m sure it’ll all be okay tho"
373,Tired,"I don’t know why I’m so tired. I sit in bed all day and I’m just so mentally drained. Can someone give me a reason suicide is so bad? And I don’t want any of this “ it gets better shit”. Is it really that selfish of someone to off them self? I think it’s selfish of someone to “need” someone to be here so desperately. I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong. I just don’t get it. No I don’t think suicide is the answer, but what is the answer. This world is so trash. You get close to someone and they eventually leave you, so what’s the point. I can deal with the voices in my head, they aren’t that loud. I can’t deal with this endless sorrow. It’s like I have no reason to be sad, but yet I spend night after night ignoring everyone because I feel so sad. I’m so privileged and I still want to die. Is it right for me to say that I want to die?
I don’t really have a good reason. I just want to. I don’t have a place in this world. I don’t know what happens after death. I’m trying not to get curious. Anyway, thanks for reading I guess. I know I’m crazy."
374,Depres-isodes,"So I have these things I like to call depres-isodes. I just get really anxious, usaually anger easy, and finally get depressed and usually think about offing myself during them. I think it's PMS since it's usually timed around my period (1 week before, during, and 1 after) . I'm in one now and my main issue is I know I should probably talk to a doctor about this but they don't last for long and I feel perfectly fine after like it didn't even happen. I noticed the episodes have been getting worse since I didn't have panic attacks like this before. I'm just not sure what to do. I know it will pass and I don't want to waste money by seeing the doctor for something that's temporary but on the other hand I know this isn't normal. I just want to know your thoughts on this I guess..."
375,Overthinking,"I overthink about the stupidest stuff. My muscles, appearance, how much water I drink, to my relationship, what I say to people if it sounds stupid, how I sound, being judged, what others think of me, etc. 

Its strange because a year or so ago I was the complete opposite of this and in a good place of keeping to a routine and staying busy. 

Wondering how I can stop this I think its contributing to my mental health and setting me back and messing up my sleep schedule at times. I am naturally a chill person and can live alone fine and feel secure when its just me and things are going, but one bad thing can mess me up sometimes and defeat me."
376,My experience in getting better,"I've had crippling depression for almost 5 years now. I have many friends, of course, most of them aren't real friends or my ""ride-or-dies"". They tried so hard to help me get better but to no avail. Whenever I felt suicidal, they would not leave me alone until I have the thoughts out of my head. While I do appreciate them, they really don't fill the void that I need filled. I've come to learn that, no amount of advice others give will help in any substantial way. Because your brain has wired itself to be pessimistic and when you ask people for advice, you're probably just looking for someone to relate to you rather than give you advice. But no one will truly understand you. Not friends, not family, and not even your therapist. 

After trying so hard to find something positive enough in my life for me to be pessimistic about it, I decided to take a different approach. To take the next best thing. I started stripping my life of all its negative elements. Fake friends, annoying online personalities, useless junk all around my room etc. And now, I'm not happy by any means, but at least, I'm not hopeless.

Just my two cents."
377,Feelings Friday,"Hey all, it's Feelings Friday!  


Here's a check-in writing activity for you: 

1. How are you feeling, this Friday? How did you feel this week?
2. How have the feelings been showing up for you (physically or mentally)? 
3. What steps are you taking to cope with, or to move through, those feelings?"
378,Depersonalization,"Around March of 2020 I took a tab and a half of acid and since then I’ve felt disconnected I haven’t felt the same at all I am starting to slowly stop hanging out with friends and doing stuff I usually like, I smoke weed every night to fall asleep and I cut nicotine and large weed consumption out I started to go to the gym and it’s been helping but only for when I’m there. I’m stressed out I can’t tell my mom I took acid but it’s really making life difficult and I don’t know what to do I can’t focus In school and I just need it to go does anyone know strategies to make it easier and not freak out randomly?"
379,How can I make peace with loneliness?," 

Short  version of the situation: I'm over 30, still live with my parents, work  a boring job, never had a girlfriend, barely started more-or-less  handling my mental health well, you get the picture.

I'm  not in a situation to find a lifepartner right now. I'm just trying to  get by and survive, that's what it's about, if I can do that for long  enough I might be able to get my own place to stay and have some  independance back so I can stop being a load for my parents.

But  what comes always back is the feeling of loneliness, made worse by all  my friends getting married and having kids on the way while I'm  defective. Mind you, I'm not here to be convinced that it's possible or  that I'm worthy or whatnot, I'm bitter, jaded and in general a cynical  prick. I will not put that on someones else's shoulders. But I'd like to  survive or even live with a bit less pain, and making peace with  loneliness seems an important step for that.

I'm  doing sports, cooking and writing a lot to keep myself occupied, but it  creeps back every now and then and it makes me feel bad. Do you have  any tipps or tricks on how to make peace with loenliness? It would be  appreciated, thank you."
380,How do you respect yourself when you don’t respect what you do for a living?,I struggle with this as I see so many in respectable jobs accomplishing things and I am only successful at volunteer crap and a total loser professionally.
381,I keep imagining death,"Not just mine, whenever I see someone around myself I just think of ways they might die accidentally, whenever I see any family members close doors to their rooms I literally hope they don't commit suicide... whenever I'm climbing the stairs I just imagine myself falling in every possible way. Last night I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about something cutting my lips with a sharp blade, it's hard for me to write this too. What should I do?"
382,High Schooler struggling to function and be taken seriously.,"Like the title says, I almost certainly have undiagnosed Inattentive ADHD. I'm not sure if this is also a factor, but both of my biological parents were also diagnosed, along with my current stepdad.

So all through school I've always been this ""Straight A, get all their work done"" perfect little student. I always got labeled as the ""smart kid"" or whatever by all of my teachers. They've used me as an example for being a good student in the past. Particularly in my early years I got this reputation of being a top student, and it stuck.

That's the problem. I don't know what to do anymore. I never was ""this super good student"" all my teachers, including my family, label me as. I've always struggled. I just masked it. I never studied for tests, I always procrastinated *all* of my homework/big projects until the night it's due. I struggle to pay attention in class and always end up staring at the wall, daydreaming or mainly doodling in my paper. 

I know this will sound excusey but I literally *can't* focus no matter how much I want too. And my second biggest problem is executive dysfunction. Like...my parents just see me as being lazy but I'm unable to function. Like there are things I struggle with someone at my age shouldn't. My room is disgusting. There are clothes and wrappers everywhere. I hate it. I want to clean it up so badly. But I can't. And I feel like everyday I say to myself ""today you are gonna clean your room no matter what"" but I never do.

I've always had this problem. My rooms always been super messy as a kid. My parents will yell at me, make me clean it, and then by the next day it goes back to being messy. Which I guess could just me being lazy and a slob. But it's different than that. I feel gross admitting this but I'm unable to shower or even brush my teeth. Like I just can't. I'll go days without doing either, although recently I've been getting better cleaning my teeth.

I struggle to get tasks done. I literally can't do anything. I won't go into details but I almost got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, which although I share some symptoms I really don't think I have. It is a possibility, but I feel ADHD is much more likely. 

My biggest problem is my grades. Like I said above I have this reputation of being a ""good"" student by everyone. And I can't handle it anymore. It's not the work itself, which is easy. But I'm just literally unable to start doing any of it. It's not that I don't want too. I just can't start doing it, no matter how much I want/need to. And it's really screwing me over right now.

My grades are plummeting. My teachers keep sending my mom angry phone calls. They are threatening to actually make me attend in-person school, which due to COVID I do NOT want to attend. I've never acted up in school before but if they made me go I would start skipping or something. There have been 4 cases in my school already. No way in HELL.

I know this will sound sad but I haven't really ""learned"" any of the material either. Like it just floats out of my head. Or I'll forget it by the end of the unit. Which I guess is pretty normal, but I'm unable to do math for my age. Like I don't know how. The teacher will bring up all of these operations everyone else should clearly know, that we learned about *years* ago, and I don't have a damn clue what she is talking about. I don't know how the hell I managed to pass before. But I definitely can't anymore. 

But I don't know what to do. No one is taking me seriously. Everytime I bring it up with my mom she just starts yelling at me, saying I'm lazy, that I'm smart and I need to straighten my act. She gets really angry at the slightest suggestion I may have it, at which she'll start saying she has it but she doesn't have these problems now does she.

She is opposed to medication, which I've brought up that I really need. Because I'm not able to function properly. This isn't normal for someone my age. But due to her own negative past experiences regarding medication she refuses to have that as an option and just tells me I'm making up excuses. 

My stepdad in particular just thinks I'm a pathetic, lazy POS who can't do anything and is setup for failure. If I bring up having ADHD he just laughs at me and calls me retarded/something similar. All of my teachers think I'm just being lazy and not doing the work due to playing video games or something like that. 

I have no clue what to do here. I'm sorry this turned into an essay. But I really can't handle this any longer. I feel really pathetic, and almost like a fraud, but I really need advice. I have a school social worker I'm on somewhat decent terms with, and we are scheduled to meet every two weeks due to my multiple suicide attempts last year. That was why they started saying I have bipolar. I did get diagnosed with severe depression, unsure if that's related. Maybe that is just the entire reason. But I have been like this most of my life, I just was able to mask myself better in the past. But maybe the depression/quarantine/being forced around my parents constantly (they aren't that friendly)/losing most of my friends is attributing to this? I'm not sure. I'm sorry this is an essay. I just really frigging need advice before I end up more of a failure than I already am."
383,"I was self harm free for 2 years, until today...","I had been 2 years that I was starting to feel good about myself and started controlling my emotions, but recently everything has started to burn again, and the exhaustion of the months of quarantine have got me. I punched myself some time and scratched my arm until it was open, I also punched my genitalias because I absolutely despise it.

So, 2 and a half years ago I was very depressed and rellying heavily in drinks until I found 2 best friends (F,F) and I as a closet trans woman made a very good friendship with them and for half a year it was the best I was ever feeling in life, being accepted and having friends, until one of them broke into a disagreement with me. She started to say I was a bad person that only thought about me, that got me a lot, but later the same day she started to trash me about my sexuality, and I had to cry to my other friend which I was starting to heavilly relly on, as I had no other friends.

In the end she kindda of agreed with the other friend and I couldn't see our friendship continuing. In the last years I desperately looked up to new friends but I only found a couple temporary ones, resulting in my burn and attrition of my mental health. 

Today all these memories were too strong and I was just too desperate and did what I said before. I am sincerely desperate as I don't have any friend to say this to, my parents don't support me and I haven't been able to open up with my therapist for months now."
384,I(18M) dont know if i was molsted as a kid and its really bothering me.,"Basiclly i show alot of the signs that i may have been molested at a young age but i have no memory of it or a good portion of my early childhood. I have trouble setting boundaries and saying no, uninitated physical contact from relatives makes me very uncomfortable, i dont remember my childhood up until about 10, i have cnc fantasies where i am the victim, im submissive sexually and want to please my partners over valuing my own sexual pleasure. I spoke to my therapist about it and she said theres a very good chance that i was molested as a child. Not knowing makes me uncomfortable and gives me anxiety when i think on it for too long. Just wanted ti get this off my chest i guess."
385,Online school is not a fun time for me.,"I thought I hated going to school but now as I am online I hate it even more. Everyday I wake up feeling anxious not knowing what's gonna happen. Online I can never relax because we have to discuss more and talk more. Also raise our hands which gives me the big panic. On top of that, the classes are 10 minutes shorter than they were last year and teachers talk so fast I can never catch on or write anything. They are also giving assignments and stuff to study when it's only our second week in school. I'm so tired and I feel so stupid because I don't think I can keep up nor understand. What's makes it worse is that the other kids seem to be doing fine talking and studying. I feel very dumb."
386,Cognitive Dissonance,"I’ve been isolated and alone since the beginning of this pandemic. I like art, math, science and I think I’m old enough to know what it means to have a strong work ethic. For example, got my first job when I was 13 because I didn’t like doing chores but I needed to do something to get candy from the candy store. 

Fast forward a couple decades, and now we have seen technology advancing at a rate that nobody could have predicted. 

Now I hate to say this, but, “back in my day” we had to learn about things that we were interested in from doing our own due diligence. Whether that be spending time at a library reading through books or asking someone smarter than us, like parents or teachers but mostly teachers because they specialized in their area of study. 

We didn’t have YouTube until I was in senior high and I can’t tell if this was a blessing or a curse. If you know what you are looking for, YouTube probably has a video explaining whatever it might be to some extent. Or eat least enough to help someone figure it out on their own. 

Now we have 2020, an election year and a public health crisis that nobody wants to believe because of the cognitive dissonance in the form of misinformation on the internet that is spreading like wildfire in the algorithms designed by social media. 

In the year 2000, my mother used to yell at me to stop playing video games and to get off the computer so she could make a phone call. It don’t work like that anymore and now I watch my mother scrolling her life away staring at her Facebook feed and melting her brain watching crime TV shows. 

WTF is wrong with everybody? Has everyone forgotten how to learn new things and do their own due diligence?

Why is everyone believing the lies on TV and the internet and why the fuck doesn’t anyone want to help anyone anymore?

The most common responses I get from friends and family members lately when I ask for assistance are:

• I don’t know how to help you...
• I’m busy...
• I don’t know what to say...
• I’m tired...

And then I get ignored. Well, my problems still exist and it’s been over 6 months since any of my friends or family members have spoken to me. 

Wake up you stupid mother fuckers! Your feed isn’t going to figure everything in your life out for you and your friends and family members (especially the introverts like me) are losing their minds and it’s trending.

I’m fortunate enough to have found a new joy for reading. Back in high school I hated language arts but I’ve discovered the true knowledge and inspiration you can find in a good book. 

You just have to realize that everything takes effort, some stuff is hard, nothing is given to anyone that doesn’t try. 

Stop wasting your god damn dopamine scrolling through your fucking phones all day making you tired watching other people do cool shit.

When someone asks for help, fucking help them or at least talk to them. 

I’m sorry for offending everyone, I’m just so fucking sick of being the smartest person in the room. 

It’s time for me to move on and surround myself with smarter people once again so that I can be happy but I’m fucking struggling and I’m stuck.

I’m not crazy, I’m just fed up with lazy, justifiable excuses for being so busy being busy that I get ignored by everyone.

I see what’s happening to you because I’ve done the fucking research. 

We all need help sometimes and most of the time, if we ask for help from someone that doesn’t understand how, what, or why...don’t ignore them.

I don’t know how to ask for help because I’m dealing with a completely new situation and I understand that you probably don’t either, it’s a pandemic. 

Calm down, it’s really bad, but ignoring someone you love and care about doesn’t show them that you really care. 

That’s why suicidal thoughts are on the rise...but just remember, I’m not the one that made the truth hurt. But I am the one that is being brutally honest. 

Nothing beats a good phone call, emotions are lost through text messages. 

I’m actually very happy writing this because I’m sick of watching people struggle like me and it’s time that people realize they can be fine just the way they are if they get the real attention they deserve.

Work hard, be nice, stay human. Unplug yourself from time to time so you can breath. It’s going to be ok, as long as you can wake up tomorrow and try to do better.

Get some sleep, it’s good for you. Being kind and helping someone else will really mean the world to us/them. 

Hope this helped someone struggling. It’s generalized toward all my friends and family members that don’t want to hear it but I needed to get it out."
387,I just feel like i can’t do this anymore.,"I’m gonna start this off by saying i haven’t been in the best moods recently. I have just been down alot.

I have recently lost one of my best friends and i don’t even know why. She basically just stopped talking to me out of no where. My other friends are drifting away. It’s just all messing me up. 

I haven’t been eating properly for about a week and i just don’t feel like myself anymore.

Everything just seems to be getting worse and worse.
Whenever i feel happy it doesn’t last for long.
Even if i try to make new friends i struggle alot because of anxiety making me overthink everything and saying i can’t do anything right and i’m scared of being judged. ADHD makes it harder because i can maybe come across as rude or not listening when i’m trying my hardest to. 

I have just been crying last night and i’m trying to hold it back this morning but i can’t. 

I can’t do anything right.
I build up the courage to ask my teacher a question out loud and got called stupid by a classmate and it just completely ruined my confidence and everything is dragging me down.

I just feel like i can’t take this anymore but i’m going to have to. 

I have been on and off my meds mostly due to forgetting them or i just don’t want to. 
They want to make me see someone to try and get more confident and possibly diagnose me with fkn autism,  but i don’t want to and i’m kinda scared to. 

I am hearing voices in my head just calling my name. Call me crazy it’s kinda scary and i don’t know why it’s happening. 

I’m just slowly drifting away from that saying “i want go live”. Because i just mess everything up, i can’t do anything right and i’m loosing friends and one just left without telling me why. 

I’m done with feeling like this and crying and stuff. I don’t like it. My ADHD, i get told that it isn’t real and i don’t have it because i can focus in 1 lesson. I can focus in that lesson because i like it and the teacher is nice and there is no distractions. 

I get called stupid for it because i’m slower than most people in class and i sometimes need extra help. 

Exams are coming and idk what to do. It’s starting to get to me because i struggle to study and revise and catch up on the mountain of homework i need to do. 

I just don’t like myself anymore. I don’t want to see someone to help be more confident or have another diagnosis. I have already got things wrong with me and don’t need another. 

My family are all nice, that they are basically the ones who keep me going. Also, a few people on here that they probably know who they are, help alot. I just want to say thankyou to those who help."
388,i feel like a burden,"i (f) been in a long relationship w my bf, and i’ve dealt with mental health issues for a long time before i met him. 

i’ve been dealing w being raped by a close friend in high school and sexually abused when i was a child, and a severe anxiety disorder that formed as a result from trauma from my childhood and from bullying. i’ve had severe droughts of depression where i had suicidal ideation but never carried out - mainly just wanted to disappear from existence, while not burdening or hurting others around me. 

my bf has never dealt with mental health issues before he met me, and even tho we’ve been together for 4+ years, the more we get comfortable the more i feel like.. i’m a burden and he doesn’t want to understand. i’m not trying to blame him for anything - i know how difficult it can be to deal w a SO that has severe mental health issues. i also know that along with becoming more comfortable with each other, the more i’ve lashed out or let my mental health issues affect the way that i speak to him/act towards him. but now, i just also feel that he doesn’t really care to understand, and if we sit down and talk about things it always starts off in a huge fight or argument and then eventually ends with apologizing and resolutions on how we can “be better.” 

i just don’t think we have been working to be better though. i haven’t really seen him do individual research on what anxiety looks like in different people/situations, i haven’t really seen him make an effort to ask me more about why i may feel the way i feel about things. i just don’t feel like he’s interested in all of that anymore. i’ve gotten to the point where i’m annoyed with myself and how much i use my anxiety as an excuse for how i’m feeling or why i do certain things in the way that i do them - but at the end of the day it really is the only true explanation behind my words/thoughts/actions that i can give. 

i just feel like at this point i am a burden on everyone. i don’t even want to open my mouth anymore because if i do i know that i may say or do something in a certain way that will result in an argument, and i’ll have to explain that it was because of my anxiety again. 

i feel like i am trying my best to do better and be better,  but it’s so incredibly difficult to be the first one to do that. my bf does not deal with mental health issues, but i do - so when we have a conversation about something, i can be more sensitive about things that he is. so is it wrong if me to want him to be more patient with me and try to help me be better by him being better? is it wrong of me to feel like... if he was just slightly more patient with me in the beginning and showed me that he actively wants to learn more about me and my emotions, that i will also start to feel more understood and heard by him... therefore making me less prone to acting out a certain way? is it wrong of me to feel like i want him to initiate the change in being better? because i feel like if i try to initiate that and he doesn’t show that he is actively trying to be better while i AM trying to show that i am trying to be better... i will not be able to make any change? 

i don’t know if any of this makes sense but am i selfish for thinking this way? i feel like such a burden even thinking like this and asking for that  but i feel like he is more oblivious to things when it comes to anxiety and emotions and i feel so discouraged to share anything or talk about anything deeper w him even though we’ve been together for 4+ years. 

sorry for the word dump, i’ve got so much on my mind and i don’t rly know how to eloquently word it. he’s not a shitty partner at all - he just lacks in the emotional intelligence department a whole lot bc he’s never personally experienced it before being with me."
389,I don't know what I'm feeling so many things are happening,"To start off I've been constantly having mental breakdowns i just explode into hitting myself while I breakdown in tears or sometimes I hold my head while crying and rocking myself. My friends keep asking me to hangout and I always have to decline because of covid and my grandmother who is well into her 80's which I have to constantly remind them I can't because my grandmother recently made a 5 hour trip back here in California because she lived alone in Nevada, as a 22 year I can't be selfish and go out I have to take my grandmothers health into consideration. Last week I went to the hospital for sever abdominal I informed the staff that I don't have a gallbladder anymore in which I had to get an MRI I spent 5 hours in total in the E.R. they told my I have inflammation in my stomach lining and proscribed me medication the pain still persist today which makes it harder for me to focus on schooling, I started getting cavities i called my dentists office and they told me they discontinued my health care which resulted me into finding a new dental office one dental office after another i still could not find an office to take my health care plan i become so frustrated, I also called my clinic for my abdominal pain that I'm still having only to find that my clinic also no longer taking my health care plan and I honestly feel so defeated that this is happening to me. My grades started slipping I'm constantly in a loop of homework and studying one quiz after another along with lab assignments, readings and essays that are being thrown at me left and right to the point of me breaking down, I barley have time for myself I'm constantly busy with college to where I don't go to bed at 2 in the morning A long with dealing with my health on top of it taking care of my grandmother and helping around the house due to her age. A while my friends keep asking to hangout and recently I felt like going off on them just wanting them to understand why I can't hangout and it's always the ""your always busy"" and ""I guess"" . I wish they understood what it's like being in my shoes constantly going to the hospital, trying to keep up my grades the class work becoming harder I'm failing some quizzes, reading and constantly typing up essays. The countless mental breakdowns, looking for a new dental and doctors office, taking care of my grandmother, telling people I can't hangout because of covid and them telling me I'm always busy and it's adding on more stress, I also suffers from depression and anxiety and it's hard getting an appointment with my therapist. Today one of my friends kept texting when I told them I have so much going on i can't talk right now and they still kept texting me to the point they started to double text to quadruple texting me to the point I had a mental breakdown so bad it scared my sister yelling at me that I'm a psycho, I have so much going on i honestly to know what I'm feeling or what is wrong I don't know why everything is happening I have two months left of the semester I just want this to be over, it's hard finding new offices to see who'll accept to see me with my health care plan I feel like giving up, I'm extremely sad to where I just don't want to deal with anything anymore or anyone, I'm mentally and physically exhausted I just want time to myself I just want people to leave me alone for a while to get everything sorted out in my life. I don't know what's happening in my life I don't know why I'm feeling. I wish everything was normal but with covid I have to live life differently I choose not to hangout with my friends because my grandmothers Health comes first, homework, reading, quizzes, and essays need to be done and new assignments must be started be because everything is due Tuesdays to Sunday and the cycle repeats, I need to find new clinics and dental offices, there are days when my pain becomes bad where I'm in bed. I don't know what to do anymore."
390,Self-study + strange questions about normal experience of empathy,"I know it may sound off, even spoiled. Maybe it's a way of texting my twisted inner life away. But I've been struggling with this dilemma for long enough on my own to give a shot to questions (at the end).


Sorry if my writing is pretentious, it's the way thoughts arrange in my head. Context will be long, there is a bio in the comments. I intend to keep it as a very definitive self-reference (and I am bold enough to be public about all of this).


#### Why curious? 

A person who has become emotionally very important to me seems (to me) to be going away after crossing a critical point in her fight with depression/anxiety. I was one of the people to support her through her condition with my modest means given the circumstances.

Talking with her about her subjective experience of many aspects of life has revealed two aspects which are significant to me:
- she is not her depression/wants to not be her depression (with nuances);
- from an attitude POV, she sounds more like the sort of things you'd read in a 
standard ""15 healthy things happy/life-loving/successful people do""; more importantly, you could see streaks of this personality looking back even at her bleakest periods, almost as if her disorders were an idiotic ""bug"" of an otherwise very natural, bright, curious, people-cherishing, life-affirming human being;

I actually often notice this in a class of people who emerge out of their problems: mindfulness, self-discipline etc, AND a sense of valuing oneself, things (a direction or goal, a raison d'être) and humans. 

I mention these because this mirror put in front of me by our interaction showed me just how much I stand in contrast not just with her, but with apparently the vast majority of the world.




#### My situation

Most of the time I am solitary, numb and uninterested. Of life, the beautiful humanity and importantly myself. A chunk of my brain wants me gone, ""quit the game"" etc. on basis of, say, my body being ~~junk~~ the vehicle of a decidedly bad life story (incl. anticipation of future). Also some very serious cognitive rigidity enables strong resistance to change/disinterest to enhance self (I don't have solid goals, passions, interests to offset this, despite being exposed to many activities as a child).

I don't know if I ever developed care for others. Example: unlike many posts I read around here, I wouldn't care if my parents or witnesses suffered because of my death/suicide. I don't cherish others and get quickly jealous of their well-being and enthusiasm. I repress an enormous, self-absorbed hunger for acceptance. I am prone to be vengeful on those who hurt me knowingly or not: I respond quite coldly or quickly discard my relations. Never physically violent, but predisposed to some forms. Emotional pain and bad memories are very easily intrusive. IMHO genetics play an important role in these dispositions, alongside my bad environment (high neuroticism).

I don't think the world is beautiful or that humans (including myself) are beautiful. To me, it's a quasi-deterministic, flat-valued, universe. And most humans I know look like ruthlessly opportunistic self-optimizers, which makes me wary of engaging with them – it always feels like I'm used and easy to outsmart (emotional intelligence-wise).


#### What I have done

I went to therapy for my issues when I had the resources. Addressed some of my problems, learned strategies for various situations (emgm decreasing my tunnel vision) and for tricking my brain into doing small changes. 

The cynical views and short-term social behaviours are somewhat controllable – I did decently well with shallow, distant, short-term relations anyway with a proper mask when willing to put the effort. The surfacing of my gloom, lack of enthusiasm or artificiality of my attempts seem to eventually bring about the ""no one wants an energy drain around"" attitude from others, and subsequent delimitation.

One of the difficult areas of being like others is empathy (not sympathy). I have not recognized it as naturally occuring in my social interactions across my life, to the point that I wonder if I am naturally deficient or so impaired that I cannot bring it out. I am used to observing cruelty and dysfunction and am not quickly affected by it unlike upbeat people around me (I don't flinch much unless I am the recipient). 




It begs several questions:
- can someone who is healthy explain to me like I am five: to you, is empathy spontaneous, is it intense, did you have to learn it? I can read descriptions of mirror neurons all day long, not seeking a neurologically-centric answer;
- should I suspect myself of antisocial predispositions?
- how to try and handle this: accept the callousness and its repercussions and sink in my solitude, half-heartedly try some more, do a brain scan (probably return to therapy) when I have the money etc."
391,What are these “visions” I’ve been experiencing?,"I don’t know how to explain them. It feels like a vision/flashback, as if I know what it’s like to experience these happenings but I know they’ve never actually happened to me.. this doesn’t make sense but I’ll try to explain. It’s basically a graphic vivid image I see in my head that feels real. It sends a shooting pain through my body.

Ever since I was little I’ve had these “visions”.. these vivid images that pop into my head of awful things that have never happened to me. I have a physical reaction to it but I wouldn’t have any idea what it would feel like for real. For as long as I can remember, this is what I would see... it was something razor sharp near me about to cut me, my physical reaction to the images is blinking hard, shaking my head and then it goes away. Over the years it progressed to the thing actually cutting me on my body, then it progressed to my face being sliced, then it progressed to being near my eyes, then my eyes being sliced, now it’s images of my eyes being scooped out. I can’t close my eyes in the shower or I have images of my toe nails being ripped out and my eyes being sliced. My reaction has remained the same but progressed a bit, I blink hard while shaking my head left, right, left, then right again, sometimes making a small sound and then the image goes away. I only make the sound when it feels particularly real, it’s a small sound, barely noticeable. Recently the images have been coming back multiple times in a row instead of going away.. I couldn’t sleep last night because I kept seeing the vision of my eyes being carved out. I don’t know what this is, it feels almost identical to a flashback except it never happened obviously. I have the same reaction to real flashbacks, but I can differentiate between the real and the fake. 

I don’t understand, I’ve had this since I was little and it’s only getting worse. I’ve always known it’s fake and I thought it would go away but I hate that it affects me enough that I have a physical reaction to it. Does anyone else see violent images like this? I’m so confused and I don’t know how else to explain it."
392,I thought I had a breakthrough,"Sorry if this looks horrible, I'm on mobile but I just need to get this out. Standing up for myself has always been hard for me. Harder still when I am punished repeatedly for it. ""HOW DARE YOU"" they seem to say ""HOW DARE YOU ASSUME YOU'RE WORTH ANYTHING MORE THAN HOW WORTHLESS WE BOTH KNOW YOU ARE"". As much as I could never stand up for myself in the past, only lashing back in pure desperation, this time I turn towards my old father with determination. I have not a gram worth of love or compassion left for this tyrant. I tell him how worthless I think he is, how worthless he's made me feel, how much his words and judgements no longer mean anything to me. Then I turn around and walk away, as usual. I will need to cool down, regain my wits and balance and mend my composure. Then I can come crawling back, child that I am, and ask forgiveness for my childish words and wrongful thinking. But I do not have to. My old father, not by blood but none the less important to me, puts a hand on my shoulder. I anticipate the worst, but instead I hear his voice, more soft and meek than I have ever heard him. He tells me that he understands, gives me some last bits of parting advice, make sure you take care of your car when you get one, if you look at the sunset like this one from a certain angle the whe sky seems to be filled with rainbows, one day you may need to have this talk with someone else. The one thing he never says I can read in his voice. I am no longer a child in his eyes, I have outgrown his care and control and I have no longer use for his words and teachings. Then he leaves me there on the hill overlooking the football field, in the setting sun. And then the dam breaks. I can feel years of dried up paper mache and plaster crackle and break as the enormous flood of tears and screams and cries come to the surface. I finally cry again, both tears and emotion and howls, and as much as the cracked rests of my shell hurts against the torrent of pain, I feel free. I feel like things will change, finally. 

Then something goes wrong. The stage light stops shining, the field and sun both vanish into wisps of smoke and mirrors. My shell of plaster and paper crumble to dust as bands of stainless steel and chains of iron suffocate the emotional freedom of crying. I remember. I realize. I wake up. These are my true bindings, not the ones I could so easily break through. My father is not there of course, nor is the sunset or the hill. The hill isn't even real, just a wrongful interpretation of places from reality that don't fit together that way. I can almost here an audience clap and laugh at me, how silly of me to believe my suffering would cease, even for a moment. But there is no audience. Just me in my bed and an empty bedroom. The crying is all gone now, barely an echo in the rigid and sterile structures of what my mind has become. Reality has set back in, the clock has starting ticking again. I have things to do, a cruel joyless life to live. My stepfather hasn't talked to me in years. I haven't been able to cry for a few more years than that. I have no other words to describe my current emotional state more fitting than the clichéd ""dead inside"" and outside of the mocking dreams I keep having this is how things will forever be."
393,What Causes Mental Illness That You Should Know?,[removed]
394,I can't stop overthinking,"I've been in dark places before, but there has always been a reason, so whenever I realise I'm in a bad state of mind I have always found an outlet to help subdue my over active mind.. be that music, art, writing etc. However I have recently fallen hard into an awful mindset and I have absolutely no idea where it has come from, so I am struggling to find an outlet to handle it, I thought I was happy.. but I feel awful, and its messing me up because my heart and brain are giving me two different signals.

When I begin to slip my brain starts working over time, friends become my enemies, family become strangers, a compliment becomes an insult and simple day to day activities become a chore, I push people away for their own sake, so they don't have to handle me being a miserable depressing sod. I would never wish this state of mind upon anybody, going to sleep with a headache, convinced you're everybody's least favourite person, a burden to those around you is nasty. I struggle to eat, I feel alone and afraid, and nothing in life seems worth it, all because my stupid brain won't shut down, my head just hurts.

How can I help myself? How do I stop making things up in my head that cause me emotional pain, I know none of the things I think about are real, but that doesn't detract from the pain and I'm scared of convincing myself the false thoughts are true."
395,how do I help my near-catatonic depressed sibling?,"they and i are both in our early 30s. we both have a lot of mental issues but our main differences are that i have a semi-stable career and my sibling has nothing.

they won't seek medical help, look for jobs, apply for education or anything. they're basically just sitting at home being depressed with their equally depressed partner. stopped taking antidepressants last year for god knows what reason.

they started skipping school a lot in high school and it just never got to a point where they could handle adult life on a day-to-day basis. they've had some internships , but that was years ago and they didn't end amicably. work experience is probably 5 months in total.

as a socialist, i feel sad about their position in life and doubly so because of the mechanics of capitalism which puts them in this Bear-trap of a life. i don't feel wealthy or mentally stable enough to support them with housing, let alone their mental illness. our parents are doing everything they can to financially support my sibling, and we're all barely keeping our nose above the water emotionally speaking. wit's end.

they told me that they've realized that they're basically just dissociating constantly. which explains a lot of their behavior.

PS we are not americans."
396,How do I stop crying when I try to talk about the abuse my mother put me through?,"Long story short: my mother was extremely abusive to me when I was young, both mentally and physically. Now that I’m an adult and have moved out to a different country, she just acts like she’s the victim in all of this and as a mom, she has the right to hit me whenever I did something wrong (I’m from a culture where parents beating children is seen normal but the difference is, my mum would beat me up for absolutely no reason at all sometimes. And the beating was with various objects, punching, hair pulling, etc.). Emotionally, she used to put me down a lot when I was young by degrading me. 

Whenever I try to talk about it with my partner or my siblings (she never abused my other siblings btw), I just start crying and shaking a lot to the point that I am unable to say everything that she put me through because of how much I cry and how much my throat starts shaking. There are times when I cry myself to sleep as I think about all the shit she put me through as a child/teenager and what a messed up person I’ve become today. 

Can anyone please tell me what can I do to overcome this? I don’t want to be weak like this anymore. I want to be able to talk about this without the tears. I don’t want this to bother me anymore."
397,Waited an hour for help after calling 911,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this.

Waited for the counselors they said were on the way. No one ever came, called again and was told that they reported they did arrive and that they already spoke to me. I was standing outside the entire time. I feel like Im always dropping everything for others, and no one else is ever there for me in my times of need. I finally found the courage to seek help, and was ghosted by emergency responders as well."
398,Mental illness and relationship,"I just broke up with up with my girlfriend and I have no idea what to do. I currently have HOCD and sex addict, but I never told it to my girlfriend. I did my best to satisfy her and make her feel that I love her. But inside, my internalized HOCD and sex addict have made me feel shame about myself. Now I feel like my mental illness devastated my relationship.

&lt;About my HOCD and sex addict&gt;
Long story short, I had a multiple gay experience with my friend since when I was 15 yo. Dominating a sissy guy as a teenager just felt so good for me. I was young and immature, but I've done pretty much every kinky stuffs with him...all the stuffs I've seen in porn videos. It just felt great and I haven't really thought about my sexuality back then.

But I suddenly felt so ashamed about my past experience and started to suffer from compulsive thoughts about my sexuality. I identify myself as straight since I'm only attracted to girls, but the past experience is making me confused about my orientation.

I still have dominant &amp; sadistic trait and I'm not ashamed about such traits. But the fact that I've had a sex with a guy makes me feel awkward and embarrassing. But at the same time, I wasn't able to stop having a relationship with my friend. Satisfying my kink felt so intense and it made me feel the ecstasy. This led me to sex addiction.

&lt;Breaking up with my girlfriend and my intentional drug overdose&gt;
Now after I broke up with my girlfriend, I fell into deep depression and took 20 doses of xanax pills. Luckly, my sister found me and took me to an ER. I wanted to kill myself but sadly or luckly I saved my life. I saved my life but I feel lost. I have no idea whether I can find a new partner or even live a normal life.

Will I ever be able to make a girlfriend?
Would I be able to cure this kind of mental illness?
Please anyone help, I'm totally lost.

Sorry for my rant and bad English. I just wanted to get some advice from Redditors. I hope y'all are doing well in these difficult times. Thanks for reading."
399,Hearing Voices,"For months now I've been struggling with anxiety and  feeling low at times. At first I thought it was a medical issue, but my results came back normal. What concerns me is that I'm hearing sleep related voices/sounds and getting vivid mental images/dreams. I went for a mental health assessment and was told it's probably stress. Something just doesn't seem right and I don't feel myself. I still keep up with my daily routine, but tired of feeling miserable. I'm not sure if this is signs of depression or early psychosis."
400,Parents fight everyday,"Hey guys .. I had set out to write about my mental health some time back but I could not keep up with it due to my exams. 

My entire childhood has gone seeing my parents fight. I really lack self confidence due to it. I'm always scared. I always feel chained and I never live freely. 

My father doesn't yell at me much. Probably because he wants me to think he's a good person. BUT he is always belittling my mother. Every mistake I make... He yells at mom. He has been abusive to her as well. He doesn't really say anything to me but I've stopped thinking of him as my father. I really can't forgive him for how he behaves with my mother. 

I'm always scared of trying new things. What if I fail? What if he starts fighting with my mom again? 

My mother is not ready to leave him because my grandmother is not in a condition to bear the news of my mother's failed marriage. My mother's brother also got a divorce and my grandmom took several years to process the pain and move on. My mother is too restricted to take a divorce.

He majorly thinks that my mom is there so that he can dump all his stress from work on her. Very fortunately. My mother is not that kind that sits back and takes all the abuse. She works as a teacher at a prestigious school and earns for herself.. probably more than my dad. She is not dependent on him at all. Infact my father is dependent on her but he still has a million tantrums.

Everyday I pray to god to put my mother at ease. To do something that my father changes his behaviour and starts treating her with respect. I've tried speaking to him about it but he shuts me off by saying I'm still a kid and I don't understand anything about the real world.

All of this really drains my energy. It is a lot to handle. Every fight I feel that he might hit her again . I cannot see that and I'm filled with rage even at the thought of this. Everytime they fight I feel like he might just hit her again. I cannot stand this at all. I don't know what to do. I'm losing sleep.. severe hairloss .. my grades are dropping. I need help

Thank you"
401,I feel like a background character in other peoples lives,"Despite being a massive extrovert with bags of characters and tuns of hobbies I always feel like the person nobody cares about. Growing up the black sheep my family didn't really get what I was doing any left me to it. I lose contact with all of my friends as the move onto better stuff and any attempts to catch up are indifferent. 

New people will stop talking to me over tinder very quickly and looking at my friends who do well on there, I can't see what I'm putting different to them. Or ending up the only person not getting attention at parties... again I can't see what I'm doing different.

I see so many people from school meeting up for drinks after so long and I've never been able. In a group of 3 I'm always the one just kind of sat there. The only serious girlfriend I've ever had said she realised she never loved me. At a slight bit of drama which wasn't my fault a friend managed to have over 40 people delete me off facebook because he was worried I would say something so to protect his reputation and not one of them bothered to ask my side of the story (not even sure what they've been told). 

1 of my friends fell out with another group of friends and even though I wasn't involved they stopped inviting me because there was no point in me coming without him, which means I was never seen as more than his sidekick

Even hanging with people purely who have the same interests as me I end up being left out. Despite all the compliments I get for being funny, having good insights, the confidence it seems like I'm never anything more than background decoration. This has been a constant throughout my life and I genuinely can't face the heartbreak of carrying on anymore"
402,A living failure.,"Even though the psychiatrist have diagnosed me as a high functioning autistic with OCD and residual schizophrenia, deep down I view myself a living mistake. The wrong egg. The wrong sperm. The wrong soul. During my secondary school years, every time I would an incorrect answer the teacher would punish me by doing something humiliating or just make stand during class. Only one of my history teacher regretted punishing me by doing 200 squats outside, only three of us were punish that way. The other two got very tired, the teacher noticed and told us to go back in the class to rest before the school ends because it was the last period, but for me I refused too stop until I reached 200. The teacher pleaded me to stop. I kept going until 200. I face faulted forward and broke my nose in the process. I rested in the teacher's office until my mom picked me up. I wonder if my teachers created a self-destructive wreck like before."
403,Cheated and lead on behind my back,My ex cheated on me and got into a relationship behind my back for 2 months whilst telling me she still loves me and was leading me on for months. I’m still really in love with her but this has mentally destroyed me is there any advice?
404,How to get help?,"I’m seriously thinking I have depression or something along those lines due to no motivation, no interest in anything, being overly sad and sensitive among other things.

I’m in the UK and would like to know how I can go about getting professional help and also a diagnosis (if I need one)? I don’t really know how any of this works. Also any self help books or apps that help would be amazing as well as techniques in general to get my life back if you could recommend? :))"
405,I don't know how I am and I've been searching for 6 years now.,"No, I'm not 6 years old. But the same, continuous distant feeling has been following me for 6 years. 

I'm 16 now, turning 17 in a couple months. That's probably the only thing about me that I can tell you in confidence. Not my name, not my hobbies, not even my medical conditions. I don't know who I am. I don't what it is, but the person staring back at me in the mirror looks so confused and almost hurt. They always furrow their eyebrows and sometimes, very rarely, they turn their head when I don't. 

My name sounds unfamiliar to me. I'll turn around and respond if you call me (it's instinctive) but the sound of my name will ring in my head and distort itself every time it's repeated till it just sounds like a growl or a horrible belch.

There's another thing. I always catch myself talking without thinking. As in, I'll answer a question or respond to a statement, but during the middle of it, I'll suddenly become aware of everything and everyone, but I won't stop talking. My mouth will move, sound will come out, but I will have no idea what I'm talking about - hell, I won't even hear myself. But it's decipherable - I'm actually saying something, and my friends understand what I'm saying because they nod and turn back to whatever they're doing. But even they've noticed it too. Because my eyes will widen and my skin will pale, but I'll keep talking like it's nothing.

I don't know what's going on. I don't know who I am. But I want an answer. I just need a little hint about whatever is going on."
406,How do you manage and cope w mental health/illnesses besides a therapist ?,"since i was young i’ve dealt w emotional/verbal abuse, which is what developed what i believe may be anxiety and ive been struggling w for a few years now. I don’t have access or the opportunity to go to a therapist due to a lot of complications. my mental health has been dropping again. it started with panic attacks/dissociating n overwhelming stress but now i just feel so lost and can’t process my thoughts or emotions well anymore. i’m scared, i dont want to be stuck/re-enter my darkest/lowest mental state again. 

So i just want to know how do others manage and cope with their mental health besides therapy. What helped you feel motivated and happy again during these lows? what things helped you make progress? how do you find help or support? what do you do to make yourself feel a little better or at least okay?

it can be personal (maybe it can spark an idea for what could possibly be mine) or suggestions of ideas or free resources (i live in the US)"

408,how to find motivation to get control of our lives when we’re both so depressed? we’re a couple (f21 and m29),"I mainly want to find a way to motivate ourselves to keep our room clean and to control our weight. We have bigger issues of course but I think this would be a good stepping point. We let the room get into an absolute depression pit state for two weeks until one of us gets the motivation to do a big tidying up day. f21 eats once a day and mainly just drinks bottled water all the time whereas m29 feels he has no control over how much he’s eating and feels bad about his weight gain. 


I’ve thought about a reward system where we order nice food or buy a new videogame if we do some chores but I know we’d just buy it for ourselves irregardless how we’ve done. I also thought about a competition between us for who was the best at housework and diet that week but I think that would just make us more depressed. How do we find the motivation to do things that are good for us and not just lie in bed all day doing absolutely nothing."
409,Why am I never good enough?,"Help, I(f23) need help, I dont know who to turn to for help anymore, I dont trust anyone, everyone's just out to get me and hurt me, I have a huge sign on my forehead that says ""treat me like shit, disrespect me, cheat on me, use me as your punching bag"" and i want this fucking sign off my forehead. I want to be respected, I wanted to be loved, cared for and to have a valid opinion in things. I've always felt so lost, somethings wrong with me, im not my own person and I never have been, I've bent to fit with people and to be the person people want, or atleast so I thought, I dont think I'm the one someone wants anymore. I dont know how to talk to someone about whats wrong with me, I sit down with my therapist and I struggle to tell her whats wrong, I dont know how to explain to anyone the way I feel. I want to be okay, I want to be loved and I want to have a continuously loyal partner, but how do I do that when im not okay? When im not good enough for my partner? When im not good enough for myself? Why is it that I'm never good enough for other people or myself? I often think about how I shouldn't be here, why would I continue living if im not happy? If no matter who im in a relationship with, they will always cheat on me ? I want to die. I won't die but I want to."
410,How to decline help?,Im an 18 year old student in my last year. While talking to a teacher about future career (guidance counceller) paths she brought up my absences. I mentioned I had 2 panic attacks during the night ( and told her i never had one before). She is telling me that she wants to talk to my parents to check in and that i should visit a gp. I feel like I dont need to? I feel like the panic attacks happened and I understand its not normal but I was stressed and its not like they happen frequently. I also dont feel like it is or has affected me after the fact? Ive changed some stuff to reduce stress etc working out more and going to sleep earlier. How do I make her understand that I am doing okay without coming off like something is wrong because i am declining help. I genuinely feel fine.
411,How to help with depressive episodes?,"So my housemate and I have to self-isolate at the moment. We are very open with each other and he told me that he thinks that he’s going into a depressive episode. I’ve asked how I can best help them and he has asked me if I can make sure that he is meeting his basic needs (like eating, sleeping etc). 

Is there anything else that you think I could do to help him? I’m not very well versed in coping with mental health"
412,"TW: disassociation, self harm.","I’ve been struggling with my mental health my whole life. Since COVID-19 I’ve been working from home - i don’t have any family near me right now. Last night - I had the worst episode of my life. I did have a few drinks (looking back at it. It wasn’t a great idea) so, long story short I ended up disassociating and slit my wrists - and apparently in that black out episode I wrote “stop pain” in my blood. As soon as I realised I spoke to a crisis like // webchat. That kinda helped. But All day today and night I don’t feel right. I just don’t feel real at all. I have booked to see my psych. But, I guess I just wanted to know if this is normal with CPTSD, BPD, ADHD, depression and anxiety. I just feel so crazy. Just help me feel less alone. I’m now even scared to go outside and see anyone. I guess what I’m most disappointed in is the fact that not everyone had to work from home but, my TL pushed me to do it. I told her I’m prone to hospitalisation with my mental health. So, this has made me so upset. I’ve been okay for 3 months working at home but, all of a sudden I snapped last night. And I just can’t stop crying."
413,Your Friday challenge.... Touching things makes him stupid,"Our 13 year old son, otherwise healthy, developed - mid August - rapid onset of OCD, depression, and paranoia. He has gone from bubbly, smart and engaged to the polar opposite. Bloods and other hospital tests all negative. We are waiting for the psychiatrist sessions to start.

I have been reviewing all the various DSM recognised mental health problems, and I can’t find this one. 

When he touches thing - cloth, metal on laptop, plate, a spec on a spoon etc.... he is convinced it’s making him ‘stupid’. It’s reducing his abilities, mentally. 

Washing hair does the same, which is why a previously healthy boy has not washed his hair in 3 or 4 weeks, and the rest of him needs a good wash too!

It is alarming. I would like to know where in OCD, PTSD, or some other condition you think this ‘touching things makes him stupid’ sits?

Thank you."

415,Something's wrong with me... is reality an illusion...,"One side of my family has a long story of psychosis, but they are good people, the other side is, strange; not the best people.

Sometimes I feel that I am the product of cancellation and there's something very wrong; the fact so many drugs are downright don't work on me or have partial effects (and this in my medical history because over the counter painkillers just don't work, but also some illegal drugs and alcohol has partial effects), so I just don't do drugs, any drug, depression immunity, trauma immunity, panic and anxiety immunity; nothing seems to be able to change my mental state; it is immovable, not even danger; even things like puking and sneezing, I can trigger them by just thinking, just like you can do cough.

Mother used to tell people how I wouldn't get scared as a kid; because of this a battle seemed to have started in dreamworld since ever, I hate dreaming, nightmares don't work; so dreams started to get crafty; and dreams began to become so much like reality, complex puzzles, that are just stressing, and cause me to lucid dream and open my eyes in the middle of REM because I need so much brainpower the dream collapses. These dreams can be worse than nightmares, eg. you have some complex life issue, you face it, you have spent months fixing it, sometimes you even get old, then you realize, a mirror isn't working, it's breaking the rules of physics, you start doubting reality, you discuss with someone, and that someone doubts your sanity; but you doubt them instead, then you realize, it's all been an illusion, a fake, and you open your eyes, and there you are in bed, back to the present, nothing has happened, all your efforts were futile.

So somehow I feel like I have lived double, I bring stuff from dreamworld that of course works in real life, because there's no difference between both worlds; but there's dreamworld in dreamworld; so how isn't this world fake?... there's reddit in dreamworld too you know.

My world seems riddles by a strong logic, things must make sense; logic is even what I do for a living, it's the only thing I am good at; that's why I work with electronics and the solutions I pick from dreamworld also work IRL.

Somehow I feel that psychedelics are what I need to find, I need to know what is behind logic, or if I am just logic; and I am an empty entity, a shell, and hence my drug resistance; or maybe this world is an illusion too, and I am sleeping at home and still 13. After all so much BS happened, that defy statistics, in the 3rd world country I was born, there was conflict, and people I knew died, and the many risks I took and everything paid off, I ignored every single expert, lawyer, teacher, in favor of the ""logic"" and the ""plan"" I have crafted after so many cycles, chances of success were less than 1%, but I got the 1%; it's all been so unlikely smooth; is this reality?

The plan... what are its limits?... if the plan is that powerful, maybe I can create something out of it; the expectations of a powerful economic downtrend was on it, triggered either by unrest or disease, it had to happen, after all it's logical, the plan makes sense, then coronavirus came, right on time; and I made money, coronavirus became my card of success, and high middle class seems closer; things are so unlikely, not long ago I didn't have enough to eat, it seems unreal, everything seems unreal, and I am getting tired; it's like one of those dreams."

Me: I'm crying in the foetal position because the weight of the world is on my shoulders. I shouldn't seek help for that."
417,Numb when my mom is suffering,"I'm a very emphatetic person and I always try to cheer people up and comfort them. I'd say I'm quite good at it, especially on the internet. But then there is one exception to this rule: my mother.
I won't go personal here, but let's say my mom and I don't have the best contact ever and she's narcissistic traits. I hold many grudges from things she said and did. I live with her, but I try to keep our contact to minimum.
She's been ill for almost a year now. The thing is she refused to go to the doctors which made her illness worst. She started finally getting help in August, but she still feels sick. And when I see her in psychical pain, I feel nothing. I know that if it was few years ago, my hearth would literally be broken to see her suffer so much, but not now. Where did my empathy go?
She sometimes cry and start talking about how bad she feels. And I feel numb everytime it happens. I may be in the same room, I may see her suffer and cry and I don't feel a single thing. She told me today her test results went bad and she have some other conditions and I felt literally nothing. And it's weird, because normally my empathy is super high. 
The thing is, is there something wrong with me or is it natural response? I also struggle with depression and anxiety and today wasn't the best day for me to cheer someone else up."
418,What does redpill mean and why do people say that when I'm talking about mens mental health,"Like recently I've been in a slump. Nothing to bad just a downer. And I started looking at videos for mens mental health, which included a an ad for prostate cancer which said ""men are worth saving"" and I teared up. Which made me realise that being told I'm important or not an bad person made me incredibly sad. But when I mentioned it to others in a group chat I'm in they think I'm heading down the route of being redpilled. Why is that"
419,What is with the lack of support for mental health?,"So I (AFAB/Non-Binary) have depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, Hypermobility, and undiagnosed chronic pain. Pretty sure I have some sort of overeating disorder, but not sure. 

I currently get ESA (well actually for some reason they have stopped my payments) and applying for PIP. I live with my parents but they often dead name me and misgender me (this has lead to suicidal thoughts over the global crisis and 1 incident of self-harm- breaking three years free of self-harm). My disabilities mean that I am an able and fully functioning person maybe 3 days a week on a good week, and over push my limits during this time. Most weeks I function for 1-2 days, bad weeks I can't remember the last time I had a good day. I work as a supply teacher, but I always get misgendered and since I have only been 'out' since Dec because I couldn't face another year not being me, I have legally changed my name. But I mentioned in passing to a school how had lots of trans kids, what would they do for a trans teacher and they told my agency, and they are now changing my pronouns and informing schools! I am just in a bit of a situation with disabilities bringing me down and how can I escape. When I can't get enough support to work and I can't get enough support to work and leave my parents. Why is mental health so difficult?"
420,I've begun to hate learning,"I used to read a lot but the more I know it just ruins me, now the only incentive for learning would be to avoid hypocrisy of disliking learning due to an ineptness of learning. The more you know, the more aware you are of not knowing (Dunning-Kruger effect) and the less you understand. Everything feels like it ends in Neo-anarchism or insanity if I continue to learn, at least from my perspective. Kaczynski, Osho, Sartre, Heidegger, Zapffe, learning has brought me nothing but anguish and disgust."
421,I feel lost.,"I just want to clarify before I begin my post: I’m not suicidal, into self harming or anything of that nature. This is gonna be a story kind of post so, enjoy the read. 

2 years ago I worked at a theater. It’s funny to think about these days because I’m moving out of state soon and I’ll never be able to step foot in that theater. The theater that would impact my life in such a negative way is the same theater that has given me such great memories with my friends and family over the many years I visited there. 

It was a moment that only movies create. I had been working at this place for a solid 2 or 3 months. My co workers and I were all fond of each other, my bosses were really cool with me. I was working with a friend of mine one day. Our shift was ending and we were just about to punch out when I see a girl in uniform whom I had never seen before. To me, she was like the girl I could only dream about, but never imagine she could possibly be out there in the world. 

I was at a strong point mentally back then. I was confident enough to the point where I could actually go to people and talk them up without feeling the sweat on my hands begin to run down my fingers. I could do my job without feeling like I was incapable of doing it. I could go up to a girl and politely ask her if she would be interested in hanging out after work some time. I was never this kind of person. I play video games and make music all day, how could I possibly be any of that? For reasons unknown, it worked out, or so I thought. 

I’ve always had issues with trusting and, dare I say it, loving people very easily and incredibly fast. I’ve never understood why I could be so loving and understanding, knowing that I’m being disrespected, manipulated, hurt by someone who I thought I could depend on. Somebody who I’ve shared meals, my home, stories about my life with. I can’t enjoy things because in the back of my head I’m concerned about whether or not I’m good enough for this person. The thought of them beating me to my knees and stabbing me in the back doesn’t even cross my mind because, as much as I have to consider that as a possibility, I just can’t wrap my head around somebody even thinking of doing that to me. But that’s the world in which I live now. The world that I live in now seems so unforgiving, merciless. I feel lost and I just want to be found, as I once did for someone."
422,"TW. So yesterday was baby loss awareness day, apparently.","I’m scrambled so excuse the lack of structure. This is a vent I suppose. TW for abortion, miscarriages, baby loss etc. 

A few people on my Facebook were sharing things about baby loss awareness day. Hashtags, photos, their stories. I guess it triggered me. 

I wasn’t trying for a baby. It was an accidental pregnancy. In absolute honesty, I’m pretty sure I was going to get an abortion (I’m not up to arguing the toss on that topic today thanks). Like 99% sure. But that choice was made for me, fairly quickly. I miscarried at about 8 weeks, we think. I ended up at the hospital, had my legs in the air and two nurses making sure everything was out of there, to prevent infection or whatever. I was pretty confident there wasn’t anything left. I saw my ‘baby’, and my god it did look like a baby. The shape, little black eyes, a pair of arms and even the bumps of little fingers starting to form. I hate to say that I just felt relief then. It was really painful, I was passing huge clots and felt so sick and feverish. As soon as it left my body, I started to feel better. 

The next year after was difficult. I had therapy for a while. My partner wasn’t supportive. He didn’t understand why I was so upset if I was planning on getting rid anyway. I guess it is hard to understand. I don’t think I do, still. He used to get angry with me about it. 

I wasn’t very healthy to myself. I’d wrap my teddy bear in a blanket and just pretend for a while. I’m doing that now. I’d wander round the baby clothes shops, pretending again. In a desperate time, not long after, I rang the hospital and asked if there’s anyway they could give me my scan photos. I had a scan early on, under the pretence of getting an abortion. The nurse turned the monitor away from me. I never saw my baby. But I thought, if I was scanned, they might have the photo on record and I could have it. I don’t know how it works, but I rang and asked them. It didn’t go anywhere. I don’t think I was making much sense. I kept seeing memory boxes made for grieving parents or cards from hospitals apologising for the mother’s loss. I kind of wanted one, but I never got anything like it. I guess I wasn’t deserving, given I was about to just get rid of it anyway. I suppose those sentimental things are for poor parents who really wanted their babies, and who tragically lost them. I suppose that wasn’t me. 

I’m very alone. Nobody knows and I don’t think anybody should. It was two years ago. My partner knows, but like I said, he doesn’t get it. We argued this morning and he’s gone. I was going to just say ‘It was baby loss awareness day yesterday, apparently’ after we fought. But I’m frightened he’ll just get more angry and tell me it’s not excuse for my behaviour. I was a little nuts this morning. I broke some stuff. 

A year ago I got myself a kitten. I have so much love to give and nowhere for it to go, so I thought I could spoil a cat. He was my little man, he was so affectionate and loving. I called him my baby all the time. I guess that wasn’t healthy. I just recently lost him to a disease called FIP. It’s rare, because of course it is. He was one. I buried him in the garden, got a little gravestone with a lovely passage on it. I miss him so much. 

I’m sick of loss. I feel I have so much love to give. I can’t help but feel I’d be a better person if I had my child still. And I can’t help but wish I had my kitty still with me. 

Thanks for listening."
423,I fucking hate hotlines,"In my experience and in most of the experiences of friends and reddit strangers i know of, there is a high likelihood of the person being uninterested and bored, sometimes ridiculing and mocking callers because they deem the caller's issues unworthy of their reaction. I dont know what could be done to fix this system but if one more person gives me the number im gonna spiral again. Im mostly alright now but that was horrendous"
424,how does one get diagnosed with tocd/tourettic ocd?,"since i can barely find good information online except for two youtube videos, and im very very sure that i have it, im afraid that any psychologist i go to in my area will misdiagnose me with just ocd. since tocd is way more ""unknown"" or like, uncommon than ocd, and i dont have many therapists near me, i feel like the chances are pretty low that ill get diagnosed with it, especially because i live in germany and have no idea what tocd would be called in german. ive looked up different things but nothing really came up. can anyone who is diagnosed with tocd or knows good websites/sources/etc give me a bit of insight on this? thanks!!"
425,What is the point in asking for help from family?,Currently in a mental break and samaritans are not picking up. Hwt ais the point is there in asking for help when they basically say go sort your self out so they can have sex just up stair above our head?
426,I'm so tired waiting for it to get better,"today i think i have deleted and redownloaded reddit like 4 times, conflicted on wether i should post or not but what do i have to lose. im only 15 but i also feel bad because everyone keeps telling me that these are supposed to be the best times of my life, yet here i am, watching the years get ruined by my garbage mental health...i just need some hope. im so desperate. im tired of waking up and crying all the time i want it to stop already.. if any of you guys have any inspirational stories of your guys' recovery i would love to hear them.. 

also has anyone here had any experience with therapists specializing in OCD recovery? i'd like to know some info on that too. thank you guys, hope yalls day have been going well"
427,I thought I was fine,"I thought I was fine but guess what ? I'm not. 

After 5+ years of one and off depression episodes I finally got a balance in my life. I still have triggers and issues that get me over the edge but it's nothing like I've experienced before. 

But yesterday one of my roommates showed me an old picture of me and told me that I haven't changed. I started crying ON THE SPOT. I have intense body dismorphia and this triggered the hell out me and I still haven't recovered yet. I had a panicky attack later this night. 

Everyone thinks I'm shallow but I just am hurt and tired of pretending like I'm a tough girl. My body and my mind are pretty fucked up right now, I don't know what to do, the pain in my chest is gradually getting worse. 

I felt like sharing, I hope no one is bothered by this here. There's more to this but idk if someone care.

N."
428,Am i fucked in the head if the thought of not surviving this year is ok to me?,"And by not surviving I mean dying.

Bro disclaimer: i am NOT suicidal.... im just thinking like.... what if I died this month (can be by any means except suicide bc I repeat Im not like that) ???? I honestly would b ok with it lol. Like does anybody here feel the same way? Should i be worried about feeling this way?"
429,I have been feeling very low for the last few weeks. Im 14 and i feel like i have achieved nothing. I have no talent i get not very good grades but all my friends seem to do. They get to get home happy and make their family proud and i cant.do i have a mental illness?,Help me
430,[Rant + seeking advice] tw: self harm,"I don't even know what's wrong with me, so I guess I'll let the Internet take a crack at it.

I hate myself. Like really, really, hate myself. I don't think about it constantly, but I've internalised it to the point where it's just become fact. Sky is blue, grass is green, and I hate myself so much that I wish I didn't exist. I obsess over my mistakes and regrets constantly, and the only thing that makes me feel better is when I ""punish"" myself by self harming. Academic stress (A levels) really doesn't help this

The problem is, I literally have no reason to feel this way. I have a good home life and social life. My friends and family would literally be appalled if they found out about this, because I come across as happy and carefree. And I /am/ usually happy, but sometimes I'm just... not, you know?

 I feel like I'd be whining or seeking attention if I ever went to anyone about this, because it feels like maybe I'm too weak to handle the Stress of Life. Doesn't help my parents are all about that weak ""strawberry generation"" stuff. 

(For those not familiar with chinese colloquialisms, older generations call younger generations the ""strawberry"" generation. The term refers to younger people who can't withstand social pressures/ stress the way their parents did, due to their more privileged upbringing, and are easily ""bruised"", like strawberries.)

 Once I cried to my mom about not doing well academically, and after comforting me she made an offhand remark about how i was very mentally weak and it was probably because i didn't play sports. It really hurt, even though she didn't mean it in that way. She'd probably deny it if i ever brought it up again, too.

Needless to say, I don't have anyone to confide in. How does one tell their friends and family that they went out to buy a penknife specifically to self harm because there's just no other way to get rid of the guilt of not doing well enough?? Especially when there doesn't seem to be any justifiable cause? I've been self-harming for like 3 months and I've been considering the idea of it for years. I do it under my clothes so nobody will see though. To me, it's just a really fucked up coping mechanism

TL;DR: using self harm as an unhealthy coping mechanism. not sure how to stop. i know this probably doesn't make alot of sense, so thanks if u managed to make it this far"
431,do i have selective amnesia or am i just forgetful??,"i grew up with a sprinkle of childhood trauma that i didn’t even know/remembered i experienced until about 2 years ago when my sister brought it up?? i’m pretty sure my memories of my childhood had some amnesia block bc of the trauma but then now i realize that i simply forget most if not all bad memories in general?? 

i’m forgetful by nature where i forget to do simple tasks(happens to everyone) but i seem to be forgetting even important memories / events because they are negative or upsetting in nature. is this amnesia or am i just forgetful?"
432,I had a mental breakdown and dont know what to do,"Last night after a small argument with a close friend I had an uncharacteristic uncontrolled outburst which lead me to throw a glass at my friend. Filling this I proceed to wreck my room and my housemates found curled up in the corner crying. This stems from years of mental health issues that I have struggled to solve. 

My friends called 111 (UK non-emergency hotline) and a few hours later still feeling unstable I took myself to A&amp;E as I felt i was unable to control myself or my emotions.

The response from 111 was to call my GP in the morning which I have tried previously however they decide not to refer me and A&amp;E believe I was ""just angry"" 

I have no idea what to do now"
433,Trying to help a friend who's losing her mind to conspiracy theories,"This is long but I really appreciate whoever reads it.  I can't pinpoint a specific time when the problems started but its been like a snowball effect. First it started with ""ADHD is a lie by big pharma."" I personally believe its often overdiagnosed, but to say outright it doesn't exist? Come on.. any diagnosis for that matter, bipolar, schizzophrenia,  she thinks they're all one big lie.  Later it moved into casually bringing up the illuminati (more on that later). She believes that wearing a mask is just a way for the government to control us and its all a lie. On the topic of vaccines, she would probably attack a doctor just for suggesting she get them. She firmly believes they cause autism and all of them have dangerously high mercury levels. Bill Gates apparently made some comment about microchips in vaccines and that really set her off. So far these beliefs are unfortunately not that uncommon.

It gets worse.
She firmly believes in the lizard people theory. FIRMLY. She goes about her day in fear and constantly in the back of her mind as she walks down the sidewalk is trying to discern who is or isn't a shapeshifting lizard overlord. Today we talked on the phone and at one point I mentioned how large prehistoric birds were. She said that dinosaurs never existed and its all some grand scheme concocted by the government to brainwash us, again. 

She is attractive and goes on plenty of dates with guys. She will always ask on the first date, ""are you my twin flame?"" Not in a cute way but sternly looks them in the eyes and asks coldly. Consistently they all say no or they don't understand what she's talking about so she doesnt get past the first date with anyone. 
Which brings me to the illuminati portion, and the most destructive so far. A bit of backstory, she considers herself an energy healer and has a bit of a messiah complex. A few months ago some random guy messages her out of the blue saying something like, ""we're from the illuminati and want you to join."" He convinces her that they are ""twin flames"" and that its her destiny for him to make her wildly rich. She spent nights crying in her apartment because she thought he was all powerful and was scared of him. Long story short she pays him over 10 grand (yes $10,000) in ""initiation"" fees and nothing happens. She still doesn't believe anything bad happened and it'll all sort itself out karmically. So forget about suggesting she goes to the police. She wont hear it. She believes this guy controls the police.

When I first met her things were TOTALLY different. She was fine, had a career and we got along great. Now it feels like shes fallen all the way down the rabbit hole. Her friends are getting sick of her. I want to help her but she snaps every time you say something she disagrees with. Like zero to 10 in an instant. Then says some BS like ""sorry I'm divine feminine and thats just my energy so I'm not changing.""
The thing that ruined her life was shamans. Maybe some of them are legit, or at least decent people. But the ones she went to filled her head with nonsense when she was at a very vulnerable place in life. She lives alone and I think quarantine has only made it worse. She thinks therapists and psychiatrists are controlled by lizards so thats not an option. Can I help her? Her family lives overseas and are just as frustrated with the whole thing. Can someone enlighten me as to how this all could have happened to someone who use to be balanced? I just want my friend back."
434,Was it a psychotic episode or something else?,"I went through a time in my life where I knew something was wrong but I didn't think it was me. Years ago, I went through a violent relationship. Lived with a family that made fun of me for it. Bullied in school to the point that I feel like they wanted my head on a platter. After leaving that relationship and school, I turned into a drunk. During this time, I was a bum. I had the police called on me a lot because my family picking at me for certain things I couldn't help like ptsd. On that note, I didn't leave my room a lot. I avoided it at all cost. I called my ex crying telling him I deserved it. I also thought I was in love numerous times with friends. This happened in 2018 and now looking back....it was bad. I am embarrassed. I realized how odd everything was that year. I guess I'm back to ""normal"" or whatever that is. I know it's over but there is no one I can talk to about it. It bothers me. Does this sound like a psychotic episode or something else?"
435,Is it possible not to feel shame and disturbance when remembering the experience of childhood sexual abuse?,"So, it hit me. I am recently diagnosed with BPD and I was searching for the reason in my childhood. I asked my mother about my early stages of childhood (since I have a quite supportive family), and when she mentioned my close relationship with my cousins, I remembered that my older cousin, who lived in our neighborhood and with whom I had fun most of the time, used to touch me sexually (not all the time, as I remember vaguely), during a period of time (maybe some years?). I can only visualize one of the incidents, but I am actually sure that it happened more than once.

But the thing that impresses me, actually rather more out of curiosity, is that I think I never resisted that type of action, somehow because as a child I didn't even know what it is and I think during that time, I was only confused and maybe a bit weird and uncomfortable, but never scared and shocked. And even more impressive is that now I may feel weird about it (and that incident keeps coming in front of my eyes), but I don't feel overwhelmed. I think I don't even hate that cousin now (and never did). And somehow, I feel like this memory was never repressed in my mind.

In my previous researches (as I have always been into psychology) I had never encountered such a thing. Aren't we supposed to feel demolished and in pain when we remember the experience of childhood sexual abuse (and also during the time it is happening in the childhood)? I can't make a connection between this experience of mine and my knowledge of childhood trauma.

P.S. It's been less than 1 hour since I remembered all of this experience, if that matters."
436,am i real??,im literally on the verge of a panic attack im so scared are we real??? is this world real?? i've been depersonalizing alot the past few days and im literally convinced we are all fake everyone is fake i dont feel real im sorry
437,vent ig,I guess  sometimes it feels like I don't know what I'm doing I miss her so much wIant her back sometimes I want to be the person I was last year  but I know she couldn't take in everything that's happened nothings working tired of trying im tired of lying to my therapist im tired i know its all my fault but i just wish it would all go back to normal im just so fucking tired
438,That feeling,"it's been 5 years at least but now I'm feeling it again. That feeling when the sun shines brighter but it's not warm and yellow, it's all white and bitter. It's a weird guilty pleasure thinking about ending things. But the idea of being at peace and getting closure makes you happy. It's like you're already getting a taste of that peacefulness. I've been fighting for so long and achieved nothing, I'm almost a skeleton. if everything is against me maybe I'm wrong"
439,Is there a mental illness that makes a person unable to accept the slightest criticism completely impossible to comprehend the idea they might be wrong?,"My mother is unbelievable, even if she simply mispronounced something she would do anything to dodge and void any conversation related to her mistake and sometimes she gets mad and start throwing personal insults."
440,My dogs saved my life,"When I was in a depressive episode I could barely get out of bed. Even on the days where I got out of bed, I couldn’t eat or shower. The only thing that kept me going was my dogs. I have a chihuahua and later on got a black lab. They are the sweetest animals you’ve ever met. And the reason I kept on going was for them. They wouldn’t know where I went. They would wonder where momma was. They would wonder who will cuddle them every night. I can’t put my dogs through that. They’re the reason I kept on living. And I am so grateful for that. (I’m much better and happier now, and I still love my dogs to bits.)"
441,[Seeking Advice] I’ve recently been struggling with these weird “states” I go into,"I am diagnosed with social anxiety but not GAD, though I suspect I have it (runs in the family).  I recently started college and it’s been bringing out a new level of anxiety in me that I’ve never experienced before, where I will feel like I can’t sit still, start tasks, and feel physically nauseous/tingly.

Twice now, I’ve gone into these “states” where I feel like I can’t string together a coherent thought, everything feels like it’s in slow motion, and I almost feel like I’m high?  This has happened twice and it’s usually accompanied by a weird feeling of paranoia or maybe hysteria?  It was kind of funny the first time it happened (lasted about an hour and my friends got to watch me acting crazy), but it happened again last night and it’s starting to scare me.  I don’t like not being able to think straight.  How do I break out of this feeling?  I think it’s caused by my anxiety, but I don’t know how to manage it."
442,Can we talk about how physical depression and anxiety are?,"I feel like there isn't enough information and conversation out there about the fact that depression and anxiety literally feel physically like other diseases and that there are people out there thinking they're having heart attacks, strokes, MS, etc. but really it's just that anxiety and depression are that bad that they mimic those symptoms sometimes. Anyone else have really bad physical symptoms of depression and anxiety?"
443,how to help a friend struggling,"TW: mentions of s\*\*c1de

my friend posts a lot about their depression on their private story. i know their parents aren't the best for them and when he asked for a therapist they hired a social worker, like someone who administers food stamps. they do most of the planning in their household so they weren't super surprised their parents couldn't get organized to do this. the other day, they reposted a tiktok where the audio was obama saying ""now that we're doing with that wanna see my renegade"" and the text for the video is ""me after telling my friends i've been struggling w/ s\*\*c1de"". i didn't say anything at the time bc i didn't know how to deal w it but i rlly want to make sure they're ok. (i think they've also been struggling w/ their gender identity)

**how should i approach them?** i don't have any experience w/ this and i don't want to make them upset or say the wrong thing."
444,So happy for my friend.,"My friend has recently been on sertraline 50mg for depression and anxiety.
He and I have had our years of previous depression from EX's and we related so much. But this year he lost his job where we both worked. He used to have a stray cat who'd he'd let in but he got fleas and spread it round the place...but it got rehomed with the cats protection charity. And yeah he's slowly gone back down the slope many of us have. But since a week of sertraline, he's come back to himself almost. Everything is still there for him, but his outer persona has a smile. Today is awesome to be with him and see him be in a great mood. We are currently drinking and having a smoke and have Nirvana live at Reading on. So yeah. I really couldn't be more happy to see him happy and I'm so glad they've kicked in so fast. I remember them taking a lot longer for myself I also ended up on a 200mg dose for a while. But i think the dose he's on is working so well for him.

If you can ever be there for a friend at a bad time. Just be there. They will appreciate it so much."
445,Trying to decide if I should keep going to my general practicioner to try an actual psychiatrist,"A few months ago I stumbled across someone talking about adult adhd symptoms online and found most of them matching up with things I've experienced the past few years (I'm 19). Took a few of the questionnaires that were online and all of the ones I took said that I probably had adhd or add and I should talk to my doctor.


 I had an appointment with my gp the next week for an ear infection and told her about this while I was there. She said she didn't know much about that area of medicine but that she would talk to her colleagues and I should schedule another appointment with her the next week. When I saw her the next week I was expecting her to consult me to a psychiatrist but instead she prescribed me with prozac. I asked why she was giving me an anti depressant and she explained that it is sometimes also used for adhd/add.


 I took it for about 2 months then had a follow up appointment with her where she was asking if it was working for me. I had not really felt any different the whole time I was on it and explained this to her. She gave me a different medicine (don't remember what it was called) but then later that day called me and said she had realized it was a medicine you need a hand written prescription for and she was putting me on Atomoxetine instead. 


I've been on that for about a month now. What I haven't mentioned (and haven't told her) is that since about February I've been feeling somewhat depressed. On the Prozac it got worse, though I at the time thought this was because school was starting and am still not sure if it was that or a side effect. Then on the Atomoxetine its gotten much worse and I've become somewhat suicidal, though I still don't know if the timing is just a coincidence or if its a side effect. I just learned today that suicidal thoughts is a known side effect of Atomoxetine. 


Sorry about this gigantic wall of background info but my main question boils down to. I'm pretty sure I need to see a doctor to figure out if this is a side effect and if it is try a different drug, but I'm not sure if I should go to my gp who hasn't really seemed to know what she was doing, or try an actual psychiatrist. I don't even know if I've actually been diagnosed with adhd or add, my gp didn't do any tests or anything just asked me like 1 or 2 questions then gave me the prozac. What makes this all harder of course is that I dont have a great relationship with my parents and feel super uncomfortable about talking to them about any of this, especially depression but oh well."
446,I Feel Like a Piece of Sh*t,"I keep on looking at famous and successful people and social media influencers, and I just realized that I'm a piece of crap. I don't do anything special and I'm just so average. The only thing keeping me from having a mental breakdown is school, something that I'm good at. 

I am a perfectionist and a procrastinator with some OCD tendencies, so it might influence my thinking in some sort of way.

The only thing that relieves my anxiety is doing work. I have less time to think that I'm not doing anything with my life when I'm working.

Sorry if my thoughts are confusing, I'm crying right now and can't think clearly. 

I'll take any additional questions."

448,Trying to decide if I should keep going to my general practicioner to try an actual psychiatrist,"A few months ago I stumbled across someone talking about adult adhd symptoms online and found most of them matching up with things I've experienced the past few years (I'm 19). Took a few of the questionnaires that were online and all of the ones I took said that I probably had adhd or add and I should talk to my doctor.


 I had an appointment with my gp the next week for an ear infection and told her about this while I was there. She said she didn't know much about that area of medicine but that she would talk to her colleagues and I should schedule another appointment with her the next week. When I saw her the next week I was expecting her to consult me to a psychiatrist but instead she prescribed me with prozac. I asked why she was giving me an anti depressant and she explained that it is sometimes also used for adhd/add.


 I took it for about 2 months then had a follow up appointment with her where she was asking if it was working for me. I had not really felt any different the whole time I was on it and explained this to her. She gave me a different medicine (don't remember what it was called) but then later that day called me and said she had realized it was a medicine you need a hand written prescription for and she was putting me on Atomoxetine instead. 


I've been on that for about a month now. What I haven't mentioned (and haven't told her) is that since about February I've been feeling somewhat depressed. On the Prozac it got worse, though I at the time thought this was because school was starting and am still not sure if it was that or a side effect. Then on the Atomoxetine its gotten much worse and I've become somewhat suicidal, though I still don't know if the timing is just a coincidence or if its a side effect. I just learned today that suicidal thoughts is a known side effect of Atomoxetine. 


Sorry about this gigantic wall of background info but my main question boils down to. I'm pretty sure I need to see a doctor to figure out if this is a side effect and if it is try a different drug, but I'm not sure if I should go to my gp who hasn't really seemed to know what she was doing, or try an actual psychiatrist. I don't even know if I've actually been diagnosed with adhd or add, my gp didn't do any tests or anything just asked me like 1 or 2 questions then gave me the prozac. What makes this all harder of course is that I dont have a great relationship with my parents and feel super uncomfortable about talking to them about any of this, especially depression but oh well."
449,Five Things To Do When You’re Too Depressed To Work,"Here are five things you could do if you are experiencing symptoms of depression while working remotely: [**5 Things To Do When You’re Too Depressed To Work**](https://www.workingden.com/too-depressed-to-work/)

* **Get Help**  
During quarantine, many counselors have seen patients via virtual consultations (Zoom meetings). Your doctor or psychiatrist may also prescribe you with medication to help you.
* **Practicing Mindfulness and Meditation**  
Meditation is the practice of training your awareness and attention by setting your focus on one task.  
Mindfulness is a form of meditation, it is the art of focusing solely on one task and acknowledging when distracting thoughts cross your mind without judging yourself and the thoughts, then bringing your focus back to the task at hand.
* **Journaling**  
Journaling will not only help to improve your writing skills, but also help to self-reflect, boost your memory, and help to manage and keep track of your thoughts, especially the negative ones.
* **Exercising**  
There are various online exercise regimes that you could follow from home, there are even downloading apps to help you get started with a routine, as well as free collections of home workouts.
* **Spending time with your family and friends**  
It’s important to surround yourself with people or loved ones who genuinely care about you and your well-being."

453,what are ways i can try to help my sisters when they vent to me?,"My sisters sometimes come to me with problems and express how they feel. They don't often do it to my parents because they are often dismissive of them and its kind of because of me. I have been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses and its for that reason that they only take me seriously when I say some of the stuff I say. Although, I am grateful, I feel terrible because just because my sisters are more functioning than I am - it doesn't mean that  they too don't struggle with their mental health. It's this mindset that's caused them to be rather stubborn when given advice to see a counselor or doctor because they believe they've been handling things perfectly on their own but I don't think the way they do it is in any way healthy and actually rather concerning. 

&amp;#x200B;

One sister is very competitive and cries whenever things don't go her way, she thinks she has to be perfect all the time - what is some advice I could give her? The other one struggles with rejection and finds it difficult to make friends because she thinks shes socially inept,  and sometimes just feels really left out - what advice could I give her? Sorry if this is like annoying or whatever, I would just like to know because I want to at least try to help some more!"

For some reason, people just don’t like me. I don’t know what it is, it’s always been that way since maybe middle school. One day I just became awkward. 

I take an antidepressant, but it doesn’t do much about my social problems."
455,I decided to get help today.,"My name is Kyle. The last 3 weeks have been a blur of hard drugs, insane sex, and my depressed and manic personalities. I have DID; Dissociative Identity Disorder. I got to a point where I could switch between them without much effort. I don’t know all of their names but the ones I know well are...

Black Dog/War Dog - the dog is a black man in his mid to late 30s. He doesn’t say much, but he’s always down to fight or hype. While in this persona I would do nothing but freestyle, rap, and talk about thug stuff. The dog was manifested in a suburb of Chicago when we all had our first hotel party.

KY - KY is one of the bright personalities. He is bisexual and is also an exotic dancer and is around 21. We would make strip videos for people if they asked for it. Although KY is bright, he would often depart sad, angry, and alone. Men would send messages constantly just asking for him like a piece of meat. KY was manifested while I was in Mississippi for combat school in the Navy.

BamBam - BB is a toddler, around the age of 3. This is one of the darkest ones I have. BB was manifested a couple years ago when my wife wasn’t home a lot. Maybe once a week she would wander in, freshen up, hang out with us, then she’d leave. This went on for years. Hearing my daughter ask ‘where’s mommy?’ Every 39 seconds for 2 years can wear on you. BB is physically confrontational. Haven’t seen him in awhile and I’m glad.

Ronnie - Ronnie thought he was the rapper that I eventually ended being for roughly two weeks. He worked at a store I worked at 12 years ago. I was 18 and had a crush on a woman we worked with. I liked her but I was shy. Ronnie got with her. He’d tell me all about their sex and drug filled nights. It was exciting. Then Ronnie put her through a wall and she almost died from the beating. Ronnie didn’t come back to work and that’s the last I saw him. Ronnie is roughly 45 rn.

Military Brobot - This is the one that ruined my marriage and my wife. Brobot was manifested before the military, when I was in highschool and unpopular. Instead of trying to socialize and make friends, Brobot stayed quiet and odd. Once he got the military to join, he went 1000mph with it. My wife would ask to speak with me about her feelings and Brobot would not. He cannot empathize....I....cannot empathize. 

Lonely Husband - this is essentially me, but I get very verbally abusive when he comes out. I almost take on the form of my father I believe. He would swear often and if he wasn’t he was in his room with a beer.

I want to empathize and be a normal man and to not have to worry if I’m going to have a blank in my memory. I love my poly group (my wife, wife’s female friend (we fell in love, and she hates me now because I couldn’t reign in my DID at the time) but I am no good. All of my actions I think are right but when they’re explained to me I know they are not. Kyle typed this post. I hope he doesn’t let the others out from now on...but each day has been like a book in itself, and I hope to god tomorrow is better than today...cause I need it.

Here’s the kicker; I type worse now than I did before, I do everything worse, it’s hard to focus, etc... I think I overdosed while unconscious on Molly and Ecstasy that night in Franklin Park."
456,"I need advice or just help in general, please and thank you.","Lol ive been sitting here for a day waiting for a reply and I realized I put the wrong damn flair on my post. (Gotta love it) So now here it is with the correct one!

I need advice or thoughts (Beware; Long post)

Im sorry this is so long, but I really need to get stuff off my chest. I’m also sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes.

So, I’m a 17 year old and I haven't had a therapist for almost two years. (I’m already diagnosed with Anxiety) I stopped going just before an incident that happened where I was taken to the hospital cause a police officer found me having an anxiety attack outside a gas station after I ran out of my house. (Will explain more about this later) but even with the therapist I couldn't explain anything the way I wanted. I ended up shrugging most the time and when I did try to talk I stuttered and blanked out everything I wanted to say, leaving out most of it. I just kind of gave up on it. But Im at this point where I cant handle being like this any longer and I just HAVE to share what I feel with someone, anyone really so Im posting it on here. 

My sister had Borderline and its hard. I so hope Im wrong but at the same time it would make sense from what Ive researched and observed from my sister. So Ima explain what I feel. Not everything makes sense because at this point Im just ranting, but here goes:

Whether it be my brothers, mother or friends. I can go from absolutely adoring and wanting to stay with them forever to completely loathing them and wishing they did not exist in just a few minutes. My mother and I's relationship is the worst. One moment I could literally wish she died in the most twisted ways to loving her endlessly in two minutes.

My self image isnt the worst. (Thats a lie but just ignore it) But I doubt myself constantly, I wonder if I was someone else than what I think I am (sorry that doesn't make sense) or trying to supress my true self without realizing. I long to be anyone else. My hobbies flip and flop constantly, sometimes I love what I do and then I hate it and it swaps all the time. (Which I think is normal if Im not wrong?) Sometimes I love being me but most times I completely hate myself. Sometimes it feels like I shouldnt or dont exist truly at all. 

During my fits of anger and depression I end up hitting myself. I punch my thighs and head, slam my head against the wall, scratch and pinch my arms, and when its really bad I end up cutting (or attempting too, pathetically) I cant really stop myself. While its happening I feel like im elsewhere completely. I sometimes feel that things won’t get better so I just die and move on to whatever cruel afterlife there is. 

I also feel like I should add the fact that I pull my hair absent mindedly. I can't seem to stop, Im thinking about creating my own fidget toy to try and prevent any more bald spots from hapenning. As I type this now my poor hair is looking quite destroyed...

Moving on, I run out my apartment during the night when I’m stressed (it happens so suddenly I dont realize Im actually doing it until Im a few blocks away from my house. Its blurred and feels unreal) But the incident I mention early was triggered by something different. (Still not there yet, sorry)

Anger is my worst symptom. The best way to describe it is being thrown underwater. It could be the smallest thing can set it off but it feels so intense I have to take it out on myself or things around me. Its like a rush of heat that I cant shake off and it gets worse and worse until the kettle blows. Its hard to supress and get over. I breakdown crying as well. The most recent was last week when my youngest brother wouldn't stop arguing with my other one. I started to scream and cry even though I really didn't want to. It doesn't happen anymore but I used to literally scream at the top of my lungs :') I also get pangs of anger and annoyance at the smallest of sentences or even looks (though im not sure of that counts) the best I can describe it is like a wave of heat in my brain that passes in a minute or two. Moving away from anger sometimes I feel so hyped and giddy I have to literally jump around my room and talk to myself until it wears off.

I disociate a lot as well. Like Im watching myself without actually being there and lose track of anything Im doing and once I realize whats happening I cant regain my focus no matter what I do. Most of the time I pretend Im someone else, anyone but who I am. Im not sure if its bad but it helps when I start to hate myself. Paranoia is also a big one as well. I feel like everyone hates me or is talking about me behind my back. Thats not the only paranoia I have either, its not as bad as it used to be but I always feel like something is there, watching me or sneaking up on me. It got so bad at one point I would have panic attacks. A plane passing overhead or a motorcycle speading past on the highway could be a bombs, or a car passing by slowly on the street can kidnap or shoot me. Its so embarrassing to think about but once this dude got into a car while I pased and it felt like he was following me (It was a one way street) and I bolted all the way to my home in a panic because I thought he was a thug gonna shoot me. (I cant tell if this is something else or just my anxiety)

Even though I have plenty to do, I feel sooooooo bored. I could be doing 3 different things at once and still feel like I could be more entertained. Then sometimes I feel like a shell, and I just exist. I feel like not a person but an entity just wallowing in the world watching everything around me. Not sure if that counts as emptiness but it happens often. Its not for long periods of time. Twenty to twenty five minutes has been the top. 

I dont think this counts as fear of abandoment but sometimes I feel like no one wants to be around me. That they are only talking to me because they feel they have to. I have so many people I want to keep as friends but Im so scared that If I say the wrong thing or even have one wrong look on my face that they'll drop me right away. Sometimes it feels like Im just following people around and the more I do, the more they hate me. I also cant read tone AT ALL I feel like what people say is patronizing or condescending when it doesn't actually mean that. Also if Im ignored or dismissed I get depressed, which I cant shake off until I get proper acknowledgement. I also overshare waaaayyy too much. I ended up telling lowly aqiuntances about that one time I got found in the street at night and taken to the hospital. I wanted to bury myself in a hole when everyone stared at me blankly after  😭😭

I cant help but feel like Im being overdramatic. Maybe what Im feeling is normal but the things I feel are so intense I can hardly function. Even writing this right now Im fucking crying like tf. I jus hope im not completely wrong in what I feel. 

I fricken hate self diagnosing, cause Im most likely completely wrong but ya know, a hoe can't help but worry. A lot of what is said Is probably just my anxiety as well soooooooooooooooo idfk. Good Therapists in my area is hard to come by plus Im poor af and not everyone takes my insurance. Im scared with getting stuck with a shitty person who doesn't listen to my stuttering self at all. 

My mom makes me feel like Im not allowed to have feelings either. When I was younger it was physical abuse not just mental. When I cried my mom would scream at me, choke me, and punch me in the head. Once she almost smashed my head in with a hammer while I was having a panic attack. And another time she ran at me with a knife, That was the same night I was taken the hospital, and as soon as my mom got there she told me ""You are ruining our lives."" When she found out about my self harm she got mad at me saying I was pathetic and started to cry. 

Sometimes, I want to share what I feel with literally anyone so bad it hurts but Im scared that I'll be disregard or ignored. 

Theres so much more. But I have to stop. Writing this much has exhausted me. 

I really dont know what to expect people to respond. But literally anything will do, even a simple ""yes, you actually are crazy"" can do wonders. 

Now im finna post this before I change my mind."
457,Your illness as a gift.,"Can I just say us as mental health folk may be struggling with what we think are burdens..but we've also got alot of sense about us that the norm don't have. Theres so much negativity revolving around mental health that deems us as 'bad' and if not, makes us feel unfortunate compared to most..

But let me say this.. we're great artists.. musicians.. and if not we enjoy art and music.. it thrives through us.. and if not art our own therapy.. but we keep it to ourselves.. that small space that's our comfort. That we don't tell anyones about.

We see the world in a whole different way..

If we can hold on to that precious little gift and see it as a positive thing.. well be more wise then everyone we envied without knowing it. 

Please please.. look into what your ability can be.

You're more then you'll ever know.. and when you realise that.. you see life and a whole different way."
458,Am I deluding myself?,"Hi,

This might sound like a bit of a rant, sorry about this. I've had an argument with an user and now I'm beginning to question my own sanity. As a person, I want to be as open minded as possible and take in consideration the opposing arguments, and I start to believe this might as well be my main weakness. The confidence with which this guy talks was enough to make me question my own beliefs, even though it's visible he isn't very well-intended. So, to be clear, what I ask is not to get sympathy, but to hear opinions if I'm deluding myself or if he's the wrong one from multiple people instead of just from him.

Unfortunately, in the first part of the discussion I deleted my comments shortly after the discussion so it's a bit difficult to understand the context. I will write a short summary but if you have further questions let me know.

Basically it all started with me telling him that we can try to be nicer and stop calling strangers on the internet 'mentally disabled' and 'autistic' as insults because it can affect them and is just unnecessary. He said that something being necessary isn't where we should draw the line because

&gt; 'Listening to music isn't a necessity, would you stop doing that if it made people upset?'.   They SHOULDN'T feel bad, it is stupid to feel bad about people correctly using it as a negative, you should feel bad about it being negative. It sucks, but the person should instead do as much as they can to make up for it, instead of being upset people see a negative thing as a negative thing. 

My reply was that I'm not trying to say if they should or shouldn't feel bad, but that they in fact do feel bad and we can try to be a bit nicer and humane. I also gave him a few link to show him that they are as a fact affected by this on a daily basis. He kept telling me that autism is a negative thing and this justifies using it negatively and it's their fault for denying this reality and getting offended. 

&gt; What you are phrasing is again just the inability to accept reality but in a vaguer way. In any situation like that it is on THEIR end, it is their fault. They are the ones unable to accept their condition. Nobody should have to sacrifice even just something like the usage of a word because of that. It's just excuses. 

I told him that the reason they're getting offended is not because of **reality denial** but because they are feeling **socially rejected**. I told him that autism has positive aspects as well such as becoming very good workers in their field, and  that the term is used as an insult because people like him only see the negatives. And as he kept insisting on the idea that autistic people are reality deniers who delude themselves, I told him that there are some researchers that show that even Einstein, Newton and Tesla might have been on the autistic spectrum, and that these persons are more aware of the reality than me and him will ever be, and that I'm sure they would get offended as well if someone used their condition as an insult. And this is where it all went downhill. He told me that:

&gt; Lmao after talking about this for so long you go mask off as a complete fucking autistic lunatic who thinks autism is a super power. Holy shit, unhinged. No, Albert Einstein wasn't fucking autistic, neither was Newton, Tesla, Darwin or Steve Jobs. None of these people had autism, and there is absolutely no chance they did. **You are insane**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The only reason autism is EVER a positive is because the other areas of your brain get so immensely fucked that your brain re-wires focus onto 1 or 2 specific things. This only ever happens very rarely and when it does happen to any significant extent the person in question would still be heavily disadvantaged and pretty much unable to live on their own, just good at 1 task.  
&gt;  
&gt;You **are** denying reality. And to have this much fucking insane psycho beliefs around this, you must very likely be autistic. I honestly couldn't really tell until now, so I guess good job. But holy shit, get help.

After reading this, I went a bit over the top and told him that he's a pathetic bully that shows no empathy and some people get to kill themselves because of people like him. Shortly after this I felt bad about my last message and deleted all my comments. 

Even though my comments are gone, you can check the chain of his comments here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/j9fbwx/esfand\_comforts\_scared\_emotional\_jinny/g8nswo8/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/j9fbwx/esfand_comforts_scared_emotional_jinny/g8nswo8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

The next day I PM'd him and apologized. What's next you can check yourself in the pictures:

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. It definitely helps me to get this out of my chest. The reason I kept talking to him is that I thought I can convince him of a point with logical reasoning, but by the end of the conversation, as he was so sure about his opinions, I became the one losing it and now I start to question my own beliefs. I just want to hear what other people think about this. Probably I will delete this thread after a while.

Also, if curious, I might have Asperger's but never cared that much to get an official medical assessment.  

All the best"
459,Answering the phone without saying hello on mute question?,I've been answering phone calls from numbers I don't know in mute waiting for them to say hello; Mainly because I think they are likely scams. So far they just hang up without saying a word. Are there any negatives in  doing this?
460,how do you deal with rapid mood swings?,"It's been a few weeks since my mood swings have gotten extremely intense and fast.

In a single minute my mood can swing from completely depressed to manic two or three times and it's incredibly exhausting, it's hurting my relationship with everyone around me because one second I can be talking in a very upbeat tone and cracking jokes and 15 seconds later I'll become  completely apathetic and suicidal.

Every time I get some motivation to do anything at all I immediately get hit by a big wave of depression and I just sit in bed staring at the ceiling.

I've always had these mood swings but never this intense, the only thing that changed is my antidepressants dosage, which has been increased by my therapist. What's weird is that these very antidepressants are also supposed to have some mild mood-stabilizing effects but I've had nothing but the opposite."
461,I feel like my anxiety is taking over my life..,"So, to preface, I’ve had pretty severe major depression and GAD with psychosis for over decade. Up until recently, the former always had more of an effect on me than the later. However, things have changed quite a bit. I’ve noticed that I’ve been a lot less depressed and significantly more anxious. I was suicidal for most of my life and now the thought of dying terrifies me to the point of never wanting to leave my house out of just plain fear. I’ve always had a fear of the ones I love dying, as I’ve gone through that a few times, but never for myself. I genuinely wish I could go back to wanting to die because I just find myself sobbing and having severe panic attacks over the thought of everything I love dying around me/dying and leaving everything I love behind. 

Has anyone else been through this or have any advice? I’m sorry if I don’t make a lot of sense as I find it really difficult to talk about this with people other than my boyfriend."

464,7 Tips For Seeing a Therapist (Things I wish I knew before I saw one),"There have been two times in my life when I’ve seen a therapist:

1. After I came back from a 6-month mission trip to Haiti
2. Half way through my seminary program

My first experience wasn’t great. I didn’t really know what I wanted, I was one of the first clients my therapist had, and I couldn’t really connect with him at a deep level.

My second experience was incredibly profound. It was a year-long and everything I needed at that time. He was kind, compassionate, gentle, perceptive, and reliable. I was able to process and heal with him in a way that I didn’t even know I needed.

TLDR; not everyone will have a good experience with therapy and finding a good one can take time. Here are 7 things you should consider before you see and commit to a therapist.

# Date Around

Finding a therapist is similar to dating. It’s okay to feel each other out and see if you’ll be a good fit with one another then move on if you’re not.

Sometimes when people get referred to see a therapist, they view it as if they’re stuck with that specific person. This isn’t true. If you’re not feeling it for whatever reason, just ask for a referral for another therapist because the relationship you have with them is important. It’s the foundation for your therapeutic relationship. If you don’t like them, trust them, or simply just can’t connect with them, it’s okay to try someone else.

Also, there are a variety reasons for why this might happen. Maybe their approach to counseling just doesn’t work for you. Maybe the therapist isn’t a good therapist. Maybe they don’t incorporate your cultural background. Whatever the reason is, don’t force yourself to stick with someone if it isn’t working.

That being said, make sure you give it a genuine shot before moving on.

# Things Can Get Harder Before They Get Better

Often times when you’re in therapy, it may feel like your mental health isn’t getting better. It’s getting worse. But sometimes this is actually one of the paths you have to take in order to heal. Why?

Human beings tend to develop unhealthy coping mechanisms in order to get through life. Rather than deal with what’s bothering them, they ignore it or mask it. This is actually how [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and) is created.

Now when someone copes, it may seem like life is getting better temporarily. But really what’s happening is that they’re putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. It’s a short-term fix that only kicks the bucket further down the road.

One of the goals of therapy is to break down unhealthy coping mechanisms so that the underlying issue can be properly addressed. This is why it can feel like things are getting worse, because it requires you to explore the depths of your junk in order to create better tools to help you thrive.

# Be Prepared to Get Recorded

Many therapists record sessions with their clients. There are a couple reasons for this. First, it helps them catch anything they missed during the session. Second, it’s reviewed for supervision where your therapist can gain insight and advice from someone with more experience.

Although it may be a little nerve-racking to be recorded, know that everything you say and do is protected by confidentiality.

Confidentiality is the legal duty of the therapist to protect your privacy. Breaking it is considered a severe violation and has serious consequences in the world of mental health. The offending therapist could get placed on probation or even have their license revoked. You also have the option of suing them.

So rest assured that the recording will only be viewed by your therapist and relevant mental health professionals. However, keep in mind that there are [certain situations](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/ss/ap/childabusereportingguide.asp) where information must be shared with relevant authorities because therapists are also mandated reporters.

# Cultural Appreciation is Important

Having a therapist who respects and appreciates your cultural background is important. A therapist who comes from the same background as you can also be really helpful. They’re less likely to misunderstand you. They are more likely to share the same values. They could perhaps even help you navigate cultural tensions based off of their own experience. But they don’t have to be like you in order to help you.

For example I’ve always felt conflicted about my identity. Am I Korean? Am I American? To be honest, I never really felt like I belonged in either culture.

Now even though my therapist was Caucasian, he was really good at asking questions being curious, being open, and not imposing his values as we were exploring the topic of culture. In fact because he wasn’t familiar with an Asian American background, I had to explain a lot of cultural tensions that I faced and it was this process that actually helped me make my identity more concrete.

Whoever you decide to see, make sure they respect and appropriately factor your cultural background.

# Figure Out What You Want to Work On

One of the reasons why my first experience with my therapist didn’t go well is because I didn’t know what I wanted to work on. This made our sessions erratic and feel like a bit of a waste of time because I didn’t know where to drive the conversation.

When you see a therapist, I recommend going in with something you want to work on. Now the reality is that this might change as you continue with therapy. That’s totally fine. But coming in with a goal will at least give you and your therapist a starting point to get the ball rolling.

Here are some examples:

&gt;I want to process the death of my grandmother.  
I feel anxious and I don’t know why.  
I don’t feel happy right now and want to feel better.  
I’m really scared of spiders and don’t want to be anymore.  
I feel really pessimistic about the future because of the pandemic.

Notice how these goals can be both specific and general. Don’t worry too much about the details. Just make sure you have something in mind to start the conversation.

# Therapists Aren’t Perfect

Don’t expect your therapist to be perfect. My last therapist was super compassionate but frankly, a bit awkward. There were a few times where we sat in silence because we were waiting on one another to guide the conversation. There were other times where I felt like he had hurt me and it was really painful because I had placed a ton of trust in him. But what’s helpful to keep in mind is therapists make mistakes too.

That means sessions can be awkward. They may forget a detail that you shared before. They may say something that hurts you. They may even recommend an intervention that may not work.

Just know that the person sitting across from you isn’t perfect. They’re not a god. They’re human.

# You Drive the Sessions

The last tip I have is to let you know that you drive the sessions. The person that determines how much you get out of therapy is you.

How willing are you to dive into your junk? If your therapist assigns “homework”, do you actually follow through? Are you fully bought in or are you just going through the motions? Are you hiding during your session? If so, why?

The times when I’ve walked out of a session thinking that it wasn’t very productive was when I wasn’t fully bought in. It was the times when I didn’t honestly answer my therapist’s questions. It was when I kept things superficial and avoided the topics that were really bothering me.

465,17 F. suffering really bad.,"All the time I feel so suicidal. Like it literally just takes over my thoughts it’s all I can think about , I fantasise about taking drugs , ODing etc idk it’s weird but that’s just what it is.. I’ve self harmed in the past and haven’t done it in a while but that’s also something that I just love doing , it’s sounds so shitty but I literally want people to notice how bad I am. No one checks up on me , I have no friends , no family I can actually talk about it to , I just want someone to notice. I never go out , I’m in bed 24/7. I feel like I’m bipolar and have depression I have the worst temper ever , literally hearing my dad fucking eat sends me out of control I literally cry I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to go get diagnosed because I have a feeling they’ll end up saying nothing is wrong with me and that will literally drive me insane. What else could be wrong with me? I just feel my life is so pointless , I don’t do anything. Idk what the point in this is I just need to vent."
466,"He only wants to sleep, cry and game","I am dating a 33 year old man who is severely depressed. He still lives with his parents. It started the last couple of weeks because he works 60 hours a week and hates his job. His diet consists of chicken nuggets or turkey dinosaurs. He says he comes home and has started to get into a habit of playing on the ps4 and crying himself to sleep. He doesn't know what to do with himself anymore and is isolating himself from everyone. I have offered to help him but he will not accept it. Just wants to sleep, wake up and game. What should I do?"
467,repost... just because,
468,I’m being admitted and need advice.,"I’m not new to the mental health services, this will be my 8th admission and 4th on an adult ward but the ward I’m going to has previously neglected me and I have open complaints against members of staff that I presume still work there. How do I manage in a place that has caused me so much trauma? Any tips or advice because this is the most scared I’ve ever felt about an admission. Also will be my first admission during COVID and I don’t know what to expect."
469,Today is a really hard day for some reason,"I haven’t gotten a thing of work done, my friends are mad at me because they think I don’t care. I’m really cold. I keep on thinking about killing myself. It’s just a really hard day."
470,Looking for a Mental Health Book Charity,"Hey everyone! Earlier this year my grandfather passed away and left some money for his grandchildren to direct towards charities. I have been deliberating as to what I would like my portion of the charity money to go towards and have decided that I'd really like to engage with a charity that gives books to the mentally ill and/or addicted (synonymous in my book). Books, particularly science fiction and fantasy, have been a large part of my recovery process, and I'd like to pay it forward (albeit with my grandfather's money). I have been searching for a charity that fits this framework and have been struggling to find one. Anyone got a suggestion/could you point me in the right direction?

Tl;dr - looking for a charity to donate to that donates books to the mentally ill"
471,Depression poetry,"I clawed my way out of a coffin born from insecurity and deceit. 
To find the surface is no better than beneath . 

I’m going to drown myself in every tear I shed over you .
I could spend forever grieving , but what would that do ? 

The fire that consumes me ,tenderly caressing my frame.
Please let me go, I’m to tiered to play this game .

Tell me that you love me even if it’s fake .
Because I can’t stand here and feel my heart break . 

My shoulders weigh more than I can take.
And the feeling of impending doom is one I can’t shake  .

I hope I never loose the bruises that you left behind .
I want to feel love , just not the temporary kind."
472,Do people with mental health issues make the best or worst therapists?,"Somebody made a point that if someone still hasn’t figured out their own life how are they supposed to help you which I think is a valid point however people who have gone through mental health issues are likely more passionate about mental health, better advocates, can better relate to their patients, and I’ve tried things out personally. What are your thoughts? I can see validity in both thought processes"
473,To those who are struggling,"This is a message to those who are struggling,. To the people who’s depression has been around so long it’s hard to remember life without it. To the 20 something year olds who never thought they’d
Make it past 16, then 18, who have found themselves in a world they never prepared for and are struggling to keep up with the whirlpool of adult life. To the people who have endured horrible trauma and great loss. To those who lost their childhood to abuse. We are going to make it, look how much we have survived through, and we’re still here. Your past doesn’t define you, your trauma is a hurdle not a barricade. You can still finish the race you just need to jump higher than the rest. You can do it, you are worth it, I believe in you. You’re gonna do great things."
474,Advice needed if you take the time to read it thank you very much,"I grew up in a very toxic home so to make a long story short my father was extremely abusive and my mother was submissive to him to the point that she’d hurt us to make him happy. I did go to therapy to work out some of this and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I do take my medication every day and the ones for anxiety only when I have an anxiety attack. This is just to give a bit of background lol it’ll make sense I promise. 

I started dating someone 5 years ago and he was my best friend for 6 years before we started dating. The timing was finally right because I moved away for school and realized how much he meant to me. After 3 years he had a girl best friend and I didn’t mind at all I wasn’t someone that was crazy or overprotective and most of all I trusted him. She messaged me saying that he kissed her (later to find out she lied because she wanted us to break up). I didn’t believe him when he said he didn’t do it because why would another female lie to me about something so horrid ? I decided to forgive him and give it another try because he swore he didn’t do it but I just couldn’t let it go. It broke me completely. I fell into a darker depression and I would get anxiety attacks every single day. I decided it was better to break up because I was losing myself. A few months later we got back in touch and we started talking and seeing each other. One night he told me he was going to the hospital but he actually threw a party with the same girl that had told me he kissed her. Again I was broken and I do believe this directly reflects my relationship with my father and because of the trauma I had a trauma bond with my significant other as well. I told him the next day to pick because we weren’t official but there is no way that I would be an option. He picked me and he cut her off. I couldn’t get over the betrayal and even became suicidal and started self harming. I did not love myself and I had poured all my love and everything into this man. The relationship became very unhealthy and it was fast. I mean it was already unhealthy but when I say I was broken I mean it. I didn’t even recognize who I became. We stopped talking and then started again. This time he had another girl and I told him to cut her off because I knew she had feelings for him and he asked me for some time. This time however I just blocked him from everywhere and then he started dating her 2 weeks later. Safe to say I was devastated but it was what I expected. He was horrible to me and would do the bare minimum and now my friends are friends with them and they tell me he treats her so well. He surprises her with trips and helicopter rides and he is very good to her while he smashed my cake on my birthday and broke up with me on another one. 

I know how horrible I was treated and he isn’t worth it but the problem lies in the fact that I can not seem to forget him. It’s gotten so bad that I still have dreams about him. I cry myself to sleep but I know I do not want him back in my life ever again. It took a long time for me to even become the shell of a person I am today. I want to get better I really truly do but I’ve done everything I can. I’ve asked for advice before but here I am again so anything that can help I am all for it so if you have any advice I will be eternally grateful. Thank you in advance."
475,Just overwhelmed,"Sigh. I'm sorry for this rant. I don't really have anyone to talk about this, or perhaps I tried to talk about this but I don't really like what I am hearing.

Perhaps the word that describes my feelings right now is ""swamped"", incredibly swamped with work. I joined a competition that I had become demotivated to do (perhaps because I am stuck), many people resigned from the company and transferred overwhelming amount of work, I got on to a lot of responsibility because no one wanted to take on the responsibility so I raised my hand to volunteer.

I wanted to quit on the competition I am now demotivated to do. Just that, and I'll be so happy. I wanted to quit, but I can't for the life of me say I wanted to quit, that I am stuck, that I am now demotivated and is beyond the point of raising that motivation back. But, I am scared that I will be talked upon, I am scared for the reputation I uphold. I am also scared that I will inspire those who are in the competition to quit as well. They also say that the ideas I had were good and it will be a waste of chance if I were to quit. 

I want to rest from this burden. But, if I even just took some few days to rest and just calm myself, my schedule will be off. I'll be scared a shit ton of days thinking can I really do this, and the fear eats me up. 

But, maybe I'm just lazy. My coworker can do it, so why can't I. They cry, and get on with their days, like the brave men they are. Is it me who's wrong? I don't really know. I accepted it so why quit. Shouldn't I have learned how to juggle all these responsibilities? 

I'm happy to learn a lot because I don't really know at this point. I'm very confused. And just very tired."
476,Don't know why I feel so down,"Nothing bad is happening.  
Everything is quiet.

Our 5th grader is all caught up on his online classwork. The older boys (16 and 18) are gone to Career Tech. Our 13 year old daughter is doing her classwork. Hubby is making dinner.

Why do I feel like slitting my wrists?  
I don't know if I can stop myself...this really sucks."

478,Going For It: The Power of Being Bold,"Do you consider yourself bold or someone who goes for it with passion in life? Some of us do, but most people I know and work with, myself included, admit that they don’t often think of themselves as a bold person.

479,I’m so angry and sad and there’s nothing I can do about it,"I’ve had severe depression for at least 7 years. (I’m 22).  I feel like shit all the time and I hate myself.  I used to be able to deny everything and just laugh it off so it doesn’t show.  But now I’m so tired all the time and it’s almost impossible to hide anymore.  It feels almost impossible to even wake up shower and brush my teeth.  I’ve become such a zombie vegetable and I don’t even care anymore.

Help doesn’t exist.  I’ve tried the national line (never call them they are the worst people who will hang up and laugh at you).  I’ve tried therapy multiple times and it doesn’t do shit.  I’ve tried antidepressants and a crap ton of other stupid drugs just to try and feel at the very least just ok.  But none of it works and I feel like I’m going nowhere.  I’m too much of a coward to go through killing myself and there’s no getting better so what the fuck am I supposed to do?  Live and suffer for the rest of my life.  

Fuck this stupid ass bullshit existence.  I’d like to burn whatever decided I would win the sperm race.
There is no place for me ."
480,Why is it so hard for me to put words to how I feel?,"whenever I went to therapy as a teenager, my therapist would always try to make me differentiate between thought and feeling.  
  
like she would ask me what I was going through my mind and I would say ""well I felt sad"" but I couldn't really say what I thought. maybe I don't think? or have an inner monologue?  
  
I have difficulty putting words to how I feel, and relating the two. I kinda just feel what I feel. does anyone else have these problems too?"
481,It's been sometime,"I am trying to.... survive...as they say.

My mind is not normal now, that's for sure.

I snapped twice today, it was very difficult to handle it while making a happy face.
I seem to have no... happiness...I am just going with the flow.

I am really mad at myself but don't really know if I should care.

I am not ok.

I don't know what future holds for me.

I can only handle getting snapped 14 more times now.

After that, I might just go mad.

I don't really know what happened to me.

Help me....even if you can talk or hear.
I have started losing hope for something I don't even know."
482,In the closet,It was hard typing this while I literally have a breakdown in my closet. I hate myself so much. I don't want to  exists anymore. What the point of living when each minute you hate it. Part of me wants to end it all. But I love my family so much i don't want them to be hurt by my actions.  I'm going stay in my closet for the rest of the day and just wait until my breakdown is over.   I'm apologize for me venting and ranting. Thank you for reading my post. I just need to vent.
483,im scared to get a job,"I'm not registered with a gp and I don't have a job, every day i want to kill myself and the feeling gets stronger, I feel depressed suicidal i dont know what to do anymore i have supportive family around me but i just feel so alone"
484,Concerns about my co- parent having episodes of being impaired or incoherent. No idea what’s happening,My ex husband has been an alcoholic for the last 30+ years. I’m afraid he won’t tell me the diagnosis even if he gets one. He drove my child while impaired and apparently  incoherent a few months back. Recently he started acting strange in the middle of the night. He was doing weird things like stuffing leaves in a bottle. My child doesn’t want me to put anything in place to safeguard. The court has not given me a hearing. I’m scared because he could turn violent or simply do something stupid.
485,"vivid nightmares, help?","i'm trying desperately to get some sort of diagnosis, but i live in the US so of course doctors still aren't taking it seriously...

i am certain i'm bipolar, my doctor has told me he's pretty sure i am too but won't give me resources to get proper help or refer me to someone who can help.

i just kind of accepted that up until i started having vivid nightmares more and more frequently - to the point i've had the same reoccurring nightmare twice this week alone and started getting auditory hallucinations from the lack of sleep because i'm fucking terrified of that nightmare. i don't want to have that dream anymore because it just gets worse and worse each time. it's gotten so bad that i've physically gotten sick from how scared i was.

does anyone have advice for dealing with these nightmares? i just wanna sleep"
486,Life feels claustrophobic,"I hate posting anywhere because I feel like I’m just living the most b*llsh*t life. I’m ignored by almost everyone but my parents. Cousins don’t want to talk, friends left long ago... it’s just me. I’m ignored on social media (which I know is 100% not important but it adds to the pressure when it’s your last resort to try to talk to someone, but no one answers). I feel like I’m in purgatory. I feel invisible. I’m not interesting enough to talk to anymore, but I’m deprived. By the time I grab someone’s attention with a quick hello, they think I’m weird or off... And I am off. I push people away because at some point, saying hello feels insincere."
487,I'm defeated in nearly every aspect of my life and heavily depressed.,"I'm suffering from OCD and bpd which make me obsess over every single thing I hate which turns my life into a living nightmare. I've let my parents down every single time and they're the only people I really love in my life. 

I just had a realization while looking at them playing carrom that they're getting old. I burst into tears in my room and couldn't stop. I'm near failing college and feel like my low self esteem is getting in the way of dealing with my emotions properly.I'm pushed around so easily due to my body (I'm a really skinny 5'8 guy) and my inability to say no to people. 

Some guy I met in our local park met me once while we both were buying weed the first time ( didn't help that stuff tho) and he took me as a granted source of weed and started calling me and gave 30 missed calls which terrified me. He's too pushy and I physically feel threatened. It's like im already down on my knees and some piece of shit is taking advantage of me. It's so ridiculous I can't say no to someone like that. I can't stand up for myself. 

Please tell me how to ? I don't have the capacity to think anymore since I'm mostly numb at this point."
488,Questions regarding your experience with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,"First off, I'm new to this subreddit. I've started becoming more and more public about my lifetime of living with treatment-resistant depression and bipolar 2.

I start TMS treatments next week. I'm curious for those who have done it, what your experience(s) has/have been like. Did you have any side effects? Did you get the results you were expecting? Did you get any unexpected results? Have you needed to go back for maintenance treatment?

I know everyone's different, but I'd like to see if there's any commonalities I can learn from. I'm also an open book, so if there's any questions for me, don't hesitate to ask."
489,How do i cope with positive emotions?,"Tomorrow i'll be getting my tattoo with its motive thats really important to me and i'm really excited for it. But at the same time i feel like its too good to be real. I'm being so excited for it, its stressing me out. I'm not used to feel that way but i also don't wanna drop that emotion just so easy even when its uncomfortable. I wanna work with it and get more experiences from positive emotions. But at the same time I'm scared of them for some reason. Should i write these positive experiences with emotions down? Treat it like a mental issue by doing skill things?"
490,Should I be concerned with occasional brief flashes of suicidal thoughts,"Whenever I get particularly stressed about things, mainly when I’m trying to fall asleep, I get these flashes of suicidal thoughts. They feel similar to intrusive thoughts as they aren’t really anything I believe and they tend leave within 30 seconds to a minute. Is this something I should seek help for, or am I fine?"
491,Anxiety related self help books?,"Hello, I hope everyone is doing wonderfully. 
I’ve been doing research and looking for books to read related to my anxiety but I’ve found that to be challenging. 
Most of my anxiety comes from feeling like I’m not doing enough, being unproductive and giving myself time to relax is difficult and often makes my anxiety worse. 
Does anyone have any recommendations?"
492,I think I was born evil.,"First off, let me get started by saying I haven't killed or tortured anyone. Nor do I want to sound edgy when writing this. 

Second off, I am not sure if serial killers or well murderers in general are born hardwired to kill but I found a lot of stuff that says they are(Law and Order, Reddit, Quora, etc) but I think I was born evil, hardwired with the desire to kill and I don't know what to do.

Basically I have been having homicidal thoughts lately... along with some ASPD symptoms(lying, impulsive, etc), and some mass shooter traits. I also have a short temper as well. So I am not sure whether I am born evil A.K.A born hardwired to become a murderer. I don't want to become a serial killer but I do want to become a mass shooter and shoot up a animal testing lab for the fame...(thanks Jeff Weise) though the homicidal ideation I DON'T want is the serial killer one. 

I have 3 questions about my issues.

Is the desire to kill curable? Am I born evil/hardwired to kill others? What can I do about this other than kill myself?"
493,Hello my little brother is having some issues,"I don’t know where to post this but hopefully I can find a solution here. So since last week my little brother has been feeling sick. The first time this happened we walked it off but the next day my mom gave him medicine and tea. He felt better but the next day he was feeling cold and throwing up. We resolved that it was the corona virus. He started getting better in the next 4 days but today he was constantly hurting himself and saying “the people in my mind kept saying I’m sick”. And then kept crying in the corner. My family are looking for a solution so I tried reddit. If you know what it is, please tell me and if you know a fix for this please do comment it. I really hope he gets better"
494,Spontaneous Ambidexterity .. anyone else?,
495,I am having a mental breakdown,I’m super insecure and I don’t trust anyone and I’m currently in my room crying listening to music and I can’t breathe properly and Idk what to do and I just can’t deal with it and I have no one I trust to talk to and ugh
496,Is this normal?,"My thoughts went from “I want to die” to “Either Tomorrow or my birthday I’m going to get a whole fucking pack of Benadryl, crush it, put it in water and chug it.” (This is the thought I had Today, I’m too scared to do any of it, but it’s sounding like an easier and easier thing to do by the day.)

As in, is it normal for suicidal thoughts to get more and more elaborate?"
497,Anyone who uses a sunflower lanyard for mental health issues do you benefit from it?,"Hi, I've been looking into the sunflower lanyard recently trying to see if its something I would benefit from, up until now I thought that they were only for people with conditions such as chronic pain or autism but I've seen that people with mental health conditions are also using them to indicate that they may need additional support and I'm not sure whether to get one or not? I kind of feel like I dint deserve to have one because other people need more support but im trying to stop that mentality and focus on helping myself instead.

I've been in and out of therapy for many years for various mental health issues including anxiety, depression and trauma and recently I have found out that I might potentially have borderline personality disorder (I'm too young to diagnose but I have emotional deregulation). I'm perfectly capable of doing things on my own most days (like going to the shop to get groceries, going to the doctors) but on bad days I just need people to be that little bit more patient with me because when I get very anxious I find it really hard to talk to people and make my thoughts clear, I don't cope well in new situations or with meeting new people and hate being a bother to people (staff) when I need help because I feel like they're judging me for wasting their time. Because of past trauma I freak out if someone touches me or gets too close to me.

So I'm wondering if there's any sunflower lanyard users here and trying to find out if you guys have found the sunflower lanyard beneficial? Are staff more patient with you? Are people more understanding when you take longer to order or can't phrase things right?"
498,Help with anxiety/panic attacks,"Any ideas or techniques good for dealing with anxiety/panic attacks?

Fireworks are a major trigger for me and we are now entering a time or year where fire works are fairly popular, albeit for Diwali or Guy Fawkes night...

I know where it comes from. It comes from
When I was in Israel a few years back there was a rocket attack and I can still hear air raid siren and the booms of the rockets when I hear fire works go off snd it causes anxiety attacks to the point that I struggle to breathe and my chest hurts.

I’m sure this probably isn’t normal and I would very much appreciate any tips for calming myself or at least grounding myself and reassuring myself that I’m safe.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and any help is appreciated"
499,I don't know how to live with my family.,"How do you accept and live with the fact that your own family does not love you and want you to be happy?
it's been always hard living with my family but it's getting harder and harder everyday to the point where am having a mental breakdown everyday and it just hurts so much and I can't make it stop, I don't know how to make it stop, I even think about hurting myself just to make it stop. My mother told me I wish you were never born (just because I am a girl not a boy) so even my mother who is  supposed to be the closest person to you the one who truly loves you, doesn't want me. The worst part is that I can't even move out of the house unless I get married, and I don't want that, so I'm stuck, hopeless, and really depressed at this point. 
what do you advise me to do?"
500,disconnecting from reality and forgetting things," 
i used to zone out and only be aware of it after i 'came back' and my eyes focused. anything could trigger it - my mind would go completely blank, i would be unable to hear people talk or see them wave their hands in my face to 'bring me back'. i was completely disconnected from reality. it would happen in all situations, even halfway through someone's sentence even if i was listening carefully. it happened repeatedly and excessively. like..... WHY?

rn im having trouble remembering things things i do. i forget massive details of negative events or the whole thing. it's exactly like recalling a dream when you wake up. and for simple everyday things i forget what i just did. for example i might intend to do something, procrastinate and not do it, only to get up and find its already been done. i live alone btw."
501,Do most people have anxiety to some degree and does most everyone suffer with depression at some point in their life?,It feels normal to me and I don’t know how to fix it. I can’t imagine other people go through life without this.
502,Disclosing Disability to Employers,"I've started to apply to jobs in my dream field, and just don't know whether or not to disclose myself as disabled.

On one hand, the impact mental illness has had on my life has been monumental.

On the other, I'm doing better now and don't imagine I'll need any sort of special accomodations.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be very welcome."
503,I think something is wrong with me but I don’t know what,"A few weeks ago I went to a professional to see if I have ADHD since I’ve been showing a lot of symptoms,but they said that I don’t,I couldn’t tell them the symptoms because I don’t know how to word it,(if you are wondering,I was speaking Arabic so it was a lot harder to explain what I’ve been feeling) and I’m not sure whether or not it was the psychologist doing a not-so-good job on trying to understand what I was saying or if it was because of me not properly explaining the symptoms I’ve been showing,so I just ignored the problem but now it came up on my mind again and I don’t know whether or not to go to another psychologist.
Do I do something about it?"
504,Burned out,"I've burned myself out at work by doing too much and taking too much on. Luckily my work are being really supportive. I know it's going to be a long term thing to look at and deal with, but I have 2 days off now for the first time in months. 

How should I spend these days?

Also what should I look at doing to help me long term?"
505,That feeling of not knowing whether it's your meds or something else,"I've been doing so much better in the last 5 days than I was two weeks ago, before I started lexapro. My doc thinks that it might be that lexapro helping early on. I'd be ecstatic if that's the case... But it's so annoying not knowing!! Like, is this going to be long term improvement, or is it just good luck and things will take a dive again soon?? All I can do is wait and see, but I hate not knowing whether I truly should be hopeful or not. I'll be very sad if this improvement is a fluke."
506,Mental Health During COVID," 

I've never really been one to experience depression or any kind of really emotional states, But recently its been getting worse.

I'm currently working a 10-hour-a-week retail job earning roughly $500 a month. I've been trying to get a new job for months, applying, going to interviews, but nothing. Every small failure in getting a job is a bit of a set back for me. I feel like im not progressing in life and am being stopped from getting to where I want to be.

My goal by the end of 2020 is to get my drivers license. As im only 18 y/o, this is a big deal for me. But as expected, the financial situation making this very hard.

The financial situation hasnt improved either, it cant. All the time im struggling to get a job, i'm stuck at this current shitty dead end job.

I hate to blame external factors for my own struggles, but this time, I feel its more external than internal. Although being externally influenced, my mental state is worsening, all the time i'm kept indoors and not working, my thoughts are stuck with me and theres no distraction. I've tried sport, gym doesnt help. Hobbies are a failure too. I cant seem to keep them up.

Idk what to do from here. I feel like im at a dead end."
507,why do i cry and feel so overwhelmed when someone comfort me or apologize to me?,i don’t even feel anything when someone yells at me or treats me like sh*t or hurt me....but when i vent to someone about something bothers me or when i have an argument with someone and they try to comfort me or apologize to me i burst out in tears and i experience weird feelings...i just can’t explain it! i wanna know why do i act like that? i feel so vulnerable and emotional when people show empathy to me!
508,"no goals in life, no motivation or purpose","i  have no idea how i want to spend the rest of my life. i dont have any  goals whatsoever which results in me not having any motivation at all to  do anything. i dont feel as if i have a purpose. i cant exactly  describe what it feels like to be honest. i dont even know what i like  or what im good at or whether im good at something at all. when i think  about going to school and studying i feel so down. like it immediatly  drags down my mood. theres nothing i look forward to and theres nothing i  want to achieve.

(i dont think i have depression. im not sad or suicidal)"
509,I feel so hopeless,"I know I posted this yesterday on a self harm sub but no one responded and I really need help so I’m trying again 

Yesterday I woke up at 3 pm which was kinda worrying cause normally I make myself get out of bed by 12 but today I was dragged into sleep, it’s 6:22 right now and I’ve finally given up and gone back to laying in bed my mom told me yesterday that if I didn’t pass my classes this semester I’d have to find my own place I’m in my second year of college I’ve already failed out of my classes so I probably have until maybe January I think until I’m out on my own, I don’t have my license and I live in Maine so I’m probably gonna freeze to death in the Woods one of my brothers died last month and I’ve started SH again because my life has completely fallen apart I’m only working one day a week at my job because COVID is making it really slower I’m missing my grandfathers celebration of life Saturday because it’s the only day I work 
I feel like with how quickly everything’s fallen apart that I should take this as a sign that I’ve stayed on this planet to long you know? It’s like I’ve overstayed my welcome. I know most of this is completely my fault so I can’t even blame anyone for the shambles things are in I think I’m just not cut out for being alive right now but I’m too afraid to die I’m just stuck in this weird limbo where everything is hell it’s my own fault but at the same time I’m unwilling to fix it I don’t know what to do"
510,dealing with feeling numb,"i am constantly returning to this feeling of numbness in relation to, well, everything

of course, i have happy/sad/angry moments, but they all seem to be especially fleeting, and at the end of the day i find myself residing in an empty vessel

i have goals, but i really donʻt see a purpose in having them anymore; i really just have them because everyone says i ought to. i have some personal achievements i want to reach, but i will do after i reach them.

i hate to be ungrateful for my life; i am blessed, really, but i just donʻt understand why, or even if there is a ""why"" to anything."
511,I wrote this and on a second thought I think I need some help,"First things first, it's very long.

I don't know if it's right to write this here, if it isn't please tell me and I'll remove it. It's late at night and it's the only time I allow myself to be emotional and I'm overwhelmed. This may become rambling or incomprehensible so I appreciate if you power through it but I fully understand if it's too long. I just... I'm tired of shutting up.

I'm afraid, I'm terrified of being alone for the rest of my life. I love my close family and that's it. If they die I'll be alone. And I didn't do anything meaningful in my life so I feel like a waste. 

Soon I'll be 20. Supposed to be an adult, well established. My parents married when they were 20. They had me at 21. They got married and moved far away from their parents and had me, and I at their age am a failure. 

What did I do in my life? I tried my best but I didn't do much. I try to do arts but it always looks like shit. I try to write stories but nobody reads them. I pour all my soul in what I do and nobody cares.

I use all my energy for these grand shows that have no audience.

No, I'm wrong. They care. Because they love to take my stuff and break it. They say I deserve it. I always studied hard, it felt like my thing, so I always had high grades. But that meant that all the kids hated me. 

I was 6 in first grade. My classmates were 8 or older. That age gap stayed for my entire school life, and I being the smaller one I always was the butt of the joke for them.  Even though I got taller than them all somewhere in 10th grade.

I was broken they said. Why? Well I never had a crush. I didn't act odd with the boys, I didn't spy them from corners... I never understood that. And for that I was broken.

I always thought that the fact that dad fixes cars is amazing. Just by the sound of an engine he knows what's wrong. He's amazing. But the adults didn't allow me to be at the repair shop for I was a girl and I could only break stuff. In spite of that, dad taught me how to fix stuff, the wonders of electricity and showed me an engine in pieces and told me what each did. I love him. I don't love him just for that, but because of who he is. I love mom and my sis for that too. But people want and expect of me to love a stranger and leave them. How could I trust a stranger like that?

I was broken for liking ""boy stuff"". I was insane for saying out loud that I like games and dinos and tech and cars and so on... I was wrong in the head for them.

I remember what they did to me. Everything. I remember everything like it's recorded in my head. A blessing for studying, a curse for interacting with people.

I remember when a guy put his launch sausage between his belt and belly and cornered me. He yelled at me. All the class joined. He told me I was too retarded to get a real sausage so I have to go for his. I closed my eyes and said nothing but he stuffed the sausage in my nose. It hurt. I think it was a hot sausage.

They laughed. They always did. They beat me with yoghurt on a freezing winter so I'll turn to stone. They stole my stuff. They destroyed my stuff. They followed me to the bathroom so I had to pee in a hurry always because they would climb the stall and shame me. Because I was ""showing myself"" by going to the bathroom. They ran after me with needless because I'm allergic to mosquitoes and they wanted me to die. 

I adopted the nerd persona. They called me a nerd as to mock me, but I truthfully liked the stuff they called me a nerd for, the videogames, the books, the movies. I was a nerd for I didn't understand or want anything to do with romance or sexy stuff.

I was broken. I had no purpose they said.

I had a friend once. Since we were toddles. We had fun together, playing GTA on his computer, making puzzles and pretending to be dragons. But when we were 7 or 8 his mom decided that her boy can't play with girls. I never saw him again, I don't think I would recognize him now. But I hope that he's okay, that he finished that mission and found the missing pieces of that bridge puzzle.

I didn't have other friends because people would only consider me a joke. They were a few who called themselves my friends, but they only wanted homeworks from me. It was nice that they talked to me but they never listened. Or cared.

I used to have these habits. Weird even for me. I had to check if I locked the door 3 times when I left home, I could only step on the black tiles at school, I had to put my food on the table before the microwave finished beeping, I had to keep my colors in order and lots of stuff like that. I had specific steps I had to take to do stuff. Otherwise? I felt like some impending doom was waiting for me to make a mistake and destroy us all as soon as I would fail a thing like this.

In the last year of HS it was the worst. I was at my worst. I worry about stuff a lot. And at the end of HS I had finals that were going to decide what college I could attend, I had to apply for college and hope to be accepted. And there was this guy, he liked stuff I like. I thought it was so nice we liked similar things and that we could talk about them. We hanged around together until he told me to kiss him. I said that I don't want to, and he knew that I didn't want to do that. He then became another person. He mocked me and the stuff I liked even though he liked them too. He demanded I kiss him multiple times and told me it's my fault that I had no friends and that I would die alone because of that.

Him, my finals, everything added on top of each other and I couldn't feel anything anymore. Not sad, but not happy either. Numb. Nothing I did got a reaction out of me. That was my worst. I feld like I was at a bottom of a pit and that I couldn't climb out, that there was no way out. I couldn't draw and that killed me slowly. My drawing is awful, but I can't function properly without it. That's how I think, that's how I process information. It may make no sense but that's how I work.

When look back at my sketchbook in that period, it hurts me. There are just a few drawings that I managed. But the characters look tortured. I make my drawings happy, for I have the power to make them anything so I make them happy. But during that time I couldn't.

During that time I didn't even care. I was just worried about everything but I didn't care about me. So I stopped doing those weird habits, thinking that whatever would come after me could do whatever.

But then... During summer holiday, when we were at the seaside, I love water and I love swimming so much, and they posted the results with who got into college and I saw I was the 10th one at the one I chosen, I felt again. I felt something and it was happiness! It was soo good. I celebrated with my family on the beach and people looked weird at us but I didn't care. I had to go into the water to cry because I didn't want my family to see me like that. I didn't knew why, but I cried. And I felt good again.

Sometimes I feel guilty even for the pandemic. I feel like I brought it upon us for not doing my old habits, even though I know that's not logical. I can't control the way I feel.

College is something else. People are something else here. They're not mocking me anymore. Stuff I've been tortured for it's the stuff that makes me cool now. And I can't believe it. It's so good that they talk to me now, that my stuff isn't getting destroyed and so. Sure, I have to keep them at arm's length just to be safe, but it feels better.

Or I mean, it felt. Since March we're doing online classes and I miss them and the place. 

I have spent much more time with my extended family because of what happened. I feel like my brain will turn to mush and leak through my ears from what they're telling me.

From all the sides I hear only how I'm destroying the family because I'm not married, because I said I didn't want to marry. That I'm a traitor for not having or wanting kids. That I'm a curse for I never had a boyfriend.

It hurts. They give me this problem that I can't solve and it hurts me. I'm glad my parents don't share their sentiment. But I'm related to this whole village and I can't visit my good grandma who lives there because I would get cornered and bombarded by those who'll tell me I'll bring the end of the world. Those who say I'm incredibly idiot, those who say humans, fish and birds aren't animals and that my lizard will kill me. I'm related to these specimens, thankfully not by blood with most of them but still. 

The grandma who lives close to me? She told me the only purpose I have is to give a man kids and make him happy. And I can't understand that because grandpa is not like that. But she is. 

So many people hate me for things outside my power to change. I don't get romance, I don't fall in love and I don't want to marry. Just like that. Am I really that terrible for it?

There's some good stuff thankfully, outside of what I already mentioned. There are some people I interacted with, even briefly, and those moments I keep close for they fuel me to go forward.

People like those from the reptile expo. I usually have to wonder if people are genuine, but for them I felt it. All loved creatures and all were wholesome. I live with the moments I shared there.

In 2017 I think I went with my sis and grandparents in vacation. One day I was alone with my sis at the playground. I couldn't play because the parents present there wouldn't let me, so I sat on the bench drawing. My sister came to me with another girl in tow and told her ""tell her what you said to me"". And this little girl goes ""what's your favorite animal because mine is spinosaurus, he's the coolest that's why"". This little kid knew what a Spino was in a country where losts think dinosaurs and science are a hoax. We spoke at length about the interesting stuff, like dinos and cool animals and things like that. We didn't share names because that wasn't important. I'm sure I'll never see her, but I wish her the best too. She was the coolest one.

This teacher in HS who really liked my stuff. My only reader. We're still friends but I'm too shy to message her.

I don't want to bother people, you know. That's why I don't allow myself to be emotional where people can see me, where my family can get worried. I get emotional at night, when I'm alone. Sometimes I feel like I could do anything and say that the next day I'll fix everything, but obviously I wake up knowing that I can't. Other times I just cry about what I lost. Other times I cry about what's to come.

Not even on the internet I allow myself to be myself. This isn't even my main, on that one I only allow myself to be polite and helpful. I made this one to speak my mind, my weird thoughts and what I hide, for on the internet you can be whoever you want, yet the most difficult I find is to be myself.  Lately I posted more on this one and for some reason this has more karma and followers so I guess at least someone finds my existential crisis entertaining.

Which kinda tells me that the person I want to be, nobody cares about. Not even IRL I speak my mind. Not even to the few people to whom I thankful, that reached out to me here. I can't break out of polite small talk.

I got shit for showing just a little bit of myself, I don't want to think about what I'll get by being myself. My whole myself.

I think back about that scene at the seside. I have to wear a bra to cover myself on the beach. Guys don't have to and it doesn't really make sense to me. But the old ladies, they don't care and don't wear bras. I want that mindset, where I could be me and not ashamed. More power to you, random old ladies.

And you know, there's lots of things I don't get. Why I have to marry or I don't have a purpose, why I have to wear dresses or I'm ugly, why are there boy and girl hobbies. Shit, just let me love my dinosaurs.

But there's my little lovely dragon. I love him. I know that with all my being. I want to give him only the best, he couldn't do anything to upset me and I worry about him even if I shouldn't. Just looking in his direction makes me very happy. My heart melts when he shows that he knows who I am and doesn't like other people around him. And here's the thing, if my family dies I'll be alone and I wouldn't have someone with whom to share the joy that is my baby dragon. And if I die first then he looses me. And when he and my family will be gone I'll be alone. Will I even exist if there's no one left that cares about me? Do I even have a meaning to be? 

I would look at him now but lights are off and I don't want to wake him. I'll greet him in the morning, I can't wait for that everyday. Can you even believe it? I jumped through so many hoops and now I have this baby dragon who's the best thing ever.

My hand hurts from writting and I think I should go to sleep now. I probably won't fall asleep for a long time as usual but at least I'll try. I should proofread this but, maybe I shouldn't post this and make people waste time by reading it. I'll look at it again tommorow.

----

Yeah it's tommorow and I'll post it. I thought hard about not doing it but in the end I don't have anything to loose. If I don't post it then it's kinda like waisted time. Although it felt better to speak (write) my mind for once, even though it's badly written. Crying gives me headaches."
512,Having a glow down at 16 and other depressive bs,"Firstly, I understand this is a first world problem and there are so much more that requires attention which is serious. But i feel like i have almost to no confidence because of this.
For some conxet , i used to be extremely pretty and some what popular.
I have had a few boyfriends nothing serious obviously because im too young now as well.
Over the past year and half i gained alot of weight and had major life changing experiences. (I don't wish to share but it was really depressive and i had to start at a new school so it was equally awkward.) 
My family situation is really weird as well. My parents don't really like each other but are together because we live in a significantly conservative society.
I gained alot of weight because of these reasons and also some really weird ones which i could solve but im just a naturally shy and sensetive person. 
I stopped playing sports of any sort in grade 9 because i became very self conscious of my body and my mom wouldn't buy me a sports bra which she still wont. I have asked her or hinted at it but she doesn't want to spend her money on it.
Other thing is that I am not allowed to wax/shave my legs/hands/face or any other part of my body. I just feel extremely uncomfortable if not judged by others because of this. I gave up sports because of this. I really wanted to play but I felt too insecure. 
Now my parents are constantly taunting me because i gained weight. I feel like there is no way out of this.
I have stopped wanting to even step out of my house because i am scared someone is going to point out the weight gain. I have resorted to food as a comfort from everything. 
I don't want to go to school or meet my friends for that matter because im scared that they will be mean when to some extent they wont. They would just be concerned. 
My school uniform won't fit me and I don't want to ask my mother for a new pair because she will taunt me and say mean things.
I just want to disappear.
Everyone my age now has a boyfriend/girlfriend idk i feel so alone and unloved. 
I am so demotivated. Nothing seems to fix it.
I am fine most of the day. When i go to sleep it hits me. I feel sad and everything aches.
I fucked up my sleep schedule because i stay awake overthinking or just staring into nothingness. I sleep at 5 am sometimes and get up late in the afternoon so I can skip breakfast but i end up eating more. 
I just hate being alive but dieing seems like a painful route which doesn't guarantee a relief from this. 
All this has led to a major glow down and alot of insecurities and me losing alot of friends.
I understand there isn't much u could say about this and i just want to be honest but blunt basic advice like talk to ur mother or someone close won't help me. I don't feel anyone is close to me. I don't feel that way w friends or any family member. 
Just go do what you like isn't an option I don't have an income plus my parents would get mad.
Plus I can't get any professional help either my parents would be reluctant plus i don't want to feel judged by them so I don't tell them any of this or to anyone else for that matter 
I just felt like ranting."
513,How to disconnect negativity with music/games/items/places that remind me of being in a bad place mentally?,"Hi all, I was just wondering if anyone knows of any good info in regards to removing negativity connected with music, games, items, places and such.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g: I love music and I listen to it when I'm in a bad place... but when I listen to certain/my favourite songs/artists when I'm in a good place it reminds me of when I have been in a bad places mentally...

... In turn that makes me sad because I cant listen to the music that I love.

Same goes for games, items, places and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you"
514,"my parents literally said that ""i eat with my eyes"" like what is that supposed to mean?","i think that all i was doing was eat normally, but they don’t see what i'm seeing. they say to me time and time again that it’s not true. that i eat too much than i actually should, that i eat a lot more than my parents combined, that i have an abnormal eating problem and me being oblivious about it where i would binge everything in one fucking setting, that i eat even when i'm not hungry. but i don’t see it?"
515,I'd love to learn more about therapy and what is the process!,"Hi dear members! I'm doing some research on therapy and I'd love to know you guys' insights and perspective on the therapeutic process, what is this process, and what to expect from this experience. Your feedback would help me greatly. Thank you all!"
516,Is this really all that my life is?,"When I was in middle school, I was constantly worried about my grades. I was always told ""Get good grades now so you can get into a good university. It'll also ease off some pressure for high school"". I used to think ""omg I need to be super worried now so that I can be happy in high school."". Then, when I finally got into high school I realized ""Oh no that's not the case at all. I need to work super hard right now so I can get into a good university. Once I'm in university, I will be happy."". So again, I was constantly worried, stressed and anxious throughout high school. I got into university and am now in my 3rd and final year but I have come to realize that I wasn't happy here either. I've spent my years in university constantly worried and stressed about getting a job and figuring out my future and how uncertain it is. I think to myself ""You'll be happy once you've settled and found a job"" but honestly, I'll probably be worried about something else then. I look back at the years leading up to now and all I feel is regret. ""Why did I take this thing so seriously, it didn't even matter in the long-run."" However, despite realizing that, in the future, I'll probably look at me now and think the same thing, I still can't shake off any of my paranoia. Is this really what my life is? Just constant worry, stress and fear for the future?"
517,Social Anxiety,I think I have social anxiety and I know that it’s ignorant to self-diagnose so I haven’t. but everything I’ve researched and seen reflect my exact experiences. I don’t want to tell anyone though. I physically wouldn’t be able to get it out. I’ve thought about talking to the college (UK) counselling teachers and help staff but I’m afraid they will tell my parents and I dont want them to know. I know you all probably think that I need to say and the best thing is speak... because I think that too. My problem is doing it a way that won’t change everything too much. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to. So... yeah.
518,Mentally abusive relationship,"So I'm a 24 year old male living with my dad..at first when I started living with him he and I were doing just fine. We would have good family nights and hang out all the time. over the years, that all crumbled down. I was trying to find a job for a while, but wasn't able to find one. After a while I did and now I'm happy where I am after finding my current job. The only thing that has been getting to me over the years is my father. He was kindly telling me things in the beginning, but as time went by, he just got worse and worse. Telling me stuff like if I don't find a job he'll start charging me rent. I do pay him rent now. $400 per month. Over the years, he's been saying stuff like I'm not even part of the family anymore. Because I don't talk to anyone and mind my own business. I just go to work and chill out in my room because when I talk to anyone, they just change their tone with me. I don't feel welcome here anymore. When I went out to go hang out with my friends at night. I was locked out of the house over night and all dad said was. ""If you want to go see your friends at night time you're not living here"" that doesn't make sense, cause I get home at the same time I do when I work. so there is no difference to him...that just put me in danger during the night. When I developed severe anxiety and depression, to the point i had to go to the mental ward in the hospital. I told them about everything and all they said was. ""You don't have depression. you have a good life here. I actually have anxiety.you shouldn't have depression"" and assumed I was lying and saying ""just so you know we won't visit you in the hospital unless you are actually dying"" but that's not what made me want to move out of here. It was the locking me out at night. I'm seeing a therapist, and she agrees with me that I am not in the wrong here. I don't know if I can call my dad a parent anymore. I want to add one more thing. I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher, I'm very proud of my job. I obviously work at night so I sleep in when I can. Is that understandable? I got up this morning and the first thing I hear is ""if you don't start sleeping during the night, you are going to go live with your mother or somewhere not here."" And he cuts the internet due to my ""bad sleeping pattern"" so I sometimes get home with no internet even though I pay him rent. Also we all know my mother is a homeless alcoholic, so that's not an option. I thought of just getting a place of my own or a shared rent a room type deal for cheap. What do you think? My apologies for grammer. I tried."
519,Id like suggestions of what the hell i just went through,"So this just happened and i had the great idea that i should really get help but id like to hear from reddit whats wrong with me, any suggestions would be great.

I dont know much about this subreddit so if i do anything wrong in this please point it out in the comments.

So im a 15 year old female living in the uk and im not sure what really happened but since its still fresh in my mind i thought i might aswell try to sort it out in words.

My boyfriend came over to my house about 2 hours ago and all was great, we had a lot of fun and we opened up about some personal things and its all good, once he leaves of course im sad but nothing bad, me and him were texting and he was tired he went to sleep, the usual thing we do and for some reason i started to get more and more sad.

Once we said goodnight to eachother i started thinking to myself about how i kind of wish hed ask more about me and stuff like that, then all of the sudden my mind went straight into suicide, i sometimes think of it but not seriously but this time it was serious like i remember thinking ""i want to go into the woods or something ans just dissappear"" then it got worse by thinking""i should make a suicide note and tell the people that i love that i love them but life is just too much and im so sorry"" then i started crying a bit cuz yknow its sad.

Then the crying got worse, i just looked dead at the ceiling and cried hysterically whilst my body was stiff, i breathed irregularly and at a quick then slow and sharp  i remember thinking of my mum (oh yea my mum took pictures of me naked when i was 6 and we had a 'play fight' whilst we were both naked, ik fucked up, pretty sure she was drunk and doesnt remember) and how she ruined everything, ik typical teen stuff lmao.

Then i got better, my legs were super stiff though and it was hard for me to go to the bathroom to blow my nose, and when i got back to my room i just went stiff again, legs and hands were the stiffest, my head was jerking forwards and backwards every few seconds and it took a lot of effort to move again, i don't even remember what i thought about my mind was just blank and i just stared at my wall, my head was very slowly turning to the right and i remember i looked myself in the mirror and honestly i looked really creepy, like even i was scared of myself.

Then i started to cry again because of what ive become (a mess) i thought i was just becoming someone really broken and i just wanted to be fine.

My legs started to move again but they were still stiff, and i had a massive headache.

Now this is the really concerning part:

I have a small dog whos a bit annoying sometimes, so i was laying in bed when she started to scratch the door trying to come in, i thought if i leave it shell go, but she kept scratching and scratching and harder than thr last one, i got really pissed so i walked to my door and when i saw her come in, i dont know what or why i did this  it feels like this didnt even happen but i just snapped, i just got so angry i slapped my own dog to, the slap was so hard i heard her whimper.

And when i heard her whimper i realised what i did and i just broke down crying on the floor, i was so ashamed of myself i just wanted to die, i was repeating ""im sorry im so sorry fuck im so fucking sorry i didnt mean to, i really didn't"" i just felt genuinly terrible, i dont know what got into me, i cried for at least 10 minutes and stopped. Everything was fine again made the dog happier by stroking it and giving her kisses.

This was really long jesus if you read through all of that thank you so much, i made sure i treated her this afternoon a lot better, i never hurt my dog intentionally in any way before and i still dont know what came over me.

Tl:dr-i cried hysterically a lot multiple times, my body stiffened up for majority of it and a sudden urge to hurt something came iver me and i hurt my own dog and felt fucking awful (ive made sure shes better now)

Please, any suggestions what this might be ask any questions of any history of my mental health beforehand, thank you so much for reading"
520,Do I need medical help,"I want friends but just dont know how.

I've been feeling numb for years and tried new activities to find new hobbies and interests. But I think the reason behind it is because I dont have people to share those experiences. Since young I always had problems to make friends (I believe im in the aspie spectrum). I just couldn't connect with them and now I have social anxiety which is increasing my insecurities and making it harder to make friends. When I was a teenage I had a phase of self-isolation due personal circumstance. My classmates were nice but I just didn't have the feeling to invest I  the or in new friends. I had quiet some meltdowns for tiny reasons in the most inappropriate scenes.i would cry for anything. I though it could be hormone but the sadness was constant. 

Now im trying to improve myself, but it just doesn't work. Everytime I try to take part in a conversation or just trying to talk to someone my mind goes plain blank. I can't think of, literally, any words or anything. Just plain blank.  It's super exhausting and is affecting my grades. I try to be open and not restricting myself, but there is a feeling g inside me that doesn't let me.

On the other hand, I tell my friends and family that i may have some mental issues about my social interactions. But they always say that I'm just introverted or shy, even joking that I'm an aspie which I'm now consering myself one. Should I reach for professional help?  Maybe it is true that I'm just introverted and need to work on my social skills. But with covid it's harder and I just dont know what to do."
521,17M. Mother probably didn’t feed me enough breast milk when I was younger. Should I be worried?,"17M. My mother in mid conversation brought up that she didnt feed me much breast milk when I was younger and kept me much more on powdered cow milk because I didnt like the taste of it. I immediately thought, ""surely that shouldn’t be done."" Even she said, ""that's probably why you're so dumb"" as she considers me to be so. Therefore I searched it up on  google and found claims that some research show that its associated with Autism. Here is some text from the [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096620/#:~:text=These%20effects%20on%20antisocial%20behavior,who%20were%20breastfed%20%5B44%5D.) read:

""Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that the absence or short duration of exclusive breastfeeding might be associated with the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social impairments.""

My whole life, people have been considering me very weird, unsocial and introverted. I have trouble concentrating sometimes and usually am not considered to be smart in general. My mother has jokingly even said that I might be autistic. Now I'm in real fear of the possibility. Has she made am irreversible mistake that has ruined the possibilities that could've been? 

I do understand that what has been done is done forever. It cannot be changed. I only ask so that I can cope with it and take duly measures, i.e. seeking mental help. I'm at a very low point in my life now and had just made the biggest mistake I've made yet by doing considerably below average on the most important exam I have ever given. I am also very depressed and have been for the past several months as I feel a sense of voidness up ahead as if I don't know what I want. Should I go to a psychiatrist for help? Should I be concerned about any of this? Truly devestated, I don’t know what to do and have not felt this hopeless as far as I can remember. I apologise for the bad English.

Please help me."
522,I want to talk but I don’t know how. (16M),I’ve struggled with mental health for a while now and I used to talk about it with my friends but then my parents found out I was struggling. They found out I had been self harming and I went into hospital. At this point they confiscated my phone and I just had to wait to get out. After this I didn’t really talk about my problems at all. I gradually stopped hurting myself but I never stooped struggling. Recently I had a sh*t parents evening at my school. YR11 in the UK. After that I’ve wanted to talk to someone about my problems but I know that as soon as I start a conversation I won’t know what to say and I won’t be able to get help. I’m sorry. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
523,I maybe suffer brain problems I need to know what to do.,"Like look I don’t know if I have any mental brain issues at all but my problem that I suffer from I feel like I just am too dumb and can’t understand anything or learn how to do new things like I’m so slow. I have no SKILLS OR TALENTS AND SLOW LEARNER and trouble understanding simple or complex things.

I don’t know if I have any learning disabilities but growing up I didn’t do so well in school I passed High school based on luck and mostly because I cheat my way by cheating on some test sometimes and because I was in SPECIAL education classes I basically had an aid teacher that would help me almost every day which basically got me to the high school without learning how to be independent and now that I’m graduated I don’t know what to do now like I cannot even maintain job because They say I’m so stupid I can’t understand how to do simple things they asked me to do like I just don’t understand it even after someone tries to explain it to me so many times I still don’t get it and I sometimes forget things after trying to understand and finally understanding it give it a few days I just forget about it easily sometimes I don’t sometimes I do I don’t know why people can try to explain it to me in a simple way but even after so many explanations I just won’t get it for some unknown reason.

I feel like I’m also suffered physically or mental psychological I don’t know how to call it abusive by my older brother for the past 10 years in my life. Don’t know if this contributes to any my problems but what I really mean is I don’t know I feel like I need a therapist or psychologist to help me out but I have no insurance no job and I’m planning on 
running or leaving my home since I am 19 years old. Need some resources.

524,"Some thoughts on another level that I constantly think about, diagnosis of what I got?","So I’ve got a busy 2 years ahead of me in terms of education. I’ve always tried to put that first but as a result it means I haven’t been able to socialise outside with people outside of school/college. There’s a girl who I have complicated history with but we’re friends, just, and I don’t know how I continue; do I try and continue to be friends with this person who I might not know after 2 years time but still means a lot to me or push her away before I hurt myself because there would be no point emotionally investing into this person. But either way I don’t feel good, as she’s got two different sides to her, one is nice and the other is nice but I feel like it’s an artificial personality just so she can fit in with others so when everyone’s around, I feel like there’s no point in being friends when she acts different around others. yet if i pushed her away, I’d regret it. And this all leads to a bigger feeling of fear of death because everyone lives to a certain age and that’s it, you’re gone, you won’t think again, feel again, won’t even remember what existence is because you don’t exist anymore, you’re dead. I wonder whether all this effort in education or people is really worth it in the end when I’ll lose it all at some point."
525,I can't do anything related to school anymore,"It's just been a month since I couldn't work on my school assignments. I got around 10 graded papers that have passed the due date a long time ago and I also got 3 more projects to do today and I can't start. Sometimes, even when I got started, I couldn't keep up - I totally lost focus. I'm not doing anything productive and I've literally stopped. Time is passing way too fast and I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm not sad, I don't really feel much. I feel kinda normal. I've never been like this in school and I'm definitely not doing this because I am lazy (though I do feel pretty tired all the time). Anyways, can anybody help me? The only thing I've been doing is writing poems to keep me stable or whatever (to purge). But again, I really have not been feeling much for a long time now."
526,My dog the hero.,
527,I quit therapy this week,"I’ve been in therapy again for about 4 months. I was doing online therapy via BetterHelp. My therapist was nice, she listened to me and made comments about my problems and occasionally offered advice. Well, about a month ago I started working again and I was hoping therapy would help me resolve any anxiety or stress I felt from my new job. This wasn’t my first time in therapy, but I do think it was the longest I’ve tried it. I just didn’t feel like occasional comments on my personal life was worth $45 a week. Was this a mistake? My anxiety has been manageable, as well as my stress. I’ve been telling myself if I start having problems I can just start again with a new therapist. I just felt like I was wasting money on telling a stranger about my life every week."
528,Is this normal? or am I just a bitch?,"So for some background, idk if it affects anything, but I do have A.D.D.

I've noticed that recently, in the evenings when my medication is wearing off, I get irritable, but I've noticed a pattern to it. 

Noise.

I think it starts with a mild headache, but I am still uncertain because I kind of live in that state.

And then I'm suddenly aware of every little noise in the house and it makes me want to SCREAM. It's not as if the noises get louder or anything, but suddenly I become incapable of tuning them out. Voices (specifically, my parent's) and my dog's nails across tile are the worst offenders for this.

I can hear the birds outside, or the gutter dripping, or sometimes even the lights/electricity in the house.

The ONLY way I've found to relieve this is a specific set of earbuds, with music playing. Not earPLUGS, because then I can hear my blood and that's somehow worse, and not JUST the earbuds because then I can hear nothing whatsoever, which is equally maddening. 

Has anyone else experienced this? what's happening? is there anything I can do to stop it? or even mitigate it?

or am I just a bitch?"
529,I got asked out on my very first date !,"I met this guy online at the start of quarantine and we have been talking for a couple months . We wanted to meet up , but because I have cystic fibrosis and he had a heart disorder we are high risk . So he invited me on a zoom date and we are going to have a virtual date on that . This is my very first date , I am so exited because he’s such a nice guy and I’m so greatful. Fingers crossed it goes well , any tips ?😬"
530,Covid depression,"So i live in Canada and we are in the second wave of covid right now and i am not feeling good at all. 
Between the ages of 12 to 17 i’ve battled with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, self harm and stuff like that and it’s always been a part of me but since covid hit, the confinment and everything completely fucked me up. The first wave wasnt as bad for me because i was with my boyfriend at the time and we would go different places to hike, go on walks and everything since its was summer but now that the second wave hit...dude it’s been so hard on me. I have this job that i love and my boss had me working from home, (which i could not wait for) but its been a little over 3 weeks now and i am not good. Always home, can’t go see my friends( they live in a different city) i don’t have a boyfriend anymore so i am always alone. At least if i could go to work i’d see people but i can’t. I’ve really been feeling my depression come back and suicidal thought. I know it kinda sounds stupid but it’s so hard on me right now i really needed to vent in here..."
531,I don’t trust my memory,"Is it possible for your brain to make up fake memories? 

I’m not sure if this is a problem or dissociation or depersonalization, PTSD, or general brain damage from drug use. 

I keep catching myself thinking that something has already happened before. For example, I’ll see a video on instagram and think about it for a minute and keep scrolling. Then, after the fact, I’ll realize that I’ve seen the video before already, weeks or months ago, but I just watched it like it was brand new.

Sometimes I think maybe my brain is making up the memory. Ex. I’ll have a full conversation with someone and convince myself it’s happened before but there’s almost no way we’ve said all of those same things already. 

I think it stems from a place of distrust in my own brain and memory because I know I tend to erase things from my past. 

(ALSO it’s not just deja vu, sometimes the memories are definitely real)

Has anyone ever gone through something like this?"
532,My Old Therapist Was Convicted of Rape (not me),"This is crazy - this happened two years ago and I just found out. 

When I was 16 years old (I’m 30 now) I went to Utah to one of those treatment centers. I had this therapist there. Nothing ever struck me as too “off” about him at the time, I was also a lot younger than I am now. But it’s creepy to think about how a predator was lurking beneath the surface. Especially since we continued to maintain contact after I left Utah and even had dinner once (I was 18 then). Luckily, he never laid a hand on me, and as far as I know, any of the other girls at the time. 

The charges brought upon him are/were very serious and disgusting; there’s numerous of them. Mainly grooming and having sex with a 16 year old. I won’t post his name here, but I’m sure you can google it if you’re curious. 

I’m not posting this to take away from all the good therapists out there. I actually have an excellent one right now. It’s just alarming to think that this man was my therapist and a “friend”. Anyways, thanks for reading if you did."
533,I felt so frustrated today,"I (16) woke up like an hour earlier today than I usually do because of stress. I don't like school (many reasons) but for some reason it was worse today. I felt sick when I got up. I even got some good news but I didn't care about them at all. School sucked but not subject wise this time and tbh I would never expect this. My ""friend"", the person who was with me during middle school and the first high school year kind of betrayed me. We had elections today and she voted for a guy who sexually harrased me a couple years ago and bullied me for a long time. When she told me I was like ""What?"" and she said ""chill it's not even a big deal"". (She is fully aware that this guy did this stuff to me). I'm probably overreacting but I was hurt. She did sth similar once again 2 years ago but I didn't give it as much attention. Idk what to think about her at this point. 

During school time, the teacher and some students were discussing stuff. I could not even share my opinion. Nobody would listen. I feel like I don't even have a voice sometimes. Anyway, when I was going back home with my sister (16), we had an argument. I was so hurt again. I also forgot to take my antidepressants so this could be one of the reasons I kept on feeling down. 

More things happened today but I see no point in getting into them. It's pretty late here and I have exams tomorrow so ig I have to sleep (finally yay no pain). Thanks for reading and I'm sorry if there are any mistakes. I'm way too exhausted to correct them rn :("
534,I don't know what else to do,"My depression and anxiety have gotten so severe that I have panic attacks and even dreamt of my own suicide 2 nights ago. I've tried everything I can think of to do, but I can't afford therapy, I'm trying medication but it's doing very little, I applied for SSI but have heard nothing back. My insurance covers barely anything, especially not telehealth. And I lived in effing Missouri so most of the mental health resources go to substance abuse. Sometimes I think about getting addicted to drugs just so someone will help me. I'm losing all hope, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just gonna become another statistic that people will wish they got to in time."
535,"I’m really messed up , Lucid nightmares are real , and they’re slowly killing my mind","I don’t know how to start or what to say , I’m not even sure if anybody will read this but I’m really messed up , I’m frustrated, but it doesn’t show.
I’m perfectly fine , but the insides of me are all messed up , I’m acting funny , but I’m not even sure if I’m there


It started when i was a kid , I’m a very active lucid dreamer — my first lucid dream ,
It was all fun , flying and all , and since then i never stopped having lucid dreams , they made my nights fun , and it felt like something special i had that nobody did ,


But ,, three years ago , my lucid dreams were not just dreams.

I don’t know how to describe it , I’ve seen everything horrible that a person can see but it was all a dream , I don’t wake up , I’m perfectly fine on the outside but my mind is going crazy , my body is not shaking but i am , my voice is weak but I’m screaming and I don’t know what to do about it .


I’m lacking sleep , I’m scared I’ll have to face my thoughts,

I’m bipolar , a hypomania and i have PTSD, but this is something else
I’m not hallucinating, i know whats real and whats not , i really do

I just can’t keep up with my own mind

I can’t focus on anything anymore , i can be in the middle of a conversation and then wonder off with my mind somewhere else ,

I had a good memory but now I’m forgetting everything, i started getting angry , i get 10 mental breakdowns a day ,


I can’t sleep at night
I can’t breath

I can’t do anything but feel this way ,



Today broke me , i finally slept after 3 days of no sleeping , 

And something really strange happened , 
I felt dizzy , like really dizzy even though i was asleep , i felt things moving around me even though i had my eyes closed , it was like i would fall off my feet even though i was sleeping ,


I got a really really bad headache, it felt strange like its coming from the back of my brain , my stomach started hurting really bad ,


But i was completely fine on the outside ,


I then got another lucid nightmare , i was in a pitch black void with nothing , absolute nothingness,

No matter how much i moved I wouldn’t move in real life
No matter how much i screamed for someone to wake me up I wouldn’t say a word 

No matter anything, i was sleeping peacefully 


I’m going insane I can’t take this anymore 


I’m sorry for the long post , you can not read but i really feel helpless"
536,You are SO MUCH MORE than your lowest point,"This is something my partner told me while I was reliving one of my worst moments last night. It helped me a lot, and I thought it might help some of you here.

We all have regrets. We've all hurt people we care about. We all make bad choices. But these things don't have to define us. We are all so much more than our worst moments, and yes, that includes you!"
537,"I feel like a completely different person after a 6 month depression, in a good way.","Ever since I started high school (9 Years ago) I've been the type of person that followed the 'cool kids'. Mostly out of fear of being outcasted and feeling alone like I did in the years before that. Because of this, I almost never expressed who I was or what interests and opinions I had, I really was just someone who followed the lead of others and copied their behavior, if i acted just like them, they wouldn't have a reason to dislike me. 

My grades at school started declining rapidly around my third year there, so my parents decided to put me in a boarding school at the other side of the country (Belgium, for those wondering). My new school was known as an OV4 school, meaning that it was meant for children with ASD, ADHD, ADD, etc. The other students there were really nice and I felt like I was accepted for who I actually was. I didn't have to pretend anymore. 

Sadly, during my second-to-last year there, a combination of being a 3-hour trainride away from home and the handfull of good friends I had there took it's toll on my mental health, I started skipping class and taking the train back home halfway through the week. At the end of the schoolyear, I failed most my exams, I had already had to redo a whole year 2 years prior, and I had 0 motivation left in me. So I quit school, and fell into a depression that took me 6 months to get through. 

I had a lot of time to think, find a reason to why I felt so empty inside. And I came to the conclusion that I'd been pretending like everything was fine with me, while it clearly wasn't. The behavior and opinions of those 'friends' I used to hang out with got stuck in my head. Opinions like ""There are only 2 genders"" or ""We shouldn't help refugees"" stuck with me, not in a way that I was sexist, racist or anything. But In a way that I simply didn't care or didn't want to understand such topics. I was stuck in a loophole where I would convince myself that my life was going in the right direction because ""At least I don't struggle with gender identity"" or ""At least I live in a safe country"". Not realising that I was falling down a hole and making myself feel better by pointing at others who were already deeper down that hole.

For the past year and a half, I've changed completely, I'm now much more open-minded and accepting of others and what they feel. Instead of thinking bad of others to be able to think good about myself, I've been trying to help and support others to be happy, because seeing others happy in life, makes me happy."
538,"I never thought of this as a tic because it happens infrequently, but it totally is, isn't it? Is this what a mild tic is like?","I do have mild (diagnosed) social anxiety, and this ""tic"" always happens when I'm in social situations specifically where I feel like I'm ""performing"" or being watched or monitored. It's basically just my neck twitching and causing my head to jerk to the side slightly, but I also have a tendency to try so hard to subdue it that I end up moving my leg or arm slightly (such as pretending to adjust my legs, or itch my face) to try to like, transition the energy elsewhere, I guess? That sometimes works but I'm sure it still looks weird when I keep doing it repeatedly.

I'm 23 but when I was in high school it happened a lot. First noticed it around the age of 15. I was super insecure and afraid of being watched so any time I was in class listening to a lecture, it would happen. Now that I'm an adult, I most notice it during work meetings, but it also occasionally happens if I'm (for instance) meeting up with a new person or a person I haven't seen in a while, or if I'm part of an audience, weirdly enough, or sometimes if I'm just in the lunchroom with a bunch of other people that I think might be looking at me. It escalates if someone actually addresses me, refers to me, or says something that may be controversial.

I know it's stupid but I always thought that - because it COMPLETELY went away at home or with someone I'm comfortable with - it wasn't a tic. I go through 80% of my life not having it at all, so I thought it was nothing. Is this what a tic can be like?"
539,Am I Introvert Or Socially Anxious?,"Well, to be clear, I'm 15 years old.  
Since my adolescence started, I've had some difficulty talking to people and a great difficulty having any initiative when it comes to anything social (like starting a conversation). After a long period of self-hate, I've come to see my social anxiety as something I can't exclude from myself, but that I don't need to hate myself for having. Since then, I don't feel as crippled as before.  


Now I have ""Good Moods"" and ""Bad Moods"". During my ""Good Moods"", I behave extrovertedly. I still feel some anxiety but as I said, I'm not crippled anymore. However, as I engage in conversation I will feel a sort of fatigue and I will enter a ""Bad Mood"". When I'm in my ""Bad Mood"", I don't want to talk to anyone, I don't want any physical contact, I just want to be left alone with my thoughts.   


Now, I don't dislike having those ""Good and Bad Moods"". But I would like your guys opinions. Is this behaviour normal? Is it healthy, and if not, should I get any kind of help?"

This is a fantastic start to the weekend! She wants to take her little sister (the 13 year old) back to Rochester with her for a week, then bring her back home.

542,Struggling with depressive episodes due to COVID and university,"Hi r/mentalhealth, 
I try to keep it short in this article. I'm 20 years old, I'm studying in Germany and next year I'm doing my Bachelor.
However, with my degree I have only poor career prospects, which is why I am struggling with fears about the future that bring depressive episodes. In addition, the studies last year were very exhausting, which is why I suffer from mental exhaustion. This condition is exacerbated by the unregulated Covid daily routine and the associated excessive digital news, Reddit, podcast, audiobook and YouTube selfimprovement garbage consumption making me feel like my head is exploding while my body doesn't leave the house. 
I‘m currently struggling to make a 10 to 15 minute cycling trip a day, while I used to go bouldering and to the gym up to six times a week.

Does anyone have any ideas how I can get my brain to come down and how I can get structure in my day? 

Thanks a lot in advance :)"
543,touch deprivation,"I think I just realized how touch starved I really am. My mom just randomly and quickly massaged my hands and feet after asking her to feel my hands simply because they were warm. She hasn’t touched me in years. In fact, I’ve been been touched before other than hugs, quick forehead kisses and short hand holding moments. Idk, I guess I just can’t believe that people actually get that on a normal daily basis. Whether it’s their friend, partner, sibling, parent or child they still get to feel that physically affection regularly. Man, the things I would give for just a few more minutes of physical touch.... it almost makes me want to cry. Am I weird for feeling this way? I hope I don’t have to go the rest of my life without ever feeling that again. 
Thanks for reading. Have a great day"
544,I feel like I am always about to crack but almost feel at home on the edge and fully comfortable in it and fully in control.,"This is exhausting though and I’m sure I’ve learned something unhealthy from one of my parents if i were to be looking back.

It’s like holding onto pleasantries for as long as possible but feel utterly out of string inside and thin and on edge yet it just carries on going and I “choose” to ride it out and maintain conversation function — even though my voice tone is pretty much gone and I’m looking for something to challenge through my words, and to feel alive of some sort. Anyone know what this is called? It feels right and bearable and comfortable almost at the time but very little memory and awareness of the whole feeling and time that passed during that feeling afterwards as a result. Can anyone help me and explain what this might be?"

I also, when I younger and my life was less depressed, I used to pride myself in my good my memory was. I could and still can remember random things that have happened and just things in general, but in the past couple of years, along with me understanding my mental health more and it getting worse, I've realized that my short term memory has gotten significantly worse.

I'll be doing something or talking to someone and I'll all the sudden forget what I just said, what they just said, or even lose my train of thought mid sentence. 

Like, something will happen, such as someone walks by and says hi and we have a quick hi how are you, what's up conversation and like 2 minutes later I will completely forget who I was just talking to. 

I've started misplacing things a lot more etc.

Is this something I should be worried about? Is it connected to my mental health, or just my memory naturally getting worse?"

I hate looking at myself because all I see is sadness and scars. I genuinely don't think I'll make it till my 18th birthday in January, and I don't think I want to even anyway. I've tried so many therapists, it doesn't work. I've tried to kill myself, it doesn't work. I just want my pain to end or to be happy. Why can't I? Everything is a mess and I just don't know what to do. I have no motivation for school or my future or to even get out of bed a lot of the time. I don't know what else can help me, I've been to so many therapists who all made me worse. I don't think I ever will be happy. I'm just alone and sad and I want it to end."
550,"Anyone else feel like Diane, flipping over nothing to find more nothing?","I’ve been doing really well throughout the Pandemic. Took up crafts and hobbies and focused on my mental health and took time to calm down and look at the big picture of life. Mental health has been very good generally.

But I swear sometimes, it all just feels like I’m trying for nothing. Like a slightly bad day like today and one set back and I just feel like all my work means nothing. It’s like Diane in season 6 of Bojack Horseman when she’s depressed and states that she just feels like she goes through life doing things hoping that she’ll find that thing that makes her happy. But she doesn’t, she just keeps turning over nothings to find more nothing. Like at the end of it all what if there isn’t anything beneath. What if it’s all nothing. 

Here’s what I’m specifically upset about today:
I’m 21, and I’ve never been in any relationship or anything and i KNOW that that’s fine. But I just spent a month getting to know someone off a dating app and it led to nowhere and I’m just exhausted. And of course it seems like all my friends are in healthy stable long term relationships, I even had to hear about my ex-hookup (the closest thing I’ve ever had to a relationship and super healthy) and the great relationship she’s in. I struggle with Demisexuality and feeling like I constantly just don’t experience human connection like I should. Like maybe I just wasn’t meant to be in a relationship. It’s something i come to terms with again and again and I still get my hopes up and get crushed. I swear I spend time focusing on myself and building myself up just to get the confidence to put myself out there and get crushed again. I haven’t felt any sort of romantic anything in years I’m so tired of hoping and trying for it. 

This was mostly a rant so I can get it out of my head but feel free to leave a comment trying to cheer me up or if you even just relate to this episode."
551,Question about my sociopathy,"Ever since I could feel I haven’t felt much emotion, like something was missing. The only emotion I feel is strong anger. I have not been properly diagnosed because I don’t want people to think I’m crazy because I am not I just don’t feel as much. So I guess I am asking what do I do?"

*I hate this feeling. I hate feeling lonely when I'm in a relationship. I hate feeling un wanted, unappreciated, and I hate feeling like I'm a burden. I'm not perfect, and I have issues, I hate that nobody understands and I hate that I have no constructive help with my issues. Only judgement and a lack of understanding. I try so hard every day is a struggle to be a good man. Every day is a struggle to do and say the right things and react in an appropriate fashion. I wish people could understand what it's like to live in a constant battle with your mind and emotions. When I try so hard and it goes unnoticed I get sad. when I feel bad and get upset, it pisses people off. I'm my own worst enemy and have to live with myself which is just as hard for me to do as it is for people around me and for that I apologize to everyone that interacts with me. Tearing down from the inside out. Feeling as horrible as one can feel. Feeling as if your soul can't escape your mind. I just wish people understood. I just wish I was easier to deal with. And I just wish I could live without these thoughts and feelings. It's really hard to live everyday having to be conscious of things that go on in the head when these things should be able To be accomplished subconsciously. I don't expect understanding because it's not a common thing but sometimes I wish there was a way I could share the way it goes for me everyday with others so they understood. Even though I would not wish this battle on anyone in the world. I'm not easy, I'm not perfect, I'm bipolar, and hard to deal with. But damn it, I'm worth it. And damn it I wish I had support. I wish people could understand and help me figure out what I need at times. I'm fighting this battle alone in a way (as to mean that I'm the one that understands and have nobody around that gets it or gets me.) I have family and friends that are ""there"" and will always be there. But they just don't understand and they don't know what it's like. Please God send me someone that can help.*"
553,Does it make me a coward that I want out?,From the title it may sound bad to people but I'm not abandoning the military more so it's an environment that not helping my state of mind at the moment. I know it sounds pathetic compared to what other people of went through in there but every person has their breaking points with certain topics and it seems that I've met mine to a certain extent. I joined when I had a lot of underlying mental stress that I've hadn't dealt with for years and never confronted. An to tell you the truth I joined the military in hopes that it'll distract me from the fact that I exist. There are multiple things I tried but after a few days of doing it get I bored right away or don't have the energy for it even though I'm never tired. But honestly speaking deep down I joined in hopes of dying. I've tried my best to make myself apathetic a long time ago and it works to an extent but sometimes I just have random breakdowns emotionally not often. Tears would just randomly stream down my face but I wouldn't feel anything. I haven't felt anything and I mean nothing for a long time no joy or anger only thing I feel is a rush of adrenaline when doing something life threatening. I can do a lot even some some things people would find hard to even to go as far as taking a life an not feeling anything. It may sound like an exaggeration I feel that way 100%. I'm not crazy when even though it sounds that way I wouldn't do something like that because doing something like that doesn't make sense to me. With the way I feel I see it as just do it. Passed through some schools in the military even though I'm still relatively new.  But as of late my emotions has been going ballistic and I control them like I used to before but its getting in the way of a lot now an the military life is only making it worse. But not just my military life but everything in general. I've already been pretty isolated myself and not in tune with my emotions but that'll take to long to explain. But I'm not sure how to proceed because I don't want to get discharged an it messes up my G/I bill because I'm college because you need such an arbitrary piece of paper as one of the ways to potentially survive on this stupid dying rock in the middle of no where. As well as I may potentially wanna work for a law enforcement agency down the line or the fire department and the discharge wont look good. The small part of me that breaks down wants to have a real relationship because I just feel lonely even though I'm surrounded by people I should feel connected to. Me being apathetic has sabotaged a lot of relationships for me because I just cant explain myself because every time I try my mind goes blank and it pushes people away. I'm not an open person but the people I am close to it sabotages a lot of those relationships and now I'm left alone. The military isn't helping me and I want get my emotions back under control before suicidal thoughts take over like the did a long time ago.
554,kill me,"you ugys really want to kill me huh, banning me for whenever I say the truth with scientific backed evidence. cowards."
555,"Wich advice, that could have an impact on your current mental state, would you give your younger self and why?",(Title says it)
556,I don't feel like a Survivor,"On many occasions I have wanted to die. I was ready. It was going to happen. I couldn't. On a few occasions I was ready. I had a plan. It was time. It failed. Why? Why did it fail? I was ready. I was so ready, but what did I do wrong. When you close your eyes in hopes to never see the light of day again, to be blinded by the brightness when you come thru. That's heartbreaking. Not only did I not want to live, now I have to live with the fact I failed. I don't want to be called a survivor. I didn't survive anything! How many times do I have to survive? I have prayed to a merciful god who has showen me no mercy."
557,Is it normal that when I’m happy my only want is to go back to being depressed,Right now is the first time I haven’t been suicidal in a long time. Now I just want to go back to when I was my lowest. I’ve started substituting my need to suffer with self harm but it feels like I’m doing it for attention. I’ve also started gaining “recovery” weight from an ED and everything just feels wrong
558,Never let go....,"Now I don't usually do psa style things cuz I would be a pretentious twat however don't do what I did. Don't be an asshole, try to care for your mates. Be there for them. Hold on tight and never let go....
Especially kn hard times. Don't let people drag you down. Your a great person. Stay alive because people will miss you!"
559,I want to kill myself,"How do I make myself want to stay when there’s no way to erase the problem. One big problem is always haunting me, it will never leave. On top of that, other problems keep getting stacked. Right now I’m in a women’s shelter because of my emotionally abusive dad just to stay with my other emotionally abusive parent who believes she’s the perfect of the two and does nothing wrong. They both have mentally destroyed me and burned my childhood to the ground. I’m trapped in one small room, smaller than my own bedroom. We’re not allowed to leave for ‘security measures’ Theres not enough food, I couldn’t go to homecoming. No bike rides. No sun. I haven’t been a happy person since 7th grade because of the big problem I mentioned earlier but being trapped here has accelerated my want to die so far that I’m trying to figure out how to do it in one shared room right now. If I don’t I’m going to be here for months and will miss my puppy growing up. He loves me and is trapped in his crate with no one to socialize him or play with him. He will miss his childhood. I want to die. I have no good parent and no one to talk to. Please help me"
560,I see no hope,"Moved to a new country a tear ago for studies which has obviously been suspended because of corona, taken online, given me only chance to just sit at an empty apartment and listen to the lectures, taking any sence from me moving abroad scenario. 
Ve been jobless for a year, feel like invisible due to all the no-responses to my attempts and like a failure.
Have no one in here, just 3-4 acquaintances that I do not even like, they just happened to be met on the way. 'Ve got a boyfriend of 4 months that I tend to spend my nearly every night woth but the minute I stay alone I have nervous breakdowns or panic attacks that also come up while he is around. 
it's time to start the thesis that I have no idea of, not motivation for and more importantly no hope for, everything lost its sense and does not seem to be any hope for any change, so far me moving in this country has been the worst decision ever and feels like there is no going back from this already half journy and no way further too. 
Have never felt myself this emotionless and numb ever in my life, I am not sure what is the purpose of this post too, but I am unable to go to any therapy as I can barely efford to live and it all seems pointless already"
561,My friend is on the verge of suicide due to her medical conditions.,
562,What should I do?,"(16M) Some info about why I'm making this post - I at the age of 11 tried to commit suicide and failed. I was forced to see a psychiatrist to check on my mental well-being which I said to I was fine and I had no more bad thoughts till I didn't need to see them anymore. Now after 5 years of pent up frustration of me thinking over and over if I should do it or not.

I have a gambling addiction where I have lost a ton of money where I selfharm everytime I lose, like bashing my head in a concrete wall until I bleed. I don't trust my current ""friends"" because it feels like they are around me for money and they wouldn't care if I died and the old ones who would've cared are sexist and racist pricks. (I also smoke, drink and use white portions which you can search up what they are.)

Everytime I am in my crammed apartment room and open my window I contemplate on jumping. 

The only reason I haven't done it is because I have a loving family which I know would be really sad about my death.

There is more but I don't feel like talking about it.

(The important thing is if I should seek help or not and keep hiding my feelings since I feel scared to be judged by people around me..) - My question I guess.

The reason why this feels so hard is because it might halt my studies, make home life harder and I guess the chance of making everything feel worse.

I have never taken any I guess ""mental"" medication or what you call it and I want to avoid that since I want to feel clear in my mind and not feel unsure or foggy."
563,Please give me a way to get through this,"I get so stressed out over everything, even minor things. I always feel like everyone is judging me, and that every day I prove myself to be even more stupid.

I’m finding it harder to cope. I worry about so much, and now my thoughts seem to always go to ending it. It brings me comfort in a way, knowing that the pain of being here could stop. Yet, I could never actually do it. So I’m trapped dealing with it. I’m dreading going back to work Monday because of dumb minor worries. I’m struggling to do college work tonight, that’s due in a few hours. 

I feel like nobody around me cares. I’m too scared to say anything about how I feel inside, but I also want people to realize that I’m struggling. I feel like I have nobody to turn to. I so tired of going through this."
564,I have suicidal thoughts,"I’ll start by saying im not depressed. And I never have been. And i never have these thoughts when im sad. I don’t know when exactly this started, at least 3 years ago. I will often see a knife and go through what it would look like (in my mind) if i stabbed my self in the mouth, stomach, etc. I put myself in third person and just think about what it would look like, who would see the scene first, the aftermath. Another example is when im on a tall building i will go through the same thoughts but with me falling off the building. These are just some examples.. I will also go over scenarios that have happened to me in the past such as being stabbed. From my general knowledge of mental health this seems like PTSD and anxiety i just want someone’s opinion that has experience/more knowledge."
565,Killing me softly,Anyone else feels extremely in tune with this song? Sometimes I don’t want to let go of pain because it makes my experience so special...
566,I am obsessed with re-creating a period of my life for some reasons," 

This may sound strange but I will do my best to explain the story to you.

2 years ago, I lived what I will call in this story ""the good period"" This period lasted about 5 months and if it marked me so much it is because I discovered during this period all the things that I like today and especially because I had a good entourage, I was in my universe and nobody made me shit. To try to illustrate ""the right period"" I will describe some typical tricks of this period

\-I had a world on minecraft that I liked a lot and I spent hours building on it.

\-I was building for a minecraft server (which closed down in the process)

\-I was a trainee in a restaurant with super nice people.

\-I was playing a list of specific video games that I will not quote because I am lazy.

\-I had rgb leds on my desk

\-I was on specific discords servers

\-And I discovered a lot of video games that I still love as much as ever

Now you who are reading this text are going to say to yourselves ""where is the problem? It just looks like the text of an asshole who feels nostalgic"" Well it's not as rosy as that. Indeed for the past year and a half I've been obsessed with re-creating this period of my life like a psychopath trying to find a pretty girl he met on the street, basically:

\-I'm trying to put everything on my desk as it was at that time (thanks to the few pictures I took).

\-I'm trying to redo an internship in the restaurant where I did my internship 2 years ago.

\-I created a playlist of the music I was listening to during the right period of time.

\-I force myself to play the same games I was playing during this period.

\-I got back in touch with people I haven't spoken to in 2 years.

\-I have created fakes accounts to see my messages from the right period on discords servers on which I have been banned.

\-I put on the clothes I was wearing during that period to feel like I was at that time.

\-I handed over the profile pictures I had at that time.

So even if I take some pleasure in doing this it starts to eat me up inside and I feel like I'm going fucking crazy, I'm trying to find lost emotions because my life has changed a lot in the meantime (I'm not in the same school as before, I don't have the same hobbies as I used to have at that time, I almost don't see the people I was dating during the good period) Anyway. And it goes even further into madness, watching the twitch streamers I was watching at that time, putting my skin minecraft back as it was before and even forcing me to not like some things I didn't know during the good period, in class I only think about re-creating this period of my life, there's not a day when I don't think about that and I'm starting to be afraid of myself.

This situation is really special, I don't think I'm the only one on this subreddit to have talked about something like that, if you know someone who is going through the same thing as me or if you have experienced it yourself I would like to have your opinion on this """"""""""obsessions"""""""""".Thank you for taking the time to read!

567,Advice Please?,
568,My identity is too wrapped in who I am an employee. It’s sending me on severe anxiety spirals (that ironically make my productivity worse). Any advice on how to not do this would be greatly appreciated.,I need help. Any advice would be amazing. I get way to worked up about mistakes and I’ve never known my identity as anything other than a hard working employee or student. It’s destroying me at this point. Please help.
569,¡ Life !,"Honestly I just feel like venting. Life just feel like a load right now and sometimes my mind just go into a depression state that I try to quickly snap out of. Luckily my mind is that strong. It’s crazy how tough life is, and what makes it crazier is the fact that I have so much more of life to live. It bothers me knowing that life has so much hard times in it. I just wish i could avoid it all. I know most of it is for learning purposes but damn can’t I learn a different way? I’ll be fine though. After writing that last sentence I chuckled a bit and for some reason it knocked out the negative energy. Overall It sucks that life is this way sometimes but God knows why He made life this way. So I’m not gonna bash His creation because at the end of the day it will be beneficial for me.  Hope you guys enjoyed your day and I pray you can see the light at the end of your tunnel."
570,Does anxiety medication make you too relaxed?,"I’ve been taking a cymbalta/bupropion combo since about February along with hydroxyzine for sleep. While this has generally worked to keep my anxiety levels from work/ school/ a LDR and managing adulthood, I’ve felt more and more lately that it almost works too well. I find myself not as worried about deadlines or punctuality to the point where I will just not stress at all. That is, until right beforehand where I feel the pressure piled up and BAM full on panic attack. I’ve also noticed it’s affected my personality in not so great ways. I’ve made some poor life decisions lately and now that they’ve built up and I’m looking at the consequences, I feel the panic again. I’ve considered the apathetic times are depression disguising itself, but I’ve generally never had issues with depression...

I guess this is part question, part asking for support, but has anyone else experienced this kind of thing? What did you do to address it? Thanks in advance!"
571,[Advice] Consistent anger/temper issues throughout life,"Hi all,

I’m usually a lurker on reddit so forgive me if the format of this post is wrong but I need some advice.

I’m easily irritable, I have been for as long as I can remember and I have a tendency to snap at friends and loved ones in a ridiculously overreacted fashion.

For example, my long term girlfriend may repeatedly ask me something  I’ve already answered and I respond with an aggressive “I told you this already blah blah”, even with the most light hearted question that doesn’t even matter and would be forgotten in moments.

Playing video games with friends, a lot of the time it’s great fun and I enjoy the experience but when things don’t go to plan, I hate it and my mood turns sour in a heartbeat, often resulting in anger bubbling out of control and essentially soiling the mood, but I love playing and hanging out with these friends.

Why am I like this? I consider myself as very happy in life. I suffered from depression in the past, though I believe this was situational as I was struggling to get a job in my desired career,  and was struggling financially but my amazing girlfriend helped me through those times and I’m now in a well paying job that I love and I live comfortably, so I can’t understand why I’m so irritable.

I try to pursue calming hobbies, I’ve recently taken up drawing and i work on coding projects in my spare time. 

It feels like I constantly have this pool of anger that’s ready to boil over the edge at the drop of a pin, but that’s not me, I love a good joke and I care deeply about my loved ones. I want to take life easy and love each moment , but this well of rage sours it.

Why is this a thing? It makes no sense to me.

."
572,Should I worry about this?,"For my whole life there’s been a little voice (not like an external voice just a part of my subconscious) in my head telling me I was better than others. It would insult even the people I most care about to an extent I would never even consider. People I think only good things of, will be reduced to slurs for a second before I can get my thoughts under control, not to mention the constant reminders of my high IQ, and the way the little voice tells me that because of it it’s ok that I’m rude or sometimes an outright dick to people. If I were to say the things the come to my head out loud I would very quickly be labeled as a narcissist. The problem is things have been getting much worse recently. I can hardly stop myself from saying these things out loud and hurting people I love. 

Tl;dr I have a little voice in my head that’s a dick and it’s been much harder to contain recently"
573,Anhedonia and me,I can't fathom people feeling things like they are meant to be felt. Any time I do anything I am almost always underwhelmed. I am incapable of feeling anything at the same level as everyone around me. Are those people just faking the enthusiasm? Or am I just incapable of feeling that type of emotion? I've seen several psychologists/psychiatrists but like.. No one has any good advice to help me FEEL things. I got married and it was just another day to me. My mother died and I couldn't shed a tear. How do I start feeling? I would like to feel like a human
574,"Is it normal to have a conversation with “your self”, while imagining youre talking to a friend as if they were there with you ?","Is it normal to have a conversation with “your self”, while imagining youre talking to a friend as if they were there with you ?  
So ive been doing this for a long time, But when I’m alone I talk to my self but I’m imagining having a conversation with someone I actually know in real life. 
So for example if something happens in my day that I would usually tell a friend, sometimes I’ll go in front of the mirror (imagining looking at myself talk from my friends pov) and tell my friend about something that happened recently or just anything I feel like talking about. 
Then other times I don’t go in front of the mirror and I just imagine theyre in the room w me and I’m talking to them. And sometimes when I’m cleaning my room I’ll imagine my friend is in there w me and I’m talking to them. 
Just to be clear, I don’t imagine fictional people, it’s always people I actually know that I imagine, but I’ve never had many friends and the few friends I have are guys and I don’t always feel like opening up to them about everything in real life so instead I imagine having the conversation. 
Is this normal?
I also notice I kind of whisper when “talking to them”, like my mouth moves and a little of my voice comes out, so like I’m just talking real quiet"
575,Is there a way to stop thinking altogether?,"I just went through something very emotionally painful between myself and my partner. Long story short he was very drunk and said and did many things that hurt me (nothing physical nor in a manipulative or abusive manner)

I’ve been crying all morning and writing down all my feelings to remember for when I speak to him again. Right now I just don’t want to think at all. I feel physically ill because of how much he hurt me today and I want to stop thinking altogether. 
Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with painful arguments and depression?
Does anyone have any tips to relax and quieten my mind?"
576,Is meditation always helpful?,"I'm currently having to do therapy as a requirement for my college course. I'm also having a hard time though. Being still is very hard, laying in bed trying to sleep is the worst part of every day, focus is very hard too. My mind is racing, I feel very overwhelmed. My therapist suggested meditation. Now I've meditated a lot in my life and those meditative states have felt useful and relieving. I know meditation is broad, and many things can count, even going for a walk. At the moment however, because of how my mind seems to be I'm finding it very very stressful to try to meditate, I'm in a constant state of stress. The therapist seems sure mediation will help, to the point where she wouldn't let me say, 'I'll try', she said ""no, you will"". I get it, she's trying to be positive, and I understand that things are very unlikely to improve if you don't believe they will, etc etc, and if you don't try to give yourself a break. Right now though, trying to meditate puts me in a worse state than before. I'm already trying to think of counter arguments to negative views, even if I'm really struggling to believe them, I am actively trying to improve my mental state.

Ive heard a few people say that there's no such thing as not being able to meditate, that all things can be meditation. If all things truly can be meditation, that kind of suggests existing is meditation. I'm talking about the actual act of being in a state of flow or at peace though. A few people have felt I was wrong in the past for suggesting I couldn't meditate at various points. Like I said there have been times I found meditation helpful. Is there a chance the people who don't believe that it is sometimes hard or impossible or not helpful for some people to meditate at some points just don't know how it feels to the people who sometimes cant?

Am I not allowed to be having a hard time but be working on it without it being suggested I'm not trying to feel better if I don't feel I can meditate? I have a history of severe self harm, I feel like there's a genuine thing, that internalising and trying to slow down sometimes isn't possible, sometimes people need release in a more forceful manner? Sometimes people feel things really strongly physically and thinking doesn't always suddenly erase it? Or at least not quickly enough to stop the feeling being excruciating? I can go day by day trying to think things through and improve my mental state, but right now doing that in the form of 'meditating' doesn't feel right. I am working on it, the fact I'm not happy and carefree right now is not because I'm not trying hard enough, it's because I need a bit more time to analyse what's going on and get my head round it so I can change it. 

Surely people aren't calling any type of thought meditation?"
577,Joy to the World,"Everything seems to set me off. Seeing people so happy with their new car. Seeing people with friends. Seeing people with a popular YouTube channel. Commericals and advertisements that torture the metaphoric soul. Seeing rude customers demand for their coffee or food. Finding out about how shitty 3rd world countries can be. Seeing people with their happy lives in happy homes that they think they so well deserved because they have a job. Knowing so many people have good lives at the expense of the exploitation of others. Capitalism. Seeing how politics is nothing but a game, using the masses as pawns, resulting in everyone tearing each other apart who have different politics. Other people work just as hard, if not, then even harder, and tons of people are struggling, not just struggling externally, but internally as well. Today there is still slavery, rape, murder. That chocolate bar you ate the other day? Probably from a cocoa bean picked by a black kid in africa, being paid less than a dollar so American companies can save money. Having Nike be the shoe brand to make you popular at school, even though their made from child labor in sweatshops in China. Watching the planet being destroyed by human caused climate change, and having so many people in denial or not caring. People born with deformations or other problems. Stupid mother fuckers that will feed cats when their away from home, so that the cat will forget to go back home and be lost. Animal abusers. Factory farms where animals are fed to obesity and never see the light of day so we can have McDonald's. People shooting any stranger because of a little argument. Toxic masculinity and homophobia. Making friends with people who have social status to increase your own social status. Flint still has led in their water, and nothing is getting done. So many religions claiming to unite but they only cause violence and division. No one taking a pandemic seriously. It's all just a constant struggle of suffering and feeding off of each other. There's more, there's always more, but now it's time to talk about my problems.

My hearing is sensitive(some where on the ASD spectrum) every little sound, the sound of forks hitting the dish plates, the sound of people walking around, people in my house constantly coughing, other people playing music(I know there's nothing wrong with music) dogs every where in the neighborhood including my own, barking 24/7. People gossiping annoyingly on the phone. These things will cause me to have a melt down. I have no control when the anger fills me until I can't be filled anymore with anger, it needs to vent somewhere physically. Bipolar depression. Times where I want to help everyone I know and try to improve the world, and then times where I want to kill everyone, exhausting my mind with negative thoughts, tiring myself where I could sleep forever but yet it's impossible to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time. All the times of being bullied through school. Isolating my self for so long, I think my personalities split from each other, letting me have long abusive conversations with myself, having my others selves talk to me to put me down. I'm fucking spoiled. I have a job and I live with my parents. I have videogames and I have the privilege to sit on my ass to enjoy videogames, while other people around the world have lives 100 times shittier than mine. None of these things belong to me, I don't deserve luxuries. I don't even deserve my body, my body doesn't belong to me. Why should I get to enjoy it? Why don't I just kill myself if I hate everything? Probably because that takes a lot of strength, something I don't have. I don't want someone seeing the dead body that was never mine to begin with. I read the description of the sub. It said I was allowed to vent, yet I'm still not satisfied, we are never satisfied. I can understand why people creating art is a better vent than writing because sometimes there are no words to describe how you feel. You can never understand anyone, and no one will ever understand you. Words and language are a secondary source of information of what someone is really thinking. You are the only one with your thoughts. You are truly alone, no matter how many people you surround yourself by, everything is in your head, only you can know what is in your head. Like I said, those thoughts aren't even your thoughts. Did you really create the thoughts in your head for the brilliant ideas you dare take credit for? Go fuck yourself."
578,What’s wrong with me,"(I am a female age 20 if that helps) God I feel like I’m going insane. For the past few years (more consistently this past year) I swear that I’m being watched. I can be alone at home and I just feel like there’s cameras everywhere, that I have no privacy anywhere I go. Like there isn’t cameras in my house but I just have this feeling they are watching me. And by they I don’t know who just someone is out to get me. Especially when I go out in public I feel like everyone is staring at me and watching and judging my every move. I know that sounds crazy but I swear it’s driving me crazy and nobody believes me. Whoever “they” are they’re getting in my head and they’re telling me what I cannot and can do. I don’t know what they want from me, but I think they’re trying to make me go crazy. There’s been times I thought I was home alone, but then I’d hear my mom on the phone with my aunt talking bad about me, only to find out that I’m by myself. Why are they doing this to me?! Nobody believes me, I’ve tried to talk to my boyfriend about how I feel and how I swear there’s cameras around me at all times but he said I’m just overthinking and stressed but I just know someone is watching me. This may be unrelated too but I have a crippling fear that everyone close to me is going to die if I can’t see/ be near them. I know that’s crazy but like if my mom runs to the store if she doesn’t call me or text me I’m convinced she got in an accident. I hate when my parents go on flights or trips because I’m convinced the plane will go down or something bad will happen. I hate that my brother barely comes home because I feel he’s going to drink or OD with his friends. I know that’s outrageous but I just can’t get these thoughts out of my head. What’s wrong with me?? Am I going crazy?"
579,What are deppression symptoms,I've been think about death and questioning mental health
580,"I woke up from a nap and now I’m just UPSET, but for no reason","I was pretty tired today but I still did my day off errands. When I got home, I ate dinner and took a nap. As soon as I woke up, I just felt SO anxious and upset and it didn’t take me long to start crying.

I literally don’t know why I’m so upset and what’s wrong with me but I feel terrible.

Any advice?"
581,I’m not suicidal in the commonly understood sense but not a day goes by where I don’t think about death,"I’m tired, I’m bitter. So many dead friends this year, fucking heroin ODs or freak accidents. None deserved to death but here I am wishing for it and yet. Human traffickers, a psychotic man cornering me with ice pick, dangling from a ceiling, ODs just to wake up in the hospital still alive. I won’t die by my own hand, I’m aware of it. But I will die eventually. I want it and I want it to be on my terms. Yet still I keep throwing myself into danger to help people, to save them, to make a stand without ever causing injury to another and yet I keep fucking living. Burning in fires, getting shot, I won’t fucking die. At least I’d feel okay dying doing something I chose instead of tortured and raped and helpless in some manifestation of existential horror, of the tragedy that is to live the flux of the human condition just for your last moments to be nothing but fear and violations and empty loneliness with no one to comfort you while you’re made to live through hell. But every fucking wound of trauma whether it was forced on me or sought out, I keep surviving, and with every one I feel alienated. My entire life has been either an active tempest of hellish experience that makes you wish to have never lived, to stand on the edge of death in a way you sickeningly know that so many actually spent the last moments of their existence, or throwing myself in damaging danger just to still be here, when I would have welcome death if it could have meant something, save someone from hurt but release me from this god damn weight all at once. I don’t want to live. I’ve stood in front of 50 cal anti infantry guns, taken beatings, bled, felt my body break and I keep craving it. I’m done with being alive. I have no interest in being alive. But my death needs to be my catharsis. Dying in the hands of some inhuman sadist fucking sucks. Dying alone by my own hand sucks. It’s fucked up that I’m still here and have to live with what it feels like to face that empty damn void like that. So all I want is to die standing in my feet, with purpose, but in the end I crave being on the edge of the void and diving in, just on my own terms"
582,I think my little sister has an eating disorder and it's my fault,"I (15F) have a sister in middle school who I think has anorexia or is developing it and I'm really scared for her. We're not very close but I really do care about her and I'm really worried. She had been overweight for the past 3 years or so, but has recently been losing a lot of weight (she's in the healthy weight range now) really quickly since quarantine started. Now this normally wouldn't be much cause for concern, but she's been saying that she's been ""starving herself"" for over 12 hours at a time. In the hours that she does eat, she's been eating really unhealthy processed foods and sweets. She doesn't seem to think it's a problem - she always seems extremely proud when she says that she hasn't eaten since \[insert time here\] or lost \[some amount\] of weight.

I talked to my mom about this today and she seems to understand kind of what I'm saying, but not really. My parents are immigrants from a country where mental illnesses aren't a big deal. It's just something that people deal with themselves or with very close family and only the most serious cases get taken with a doctor (the same is true for physical illnesses so it's not just some conservative mindset or anything.) However, I don't think my sister is as strong-willed and I'm really worried that she'll do something. When I told my mom, she said something along the lines of how my sister's always been like this in a way. She said that when my sister was a baby and she would hold her, she could feel that she (my sister) felt very alone. Like she was ""the only one in the world."" My mom told me that I couldn't fully understand what it felt like and even started getting a bit choked up.

I think this is my fault. I've been suicidal for a bit over 1 1/2 years now (please don't give me sympathy in the comments tho) and nearly attempted a once or twice, and I used to get into these state of minds very frequently (it's a lot less now) where I'd just hurt (emotionally) everyone around me. My sister is a very caring person and she can always tell when someone is upset and try to help, so she would and I'd get upset and essentially just give her generosity a cold shoulder. I think this greatly contributed to her feeling alone and isolated and this is my fault. Then I start thinking about killing myself and all that stuff cuz this would not have happened if I weren't here and all that stuff, but then it's also jsut outright selfish to think about *myself* when this is about my sister. But then this makes it so that I can't think about this logically. I want to cut myself or soemting but then that's making it about me if my mom sees it (which I think she has before) when I don't want htem to be worried about *me,* but I need them to care mroe about my sister. I feel like I *need* to do it but i'm too scared to and now my head's just all filled up since I can't release it and it feels like it's about to explode. This post is probably really selfish but I don't know waht to do. Please help. I'm scared of doing any more harm to my sister."
583,Toxic Person looking for help,"I've caught on that i'm quite possibly the toxic person since my last relationship failed. Ive seen various posts saying that toxic ppl should get battering intervention therapy. i would but here in the UK, the waiting lists for therapy is so long it's useless + private therapy i cant afford. so im looking for alternative ways to help myself like maybe educational books or videos on how to NOT be the toxic person. any advice would be great"
584,I cant let it out and i might lose control,"

The last few months have been hard starting with my father up and leaving his job at the very start of quaratine and being unemployed ever since.

 Him being around triggered a mess of childhood trauma and i can't be around him for more than an hour without needing to leave the room. 

I pretty much hide in my bedroom if I'm not at work. 

So I try to work as much as possible and work as hard as possible. But work preformance means nothing and no matter how much I do work it still doesnt matter cause I still am forced to live at home.

Everyone seems to be having some happiness driving them. People are getting promoted, getting married, having children, adopting pets, travelling, or moving out and my life is just a mess.

All of this is building a ball of anger deep in my chest. I have thoughts of screaming and swearing and wishing to tell people how I really feel. But its impolite to share my feelings like that. Its wrong to scream. Its wrong to throw fits so I have to just sit on my anger and hate.

I have no way of letting any of it out. I've tried literally everything to let my anger out. I've tried deep breathing, i've tried stress balls. Chances are if you think of it i've tried it.

So I end up cutting myself to try to control it and protect others. But even thats not enough. I want to scream and I want people to know how much pain im in. I have no way to let it out so im stuck with the baggage of this anger.

I want to let it out somehow"
585,My mom is in a complete psychosis with schizophrenia and I don't know what to say to her.,"This has happened on and off since 2014. I'm 20 years old now and am the only one living with her because my other sibling can't handle her when she's in this state. She is on an antipsychotic medication and I made sure she took it today, but she's missed the last four days and is currently in a total psychosis. I normally give her space and whenever confronted go with what she is saying and tell her I lover her and my sibling loves her and all that good stuff, but this time she is saying like, pardon me for saying this, some insane asylum shit. She thinks people are after her and after me. She said ""Will(my name for all intensive purposes) we need to have a meeting, Cynthia and Bill are with me, the babies are in a hole and I need to go and take care of them. Gordon(my dad) is with me too."" She said a bunch of other thing that are of that same type and I'm having a bit of an emotional breakdown which is highly out of character for me since I'm normally a very emotionally stable person, but seeing her in this bad of psychosis and not being able to do anything about it is not only giving me flashbacks of prior times before she got on her medication, but it really pains me and makes me feel helpless to help her."
586,I'm proposing a mental health day at my job.,"So I currently work for this great regional company. They have decent pay, great management, and a nice non-toxic work environment which is just this huge blessing having come from restaurants and more recently an inpatient psych hospital. However, after being here a year, I have yet to see an outreach program. So, because I advocate so strongly, I want to make a day dedicated to:
•mental health outreach
 - therapists covered by our work insurance
 - group therapies in the area
•possible social outings/workout days to help people not feel so alone 
•anonymous surveys from employees of all levels on what might help them thrive better

I want to hear from you all. Is there anything that you might add or remove? Is it even a good idea?"
587,Dealing with a depressed spouse...help,"My husband and I have been married over 10 years. He has anxiety, bi-polar depression, and a bit of OCD. I love him and he says I am his rock. I have learned how to support him when he is depressed, what to say and what not to say. Stand there and give him hugs and tell him everything I have learned from the internet. Softly push him to talk and seek medical treatment and give encouragement after treatment.

But his last bout of depression lasted weeks and has taken its toll on me. I am tired of having to be the rock. Tired of pick up the pieces and being the strong one. I want to YELL at him to just get over it and everyone has bad days and gets overwhelmed pressure from life and work. 

I am feeling lost and resenting him for something he cannot control. What should I do?"
588,What Do You Do?,"What do you say when someone asks if your ok, but your not. You don’t know what’s wrong but you don’t feel like you used to."
589,How to stop feeling emotionally attached or guilty for inanimate objects,"Two big problems here- one is feeling guilty for inanimate objects but I’m not a hoarder and still bin them, I feel extremely guilty nevertheless. I think it may be because I don’t use something and it never got to serve its purpose or something? I don’t know but I hate that feeling, I want to stop feeling bad for literal pieces of plastic. 

The other is hoarding things with slight sentimental value. For example, stuffed animals I’ve had since I was little. I don’t want to donate them have have them thrown away by the charity shop, as silly as that sounds. Do I need stuffed animals at my age? No. But I hold an emotional attachment to them. I think it’s because my father really didn’t give two shits about me as a young child and when he paid attention to me it was negative, so the toys were comforting. I’ve got about nine or ten and can’t bring myself to donate any of them. I even feel guilt for putting them in a dark box. 

I’ve seen many articles and forum threads analysing this, but never actually offering a solution. Any guidance? I’m posting this in here because the sadness that ensued from thinking about parting with them led to subsequent mental breakdowns, which lead to me exhibiting the same symptoms of depression I did before I found an anti-depressant that seemed to work."

591,How to cope with partner’s mental illness?,"Anyone whose partner suffers from a mental illness, what are your best tips for coping yourself as well as supporting your partner at the same time?

My partner has had really rough time with his mental illnesses lately and has been suicidal. My own mental health isn’t good either and I struggling to find a balance between supporting him and also taking care of myself. I often feel hopeless and exhausted. He gets triggered easily and I tend to take his reactions personally and then get upset or angry back at him. Obviously that makes him way worse. 

Any advice welcome."

593,Whats the point in life?,"Whats the point in life if people are just going to treat you like your nothing. 2020 has been one of the worse years in my life. They say turning 13 is a big deal, and you should be happy about it. This year I have realized all the emotions turned up inside me and I can't even tell anyone I know. I realized how messed up life really is. How people are never going to respect you treat you like a actually person. That no matter what you do in this world, someone will hate you. That there will always be haters.

Idk, I just figured out how all my life I've been in pain and didn't really realize it. Just hiding it from myself and from other people. Now I'm just hiding it from the people closest to me. It's not like we were even close in the first place.

Whats the point in it all. Life is made on this structure. Go to school, get good grades, go to college, and get a job, then die at the end. And spend all your life paying off college loans. I don't get it. And in between, you have people treating you like trash the whole time. Never giving a heck about you. Your young you should be happy. You have a good life you should be happy. Is that how it should work.

I'm told everyday of how I'm lucky to have a middle class family. How many people have it worse then me. Does that mean that I'm justing imagining it all. That my feelings of pain aren't real or I'm not worthy of having pain and sadness. 

Just stop being sad they say. The magical cure for all. I wish that were true. That with one thing all the pain would be gone, and I could live my life. Sadly, it doesn't work like that, people like to believe it though. It just makes it worse. Like saying stop being stressed or there nothing to be stressed about, ever helps. Why do people even say that. Just makes me more stress.

Tell me. Is there any point to life?"

595,Obsessing Over Psychosis,"In the past I’ve obsessed over the possibility that I’m in a psychosis or that I’m getting schizophrenia but this time I can’t tell if I’m actually losing it or not. I’ve never distinctly heard a voice or seen something that wasn’t there but every time I even see something out of the corner of my eye, my mind starts telling me I’m crazy and psychotic and then I start obsessing over it and that makes everything worse. I just wanna know if I’m actually psychotic or just anxious. Ugh this cycle sucks."
596,I’m not sure anymore. TW: s*xual abuse,"I have suffered from BPD for a very long time, I was sexually abused by someone early in my childhood. Sex became meaningless but the need always emerged even when I knew I would regret it later. I have used sex as a weapon and also as leverage to keep someone in my life. The crippling fear of anyone established in my life leaving me drives me into horrible habits of sleeping with someone just as a comfort that isn’t really a comfort because I feel just as empty as I started. Recently a trusted friend and confidant sexually assaulted me when I was drunk, I had drank an entire bottle of tequila and hardly conscious due to a horrible panic attack. I have since cut contact with the individual but even leaving that friendship has left me feeling like it was my fault that I couldn’t pull myself together enough. Like maybe I shouldn’t have drank that much then I wouldn’t have lost a friend.. I don’t want anyone to feel the way I do, I don’t want anyone to feel like they have to give themselves physically for people to stay or feel compelled to. I have a very fleeting sex drive as I only really feel sexual desire when I am having a manic episode which is not good for long term relationships as I cannot keep up with the demands my exes wanted. They would guilt trip me into doing it or yell at/hit me until I submit. I can’t stare at bare ceilings for very long because it would send me into panic as I used to just stare at the ceiling and go somewhere else mentally to distract from the pain. This abuse has caused me chronic pain due to a pelvic floor disorder which further dampens my willingness to be touched at all even just hugging. I can’t help but feel like this is all my fault and that I ruin everything because of my issues. I feel like it has made me unloveable and not capable of being cared about more than just my physical form. I don’t want anyone to relate to this.. I don’t want to believe anyone else is in this pain as well because it is so lonely and so painful."
597,regression?,"Hello!! The current situation is not easy, but I just wanted to ask if anyone else feels like they’ve regressed to their childhood? 

I’m currently 17 and I keep obsessing over things that happened in my early teenage years. I cannot watch a movie unless I’ve seen it before. I only enjoy listening to music that I loved back when I was young. I can’t talk to the friends I’ve made in recent years normally anymore. I don’t understand what’s going on.

Along with that, I can’t seem to remember anything from 2017 onwards. This makes sense because I went through pretty bad trauma and emotional abuse. Instead, my mind focuses on how amazing being a child was. My childhood is more vivid to me than anything else. I find myself reminiscing these days more than anything. 

What does this all mean? I would appreciate all the help I could get. This has been taking over my mind recently."
598,Psychologist needed.,"I am going to suicide next paycheck.

I have no money until then but promise to pay you $1000 on that day. The rest goes to family.

I need someone with a good amount of experience to save my life.

I am not an easy patient. I believe this is likely a useless request.

If you do save me, I will pay whatever I can until I dont need help anymore.

I currently do sales with 1500 comission whenever I complete a task.

My identity will likely remain private to the best of my ability.

I am currently dealing with progressive psychosis and personality disorders. I have a high IQ and I believe I'm not easy to work with. Please help if you can."
599,Okay but like how do you do the confidence or the being social thing,"I've never really socialized or had friends. I was in seperate classes throughout middle/high and honestly I really cant remember a single legitamite friend. Even in elementary I got low key bullied. I hate ever having to talk to people or anything. I feel like I have to put on a face and act normal. I can't make eye contact period. I have trouble talking in general, will always be awkward, etc. 

I've just kind of lost all my own confidence. I'm unhappy with my body a lot but can't find the motivation to change it. I feel lonely but am not at all comfortable or social enough doing anything like ""oh, join a club"". My work is gig econemy stuff so apart from the people at stores knowing me being a shopper, I don't ever go out and talk. Not 21 so I can't go to bars. No social hobbies or desire to do any of them. 

So it just gets worse. I've gone on a couple dates and, in addition to not being in a good enough mental state, never feel comfortable being myself. And just being in fear they won't like me if I'm too open about myself. Because I'm just weird. I had come to accept that but I just am. High functioning autist with bad anxiety and shit social skills. I am anything but ""average"", and sure I know ""everyones different"" but seriously i can never be myself because I don't even like myself."
600,How do I deal with negative triggering thoughts? I could feel the panic attacks in my body and then try to justify it and reason it with my brain.," 

Sometimes it works and sometimes I try to replace it with some positive thoughts. It really depends on how bad is it. Well, maybe if I could hold that positive thought for few minutes then I can replace it.

Whats your experience with similar triggers and how do you overcome it?"
601,Psychotherapy vs Psychology,"So, I (22F) finally gathered the courage to ask my parents for help with my depression. Today they took me to a psychotherapist but, although it definitely helped because I was going through a crisis, I wonder if a certified psychologist would be better for me. 
Would it be possible for someone to tell me what are the differences between the two? 
Thank you!"
602,How do I deal with the fact that I don't have friends?,All my life I have had friends but due to a number of reasons I've had to either cut them out or our friendship died. I'm tired of putting myself out for people who just don't care about me. How do I manage knowing that for the first time nobody's gonna even pretend they care about me? I miss having friends even if they didn't like me or were fake.
603,Depression and anxiety,"Its been a year since I intentionally harmed myself, but last night something came over me and I did it again, I look at the scars on my legs and arms and I regret it, yet I can't stop. School has me so stressed out I don't know what to do, I dont want to be here and I cant take this bullshit anymore."
604,I feel like I am more sensitive to things because of my past trauma,"I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but because of my past trauma, I do notice I am more sensitive to the way people treat me. Like some complete stranger can call me a slur and I will have to try very hard to get over it. Also with friends I have a difficult time believing they actually like and value me the same way I do for them. The littlest things and behaviors freak me out and make me jump to conclusions to the point where I have to distract myself. I'm also sensitive to loud sounds and when I heard two people fighting I tense up and feel heavy in my chest. I get afraid of my friends just being my friends for pity or secretly hating me. I know it's crazy and hopefully not true but I get these feelings over the tiniest things."
605,Is this normal?,"Sometimes i just feel sad and just want to do nothing for the entire day but sometimes my mood instantly changes back to normal like nothing had happened. It's like im sad for a few minutes or an hour then my mood just changes in a second like im sad then ""eh. I'm fine now""."
606,I feel useless and it's affecting my everyday life,"I can't remember when this started but i'm gonna keep it simple. I've never been the most confident person I used to be really sensitive and i was more open since i was just a kid. Now that i grew up and after being shamed and suffering from people telling me a thousand times i was stupid and not trusting me with things because they thought i'd mess it up even if no one really does that anymore or not as frequently, i got used to being harsh on myself and not wanting to keep making the same mistakes or else i'd get frustrated and started acting like i didn't care about what others thought of me or if i messed things up, but truth Is that was probably my way of getting trough it, to be lazy and not want to help anyone or put much effort because it was better than working hard and failing. And that's fucked up because one of the things that i never want to be it's stupid and it became very easy for me to believe i was and i started second guessing myself even more whenever i did something simple and other people were watching. It might not happen everytime but while i'm not an emotional person anymore and can take criticism without feeling bad for myself, at times i won't be able to take it and become very stressed about the fact that'll never change and no one's gonna trust me and i'm never gonna see real improvement. It's like i just need to get better and like i don't care about making others proud but as long as they don't think i'm an idiot i conform. Don't know what else to say, i just want to have confidence but i find it stupid to work on it while being considerate of my feelings and nicer to myself and tell myself good things and affirmations because i think that's a lie and i'm already someone who doesn't put much effort into things so being nice to myself only makes me more chill about everything and i'm always like that which is why i can't commit to improving myself, i just need to know what am i supposed to do to get out of this loop, at least if i'm gonna be an idiot i want to be an unbothered one. Sorry for the way i wrote this, english isn't my first language."
607,Attachment to Places,"Does anyone here get crazy attached to a place where they've spent any amount of time in their lives and suddenly they want to spend any amount of time there they can?  For me, it's a camp I attended growing up.  Started as camper and am now staffer, also on a decision making committee for the camp and sometimes stay there on weekends over Winter.  Sometimes I feel I'm in too deep with it but at the same time it quiets and calms my soul so I figure why quit?"
608,"So if therapy is expensive and you shouldn't share too much to friends because they're not your therapists, then what can you do?","I'm not from the US and let's just assume there are no free services around.

Also there was a time that I was drawn to become friends with people who were also struggling with mental health because I thought I could relate to them. Turns out, it rarely went well. It just made me wonder if I'm a bad friend or something, or if it just wasn't possible for me to make friends with likeminded people.

I have mental struggles myself but other than the occasional post on Reddit and journaling and meditating, what else can I do? Trying to eat a healthier diet is easier for me than exercising. But right now I got so much things I need to fix at work and I just feel overwhelmed and stuck, so I am not able to maintain good habits. And I am also aware that people can do ALL these healthy habits and STILL not heal their mental issues.

There is also starting to be a point that the more I talk to people, the more it starts seeming unrewarding and draining... But I am posting this because sometimes I still try to give human communication a chance."

For years and years it went unseen or avoided. When was the last time I felt whole? So many times I was used with the feeling of guilt. This is my fault. Be better. You are statistic. Push down. Down. Down. Now you drown as you let everyone down. Encouraging words, therapy and medication and I still feel like a joke. Fighting the words of those that think I should just be ok. Life is hard. Others have it worse. Guilt. Everything is meddled as I remember I am a selfish freak. Where do I fall? Guilt for those who have to catch me. Go to sleep dream of that night over and over. My shame and guilt I feel and I wasn’t conscious."
612,Why arnt we taught how to live with ourselves?,"I don’t understand why schools don’t add mental health to the curriculum... How many suicides and school shootings does there have to be? We need to teach children how to work through their emotions from a very young age. We also need to teach children how to build their future and reach goals. 

Why don’t we teach kids how to grieve and cope with loss. People die everyday but most people don’t understand how to deal with death. I don’t understand... 

Why not add a course that teaches kids how to be good human being. Teach kids how to accept others for how they come. Teach kids how get out of bad situations and ask for help. We need to have uncomfortable conversations and eventually they won’t be uncomfortable anymore. We need to be more open as human beings. 

We need to teach kids to break societal standards. Break this taboo of that expressing your emotions makes you weak. Or that it’s a feminine thing... I just want so many things to change about our society.. and it starts with public education."

is with regards to sexual abuse (childhood- I was 10-12 the guy was 14-16) and marriage (together since age 16, married at 19. I am 37 and my husband 38) 

History is too long as it is 20 years but has been abusive at times and last year almost ended. Since that time (Oct 2019) the past year has been one of healing and growth. 

But today I am feeling a bit confused and would like help sorting my thoughts to whether or not me (age 12-16) as a child being promiscuous post sexual abuse (by my best Friends brother) and having sex with 5-10 guys (before meeting my husband at age 16) is “slutty” AND most importantly, if I cannot remember the details or names of a few people... is that not believable? Anyone have a similar experience? 
My husband is upset and said that I am a liar and a slut. 

He has said this to me in the past, along with other things (and has done some harmful things), but I guess I’m wondering if this is a red flag that things are going to get bad again. Or if I should respect his feelings? Or am I right for being hurt? Honestly feeling like I dont know what to feel."
614,is it normal that my psychiatrist diagnosed me on our first meeting?,"hello all! i met my psychiatrist for the first time a few days ago and they asked a lot of questions and i shared a lot of info, maybe enough for them to diagnosed me? and they also made me take a test where i had to rank the severity of certain thoughts, feelings, and emotions. i guess i was just shocked that i got a diagnosis and medication right away. is this common?"
615,"I feel like the state of the world &amp; it’s polarization is enabling me to push people away, specifically loved ones","Hi everyone, first time in this sub here! 

For starters i’ve really been struggling with the overall ambiance of the environment we live in. Here in the U.S. there’s lots of polarization going on. just to name a few, 

- politics 
- social issues 
- environmental dilemmas 

To get in specifics, like most - i personally have been unable to ignore the current political state of the U.S.  and i’m beginning to see it affect my personal life. More-so recently tonight, I had a pretty nasty dispute with my Aunt, whom my mom &amp; grandmother are very close with (my only family,  aside from my immediate brother &amp; sister). 

this dispute was about politics, and her views tend to tread more towards an extremist POV, particularly about people on welfare, and any gov’t assistance. This struck a chord with me for two reasons 

1. Since the pandemic i’ve been unemployed and collecting unemployment 

2. last year, for a full year i was an intern at homeless shelters and would facilitate group listening sessions with them to alleviate their stress and provide therapeutic intervention. i witnessed people who would work 40+ hours a a week, had no home, and still needed some type of gov’t assistance to put food on their table. 

So to get to the point; my aunts POV’s are very against helping the needy, or less fortunate. &amp; quite frankly the way she was talking about them was disgusting, and truly struck a chord with me to where i lashed out on her. i got really mean, and really hurtful. My mom and my grandma don’t seem to want to communicate with me now and my relationship with my aunt was pretty much Nuke’d by myself. 

I came home sobbing because along with being unemployed and struggling, now i fear my family has isolated themselves from me, or i’ve isolated myself from my family. i feel really alone, and have been through so much trauma over the past several years (my father killed himself three years ago), and i don’t know how to handle the growing mountain of stress, and nihilism.  I guess i’m just here to vent/get this sadness off my chest. i just spent the past two hours crying and i feel like my world is crumbling around me and it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to handle. 

sorry if this is so long, and if anyone reads this thank you for taking the time to listen 😔"
616,I took care of myself :),"It's 2 Am so I'm gonna make this quick post because my boyfriends asleep and I don't have good friends to tell this to, but I just took care of myself more than usual!

I don't pamper myself or anything that much, and the most I've done recently was putting conditioner the last couple of times I showered thanks to my boyfriend ( if you're reading this thank you, my hairs soft now ) and put lotion on sometimes, but today I went out and got actual products to help my skin and hair more.

I decided to use them today even though today's been pretty bad, so around 20 minutes ago I cleaned my face with nice smelling face cleaner, put actual good quality lotion on that also smelled nice, put chapstick on, and brushed my teeth which I don't do often because I usually don't care enough to. I feel pretty guilty for pampering myself because of things that happened today but otherwise, I'm really proud of myself for trying to take care of my skin and body better.  I also want to thank my boyfriend for making me feel like an actual person and helping me love myself more, without him I probably wouldn't feel like worthy of treating myself this nicely ever, so if you're reading this thank you a lot :) 

Sorry for the long post, I hope all of you are doing well and have a good night/day!"
617,I hate myself,"Hi. I already posted this to another subreddit but I feel like I need to put this here too. I’m sorry if I over share. 

Like most people, I have fears. However, my fears are a little different than being afraid of a little spider. All my life all I wanted is to make everyone else happy. I laugh. I crack jokes. But if I find out someone has an unhappy emotion because of me, it kills me. To know that they are mad at me, or sad because of me. Or maybe I shared my feelings, and now they are worried about me. Then I become a burden. 

I am a High Functioning Autistic 19 year old Male. Some things are hard. I don’t always know the best thing to say, or what to do when certain things happen. I am not very good at regulating my emotions. If something is bothering me, I cant tell anyone. They will hate me or worry about me. I know because if they feel nothing, then they don’t care about me, snd that makes me exactly what my brain has been trying to tell me all along: that i’m worthlwss. 

Everytime something hurts me, I bury it deep down so no one has to know. I let it sit. Slowly killing me all this time. I wish someone will wrap their arms around me, hug me, and tell me that i’ll be ok while I cry on their shulder. 

I really wish, in times like this, that I had a significant other. Someone to share happiness with. Someone that I can grow with. And someone who will help me through this. But I don’t. Because I have this. I don’t want top pull anyone in. Besides, I would be too much work. Too much of a burden. I can’t approach anyone because I don’t want to make it awkward if they don’t like me back, and if I ever do get someone, she would most likely leave if I tell her. Even if she stays, there would be days where I would be dead weight. I can’t put that on anyone. 

I hate myself. Even people who know I go through things never see it in action. I’ve made sure about that. It’s hard enough telling them I have Anxiey. If they read this they might wirry about me. No one did this to me. I’ve grown up surrounded with love. This is my fault. My fault for feeling this way. Feeling inadequate, out of place, worthless, awkward, cringy, and not good enough. I want this pain to stop. It hurts really so much."
618,Everything feels fake,"For a couple of years I have felt like everything is kind of fake. Especially  in the midst of a depression. I'm not sure why I deel this way. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
619,Need Help (trigger warning),"I'm really struggling.

Had a breakdown about two weeks ago due to stress from grad school/work/isolation, and started back on an SSRI.

But even though the medication seemed to help at first, I'm still having really dangerous thoughts, and feel so stressed that I'm physically nauseous. I keep also having an intrusive thought about wanting to up my dose so I can just be totally numb.

I guess I am not sure what to do because I think I am in a scary spot. Should I up my medication? Or drop out of school? Or both? Idk. Any advice would be appreciated."
620,need advice,idk if this is the right r/ if it isn't pls give me the correct one. I need to know if it's a thing for someone to say something that didn't actually happen and the only reason they said it was for  no reason but it's only later that they actually realize what they said was a lie. like at the time they thought what they were saying was actually right but later on they realize it never actually happened.
621,I need help dealing with this flip flopping of Diagnosis,"I’ve recently been  Diagnosed with cptsd by my clinical psychologist I have been seeing for a year or so which is hard to in the first place but I have also been seeing a Psychiatrist (for alittle less) that said it was bpd, I’ve talked to them both about it.
 they are in contact with eachother and I know I shouldn’t care but it’s stressing me out so much.
In the end I’m still me a label doesn’t change that but I’m so scared and I really hate this Uncertainty, I hate the labels in the first place I don’t know why it should matter but it does to me.
I just wanna know what to do and how to handle it I don’t what to deal with more shit.
 What am I doing wrong?"
622,What are these symptoms?,"Hi guys,

Over the last couple of weeks, the best way I can describe how I'm feeling is that I haven't felt like myself - and I don't know why. I don't feel excited for things I would normally be excited about, I keep getting random low moods where speaking to people becomes frustrating. For example, yesterday I saw some of my best friends that I hadn't seen in a while - and about an hour into our interaction I felt my mood dip. Almost like my battery just died. I felt so overwhelmingly sad, for what feels like no reason.

I keep getting mad at my partner for no reason, and he hasn't done anything wrong, I seem like I don't want to be somewhere when I do. I feel flat and it's scary because I don't know why this is happening.

I don't know if it helps, but I take magnesium, calcium, vit d and zinc supplements. I don't take any medication otherwise. I just want to stop feeling like this and I hope someone could shed some light on why this is happening."
623,Looking for recommendations for online chat base counseling,"hey

so without going too in depth the state of the world and personal stuff has left be struggling and i feel like trying counseling/talking to someone would be beneficial. However given that i feel much more comfortable typing then talking when it comes to opening up and the fact i dont really have alot of privacy. So i am currently looking for some kind of help 

thank you in advance"
624,Genuinely don’t care what happens in my life,"I just don’t care. I care and get hurt, and I don’t care and get hurt. I genuinely don’t care what happens anymore, for anything I do ends in pain. Who cares anyways? It’s not like anything I do is matters and no matter what I do I’m hurting. So what’s the point?? The only good part of the day is sleeping because there’s that slight hope I don’t wake up. It doesn’t matter. None if it does. Hurting and pain is all life is about."
625,i just need someone to talk to,"Throwaway for obvious reasons , im a 22 year old guy that has had close to zero human interaction the past 3 years apart from when im so drunk that i cant really remember half of the night, i was really really happy 6 years ago when i had my first gf who i really really loved who was such a nice person to everyone apart from me , she spent so much time just dismantling me as a human telling me im absolute worthless and she is just settling for me untill someone else who is better comes along , i just thought this was normal behaviour because who does not want their loved one to be the best version of themself? Then she openly cheated on me and broke up with me and started to tell all of our friends how i was such a garbage human being with no value and that she just pity dated me for 2 years and how i never pleased her and how i was such a garbage human being. I just dont know , part of me still love her and i really miss her, she made me feel safe and i just felt like i could sleep so much better with her in my arms meanwhile another part of myself is becoming more and more of an ""incel"" and i absolute hate myself for even having those disgusting thoughts and i just dont know what to do i just feel like i have lost at life this early and its over.."

627,Reliving old memory,"When I was 12/13yrs old, one morning I was getting ready for middle school, which was when I was most bullied because of my hair. I was trying to brush through my weave and blend it to my hair but it wasn’t working. I couldn’t get my hair to stay straight and flat(I have 4c hair, even with chemicals my hair was never straight enough). I put in a ponytail but my mom saw and though I look bad. Both my parent yelled at me for wasting time and for not fixing my hair when I started crying my dad stop but my mom continued yelling. I didn’t want to go to school because my mom word was worse than the bullies but I knew they were coming fuck any self love I had too. I had a panic attack reliving that hell of a morning. That morning was only 30minutes tops but I  have relived it for years. I’m turning 25 soon. I though I would be in a loving relationship by now but nope I spend my night crying over thing that happened in middle school and binge eating, which I am working on."
628,How to deal with loss,"Hey everyone, I want to keep this short because I’m in shock. My stepbrother, who was one of my closest friends throughout middle school and high school committed suicide a few hours ago at the age of 19. Despite our best efforts to help him out he passed away tonight. I was just wondering how to keep positive despite these dark times"
629,"18M, being a virgin and comparing myself to ex is eating me alive. Thinking of seeing an escort.","Hi, 18M close to 19 here, I'll start with a little bit of background. I dated this girl that i met on an erasmus for almost a year. Thing is, it was 99% a ldr, and even if I visited her, it went all terribly wrong. Won't go much into details, but she played with my feelings and lied multiple times, lost feelings for me 2 months before me going and met another person and just wanted me to visit her to see if we kissed or something.

Well, not only I'm completely broken right now, but the anxiety of not having done anything with a girl is eating me alive. It's not peer pressure, in fact most my friends are virgins. However, thinking how my ex has no trouble having guys interested on her while she was the only girl ever interested in me as far as I know makes me so insecure. Also how next year she'll move for university and probably have a lot of fun and meet people, while I stayed in home for university and pretty much made no friends on an engineering career, which gives me 0 free time completely kills me. She's enjoying life, while I'm here just broken.

The chances of me finding someone in the near future are close to zero. Not only I'm a huge introvert, but I have developed massive social anxiety, trust issues and lack of self steem. I know I have to work on those first. But, the more time goes, the more my stress over being a virgin and comparing myself to my ex increases, to the point which it makes it harder for me to focus on myself.

I'm thinking of seeing an escort. Get it over with, absolutely never go back to an escort, focus on myself, and when I think I've finally healed, give dating a chance. Thoughts?"
630,"Am I the only one who's never comforted by ""you're trying your best""?","Like I know DAMN well I'm not doing well-- Not mentally, but just in life.

So like... If this were me trying my best and this was the best I could do, that's more fucking depressing than just thinking I'm lazy or whatever"
631,Should I ask for help behind my parents back?,"Hi everyone. For 6 years now I have been trying to sit my parents down and tell them that I  have symptoms of depression and that I need some help. But they either dismiss it by telling me I dont have any problems because I'm too young, change the subject, ignore it or theyll get mad. Telling me to get over myself, snap out of it, it's my fault for being depressed because I'm on my phone too much (I keep myself to myself and prefer to talk to my friends because I dont get on that well with my family), and that if people found out i was depressed theyd think I'm weird and a freak. Then they try to get involved like telling me that putting things in the bin will increase my happiness, telling me how much worse their situations are, telling me that I was only cutting because of my period (it wasnt), and making me go out to walk around the town in the middle of an anxiety attack. When I show any signs of sadness or anxiousness they get annoyed and say they're fed up of this. 

I just really dont feel comfortable to tell my parents about my mental health anymore and they wont let me get a therapist. But I've been experiencing symptoms of depression for 6 years now so it's not going away, and i started getting symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder a year ago which has taken over my life. It's getting to the point where I cant function. Im depressed 24/7, I'm self harming all the time, I'm thinking about suicide, I cant concentrate or organise myself in school and my teachers get annoyed, I feel really anxious going in public, I have to wear a winter jacket to cover my body all day and even then I dont feel comfortable. I go to sleep and wake up with the thoughts of how horrible my body is and it consumes me. I just really need some help and I feel like I'm at breaking point. I dont know if I should just go to the doctors and let it all out even if it gets me in big trouble just so I dont snap and put my life in danger. What does anyone think is the best option?"
632,I want to damage my vocal chords on purpose but I'm not sure how far I'll push it,"No one talks about this but I figured I can't be the only one with these thoughts right. I'm ftm trans and my looks are okay-ish (I look very young, havent been on any hormones yet) but my voice instantly gives me away. As soon as I talk everyone 'Miss' and 'Ma'am's me to death and I can't take it and I don't have the balls to correct anyone. I've been doing this for years, I get excited at the prospect of a cold or just something damaging my vocal chords so I dont have to speak and give myself away. I've always had an unnaturally weak voice but goddamn I wanna take it all the way. Lowkey hoping for GERD at this point, and yes, I know that's a horrible thing to wish for. Only problem is I like singing and making jokes and talking with my friends. What the fuck do I do? I need some enablers lol, or rather I don't, but I severely want them."
633,I am worried about my twin:(,"Hi there, I am concerned for my twin. I have started noticing odd behaviors and am wondering if they are normal. We grew up in a bad home with violence and i'm worried there might be something wrong with them mentally. Here are some of her behaviors and stuff she has done that are concerning.

\-They use to be very abusive when we were younger

\-They have outburst

\-They have been caught lying and stealing

\-They tend to throw attitude

\-They like to skin rabbit skulls ( my mom had already called them off) and pop out there eyes and brains, she then saved them in a jar in the fridge for a few days.

\-They just started getting better emotionally ( I hope) and stopped self-harming.

\-They were doing bad stuff online like for example, talking to strangers, lying about being 15 and abused ( they even claimed that they had a 3 year old son that her parents sent away) using a fake email,watching bad porn, getting secret social media accounts, and watching videos about bestiality.

\-When they was confronted my our oldest sister they flipped out and tried running away jumping out of windows, saying they was gonna kill herself, and begging for her not to tell.

\-When ever we play games she makes her person get raped, abused, and kidnapped.

**This isn't all of it but just so you could get an idea:)**

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried asking her about it but she denies there might be something wrong. A few weeks ago someone trimmed our dogs whiskers, and today I noticed our cat had chopped whiskers. When I asked her about it she said the only time she ever trimmed a cats whiskers was when she was around 6 and that she was crazy back then. She said it herself she was gonna be a psychopath when she was older. I am trying to find out if it's her. No one else in my family would be able to this. My dad is very smart and loves animals, my mom also loves animals and was a vet, my sister (18) has the dog Dakota (the one who's whiskers got cut) and when she found out she freaked out and started crying, my other sister (14) is at the moment in a hospital bed (at home) because of back problems, she is a big animal lover and hates the thought of animals getting hurt. My twin when I asked her about it got defensive and started saying she would never do that, she never asked if they cat was okay like the rest of my family had. She had started saying anything could have caused it like our other cat. I know it's not possible, this was done with scissors. Our bio dad was abusive and our brother had used us sexually when we were only 5, could that be why she is acting this way. My brother is diagnosed with Bipolar and ODD (my mom has Bipolar). Could she have a mental problem? If so, what could it be? Is this behavior normal?

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried about them, I keep thinking they might be a going insane:("
634,My highs and lows cycle to frequently and I’m not sure if I’m just making stuff up.,"Since I(21 m) could remember my household was pretty shitty my dad would work and would do meth (not sure of the frequency on that) and on occasion he’d flip out for no reason.

My mom has always been the rock and she’d take care of me and my siblings.

So I started noticing around middle school (7th grade) that I’d have these really high moments where I’d feel like I could do whatever I wanted to then go into a sad slump right after just thinking about how much of a failure I am and just picture my future crumbling down.

That translated all the way until college at around 18 I went to my pediatrician and she told me I was depressed and told me to see a therapist but I didn’t listen cause depression to me seems like being gray 24/7 and like I said I have these highs and lows so I didn’t follow her advice.

At 20 I realized I was going to college for the wrong reasons since my cousins told me it was what I have to do and they signed me up for classes and I passed with ease cause their not hard but it just made me feel way more lows than highs. I’d be in a high state for a day then shut down for weeks. 

I’ve since dropped out and I am happy but i want to start working I also think I need to get this shit in check. I really love making videos and just editing stuff for my friends and family and I want to invest in a laptop while I work I’m not a big money or fame kinda guy I just want to do something that interests me. 

But like I said I experience this all the time some times multiple times a day and I want to know if I should talk to my pediatrician again. Sorry for the rant."
635,My highs and lows cycle to frequently and I’m not sure if I’m just making stuff up.,[removed]
636,I feel unwanted. Why can’t I just BE better? My best is not it...,"
Why can’t I just walk outside without worrying that everyone I see hates me for this or that reason and that they wish me harm? I don’t fit in anywhere; I’ve always been somewhat of an outsider. Do I even deserve what I am asking for? I’m worried that this will is just who I am, my role in this. Being the background character everyone hates in the play of my life."
637,TOO EMPTY AND LONELY TO CARE ANYMORE,"17f Lol I don't even know where to begin at this point, I have this huge lump in my throat right now and a tear on my eyelids not daring to drop.

I have a sexual abuse history when I was 5 and it's ruined me to this day and the best relationship ever. I guess it's my fault for not letting go of the past I guess. I have 0 friends, no one texts or calls, I get depressed 24/7 and the only thing that makes me feel better is cutting, I've been self harming since I was 15 I guess. My right arm and thighs are dang full of scars that's turned to keloids and looks like shit, ready to scare off anyone that's interested. ""No one wants a suicidal bitch""

I hate myself so much I can't even glance at my reflection, I'm ugly asf with a big forehead, I have a really short afro hair, it's raggedy cause I don't do anything about it, but sometimes I do braid it when I feel like though it's short, I don't eat a lot so I've lost a lot of weight this quarantine, I'm quite small/petite for my age. I feel like with each passing day, the lonelier I get, the harder it would be if someone **EVENTUALLY** has an interest in me. I don't care about anything anymore, my room is a mess though sometimes when I feel like it I can make it gorgeous, but at the moment I'm writing this in a pile of dump. I'm currently in my third year through the University doing Mechanical engineering (I'm not that smart but I try) I can't focus on anything, I can't do my homework, not cause I don't understand, but cause I don't feel like. I feel like what's the use of anything if I'm prolly gonn'  die anyways.

Everything lately lacks that.... thing that makes it worth doing, the only reason I get out of bed is cause the longer I stay not doing anything, the more intrusive thoughts there are, I try to keep myself busy but I can't cause I don't feel like, thus the intrusive thoughts, or other times I play Minecraft on my computer and I don't even realize how much time I've spent on it till I begin to smell myself after 12 hours, lol. Btw, THANK YOU SO MUCH @MOJANG AND NOTCH. 

It doesn't do the job but it helps sometimes.

Sometimes I'm scared to have my bath cause the moment I see my reflection I break down and curl up in the bathtub hoping to die of hypothermia while I let the cold shower do its work. 

I feel so empty and it scares me cause I hate being this way,I don't speak unless spoken to, I don't see a reason for anything anymore, nothing feels like it matters.

 I don't think I've ever been genuinely happy, thinking about it now, I feel like all the times I smiled were fake, I never wanted anyone to see I was dying inside, even as a young child. I had so many secrets a child my age should never keep. I had so many thoughts that should never have been thought off. I have never been happy, all the times I'd say ""Where was the happy girl I once was""  was just faux, I have so many memories of myself that I hate to imagine

Is there any way I can forget these things???

My name is Lisa and I don't feel like this world is meant for me, it was never fait to me in the beginning, what could ever make it change."
638,How do I be optimistic?,"I don’t know if there is a better sub to post this. Also, if anyone reads my post history, I’ve been in the US the past few years, not Canada.

There has not been a time more than now that I have felt like I am going to have an absolute mental breakdown. I am just angry. I just hate everything. I how a bunch of stupid pieces of fucking white trash are willing to put other people’s lives at risk and prolong this pandemic because of their absolute ignorance and politicizing of everything. 

IT’S OCTOBER... I let that sink in recently. This shit is still not gone. And I believe it is because of absolute pieces of shit like the president who feel so entitled to do whatever the fuck they want regardless of Dr. Anthony Fauci tells us. I had a former coworker die from this shit and even though I didn’t know him well nor was I super close with him, his family is left without a father,  husband, grandfather, and sibling. There are still similar stories to his IN OCTOBER because of this disgusting mind set that “my liberties are more important than your health, because I personally don’t think you’re going to get infected.”

Not just is there an increase in deaths, but the pandemic society has to continue along because a vast amount of people choose to make absolutely selfish decisions, at least in the U.S. I just feel like I’m going to lose my shit. I’m in my final semester in college, have no job prospects because of this, and had to pick up a minimum wage job in a supermarket where I have had the most ignorant piles of waste for customers tell me shit like “You must be so thankful to have a job.”, and have “dick-nose above the mask” wearing pieces of shit tell me their delusional conspiracy theory for why the masks are pointless and how for some reason it is a political ploy to screw over Trump. Fuck you for that you entitled braindead cunt. Fuck you. I just hate you. I just hate you so much. I don’t usually have physical tears but I’m just pouting for some reason.

Oh but I’m not done, I’m not even close to done haha. Ahahahahahahah. So, then I have my dumb bitch of an aunt, cousin, and multiple 55+ aged relatives send me political shit via text as well as post their shit on any platform they desire. Recently, my aunt sent me this video with how Trump had so many similarities with the bible. And this isn’t the first time that I received this from a relative! “Trump was like Jesus/Moses/Abraham/Joseph because he was born on a (whatever the hell it was) and that is why he is a godlike being and that he is backed by the lord himself.”

Also, to clairfy. No. I am not some ultra-liberal redditor looking for a handjob from the echo chamber. I am centre-left and just want some calmness in the political sphere. I hate it all. I hate how we still have civil unrest in our major cities, I hate how so many homeless have ruined California and the entire West Coast due to political mismanagement, I hate how so many cops have a god complex, I hate how there are extremists that react to these events and ruin the cities for everyone, I hate the nationalism here - posting a bald eagle on social media does not make you a better person. 

I hate how I can’t travel because people have been doing stupid shit that has caused travel to still not be safe, I hate how my father manipulates me emotionally by being an amazing person sometimes and then an absolute arrogant headgames prick at other times (he’s bipolar but claims his “manic depression diagnosis in the 70s was nothing of concern”, I hate how my friends and random ppl still see me as the “haha fat friend” even though I dropped 40 lbs since June and went from a BMI of 29 to 24. I hate how the political subreddits are just “Trump bad” circlejerks without real discourse and pragmaticism with the fact that this election is still up for grabs - this should have been learned back in 2016.

I hate how my ex (who is actually really nice person) just associates with white trash and how she always tell me about how her bestfriend went to jail again or her mom goes to the casino all the time or the fact that her hillbilly brother knocked up a girl he wasn’t committed to at a fairly young age and now won’t be a father figure in his daughter’s life. I hate deadbeat dads, I wish the absolute worst upon deadbeat dads. Yes, my dad has mentally fucked me up at times (hid my aspergers diagnosis from me until I found out on my own) but at least he was there for me unlike some piece of shit that created a life to fuck up so he can get an orgasm. Back to the ex, she was a good person, but with the pandemic and us having to be long distance mixed with the white trash universe she had (think Shameless), I had to break up with her.

I had been pondering the thought of breaking up with her for a while prior to the actual Skype call where I did it. I felt like an absolute piece of shit. Everyone’s relationships should be ended in person. I only did it on Skype because it felt more personable than text or call. But it doesn’t matter, I fucked her up, because she thought I was the one she was going to marry. I visited her dad who was dying of cancer on a 2 hour flight away so I can comfort her (she was up there 4 days before I got up there). It was me going over there to visit that made her think I was the one. Fuck. The only reason I never thought about “playing house” shit like marriage or kids is because 1. I’m scared. I am only 22 yet I still feel like I’m in my youth. I’m just not ready to throw that away yet. 2. I hate young kids and the whole baby culture. I don’t mind having an older kid, but that would involve adoption and eh, idk, there’s so many ramifications. 3. Money. I would rather achieve financial independence prior to having a living being. I have learned a lot about financial literacy over the last 5 years and I now try to save and invest as much as possible to achieve a healthy retirement and eventually wealthy lifestyle. Notice how most young parents are poor as shit, because they don’t think. They think they’re so grown up and that they’re ready, like it’s a fucking fantasy.

I hate how my parents curse all the time in the house yet if I curse in front of my mother while my dad is around, my dad lectures me on cursing in front of my mother. Because she’s a woman?! This isn’t the 50s dad. I also have a younger brother and he hates me and I cannot necessarily blame him. Yes, I think his morals are a little fucked and that he is incredibly rude at times, but I haven’t always been supportive older brother of his endeavours nor have I been the brother that should have had his back. I was a deadbeat older brother who only made his situations worse because I somehow thought I was making them better.

You know. One of my favorite shows is Bojack Horseman. That show helped me understand my own mental health better. Before any one makes a comment about how it’s stupid when people try be like... Rick Sanchez, The Joker, Walter White etc. because they’re missing the point, I am not one of these people. However, most people that have seen the show have compared me to the main character, Bojack. He is a miserable piece of shit with mental health issues who ends up hurting others because he had such a messed up upbringing. The source of his misery comes from him. He has been given the opportunities to better himself and misses everytime he gets close - I don’t want to be like that. I really don’t.

I went to this school for one year before transferring to another state. I made three close friends there. My depression took a toll on me and had some existential crises and ended up drinking myself out of my mind. These three close friends were nice but all nerdy and I slowly ended up making them all resent me in a unique way. The first one to drop me was because I ended up becoming an absolute asshole to them. I’ve tried what I could over the years to get us on talking terms, they haven’t felt comfortable with that and I can’t blame them. The second one I sent an unsolicited snap of myself cutting (my arms) to them and that really bothered them. I ran into them a half year later where they voiced their disappointment with this and we ended up transitioning into a pleasant conversation where I kind of explained that I was in a bad place and should have NEVER done that. It went well, but then I got ghosted. I wrote a diplomatic sendoff text after a few ghostings from him but never got anything back. The third one and I sorta talk but it’s been on and off and I know they’ve thought I’m an absolute garbage person over these last 4 years. I burned a bridge with that place all because I am a dumbass.

Other things that piss me off and have attributed to me having an absolute breakdown:

-My first consentual sexual experience was with someone who had just been banging everyone.

-I’m bisexual and I hate saying this even though I’m open because a lot of straight people start treating me like I’m gay while a lot of gay people make me feel illegitimate about my sexuality.

-Even though my dad always said he would never be bothered with a gay son and told me he supported me when I came out as bi, he still says shit about how it’s gross one when a guy puts his genitals in another guy’s ass and how the balls smack against his rear. He then drops the narrative and talks with me like women are the only people in my dating pool.

-Kinda cliche, but I really hate Tik Tok just because it’s so prevalent today and has so much shit that comes with it.

-My aunt who always takes candid photos of us at family events where I look like absolute shit and posts them social media. Also, stop having your iPhone be your 8 year-old son’s virtual babysitter. He’s discovered some pretty fucked up shit and lacks any discipline or manners.

-I hate entitled parents/dog owners that think that their kid/dog can do no wrong.

-The fact that I’ve been so insufferable at times and that there are still people who talk to me but secretly resent me for this.

-The fact that I’ve been told “I have a good heart” or that I’m an “old soul”. My “good heart” is the reason I’ve gotten so fucked over in the past and it’s not good. My “old soul” is not “old”. I hate most older people because of their stubborness and bitter attitudes toward anything my generation does. Fuck you. You all were rebels decades ago.


-My beard grows so fast so I have to clean shave almost everyday, and no, I’ve grown it out in the past. It looks like shit. People have told me some very hurtful yet truthful things about it when I’ve had it. I just always seem to look gross even though I shower twice a day and wear pretty clothes these days. I just wanna look cute, ya know? But I never do. But I’m not phishing for compliments on my looks. I hate pandering pieces of shit. I accept that I just can’t look cute and hate it. Also, the “fat friend” thing again even though I have a normal bmi these days. Some people just can’t shake the image. Including me.

-The expression “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.” I’ve gotten jumped/harrassed by sketchy people on the street because that saying made me think nothing was going to happen to me if I kept walking on the same side of the sidewalk as they were even though they looked scary as shit. And I always keep to myself. I never open my mouth unless it’s to eat or say annoying shit to my friends. Fuck that expression by the way. Fuck whoever made that expression.

-Getting treated like a number by every college/university to which I have been.

-Aggressive Homeless People

-The ex-friend who divided my close friendgroup and caused many social hangouts to be separate or a “him or me” scenario. Toxic shithead. The conflict stemmed from a genuine misunderstanding but I believed they had pent up hatred for me prior. I just didn’t have a clue.



I don’t know how much more I can write. I want to pass out back can’t fall asleep. I have a feeling I could eventually be successful, but I still won’t be genuinely satisfied unless I’m travelling all the time. For some reason, travel has always been something. But fuck that. Can’t do it safely for a while and it’s not like it’s a free acrivity you can do year-round anyway. 

Also, regrding my post’s title, I really hate the wholistic stuff. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for here but it will be nice to hear from you all. I’m sorry if this post really demonstrates that I’m a miserable piece of shit. If you come to that conclusion, you’re probably justified in thinking that. Thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings. I think the only reason I’ve calmed down at all towards the end of writing this is due to exhaustion. Have a great rest of your day/night."
639,Why do I keep randomly thinking of horrific scenarios?,"I could be enjoying my day or trying to sleep and just these random horrible violent thoughts come in my head. (I gotta warn you they might be a bit too much.) For example Like right now, my brain goes “what if someone just breaks in?” and I imagine myself being forced on the ground while someone goes “wow what a beautiful daughter” (she’s 5 yrs old and the most amazing smart little girl I’ve known) and starts stroking her hair and goes on and rapes her in front of me. I see and hear her painful cries and the look she has while she looks at me in horror in my head. I see her running away from them in fear only for them to catch up. I  hear the cracks of her neck as they kill her.  Or walking in and seeing my beloved mother who’s been through sooo much in life stabbed to death.  I can’t control these thoughts. I won’t be thinking of anything to trigger them. Sometimes I get to the point where I start to cry as if that scenario already happened. I’ve never been through anything that could trigger such thoughts either. Why won’t it stop?"
640,Anxious attachment issues help please.,"I've had a few issues growing up and I have issues with being attached to people. 

I can be clingy due to me being anxious they will leave or replace me. I tell myself that isn't true of course. 

I know that my anxiety and clingyness, i am not extremely clingy i just talk a lot if j am honest, will drive people away and I want to learn to deal with it so I dont continue to lose people that I cause to become tired of me.

I currently have two friends that I got after moving and I feel like I am bothering them by talking so much. I dont talk all day, but I talk everyday. I know I shouldn't but I worry so much about being replaced or abandoned that I feel like I have to talk to them causing the issue of the clingyness. 

I really want to learn how to manage this. I am very self aware, but its really hard to do it by myself. I just want to hear other people's opinion. 

I'm on mobile sorry if the post is fucked up. If you have any questions just ask and I'll try my best to answer them."
641,How to cope with intrusive thoughts?,"I've always had intrusive thoughts but recently they have been really awful, to the point I have been smacking my head with my hands and digging my nails in. I am waiting on a drs appointment but the wait time for mental health assessments are so long, I can't keep on like this. Any advice would be appreciated."
642,How do I stop worrying over everything going wrong?,"I am a 28F and I am tired of feeling worried all the time. I can't remember a day when I woke up without extremely anxious over something. And I always have random peaks of palpitations and anxiety through out the day.

It has made it hard to live and do anything productive. And pretty much never has something I've been worried about actually happened. But I still worry and fear every second over one thing or the other.

As an example my masters thesis dipped a little midway. So I spent every day worrying I was going to fail my thesis and won't get my degree and everything else I had planned ahead of it would fail as well. My thesis went fine but because I wasted so much time worrying I couldn't publish anything out of it in time and am now trying to publish it almost six months after graduation.

How do I stop over worrying?"
643,Losing memory and can't remember events especially the one that caused pain,"There was a time when I used to remember each and every specific details of the events in my life but from past few months I am not able to recall the people or their names. 

2019 been a very traumatic year for me and it left some scars on my emotional state. My husband was verbally abusive and have insulted me many times in front of his family and friends. I have felt severely sick and then he gradually changed from past few months. I had very low self-esteem now and I just agree to everything he says I have stopped keeping my opinion. My mom dad loves me but my mom has toxic view on everything so I can't clearly open my heart to her. My mother in law pull me down from time and again with her sarcastic comment. I am a data scientist but sometimes overworking keeps my mind at peace. But now I am not able to concentrate on my work and feel like my life is setup as a puppet show. 

I think my husband had a traumatized childhood so that anger now come down to me but I think I am losing my self and won't recognise myself anymore."
644,Confusing mental problem,"Hey guys i just woke up with the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced and Im shaking a lot. This all started when i was little and i use to get this feeling at random times and didnt know what was happening but it’s a random feeling that is in my gut and mind and my only way of getting rid if It is wait for it go to away. The feeling comes in a lot of different ways but right now it feels like I have something to tell someone, and I can either tell one person or infinite people. I Dont know it’s hard to explain but it also feels like eyes are looking down on me waiting for me to tell either that one person or infinite people and my mind can’t wrap around the idea of it. Another way it shows is if i think of something that should be normal size in a hand sized form, my brain will go into this sort of panic. Please help me understand and cope."
645,"survivor here (surviving at least), i just found out my mom is cheating on my neglectful dad - someone please help","no one prepares you for the situations that make a movie entertaining: villains, sex, cheating. it’s just like depression, imo. bc my main problem is that i’m not feeling one thing. i’m just overwhelmed. idk how i feel. i just keep crying and crying, then getting tired to get some rest, back to crying.

please, anyone who knows anything about this or a psychologist who can offer opinion, send help.

ps. as for my mental health, so far i’m okay, all things considered. i’m not thinking of suicide. i’m just really fucking confused."
646,Advice for coping with flashbacks and day dreams of the trauma coming back into your life somehow? (Without therapy I'm broke),"I had a very emotionally abusive boyfriend just over a year ago and today (like many other days) I've woken up with flashbacks of things that went on between us and then daydreams of me seeing him again and what would happen. A lot of this is linked to paranoia because he's friends with one of my boyfriends mates and also lives in the same area as my current boyfriend. I don't want him to ever find out that I have a new boyfriend seeing as he's tapped in the head nor do I want to ever have to face him again after what he put me through. 

If anyone has any advice I'd be really grateful, if you just want to say some nice words I'd really appreciate that too! Hope everyone has a blessed day."
647,I’m not sure I can do this anymore,"Things in my life have been relatively ok recently but this week, I feel like my Venlafaxine has stopped working. I’ve been really tired, getting these weird mini head-rushes and brain zaps. My mood has been really low as if I’m not on any meds at all.

My husband and 2 kids have been quite hard to deal with because of all this. My husband just doesn’t have any empathy with what I’m going through. I will tell him that I just need a bit of space to read or just lie down in a dark room but he sighs and tuts and rolls his eyes. He’s said in the past that he feels like he’s taking care of someone who is disabled which I don’t agree with. I’ve been a stay at home mum for the past 4 years to our sons and I’ve survived this far, so I can’t be doing that bad of a job.

It’s more the physical side of how my meds make me feel that is challenging and I just need a bit of time out sometimes, especially when our 4 y/o is climbing on the table with his little brother and I’m sick of shouting both of their names. I can’t deal with how my husband speaks to me and treats me. He smacks our son and bellows at the top of his lungs at him and doesn’t understand that he’s making those behaviours look like they’re ok to do. 

He’s working from home doing a job he loves and is left alone all day during the week. But he just comes back with “look, we’re all tired. You chose to stay at home with them. They’re your job after all.” He will do a chore just to get back at me, it’s never to help, it’s to highlight that I haven’t done it because I’m really not in the headspace to have loaded the dishwasher that one time.
I’m sorry for the ramble, my head is a bit muddled at the moment but I would appreciate any advice. :)"
648,My Grandparents are suicidal (60f)(59m),"My grandparents, who are basically mine(24m) and my brother's(18m) parents are both contemplating ending their lives. After having lost their middle daughter in the middle of the night after Thanksgiving, to their eldest daughter(my brothers and I mother) murdered and their youngest son arrested for being caught talking to a minor. It's began to put a toll on them. I'm currently 2 time zones away from them going to school, I'm not exposed to it constantly like my little brother is as he reports this to me. Yesterday he had to prevent my grandmother from getting to the knives. Then this morning my grandfather told him that they put everything in his name and my cousins name. Saying that they'll do it together. It may happen tomorrow or never. My little brother is stressed and I don't know what to do. I'm not financially able to fly home, so im trying to think of what I can do to help every party involved. Ive told him to seek therapy.

Additional info: my grandmother is an alcoholic and justifies her need for a drink and a smoke due to events that have transpired. They are both hardcore Christians or alleged so this is difficult for me to understand knowing them from this angle. 

Any tips or resources that I could use would be of great help. Thank you"
649,How to stop crying all the time,"I cry every day countless times. It’s getting really frustrating.

How to stop crying"
650,How to confront mom about invading my privacy?,"Last year during my first year of college, I started keeping a diary of sorts to help me reflect. I was going through a very dark time in my life where I had problems with drinking and drugs following a breakup. My father is very religious and my mother has a track record of being nosy, so the writing did me much good. When I came home from winter break I continued to write alone in my room although at this time I was doing better. One time my mom saw me and started prying to figure out what I was writing. I told her that I had kept a journal during college, of course she asked me what was in it but I told her I wanted to keep it private. I got kind of scared she’d go looking for it so I put it in a very obscure hiding spot just to be safe.
Fast forward to now, my phone is broken and my mom let me borrow her old one. I was looking through her camera roll of all her old pictures of me when I stumbled upon at least 50+ pictures she had taken of my diary. After tracing back the dates of the pictures I found that the first ones were taken a day after she had learned about my diary. This was the same day I had spent the night at my friends house and she had found, read, and photographed many of my very personal things. Even worse there were even more days where I had gone somewhere and she’d take the opportunity to take more pictures.
I obviously want to confront her about this but I know she will flip it into it being my fault that I was doing drugs and drinking. I feel embarrassed, mortified, and sick. I’m in physical pain that I literally cannot confide in my own mother without her betraying my trust. I was really trying to fix our bond and she not only read, but took pictures of my personal things to look back on for months and months. How do I go about approaching this or do I just hold it in?"
651,I can't talk to anyone for fear I'll convincing them to believe my concerns,I feel like my fears are reasonable and realistic and if I tell someone I could end up making the person I confide in scared too. I don't want to make someone worry about something they weren't even thinking about until I told them.
652,I cut myself for the first time in years,Today I was just doing the usual when I and my friend started having a deep convoy about life.Later I was still thinking about it so I decided to sit in my room and listen to music but then I just got really sad and then felt an urgent urge to cut myself..so I did.
653,Deep feeling of sadness/doom in my chest. What could it be?,Sometimes I'll just be sitting around and I just feel like a deep sinking feeling in my chest. I literally don't know how to describe it but it's like a feeling of doom. It lasts maybe like 30 seconds to a minute or two. Then I feel okay again. I feel like something triggers it but I'm not sure. Usually in that moment I can only focus on that and my surroundings just fade away. It kind of makes me feel terrified and very panicky. After that feeling I need a moment to collect myself. This doesn't happen all that often but it does sometimes and I'm not sure what it is. If someone could help me out I would be very thankful.
654,What am i?,"First of all i want to inform you peeps that im not finding my condition debilitating or annoying and i am quite happy with my life so far, i am just curious about it as no specialist or doctor managed to define it lmao. 

I am 24 years old, male, in a relationship and have no troubles with socialising with others etc. I am telling this because i was oficially diagnosed with autism before i started elementary school. 

I have never lost my primitive reflexes like rooting or suckling etc. 

I “obsessively” love to sniff my pillow, like literally i can sniff it all day if it has my odor and i get lost in time if i seriously do not try to stop myself. But this not happens if pillow cover has not my odor yet.

I touch a specific type of paper all the time even when going to sleep

Also i compulsively smell people’s hair if i consciously not stop myself


So as you see i am a solid weirdo but after some mocking in middle school and years of self training i managed to learm to hide them quite well in public, so far so that no one can know them unless i want it.

At first they thought i am autistic however as i grow and started school apart from kids mocking me, i was quite a normal boy. So case closed and lucky for me my parents sent me to a public school first before sending me to a special ed as my doctor back then advised. 

In middle school and puberty, kids are quite cruel creatures as many of you may experienced. So my condition once again led me started to visit doctors. Final conclusion of them was that i had OCD.

But to be honest i have no rituals, my behaviour is quite random and i do it instinctively. The only thing i can corelate to ocd is that i am absessed with my territory so to speak. I throw tantrums when peeps touch my “beloved” objects without my explicit permission. But as i said and my current doctor agreed, this is not very much like ocd either. 

Anyways i am just asking this out of curiosity, after finding out that paxera quite supress my instinctive behaviour and concerta helping me to focus on work and not sniffin pillows me and my doctor just gave up to try to name it. My gf also fully know my “condition” and she even finds them super cute even though i sometimes get a bit emberassed lmao. As i said, i am just curious for the name of this."
655,I think I (19F) might have ADHD. My doctor won't listen.,"For reference, I have moderate anxiety and severe major depressive disorder. My doctor, when I brought up my symptoms, said that since some of them were also symptoms of either my depression or anxiety, he thinks it's just me over-analyzing them basically. 
My best friend (19F) has ADHD and she asked about it because she thought I had it based on the symptoms she had observed. We discussed it and she said she was confident that I had it and that even though there is some overlap with my other mental illness, there are enough standalone symptoms to make it seem obvious to her. 
The symptoms I have that don't overlap are long periods of hyperfocusing on something to the point of not eating or sleeping, not being able to focus on anything for similarly long periods, feeling a sense of urgency - basically like everything around me is moving way too slow and I need it to be faster, and a few others but those are the most prominent ones.
Am I overanalyzing? Or should I try to push the issue or maybe even get a new doctor?"
656,Going through breakup Anxiety and Panic Disorder,"I’ve suffered with panic attacks and anxiety for years. My last big stint was almost three years ago where I struggled daily. Through mindfulness, meds, exercise and the occasional benzo I made it through and have felt pretty stabilized the last few years. Only would take the benzos 1-2x a month or PRN. I’m prescribed .5mg of Clonazepam but I cut them in half and only take the .25mg while struggling.
Anyways, I’m going through a brutal breakup right now and am constantly in a state of anxiety, panic and obsessive thoughts. I restarted my Wellbutrin and seeing my therapist over a week ago and I know in a few more weeks it will begin to help, but last week I took a benzo 5 days in a row. It’s only ever the .25mg but I get freaked out by the potential effects of long term use. I know this is mainly my anxiety talking but I am just looking for some advice on how often I could take it, with an end goal in mind, without it being problematic. I feel so far away from my center right now and am really struggling to stay in the moment. I’ve had no appetite, can’t sleep, and have been in a constant state of significant anxiety and panic. I’ve lost a bunch of weight and having a real tough time taking care of myself."
657,I'm stupid.,"My mom called me stupid, she just came back today after being away with my dad for a few days. I apparently didn't water her plants correctly, so she was upset the moment she walked through our front door.

I was looking forward to seeing her today but not anymore.

I'm stupid, I can't even do one thing right even though I tried so hard to keep the house in a good condition while they were away and while my brothers didn't do much.

Why do I bother?

I'm so stupid aha. 

It hurts.

I hate myself.

I hate myself. 

Why did I bother trying so hard?

I really hate myself. 

I wish I could disappear."
658,My life....,"I’m a 21 M. I’ve been out of high school for four years and I’ve realized I’ve done nothing but mediocrity with my life. At most I’ve even stepped back. I grew up a chubby kid who was picked on for being weird, annoying, and fat until I was a junior in high school. By that time I morphed into a big, strong, prototypical jock. I created a whole new person who I wasn’t around that, I acted as certain way for people to like me, but I finally had a little bit of self confidence and self esteem. I ended up partying almost every weekend, get around the county and thinking that I was hot shit. I had an almost god complex. I hooked up with chicks I always thought we’re way out of my league, I had a load of friends and I finally felt like the popular kid. Whether it was in my head or not. I turned into somebody I never was, it made me finally feel like something. Yet, the whole time I went through all this I realized that some parts of the old me never left. I was anxious 24/7, even though I had a little bit of self esteem it was still barley there, I always put people on pedestals above me. Then the end of my senior year comes around, I end up committing to a D2 school to play football. I go up to summer after I graduate and stay on campus and work out, and get prepared for the season. This is when all my demons and the old me came back out of the closet. I wasn’t the same kid from back home, no one knew me. Some guys would say ignorant shit to me, try to fuck with me being one of the only white kids on the team, and then it came to a breaking point like it always has in my life. I’m a over thinker, I stew and stew on things until I explode, I ended up getting in a fight a week before my first spring game. Yeah nobody “picked” on me or said shit afterwards. But I still felt like that fat little sixth grader who girls would come up to and call fat. I felt like the little boy who would get made fun. I lost every ounce of self confidence, self esteem and will there. To be fair it probably was gone way before this but I just finally realized it then. Either way two weeks later after our spring game I had to talk to my coach about howd I be paying for school. I was put on a half scholarship my freshman year but was promised a full scholarship sophomore year.  My family and I could barley afford my freshman year. My parents didn’t know this but I found out through old texts that my grandparents who are retired and live in a section 8 shitty part of my area would use a substantial amount of there life savings to pay for school to help my parents and I. I knew this weeks before I went into that office to talk about how I would be paying and it drained me, my parents working 120 hour weeks slaving away and my grandparents giving up a part of their life for me. I couldn’t get my mind of if Of it. I went in there to my coach and explained everything and he broke the news to me that there wasn’t any way I would be able to get a full scholarship the next season. Due partly to the influx of kids they brought in this season and all this other shit. It broke me right there on the spot, I looked him in his eyes and said well I’m going to have to leave then. He brought up a million reasons why I shouldn’t, even called me a quitter and that I would regret it if I left. I told him I’d have to make a call and get back to him. I went back to my dorm and called my dad, I broke down crying for about an hour. He understood and agreed that I’d have to come home. I went back to my coach and told him, and his last words to me were “ well what are you going to do once you go back” and I told him work like what the fuck else am I going to do? I ended up loading all my shit into my 95 Ram 1500 and driving six hours home all by myself. I cried for about the first hour as I realized my life long dream had just ended. In the other hand I was happy to be home, happy to be back to my safe spot in my room all by myself. I ended up coming home and enrolling in the local community college. I was so afraid and worried about what other people would say or think of me I didn’t tell some of my family or my best friends that I was home for close to two months. I hated showing my face anywhere because I felt like a failure. I finished my semester at the local community college and felt like a even bigger failure. I told my self that I actually needed to do something besides wake up everyday at 11am and go to class. So I ended up getting a job at a local construction company as a welders helper. I stopped going to school and put in 80 hour weeks. I remember thinking to myself there is no fucking way I can do this until I’m 70. But Atleast now I felt like had something to be proud of even it was stupid. Six months in I got hired at another company as a welder making close to $40/hr at 18. This was a blessing and a curse. I immediately thought I was better then everyone else around me because of the money I make. I started drinking and taking drugs very heavily, I’ve had al it of embarrassing nights, and I have done a lot of things that haunt me. Nothing insane, but drunk driving, fighting, and making a jackass out of myself. I know the reason when I started going back out all this happened. I was anxious 24/7 about what others thought, I always thought people were talking about me or wanted a piece. So I resorted to getting almost black out drunk everytime I went out. I haven’t had a girlfriend in over 4 years. I have no self confidence anymore so when it comes to talking to females and making moves it’s one of the most anxious things I’ve done. I’ve gained weight, I’ve had a bunch of shit happen to me over the past four years that I hate. All I do is work, I mean that In all seriousness I’m 21 and I work close to 60 hours every week. I do that so I don’t have to be bored, so I don’t have to be by myself fighting my own demons in my head. But now I’ve came to realize that I’m going to fight each one of my demons, I’m going to crush their souls and get mine back. I’m tired of feeling the way I do, and it all comes back on me. It doesn’t come back down to everything else that has happened to me. I don’t know why I sat here for a hour and wrote this but I just had to. Sometimes when you look in the mirror and you see that piece of shit you really are that piece of shit. When I look in the mirror I see that fat little innocent scared boy. That time is no more"

My Grandmother just had 2 strokes in four days. I'm looking for an infographic or short bits of info/visual popcorn showing the benefits that playing video games can help people with neurological conditions recover. I'm reaching out here because I find great design to be an incredibly effective tool at helping people to connect and fundamentally, profoundly understand the information presented. As fellow Nintendo users and lovers, I thought the community here may have had similar experiences and found great resources.

I'm looking for an infographic explaining the correlation between use of video games and recovery from stroke. Or maybe an easy to understand chart showing how much faster people who play video games get closer to a place of ""normality"". I know that nothing may ever be the same after, but at least we can aim for more self-sufficiency, confidence, etc. Since I believe a positive mood and outlook is both crucial and desirable to health and recovery, if data includes things about happiness factor (since she's understandably depressed) that would be great.

**Why I Want To Give Her A Nintendo Switch**

No one can give another person happiness, but we sure can bring each other a TON of joy! Joy is the universal cure for suffering. While my Grandma's physical recover is crucial, much of this goal behind this gift is to alleviate those feelings of malaise, isolation, and boredom. These are hard feelings, and really, they only slow down recovery. Nintendo has so many games that are not competitive, but they are about enjoyment. Since Grandma is recovering, I want her to have access to easy games that are encouraging, fun, rewarding, and bring joy.

**Challenges**

My Grandmother is 70 years old. Though she loves being nosy on Facebook, the rest of my family that lives close to her isn't score -1000 when it comes to tech saviness, and doesn't really look into the cutting edge of research or alternative things. When they talk about this recovery, they acknowledge her depression surrounding this, but all intentions are focused on the physical, and none of the emotional needs. In case anyone mentions this - I'm not going to give anyone a talk about what they need to be doing differently right now. I'm buying the switch, I just want them to understand why and I hope they can encourage her to use it. But I am not going to force it on them. They are all overwhelmed and it's a very sensitive time. I love my family but I know their limitations, and this is not the time to boss them around from 3,000 miles away.

So, they're not tech savvy. They don't even have wifi, and her computer might still run Windows XP - but she really loves Facebook so she's not totally inept tech-wise. When I tried to explain to some of them why I wanted to get her a switch, they were like, ""well she's about to go into rehab, might have to do 6 months or longer, then maybe we can think about video games."" Tried to explain it differently, didn't really get through to them.

I tried looking for any succinct, fact-full articles, infographics, anything to show the benefit of video games for stroke victims. Does anyone have any good resources? They aren't big into reading, so graphics are definitely the best.

**My Research, Or, Why Switch Is One of The Best Tools For Helping Someone Recover From A Stroke**

I. *My Mindset*

This is the second loved one of mine that has had brain surgery this year. In February, my friend Elena started complaining about double vision and went to the emergency room, where they discovered she had an aneurysm and a mass. They needed to perform emergency surgery right away. Though Elena is no grandmother, she's also no gamer. She's 28-years-old, however, so may be more open than my Grandmother would be at trying it, but let's not cut Grandma short.

Going back to my thought process, initially this solution came to me from thinking about what types of issues I know stroke patients have to deal with. Issues with dexterity, movement, fine motor skills. I have read that the brain learns motor skills through repetition. I play video games, so I know hand eye coordination is such a big part of it, as is repetition and fine motor skills, so my initial thought process lead me to dive deeper.

I wasn't sure if Elena would totally shut down video games, and I wanted to surprise her with the Switch if I decided to get it, so after her surgery I started challenging her to play pool through Gamepigeon, that imessage gaming app that comes with iOs. She got into those pool games, so the deal was sealed, and I ran to Target and to the hospital. I got it for her to help battle depression, to give her something to help her with feelings of accomplishment, and importantly, also to help her fine motor skills recover quickly.

Unfortunately, she could not play it at first, but she was able to use it to stream Hulu and youtube! So it still helped. As she recovered, she vested more and more into it, and she has told me it has helped her tremendously with things from, just having something to do (let's not forget, we're also living during covid right now), and getting her coordination. She's recovering more quickly than her physical therapist expected, and they think it's because of the Switch.

My Grandmother, however much she loves reaching out to loved ones on Facebook, she has an android so we can't play games on it. I also don't have Facebook and do not want it at all.

*II. I Hear Good Things*

I remembered hearing anecdotal reports over the years about video games used to treat certain conditions. Elena also has a friend that works at a UCSF, which is a leading brain surgery center, after I got the Nintendo Switch he reinforced that it was a good idea based on what he has seen and heard. Now from experience, I know that the switch has helped my friend avoid what would have been deeper depression because we talk a lot.

*III. Google, (v.)*

I have read long, thick articles about why video games may help stroke victims recover. The internet has been so helpful. But, these articles aren't very accessible, and my family is stressed. I hope to find something easy that they can digest quickly.

**TLDR**; Looking for a infographic to show family why videogames are helpful for stroke victims to hopefully get them excited about its potential to help my grandmothers recovery and encourage her to use it."
660,i'm sick and tired of always comparing myself to other and i don't know how to stop,"i was a bit of a troublesome child so in hopes of calming me down, my family spent my childhood comparing me to my little cousin (who is 2 years younger than me), telling me how patient and good she is, how many amazing things she does, how likeable she is, and now i'm 17 and can't stop comparing myself to others.

it's so ridiculous because i will do it for anything. i feel like others are doing better things, are being more successful, and i can't let myself rest with these thoughts. it's a horrible, horrible thing : nothing is ever enough for me, i can do better because look, the other ones are probably doing better things. it fills me with anxiety, it makes me feel like i won't ever do anything great and even if i tell myself a thousand times a second that everyone has their own pace in life, i feel like i will never be as good as other people.

is there any way to fix this?... i just want to feel content with myself..."
661,I asked for help this summer and now it’s only a matter of weeks before I get a follow up.,"I’ve been depressed since march and pretty anxious too since even before.
I just started university this fall and I can tell anxiety has been impacting my performance in exams. This week was really hard. 
So I called back the social worker who is on my case yesterday and he called me back during the day to talk about how I was doing. In the end he told me he would prioritize my case so that in maybe 4 weeks I could have a follow up with a professional. 
I was happy and relieved to think maybe I’ll be able to save my semester but I don’t want to count on that too much either.
The only problem is that I feel bad because I keep feeling like I’m inventing my problems and exaggerating how I feel for attention. I feel like I could shut up and wait and maybe I’m using resources people need more than me.
But I guess that’s imposter syndrome or something and it will pass. I try to be a little more selfish and just be happy I’m about to receive help."
662,I have no excuse,"TW for quick mentions of SH, S*uicide, EDs, R*pe and A*use, none of those is the focus of the post. 

My friends always tell me I can vent to them if I want to... And while in theory I know that's true, I never know what to say to them. 

My closest friends at the moment both come from abusive households, both have struggled with EDs and sexual assault, both diagnosed with depression, both suicidal, and both diagnosed with various other mental illnesses I won't get into. One of them also has physical illnesses to boot.

Me? 

My family loves me, we argue but generally they're supportive. We aren't high income, but we've never been down to poverty. I've never so much as had a shitty ex. I don't have any mental illnesses (and yes, I know mental illness CAN be genetic and doesn't always come from bad circumstance, but I don't have anything genetic either), and nothing physical that's in any way debilitating. 

I have literally NO excuse to feel as shitty as I do. I hate myself, I do everything wrong, I'm lazy and unmotivated, I'm rude and don't grasp social cues, I'm egocentrical as hell, I'm overbearing and condescending... And I constantly, always, unless something really good is going on, feel shitty. 

How am I supposed to walk up to my friends who've been through so much and still struggle with so much every day and say ""today I woke up kinda sad and then my mom told me I was lazy :'("" and expect them to take me seriously?!

I know it's dumb to compare struggles, but I have N O struggles. 

The objectively worse thing that's ever happened is me and my fiance had two separate friend groups that broke apart in a massive drama-- my fiance got painful ""last convos"" and half hearted shitty apologies and that's terrible... And I got nothing. They just cold-turkeyed me like I never existed.

Which, first of all, again, someone close to me got much worse of that situation

And second of all who can fucking blame them? When literally nothing interesting happened to you and you're a boring buzzkill of a person why should people remember you? 

And even now I'm sitting here whining when there's nothing to whine about. 

Boohoo I'm so privileged no one wants to listen to me being sad :((((((((

God I'm a piece of shit."
663,I don’t really want to be here,"I am not looking for pity. I just need to rant. 

My mental health has been ...questionable?... since I was 11. My mum took me to my doctor as I had bad anxiety (mainly around throwing up as I have bad emetophobia) and some pretty severe physical symptoms tied to it, she only took me because she was sick of me ""ruining"" everything bc I was always anxious :(

I was referred and diagnosed with g.a.d. and did a 12-week programme with CAHMS - if you are from the UK you will know about their shitty reputation amongst teens. It didn't help me one bit but me being the shy 11-year old I was with already very fed up parents, I pretended it did. 

Now I'm 14, sh*, have bad OCD symptoms, regular panic attacks, suicidal, yk; all the great stuff 😀... and I have no idea what to do. I know I need help but no one knows I feel like this, not even my best friends. 

I always knew I would rather end my life than throw up (ik how stupid and fcked up that sounds but that's just how my brain works with emetophobia) but other than that I had no reason to feel like I wanted to die. But now, everything going on in my head just comes to the conclusion that I don't want to be here. 

I don't enjoy anything at school and barley do anything in class anymore. I loved biology, maths, music, art and I had big hopes to become a doctor or work in medicine. But now I hate them all. I was a smart student when I was a bit younger, things came easy for me, therefore I developed no work ethic which obviously hasn't helped the situation. I have literally no motivation to do anything, I can’t remember the last time I revised for a test. My homework no matter how important, is either done late, not at all, or done literally the lesson its due. I suppose I stopped trying hard in school when I realised I wouldn't live long enough to need it. 😃

I’m pretty sure I have ocd. I don’t want to self diagnose but I’m pretty certain I do. I have all the symptoms and there’s no other explanation for them.

I quit all of my out of school clubs and things and now I come home everyday and lay on my bed. My parents just say I’m lazy and moody, they could be right but when I speak to my friends and others my age generally they don’t want to die lol. 

My friends all have their own problems and I also just don't want to make things awkward by telling them all this so I try my hardest to take my mind off it and still seem happy when I'm with them. 

Yeah I'm sad but I don’t think I’m depressed or anything. Tbh just nothing appeals to me about living now, or later. I’m in mental pain now and later on in life: yeah, you can do whatever you want but shit gets even more real. You have to deal with so much more. I can't be bothered to write it all down but the world is a fucking horrible place. 

I don’t mean this in a whole “I’m 14 and this is deep” way, but I just don’t get life. I seem to be just floating along taking comfort in the fact that there’s always an easy way out. I sound like a coward because I have no reasons to feel like this but idk. The good parts of life just don’t seem to balance out the bad..."
664,I don’t know what to do,"My girlfriend was crying the other night about feeling she was hated by everyone and everyone was talking about her when no one was? She’s been overly paranoid over the smallest things and keeps making comments about everyone being against her and it’s showing more and more. 
-she thought she was being watched and taped over all her cameras 
-she won’t drive alone because she always thinks she’s being followed 
-started sleeping with a knife near her
these are just some that I’ve noticed it all started a bit over a week ago and she just looked different.. 
I don’t know if maybe it’s just a normal thing and nothing to be overly concerned with but I’ve never felt the way she does and responded like it. 
I don’t wanna be over the top with suggesting help or seeing a doctor but she looks emotionally exhausted and I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of overstepping but I’m afraid it these are symptoms of something potentially very wrong."
665,Shameful Plug,"I wish it wasn't so. I wish I wasn't stooping to this level. I'm mortified to admit it, but this is a self-promotion. An unabashed, annoying one that may not do anything for me, but I'd rather try and fail than not try at all.

I run an online resource targeting people with anxiety or more general mental health issues. My content is centered on relevant scientific research: I take findings from the fields of neuroscience and psychology and interpret what we can learn from them and how we can apply that research to ourselves to improve our lives.

It's called Above Cognition, and I post fairly regularly to it. I also have an Instagram account, and I post drawings, quotations, and memes to help you laugh at the way our brains mess with us. 

I'm a first-year college student, and I want to transfer schools because I'm paying too much as it is, so if I could get this project off the ground with your help, I'd be so grateful and it would improve my chances of successfully transferring.

So please follow my Instagram page and check out my website: I hope you can learn something about yourself.

666,I cannot breathe when I eat. What should I do?,"I cannot breathe when I eat. I am afraid that I will choke on food if I do. I was unable to find any advice on the internet about this particular eating disorder, nor have I ever found anyone with a similar problem. 

I have done my research and found a phobia called **pseudodysphagia.** A short [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudodysphagia#:~:text=Psychology,undercapacity%20of%20the%20esophageal%20opening) about it states the following:

&gt; **Severe pseudodysphagia** is the [irrational fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia) of [swallowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing) and minor pseudodysphagia is the fear of choking. The symptoms are [psychosomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic). The act of swallowing becomes mentally linked with choking or with undercapacity of the [esophageal opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esophageal_opening&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1). This can induce [panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic) reactions before or during the act of swallowing. The sensation of difficult swallowing feels authentic to the affected individual, although it is based on nothing in reality. It is important that [dysphagia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia) (difficult or painful swallowing) be ruled out before a diagnosis of pseudodysphagia is made. 

However, I am not afraid of swallowing food. I am, however, afraid of choking on food and dying. This fear has become an everyday part of my life and it really scares me. What scares me the most is that one day I may actually choke on food because of this irrational fear, and the fact that I cannot breathe when I eat.

Additionally, I would like to say that my nose automatically stops breathing whenever I put food in my mouth. I do not know why. I cannot control my breathing when I eat. Therefore, I am having to hold my breath whenever I eat something, and I eat *very slowly*. At some point, my body just forces me to take a deep breath when there is not enough oxygen. I am afraid that exactly that may cause me to choke on food one day, and, perhaps, die.

I need serious help. I hope that some of you may give me an advice on how to deal with this phobia and how to cure it."
667,"Need to vent about my childhood (trigger warning: neglect, suicidal thoughts, alcoholic parents)","My mother is a schizophrenic and an alcoholic. I also have come to start to believe that she might be a narcissist. I was told by her that I was the only reason she didn't drive off a cliff earlier that day at probably around 13 years old. Which was very confusing to me cause I didn't understand why she told a 13 year old. And months before she had a schizophrenic episode and threw a glass near me and said i was ""stupid and useless"". Those things that she said to me are still in my mind 24/7. Both of my parents were never there for me emotionally and if i tried to talk to my mother she would say that ""it never happened"" or ""i'm overreacting"" or ""grow up, man up"". All of these things have taken a toll on me and now that i'm 18 i'm ready to open up and speak up. I actually find out through coworkers and security cameras that my mother has been cheating on my dad at 6 am with her boyfriend at MY JOB almost every day. I cant tell my dad cause it will break him. Its so confusing cause I want to love them for the good things that happened in my childhood. but to what extent does the good outweigh the bad? that's the question I find asking myself constantly. Also, as a child my mother used to pick on my weight. She embarrassed me infront of my friends and their parents at a dinner and made fun of my weight. I used to eat in order to fill a void (at the time i didn't know what that was). I have come to think that i might have borderline personality disorder from the constant neglect. During my teenage years i self isolated and stayed in my room all day. There were some days where I wouldn't see my mom or dad at all. They always fought and my mom gaslights my father and he doesn't even know anymore. I'm just so tired of fighting for my life sometimes. I just feel hopeless and useless and I don't deserve to live. Now i find myself losing friendships cause i lash out at them the second they wrong me. When people anger me I lash out and stop talking to them. I hate that I do that after, i really regret losing some of those friends. I just started therapy and I kind of want to bring up BPD but i'm afraid that they will laugh and say no it's not that, when i really do think it is. I dont trust my self or others and i feel like people will use what i say against me. I'm so lost and confused anymore. Idk what to do. The only thing that's stopping me from killing myself is wanting to prove my mother wrong and show her that I don't need her to be great in life."
668,Trying to understand my daydreams...," I'm a straight male who daydreams about being a female. Keep in mind that the scenarios in my mind are never sexual, but they can get intimate in terms of the conversations I have as this character in my head. Why do I enjoy being being a female in my daydreams?! The scenarios are usually conversations with people I know, but they like me more as this female character. People are obsessed with me in my daydreams, because I'm this beautiful woman. Is this maybe a sign of hidden insecurities? 
What do you guys think?"
669,Sorry this seemed like the best place to put this,"So somewhat of a vent but could also use some input either way something I needed to write out. I would like to say I internalize but the definition doesn't quite match, really I just bottle up any uncomfortable emotion or feeling. This has been my method for literally all of my life and other people with my type of personality can probably understand. I've always been the mediator, the funny one, the weird dude and while I do enjoy being those things it tends to wear you down when it's all you can be. I have an amazing friend and support group but it's hard to let any negative emotions show or be down at anytime because everyone jumps on me asking if things are ok. So I'm forced again and again to put on the smile and do the show because I simply can't bear to disappoint the audience. Now onto why I started writing this, anger. Recently I have been in need of a good way to release anger, normally I would talk to the person or people involved and try to resolve the issue but that is not an option for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons being that I'm not even sure if I'm mad or even have the right to be, then I swivel around the next day and say I'm furious and here is a list of reasons why. Anyway if anyone has any input or things they use for unresolved anger please let me know. Also big thanks if you read this all I know it's whiny so apologies"
670,Do I have a mental health problem?,"(TW for selfharm/suicide/death etc) So pretty self explanatory, is this something I should take to someone? I'm 18F, finishing high school now and its so stressful. I used to scratch myself with a pin when I got upset however one day I decided to upgrade, I guess, and I now have a razor from a sharpener, that I use every now and again. I really want to die, like a lot, I don't want to live past 24 (That's when I see my Uni course finishing). I remember wanting to die by drowning in a pool when I was 10, and I recently found a note from my 7 year old self that said ""I am very sad, God is dead,"" so I think it's been going on longer than I thought.

I have a lot of stress about social situations, I can't deal with strangers, and constantly worry about my appearance. One of my main concerns is my hair, and I will have what I call a breakdown (but I don't know if that's actually what's happening) if I think it's not right. I can't talk to people I don't know and I don't even like talking to cashiers and stuff like that. I had no friends until year 1 (7), and that was because a more confident person let me join their friendship group.

I run around the house if my head gets too full of thoughts, and I much prefer running up and down the stairs at school rather than talking for a long time with my friends. I get really overwhelmed by people and seem to constantly misread or misstep during conversations.

I can't focus on the right sounds, like when I'm trying to study or listen to a teacher during online learning I will hear my mum if she's talking first. I hate any food related sounds, and I will almost start to cry if someone does something in a song that isn't meant to happen (like clapping during a part that's meant to be silent). I don't know if these are just because I'm stressed or if it's something else.

I don't know if I can feel love? I don't think I've had a proper crush. I also don't really like the way I look (which is normal though I think).

My grandma died quite horribly two years ago (she had a stroke on a plane and had to stay in Hong Kong until we could fly her back here,) and I just felt numb after that. I only cried during a song in the funeral, I don't know it was just emptiness mostly.

I have no way of visualising in my head and as a side effect I adjust way too easily. If I'm on a camp, by the second day I'll forget I had a life at my house. I can't visualise people's faces, which means I don't get home sick, and I forget people exist really easily.

I sleep in a 'nest' of blankets and such, and I can't really sleep without feeling surrounded. I'll put a pillow behind my back in an unfamiliar environment and I usually can sleep quite easily with just that pressure on my back.

Both my brothers have ADHD, one more severe than the other, and I've heard symptoms differ between girls and boys. I don't think I have it, but I do things that I don't think are normal, so I guess I'm just wondering if I'm just overthinking this?"
671,Am I really ok?,"Hi guys, I've been thinking about this lately. I haven't consulted a psychiatrist before, never had the chance to. Before I start, I just wanted to say first that English in not my first language, so I'm sorry if my grammar would sound weird for ya. So about what I am concerned about, I don't know if my parents are also aware of this, it's something about my personality and behavior. There are times when I feel like everything is too boring, sometimes I just feel too lazy to even try something new. I'm an introvert person. I do have some friends, but only a few and I don't feel like I want to make more connection to other people other than those friends that I already have. Sometimes, I feel somewhat lost in my own thoughts. While I'm in the middle of thinking something, there are times when I forget what I was thinking about in the first place and why I was thinking about that particular thing. There is also this stupid feeling that sometimes happen to me where I would just lie about random things and deep inside I love it. I know to myself that I'm just joking around with that person but, the more I do it, the more I want to do it again. Deep inside me, I also think that it's funny and there are times where I laugh and giggle in public when I think about it. Also, I find it hard to sympathize with another person's feeling. I don't know if I can really feel the emotions of other people or if I'm just lying to myself that I get how it feels at all. I don't know if this is something that I should be concerned about, I mean, I think I'm ok. Is this normal? Cause I think a lot of people is also like me right? I don't know, that's why I'm posting this here. I hope you guys can help me."
672,Is it normal to see your life in 2 parts? One before you had mental issues and after,I can’t relate to my former myself it feels like. Situations and experiences were totally different. Some could argue I’ve just grown up but I can’t help but see the negatives that have changed. Like socially I’m definitely not as successful now. I’m less of a strong character type as I am not confident anymore. I know I’m the same person and I guess I put my former self on a pedestal too much. I still see glimpses of myself now as how I want to be. I guess I have pretty low self esteem about the way I am now. I miss being accepted by people socially
673,My grandma,"My 91 year old grandma has been acting strange lately, we are positive she has early stages of Alzheimer’s but lately she has been saying some really strange things, talking about how she needs to kill a dog and saying she’s been getting calls from people that don’t exist but last night was the tipping point.

She came to my room at 1:30 am and asked me to stop screaming and let her sleep. She was fully dressed and said she needs to leave her house. Me and my mom calmed her down and she went back to bed. About 2 hours later i hear her yelling at the top of her lungs at my mom saying things like “the girl is in the house” and started rambling on about a dead 4 year old girl.

Normally when she says strange things we just calm her down and she relaxes but she’s been saying this creepy things at night lately and it’s getting worse and worse.

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this with an elderly family member before?"
674,TW How do I know I need to go into impatient/a psychward for suicidal thoughts and behaviors?,"For the past 2-3 weeks I’ve been cutting myself to the fat/fascia and have been thinking about suicide a lot. I feel like I’m never going to get better because I’ve been on and off suicidal 7/17 years of my life. I went to one when I was 15 and think I need to go back. I would admit myself right now, but I’m scared my parents will be disappointed in me. Also I live in America and my family is lower middle class :(
I think I need one because I’ve started thinking about methods of how to end it. I feel selfish for needing inpatient care though"
675,Envy and hate toward people better than me,"I can't help it. I can' stand people who are better than me. For example my social and handsome friend. I love and respect him but I also hate him so much. He always been supportive to me but I can't stop myself from envy him. 

Other examples are my father, %1 of world, people lived really full lifes (Theodore Roosevelt, Sir Christopher Lee), popular politicians, nerds in school etc.

I feel insecure, lower, powerless among people better than me and sad part is a lot of people are better than me. I hate myself so much, there is literally nothing I respect about myself. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Is this mental problem or is it just natural thing?"

It's getting bad now because I bite really ahrd and my hands are becoming very bruised. Idk how I started this but my kom says I did it as a kid too. What's going on with me? How does one stop this? When the urge comes over me I feel like I have too do it or I'll break my teeth clenching them."
678,I am afraid of trusting people,"  In order to have a better understanding of my life, here is how my past looked like: 

I was born and raised in a small town in a middle of nowhere. Lived all of my life in an emotionally distant family, where nobody would ever hug each other or tell someone something positive. I was literally never praised for doing anything. My parents would only point out if I did something wrong, and tell me how stupid I am.

I remember feeling scared shitless during my elementary school, as other guys would always make fun of me for being fat. Even my dad would constantly tease me about being fat.

As a result of that, I learned to never show any weakness to anyone. If someone hurt me, I would just withdraw myself from them.

I never thought that something may be wrong with the way I was raised. They weren’t physically abusive, they gave me food, they would give me money, but as long as I behaved exactly as they wanted to.

I feel awful for writing this, but I fucking hate them so much. I wouldn’t even cry if my father died right now.

It was always hard for me to connect with other people. I have few friends, but we never talk about our problems, only about social life. I felt like no matter how much time we spent together, I could never trust anyone, and that people will just turn around and walk away from me.  
   
 

So, two years ago I met this amazing girl that I asked out. She wasn’t into me (most likely because I was fat), but we stayed friends. I trusted this girl so much, and loved her. We were only platonic friends, but I was infatuated with her. Since I was so unstable, our friendship broke and I felt like I was manipulating her into a relationship. The last thing I remember is that we had an argument, and she just got up and left. It broke my heart. I was crying for months after. She was the only person that I ever trusted, and she just disappeared from my life.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Every time I see someone I’m interested in, I always remember how people never cared about me, how others abandoned me, and it makes me withdraw and never initiate anything.

I don’t see male guys as potential friends, but instead as someone who will hurt me and mock me.

I don’t see girls that I like as potential girlfriends, I see them as someone who will eventually abandon me.

I don’t know what to do or how to stop this."
679,"If you're new to mindfulness, it can help you live a calmer, happier life","Mindfulness is about the here and now - focusing 100% of your attention on whatever you’re doing, being present with whatever you’re experiencing. Trying to be calm or happy doesn’t work - chasing after things which will make us happy doesn’t tend to either. Practicing mindfulness doesn’t switch off difficult emotions but through regular practice it can help us to transform difficult feelings and limit the damage that anxiety, anger and sadness can do to ourselves and others.

As well as sitting down for a guided meditation, you can apply mindfulness to your everyday life, focusing your awareness in everything you’re doing. You can do this when washing the dishes, making tea/coffee or brushing your teeth. Even just sitting for a few moments focusing on what you can feel in your body can have a hugely calming effect.

Mindfulness can also help us to be aware of and tend to our thoughts and feelings - so if we have a sad, angry or anxious thought, rather than being swept away we can stop, breathe, notice the thought, acknowledge what we’re feeling, notice the thought we’re having and listen like a friend. We might think about the roots of that thought/feeling - events in our part that drive our reactions. Its not always easy to remember in the heat of the moment but that's why a little practice every day makes the most difference.

680,Commitment issues and constantly restarting things,"Before I start this post, I wanted to give you information about myself: late 20s, female, Australian, have both depression and anxiety. *There is a TL;DR at the bottom.*

For what feels like almost a decade, I have had commitment issues with various things.  This includes work, tertiary study, video games, social media and even email addresses.

Out of all the commitment issues that I have, restarting video games is what is my current problem.  For games such as *The Sims* and *Animal Crossing*, I cannot stick to one story for longer than ten minutes to a few hours.  For *The Sims*, I always delete my save data and I cannot play without it being clear of previous data.  Even then, I end up stopping either midway of making a sim or just after moving the sim into a house.  Whereas for *Animal Crossing*, I actually was fairly okay when I started in March and didn't have any problems for over a month.  After a few months of not playing it, I am unable to stick to one island for more than 2 or 3 days (in game) before I restart it.  I've tried not to do things that might make me want to restart but it doesn't work.  I love the game but I am constantly repeating the requirements of the first few days so it is starting to drive me insane.

Regarding work, whenever I start a new job I have no commitment issues until a few weeks later where I start to miss work.  My current job (aged care worker) since 2018 has made me miss a lot of work due to a mixture of stress (which lead to really bad burnout in October 2019), anxiety and depression, and overwork.  In the past year I have taken more time off than I intended to and I can't trust myself to not call in sick from even minor things every few weeks.  It drives me nuts, especially after reducing the amount of shifts to help prevent it from happening.  I am trying to look for a new job but due to COVID, it is impossible.

I have made at least five or six times to go to university and five of the times I quit before classes started (and fortunately wasn't charged anything).  I did attend for a semester earlier this year but I only attended classes in the first half before Easter break.  Unfortunately I started *Animal Crossing* in the break which didn't help.  I have realised that I don't need to go to university and don't want to attempt any more study as I'm over it.  Plus it's crazy expensive.

I also have an issue with social media where I make an Instagram account and end up deleting it and restarting after a certain period of time.  I have lost track of how many times I have restarted Instagram.  I have a similar problem with Facebook but I usually would keep it around longer yet it would result in the same thing.  I deleted both accounts around early September and have decided to just not restart them until I figure out what my problem is.  

Like everything else, I have a similar issue with my commitment to email addresses.  This is definitely my longest issue from around 2008 onwards.  It was originally to make new accounts for whatever games I played online or social media.  I have success with keeping a main email address, especially for communicating with family, but it usually changes every couple of years.  Although I make so many other email accounts, especially as back ups or for social media or whatever reason I had at the time of making one.  

*Not related to commitment issues, but does anyone else experience problems with having things in their peripheral vision and can't work unless it's tidy or out of the way and not in their peripheral vision?*

TL;DR I am having commitment issues with various aspects of my life and it is driving me nuts.  What can I do to stick to everything?  Could I have OCPD or something else? TYIA"
681,Second relationship ruined by my anger,"So I’m currently in the military and getting out for mental health issues that mostly came into the spotlight after my wife left me, still no contact with her and it’s been almost 4 months. That’s the first relationship. The second is with a girl I met two states away and have been “dating” (although I’m still married but separated). She has taught me so much about love and got me to realize my wife sexually abused me and I really noticed it my first day going back to work (someone walked behind me holding a folder, folder touched me and I got super anxious). 

Last night I kicked a table, not very hard, it was small and flimsy and she ran off and cried in my bathroom and I couldn’t handle doing that to her. My wife had left me due to my “violent outbursts” which were just cries for help I guess. I just wanted to be held and have my hair played with until I’d stop sobbing. The second relationship is still in question as she feels we need to take time to better ourselves before we actually consider us dating.

Long story short is I need help to manage anger, express my frustrations and feelings and I would greatly appreciate any resources.

Here’s some additional background information, I’ve been in the hospital twice for mental health, once during active duty, once when I was a civilian, currently in medications for sleep, PTSD (mostly nightmares) and depression. Feel free to ask any questions, I’m okay with therapy like questions and I’d appreciate those too so I can get some more input. Thanks for reading my long post!"
682,Recently off antidepressants,I have recently gone off antidepressants after many years of being on them. I started therapy and have been trying to be aware of my habits with my unhealthy thought process so i can hopefully change my way of thinking..... im struggling. Hard. I feel really lost and that im just going with the motions of life. I understand that this is a process and with time and effort things may change but wow. Its miserable.
683,I (20) dont know how to feel about my dad and his partner getting married.,"Please note: I reallt struggle with putting my thoughts into real words. So it may go on, but in my eyes i needed to included it lol. I also skip over some stuff, but the gaps I assume kinda fill themselves.


For alot of my memory(up to like age of 14) my life had been me, my dad, and my younger brother. My dad was married and split with ny mum when i was young(7ish), I barely remember it. All I know is for a few years I couldn't see my mum (untill I was 13ish) me and my mum now have a very good relationship, but not a typical one. 

Through these years where I didnt see my mum, up untill I was 16 I just knew occasionally there may be a lady my dad was with, wede visit a few times, and not again. Sometimes they stuck around for a few more months, one or two moved in or we moved to them. The worst one I think my memory has blocked out, because she would verbally abuse myself and my brother, and then lie to my father saying wede done it... 

Then eventually there was a different one. She seemed kinda nice, I liked her for the first 2 years. And then things changed. 
We moved in.
She had 3 kids, a one same as my brother, well call them O. 
Then there was a girl, my age, shes L. 
And then a older boy. Hes not too relevant to the story, hes nice. 

L and O were spoilt. Never did wrong in her eyes. But if me or my bro did it, then it would be atleast a telling off at the table. 

Over time, it slowly became less at the table. More while everyone else was out, so she could be louder. And so she could say whatevee she wanted about me. About after a year she would accuse me of being a lazy waste of space, that I did nothing of worth and that Im weak. (Id like to add, at this point I had a solid job and had bought my own motorcycle, I had finished my 2nd year of college and was starting another degree) 
She started to slowly convice my dad that I was this way. He didnt seem to fully accept it but went along with it. 

Fast forward to early this year. Things were already fragile after several outbursts over the months, including me loosing my temper with her constant need to belittle me and make me feel like I couldnt fo anything. 
My brother comes knocking on my door in tears. I could here shouting of J and my dad before in his room, shouting at him. He asks me when we can get to mums soonest. 
I cant remember what really happened after that. All I remember is feeling nothinf but pure, unrefined hatred towards J. 

We screamed back and forth. It ended with me, my dad and brother sat in the kitchen. Im having a panic attack. I could hardlt breath. The only thing I remember saying to him was ""surely you could tell life was better with only us three"".

I moved out soon after with my partner. They bought a new puppy together the day I left. 
And within about 6 weeks when I visited for some lunch my dad told me the news. They were planning to get married.

I dont kmow what to feel about this. Because it doesnt upset me, or anger me. But I dont feel happy for them either. Do i really feel nothing about this? 

I think I mostly feel like ai struggle to see how they think its a good idea, and what my dad can still see in there. What can he see in someone who made both his children want to leave. 

Let me remind you- my brother is younger than me, and we didnt see our mum for a few years of out life. He didnt meet her properly as his mum untill he was 8... and he wanted to leave, and go to hers. 

TLDR: my dads getting married to someone who made myself and my brother want to run away. She ripped into me as a person probably monthly. 
Im stuggling to understand how I feel. Or if I feel anyrhign about it at all."
684,"Is it normal to feel super paranoid about everything almost all day, most days/every day?","I thought that my (20F) problem just might have been watching too many crime dramas and movies/shows of that sort, and maybe that's why I get paranoid. However, I am worried that it might actually be something more serious. I just moved into a new house with my husband, and since the information is out to the public right now, I have been feeling paranoid. for example, I hear noises upstairs and immediately think that there is someone hiding in our house. ""what if someone hid in the crawlspace in the attic and has been there since we moved in?"" ""what if there is someone and they are just waiting for an opportunity to kill me and my husband?"". I am constantly thinking that someone wants to kill us. we have no enemies, we keep to ourselves and have never been involved with any bad people or bad businesses. So it seems stupid, doesn't it? But for the last four days, My husband goes to work and as soon as he is gone, I start hearing noises upstairs and in the rooms. When he is around, I don't really hear it or just don't pay attention to it. So in the last four days, I began to hear it more often, and I seriously started carrying a knife with me everywhere I went. I am alone at home, so if I went to pee, I leave the door open. I sit on the toilet and instantly start thinking "" okay if someone did appear and tried to kill me, the first thing I would do is instantly charge at them with the knife"" Two days ago, I was paranoid more than usual, and took a shower until late afternoon because I was scared to get in the shower, and if someone was going to kill me, it would be the perfect opportunity. I left the shower door a little bit open, with my phone programmed to 911 on the phone app, just in case. And I checked how much space I had the door open so that my hand could easily reach the phone. When my husband came home that day, I was too embarrassed to tell him about the extreme paranoia I had that day, so I simply asked him "" When they do the inspection for the house, they don't check for rats right? unless you suspect it?"" and he said, ""yea but I'm pretty sure there are no rats in the house. If you hear things upstairs, it is probably the house settling or the wood settling or because of the wind"". So I asked him if he had heard noises too, and he said yes. so I was calmer that day. But I still get scared when he leaves and think, what if he isn't here and I die?

One more example before I end this. Yesterday, a man came up to our doorstep when I was going to check the mailbox. It was around 8:30 pm, and a tall, big, dark skin man came up, and really friendly introduced himself and said he was from the home alarm system company. We spoke about the house, and he asked to go inside for a minute to check out the exits and entrances. So I hesitantly let him in. As soon as he walked in, I immediately looked around. I had a knife on the cutting board (I was cooking) and thought that if anything were to happen, that is the first thing I am reaching towards. The second thing was,  as he was walking around the house, I made sure to stay behind him, and not me in front of him. If anything happened, I was going to see it coming and maybe have time to react.

I have been slightly paranoid for 2 years, maybe. Always thinking, if this were to happen, this is how I am going to react. Sitting on a bus, in an Uber, at work, I was always thinking, ""what if this person attacks me? how will I react and save myself?"". If it is of any importance to this post, I was severely depressed from ages 14-17, I didn't take medication, I was against it but I went to therapy 3 times a week and slowly got better, and I no longer have suicidal thoughts or cut myself, and I am very happy now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am worried that my paranoia might actually be a serious problem. I constantly think that someone wants to kill me, and if someone attacks me, I plan how I am going to react. I recently moved into a new house, and I hear "" footsteps"" in the upstairs."
685,Cause(s) for my extremely terrible memory?,"Lately, I've been feeling frustrated more and more with my terrifically terrible memory, both short term and long term. That aside, I'm also starting to have more and more difficulty with recognizing faces as well as voices (I don't think I have faceblindness though, that'd be a bit too extreme). And then there's auditory processing disorder, which is always fun.

It's the terrible memory that upsets me the most though. My friends can be telling me something, and only moments later would I go like, ""wait what did you say I had to pick up again"". They can even have said something only a couple months back or a year ago, and I would forget that too. I even have issues with zoning out, like putting on my normal shoes instead of my work shoes when I have to go to work. And these are all just mere examples, there definitely is more than just this but I, you guessed it, forgot the more extreme ones.

The ""faceblindness"" isn't much fun either; this morning, I walked my friend's dog with her, and we passed by the father of another friend of ours. Later when we got home though (we're roommates), I had to double check with her whether that was our friend or his father. ""Voiceblindness"" is a thing too; I won't recognize the voices of 99% of all Japanese voice actors, and when my brother goes like, ""did you know that voice is also the voice of character x from another anime?"" I'd go like, ""really???"". Silly example I suppose, but then there's how there were times where I mistook his voice for my father's, or how I mistook my friend's sister's voice for my friend's. And I don't remember our mutual friend's voice at all before he started transitioning- despite the fact that I also dated him for a couple years (I also don't remember his face from pre-transitioning too).

Now, I've had chronic depression since I was thirteen or something, and I'm 24 now. And I know bad memory is a significant symptom of depression, but these issues have only worsened in the last couple months, or at the beginning of this year. It's so sudden, it honestly frightens me, and makes me wonder whether there's more to it than mere depression. I'm not asking to be diagnosed by the way, I just wanna read up on shit to clear up confusion and take it with me to a professional whenever I can go (I have to fix some shit with health insurance first).

So yeah... What could possibly cause this? Just a symptom of depression worsening, or something else? Is there a name for this as well? I really want to read up on it and feel like I'm less alone."
686,if depression already makes me feel numb then how will antidepressants make me feel?,i always hear stories of antidepressants helping but making people feel kind of numb and emotionless? for me in my everyday life already it’s a mixture of feeling numb/ sometimes random outbursts of sadness/anger etc but if numb is already my main emotion then what could starting antidepressants do for me? Is it likely it could just make that worse?
687,Can't stop torturing myself over strong feelings for someone I probably can't ever be with...,"So, the long story short is, I've developed pretty strong feelings for my best friend over the last several weeks (I'm 32M, she's 29F). I don't know for 100% sure that she'd be against it, but I think it's probably very likely she'd not be interested. I don't think it would kill our friendship for me to bring it up, but I don't know that for sure, either, and even if I do say something and get rejected, I suspect I'm still going to struggle with these feelings quite a lot, especially when she starts seeing someone, and then jealousy gets added into all that. But I also don't want to lose the friendship we have, as it's extremely important to me.

For now, I'm trying hard to suppress these feelings. The thing is, these feelings are really taking a toll on my mental health. It's been weeks, at this point, of struggling. I'm at a point where I constantly feel sick to my stomach, I can't stop thinking about her, I have so much trouble sleeping, I can't seem to focus on much of anything, I can't seem to distract myself with anything, and my heart is just constantly hurting from all of this.

And she has no idea. Not that I'd want her to know I'm feeling all of these things and going through all of this over her. But it just sucks, because the one person I know who would be there for me is the one person who absolutely cannot be there for me, right now.

I don't know what to do. I'm so heartbroken thinking about having to forever sit by and watch her build a life with someone else, but it just feels like no good can really come of actually talking to her about any of this. All it would do is make things weird and awkward, at least temporarily, but still end up in the same place."
688,Is there a way to end my life without killing myself? I’m too much of a coward.,"Like, is there a drug that’ll make me feel great in my mind and just be a vegetable in real life?  I’ve been perpetually high for the past week and idk what day it is.  But I don’t want to feel anymore so here we are."

690,I can’t seem to get out of this loop,"I was raped by 3 guys when i was 14. They were a friends friend. They took at advantage of me while my friend watched and she left me there. I don’t understand why i said yes to accompanying her there. Probably because i want to have a friend (im kind of an outcast in then) and i wanted to be closer and impress her. When we arrived there, those men were already drinking. They were probably on their late 20’s to early 30’s. How she knew them? I dont know. At first i didnt want to drink because im in an unknown place w people i just met, and they keep calling me a buzzkill or uptight so i gave in and drank. After 3 shots i notice my vision becoming blur and im becoming dizzy. No energy but still conscious enough to know whats going on. Their carried me somewhere with and laid me on a surface and they started pulling down my undergarments (i was in my school uniform) they took turns and abused my body. I kept telling them to stop but they just laughed at me. And started to put different objects in my vagina. I remember one of them said “can you tell the difference if its my dick or the bottle?” They kept going and even using my thighs and inner thighs as an ashtray. They kept taking turns. Laughing and asking me if i liked it. IT WAS MY FIRST SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. im pretty sure they fucked me up for long periods of time because it was still daylight when they carried me somewhere. And I remember it slowly becoming dark outside from the window. They inserted bottles and different objects that i dont know in me. I felt so dirty. 
Then they carried me back to the living room and told me to go home. I was in my uniform without my underwear. I was still fucked up and i walked home. 12km away. I fucking walked. I had a hard time letting people touch me for months. Even a single tap on the shoulder fucks me up. Now its still in my head and im 23 now. It still fucks me up. Worse part about it is that i kept it to myself for YEARS because i didnt want my mom to know and call me names and i was scared. when i finally told her after 4 years she didnt believe me and blamed it on me because i went out and i was too trusting. That fucked me up even more. So i went through it alone with no one to cling on to or talked to. I am so fucked up and dirty i dont know of anyone will still accept me or love me"
691,I‘ve distanced myself from all of my formerly best friends,"Not really looking for advice although I’ll welcome any. 

When I was in HS I had a small group of best friends, about 7 guys and 4 girls. We were all close and hung out every weekend and every day of summer breaks. This continued for the first few years of college, but over time I fell into drugs at school and I distanced myself from almost everyone in the group. 

Six years later and I’m sober now. Some people moved away, however there are still 6 or 7 of these friends that hang out a lot and go on outings. I live in the same city as them, but I am almost never invited to these outings and I see this group once a year or less. There’s a few of these friends I see a bit more often (maybe once every six months), and I still have active group chats with this group and with individual people. But I almost never see them, and it is 100% my fault. 

For the first few years, I was always invited to everything, and 90% of the time I said no. I was dealing with personal stuff and wasn’t being a good friend as a result. These days, I feel out of place when hanging out with this group. There’s new people I don’t know, stories I’ve never heard, and plans I’m not a part of. I’m awkward and anxious around the people I used to consider my best friends. There are a few friends from the group that I still feel comfortable around, but only in one-on-one settings. 

This all would be fine with me if I’d found new friends, but I haven’t. My best friend is my brother (always has been), and besides him there’s a few coworkers I’m friendly with but never hang out with. I have virtually no IRL friends anymore. 

Again, I’m not really looking for advice on remedying my relationship with my old friend group. I feel like I’ve distanced myself from some of them to the point that it’s damaged beyond repair. But there are a few individuals in that group who I still value my relationship with, but I understand that I’m not very close to them anymore relative to their other friendships. 

I guess I need to find new friends or stop taking the few that I have for granted."
692,Grad student looking for folks to talk to re: Asian Americans and mental health,"Hi all– I'm a grad student currently taking a class where we explore online spaces at a time when it's increasingly difficult to engage with people face to face. I have done research in and am very interested in healthcare among the Asian Diaspora-- wondering if there is anyone interested in chatting with me this weekend about how you're using this subreddit to engage with/manage your health. Just a super informal, non-committal chat that will take less than 15 minutes! Please comment if you're interested and I'll reach out via chat! Thanks!!"
693,PTSD from a childhood of chronic/life threatening illness?,"TL;DR: i think have PTSD from dealing with a chronic illness/life threatening disease since i was a teenager. Anyone else in similar situation?

When I was 11, I got sick. Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, and eventually decided I was faking. While my parents believed me, they could only do so much and eventually we all agreed thay I would see a psychologist. Psychologist knew that this wasn't a mental health issue and actually helped get resources to have me properly diagnosed. 

From there, my disease (which is normally not life threatening) became life threatening for me. I was in and out of hospital. Getting all kinds of treatment, including chemotherapy. I've had five major surgeries to correct issues caused by the disease, with many more in my future. 

I'm now 25, and while I've been able to complete an education, I've been unable to work since graduation, due to health complications. 

The last few months have been particularly hard on me. And I've been reflecting (or obsessing) over everything I've been through. And a large part of me believes that I have PTSD from living with this. But its not one particular instance that has caused me issues, its the experience as a whole. The terror of almost dying, the fighting with health professionals to believe me, losing friends because they didn't believe I was as sick as I was, missing out on milestones, watching my future melt away, traumatizing my family, the bullying, etc.

I'm supposed to be at the point in my life where I'm working on a career, moving out of my parents house, creating a life of my own. But I'm stuck in the same place I feel like I've always been. And I want to move forward but I feel like I can't. 

And I'm constantly plagued by the thought that the disease could become as bad as it once was, where I'm fighting for my life and become a shell of who I am. And it's terrifying. 


I was put on medication for anxiety and depression when I was diagnosed with my disease as they are common side effects of the disease, but I haven't actually seen a psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, etc. since they put me on the medication so I've never really had someone to talk with about everything I've been through. I've recently had a referral sent for a psychiatrist but no clue when they will be able to fit me in. 

I guess, besides just getting these thoughts out of my head and into the world, I'm looking to see if anyone else is in a similar space? Anyone with PTSD caused from a similar situation? How do you deal? How do you move on?"
694,"I'm feeling really bad, but I feel like I can't tell anyone about this. I'm badly in need to feel loved and appreciated but I don't want to beg for that.","Hey! If you really take the time to read this, I wanna let you know that you are awesome!

I'm looking for a kind voice to chat a bit with, I'm feeling pretty bad and unloved, I feel disposable (and I kinda am), I feel like all of my friends will (if they didn't already did) replace me.

I feel really not important to anyone or anything, I feel like a basic and common thing you can replace when you get bored of. 

I miss once and event because I'm not feeling great or something and then I'm not getting invited to other ones. I break up with someone and next day they replaced me with someone else.

I really feel awful and like a big nothing, not special and like crap.

I want to feel loved, is that much?"
695,I'M SORRY,"I (M/25) was doing so well, then I woke up feeling unstable and trying to cut my friends out of my life. Spoke to one of 'em a lot, think I drove her away. My thoughts are just bouncing all over the place. I relapsed into self harm after 8 years clean. Feels like everyone is trying to get rid of me but at the same time, I want to isolate from everyone permanently. My self harm addiction came back and I'm probably gonna continue self-harming for the rest of the day. I'm sorry friends, I thought I could do better but I'm not sure now."
696,Not sure if I dissociated or ??,"Some background: 21F with severe anxiety and depression issues and ADD. Last night I drank a lot of alcohol but not dangerous levels. I spent the night with a close friend that I often sleep with. In the morning I remembered very little of the previous night. Total blackout. 

My friend told me that I was acting very weird. We were hanging out with a group of friends when I started really zoning out. At one point I got up, started walking somewhere, seemed really dizzy and collapsed. Didn’t pass out but didn’t seem to know where I was, was mostly unresponsive. Other people who witnessed this confirmed that this all happened. 

After that he says he eventually got me to his room and tried to make sure I was ok. I was awake but not talking, seemed unaware of him trying to interact with me. I didn’t respond to anything he said. Had very poor motor control and often went limp. Supposedly I seemed a little better at times, like I might be coming back, then would slip back into what he described as catatonia. Just completely spaced out and detached from reality while staring off into nothingness for quite a while. 


Considering the alcohol, my severe anxiety, and that I have been under a lot of stress lately, I think I might have been dissociating. But it might be something else. Does anyone have any idea or have experienced anything similar??"
697,"Life is too much, I need someone to talk to","Helloo everyone, hope this reddit post finds y'all in good spirits !! 

I know it takes time, effort and patience to listen to someone vent, hence why it took me so long to post this because I really don't want to burden anyone. But life is really too much. Everything is burdening me and I'm so used to suppressing everything I'm truly at my limit and don't think I can take anymore. I'm not angry, neither am I sad, nor am I suicidal. I'm just tired and I want someone to talk to. 

I know that it's a lot to ask, but if even one person PM me it would make my day. 

We can support each other through this journey of life so don't worry, it's gonna be a mutual 2 way supportive thing !! Take care everyone and thank you for reading this post ;))"
698,What's the best way to help someone with mental health issues?,"Hi everyone, 

I hope your day is treating you well.  This is my first post on Reddit and given the anonymity, I feel it's a great place to ask the community  what has worked either for themselves or others for those impacted directly or indirectly with mental health issues.

For background, I'm 36(M) who has been diagnosed as both Bi-polar and in the past, I struggled very heavily with depression and multiple suicide attempts in my teenage years.  I'm no longer suicidal, but I do struggle with my depression from time to time.  The bi-polar incidents I can handle as I recognize whenever I get either too high or too low (for those of you that know, I feel that you'll understand what I mean by that).  By all accounts, I've done very well for myself.  I'm financially stable, have a decent-paying job, bought my own house and my car was just paid off in July.

I have had, for the most part, an outstanding support system whenever I've ever reached out that I'm not feeling well.  I can tell my male friends ""Beer tonight"" and they know it's essentially code to spend maybe an hour or two while we have maybe a beer or two and it's mostly just time spent to help me through it.  

I've often wondered how others are able to cope.  I see a lot of posts about ""speaking out whenever you're not feeling well"" or ""calling someone no matter the time or day"", but I can speak from personal experience, the hardest thing for me to do whenever I'm feeling down is to reach out my hand for help (metaphorically or literally).  I've seen and heard personal stories where people commit suicide and the pain it causes others around and they wonder what they could have done to help prevent it.  The easiest and most simplistic answer I can give from own experience is that I don't want to be a burden.  It's crippling, society tells us we're supposed to be able to pick our own weight.  Those individuals I spoke about earlier all have their own families to worry about (they're all married, in VERY committed relationships, have children, or a combination of the 3).  The absolute last thing I want to do is burden someone else with issues I can't explain very well or even worse, I don't want them to pity me.  The absolute worst part is that these people are all absolutely wonderful individuals, they all want generally the best for me personally and all have offered to help any time or place. 

I've spoken with others who have similar issues (those with other mental issues) and I've asked what they think the best advice is for someone who wants to help someone struggling with mental issues.   We all don't have a good answer.  Those I've spoken to and I don't have an answer when someone asks, ""what's the best way to help someone who might be struggling with issues from time to time?""  The line of reaching out to someone?  I don't think it's a good answer.  A hotline to speak to someone anonymously directly?  I'm skeptical because of the reasons I listed earlier.  

Apologies for the long rant if it comes across that way, but I want to ask everyone: what's your answer to someone who asks what's the best way to help someone with mental issues?  I don't know if it makes sense or not, but I'm hoping you, the reddit community, can help me find an answer.

Thank you for your time, and more importantly, your honesty."
699,Anxiety,Has anyone ever suffered from a tight chest/shortness of breath/sensation of running out of oxygen after experiencing an anxiety attack?
700,My brother needs help,"My younger brother has had a very tough childhood, as have I. The difference is, I was sent off to boarding school while he was home to witness the ugliness that came with my parents divorce. 

Since then, he’s had a very strained relationship with my mother. My mother is verbally abusive and clearly has anger issues. She needs help, but will literally scream and shout at me if I even suggest it. 

Anyway, years of this have taken a toll on my younger brother. He’s quiet, angry and easily irritable. He recently self harmed. He needs someone to talk to. He doesn’t tell me much. I suggested that we go to a good therapist, but he says he doesn’t want to.. 

Any advise on how I can support him? FYI: I live in a different city than him. He’s 23 and lives with my mum. I offered to get him to live with me, but I know that’s unfair to him since he has a life here.. what can I do.."
701,Its my 25th birthday and I'm spending it alone,"I can actively feel my mental breaking. Since I was around 17 years old ive struggled with chronic depression. I was on daily medication up until about 6 months ago. My mental health has dramatically improved since and I have finally felt like myself after years of being trapped in a cell. I am actually happy, like genuinely happy.

But now, im sitting in a bar, all alone, on my 25th birthday. Its killing me. My mind wants to be depressed, but I just got through that, and now its presenting itself via extreme anxiety. Im usually not anxious, but today is awful.

I have no friends. Im a pretty social guy, but most of my friends were made via my ex girlfriend, who left me almost a year ago. Most people I meet like me and I get along with everyone (lots of work friends), but I struggle to move to the everyday friendship stage. Covid has made this even harder.

Im simply lost and dont know what to do other than drink myself to sleep and pretend this day never happened. Im terrified of falling back into a depressive state, but I just can't help thinking about how I'm in the prime of my life physically and spending it alone.

The worst part is that I actually love people and being social. Im not one to enjoy being alone. 25 is a big deal to me, and this is the absolute worst case scenario.

Sorry for ranting, I just needed to get this out there, as I have nobody else to talk to."
702,Hi just a minor vent and I actually need support ngl,I have looked up charts in the internet for depression and I have a lot of those symptoms although I am a cheery guy. But I do sometimes sense a bit of darkness in my mind. And also my parents treat me like a little kid like I'm in college wtf let me manage my own time I still hasn't ran into any problem academically. Like they planning to install a tracker in my pc. Maybe I should go back to playing when they are not here. I was performing the same as when I'm playing secretly and parents think I'm an addict or shit and I can't control myself bruh pls help
703,What Bipolar Disorder Feels Like,"One of the biggest problems with getting a diagnosis of bipolar is the doctor needs to see manic episodes otherwise they think it’s unipolar depression. But hypomania (not full-blown mania) feels ‘nice’ so you’re probably not going to go to the doctors and they’re not going to see you manic.   It's very important (if you do have bipolar disorder) that you find the right medication and get some help as the illness can be very damaging to both yourself and those around you.  It can make you think and behave in ways that are just not like you, not to mention the increased risk of self harm, drug abuse, or worse. 

Below is a Vlog that goes into more detail about what having the illness is like.

704,My flat is a mess I have no motivation to clean it...help,"Ive been lying in bed for the past hour trying to motivate myself to clean, my bathroom still has hair on the floor from last night when I cut my hair and there's clothes everywhere...help send me some motivation please."
705,Online counseling in U.S. for maintaining mental health?,"Hi all,

I have struggled a lot with my mental health for most of my life. It really peaked in my late teens/early twenties and manifested in a lot of self-destructive behaviors, disordered eating, physical self harm and relationship issues. I lost pretty much all my friends during this time and really struggled with my new marriage and failed to launch a career after college.

A few years later I am generally feeling more comfortable in my own skin. I still don’t have friends but I have rekindled my relationships with my family and spouse. I am still not in a great place career wise, but for the most part I like what I do and I don’t have a lot of anxiety about going to work any more. My partner and I bought a house and I got a dog who gets me out of the house and keeps me company when I am alone, which is pretty often since my partner likes to go out and we also work different hours many days.

I do still think the years of struggle continue to make it difficult for me to have a more fulfilled life. After years of kind of living in a hole, I find myself having to be really mindful and disciplined to complete basic self-maintenance, like washing my hair or trimming my nails. I have tried to get back into my hobbies but after so long it’s hard to resume, even if they are things I really do enjoy. I am sure many of you out there can relate. While I’m far from being in a crisis nowadays, I feel so much of my life has been wasted and what I still really want is some level of happiness and self-actualization.

I live in the U.S. and counseling is expensive. The only time I ever received professional help was when my spouse and I saw a counselor for two sessions, which I do think helped us immensely, but then we couldn’t realistically afford any more (neither of us had well-paying jobs), even with insurance. At the time our counselor recommended that I also attended individual sessions, but we both just made do without and made it to a better place on our own.

At this point, for my needs, I am thinking online counseling might be appropriate. I just need someone to help me reorient myself and let go of the nagging sense of regret for all those years I lost to mental illness. I was wondering if checking in with an online counselor via better help, etc. would be a productive option.

There are a lot of posts asking about online counseling on this sub but very few answers, and every situation is unique. Personal and professional opinions/advice are all welcome. Thanks!"
706,Supporting other’s mental health journey.,"So I have bipolar disorder my sister suffers from panic disorder and bouts of depression. Anyway, since Covid 19 came to disrupt everyone’s everyday living I noticed her mental health deteriorating a bit. Luckily for me, with everything slowing down for once, my mental health was the best it had been in over a year.

Some days, she would vent to me and tell me that she didn’t care about taking are of herself and that she was feeling down often. I noticed her struggles with her not wanting to anything aside from work from home. She wouldn’t shower for two weeks at a time, I had to remind her to brush her teeth, and she was sleeping for much longer than usual.

Finally, I came up with a system! Every Saturday is out “girls day” in which we’ll rotate between a mani/pedi, doing each other’s hair, watching our favorite show, and absolutely no work. Always starting the day with a shower- something she has no desire doing during the week.

It’s a little step but it’s something she looks forward to, and it’s something fun for me too! She seems happier during the week, and has her first therapy appointment this week!

Moral of the story, support your friends/family and their mental struggles too! 🖤"
707,Intrusive thoughts??,"I put the question flair but there’s not really a question. I get intrusive thoughts but I don’t know what to do about it. Sometimes they’re very gory, other times they’re just about dirt and stuff. I talked about the dirt-related ones to my therapist and she wanted to know if it was ocd, but it isn’t. After that was clear she kind of dismissed the problem and now I don’t know what to do about it. These thoughts are not every minute and every hour, and maybe not even every day, but they keep coming often and a lot, and they’re violent. I want to tell my therapist about this, but I don’t know how, I’m not good at expressing my feelings and stuff. That’s it, I don’t know what kind of feedback I’m expecting from this honestly"

710,I know i need help but i dont seem to even have the ability to go get it,"I know mostly just venting here and i dont really expect to get any real help with my life from a subreddit, i just kinda need to write this down to get it out

I wake up almost every day feeling either empty, panicke, worthless or just ok. Some days i dont even remember waking up or what i was feeling at the time. When im with the few people that i care about i feel euphoric at times, until the emptyness and sadness i feel most of the time slowly creeps in. I can not seem to get anything done outside of those few moments of panicked overworking. My inability to do anything that isnt eating, sleeping, shitting or going through damaging coping mechanisms (aka smoking, drinking and such) has made me wish that the panic would overtake me more often simply so that i could actually make some progress on school, or write up a cv so i could search for a job. Even though i know i would most likely fuck up the job i might get from it like ive fucked up most of my relationships with people and my life in generall. I dont get how a im supposed to live to the age of 80 if this is the way i feel at the age of 18. I know people will comment something like ""oh this is just teenage anxt, even though ive felt this way long before puberty. I always thought i would die way earlier than even the age of 18, yet the fact that i know what the people i love, and i know love me back would feel has kept me from doing it. Mostly my little sister who i know wouldnt understand my reasoning and who i know looks up to me with atleast some admiration. Im scared what she would do if she knew id ended myself, cuz i know shes falling into the same spiral i did at her age. Sure i never self harmed with cutting like she did the one time she did, but i did similar things. Seeing her self isolate like i did for years, it hurts cuz i get a generall feeling of the thoughts shes having. Neither of us have our respective dads in the picture and i know how that feels. Im scared of what she would do if she learnt from my death that ending it all was something someone she looked up to was willing to do, she might even think that the years between us was enough to break me when in reality ive been a broken person for longer than i have been ok. I dont really know how to end these inane ramblings disguised as a post, so ill just say that i hope you people in this subreddit enter a better part of your lives and start feeling better, cuz i dont know if i ever will

Ps. english isnt my first language incase there are some grammatical errors or generelle mistakes, i apologize

Tldr: i dont feel good like most of the people here"
711,I'm feeling very anxious and lonely,"I'm been feeling pretty low recently. I don't have the support system I once had and the lockdown has made it incredibly difficult for me to not think about my insecurities. I am feeling very lonely and unworthy of care and support. 

I reached out to my bestfriend, she said she would call me but she didn't. I'm sure it's because she was busy or genuinely forgot about it but it made me feel pretty terrible about myself. It made me feel like nobody cares for me and I don't have anyone to go to when I'm down without feeling like a burden. 

I was also feeling lightheaded and had a headache today because of my anxiety and I wasn't able to study today which also made me feel pretty awful about myself. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I had someone who would listen to me. I wish most of my friendships weren't one-sided. I wish my family members could see that I'm falling apart. 

I'm afraid I'm going to do something to myself but I don't feel comfortable sharing this with anyone now because I don't want to bother anyone with this crap. I don't want to be seen as an attention seeker or a dramatic teenager. You know, the way I've always been judged when I reached out for help. I don't know what to do anymore. Anyway, sorry for the long post. I don't really have anywhere else to go to share all of this."
712,Can I grab a refund on my ticket please?..,"*I've tried to keep this concise and to the point but I've been adding bits here and there and going back to sections, so some bits might be a bit all over the place*

I don't know why I'm writing this, tried most other avenues and feels like very few are really listening and hearing what I'm saying and the ones that are, have impossible hoops to jump through that I just can't manage.

I'll go back a bit - 

I'm 31 from UK, Ive always had horrific mental health issues but for the last few years, things have been completely unmanageable 

I've never been able to deal with people at all, but losing myself in work seemed to help, so I ran with it, my only issue was taking on WAAAAAY too much. I ended up shirking my normal work duties, become the point of contact for a lot of different subjects and focused pretty much exclusively on fixing problems and taking on the most horrificly, mangled fuck ups imaginable. Things we'd screwed up on and customers could complain to the ombudsman about and actually win a case (Work for a large pension provider/finance company). 

I enjoyed it for a time. Most people are really nice and open up when they've fucked something up and if you help them fix the issue, don't take the piss and let them know you fuck up too (which I usually do) you usually end up friends or at least you have a chat with from time to time. Also helps our customers get things sorted quickly and get the outcome they deserve.

This obviously has some negative effects - People start coming to you for any and all problems, which within reason is fine, but when there's a couple hundred people in your department alone, over 2 thousand in the building at any one time, it gets out of hand. 

Add to that the people who don't really need help but if they can get someone else to do it...

During this, I finally told my wife about things that had happened to me as a kid (raped by a teacher, left school at 15, multiple relationships with men WAY older than me when I was underage and the usual drugs, drink and bad decisions). Telling someone helped at first but then the paranoia kicked in and it felt like everyone on earth was judging me

Fast forward a year or 2 and I'm popping 6-8 bars of Xanax a day, nearly a bottle of rum or gin, anti depressants, codeine and tramadol just to deal. I left my wife and kids, shacked up with my ex, bought a stupidly fast car so the police couldn't catch me, and proceeded to go on a 6-8 month bender, signed off work with full pay, out all day, everyday, Completely out my mind, believing my wife had caused me to snap and leaving would fix everything. I Completely destroyed myself.

Finally came to my senses about a year in after a conversation with my son about how he was terrified I was leaving and he didn't want me too stop seeing him (the worst moment of my life)

My wife stuck by me. Helped me get sober, get back to a point where I could function (or do the bare essentials at least) and made it feel ok to ask for help.

If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be here right now, some of the shit she dealt with, no human should have to see/feel. Cheating, drugs, overdoses, emotional abuse and blackmail. How she is still alive and functioning I have no idea. She really is my hero (even though I don't tell her anywhere near enough)

So that brings us to now - I'm nearly a year Xanax and diazepam free, don't drink anymore, no drugs other than a joint every now and then. Lost 6 stone and look better than I ever have, and feel like I look  good for the first time in over a decade, but mentally I'm worse:

- Suicidal thoughts - The worst I've ever had, 100% of the time, whenever I do anything
- Paranoia - To levels I can't even handle, causes me to shut down for days.
- Seizures - feels like too much information coming from my brain, rush similar to coke coming on then every muscle in my body tenses to the point I can no longer control motor function, eyes roll in back of my head, shake everywhere, but I'm aware what's happening, doesn't seem like epilepsy.
- brain-zaps, between 5-15 at a time, one after another every other minute at worst, unable to hold conversation or control motor function when this happens apart from when I'm angry and in complete meltdown
- Permanent fight or flight mode, usually both fighting each other, if that's even possible, feels like that anyway
- Can't eat
- Can barely drink
- Can't take my meds
- Can't talk to people
- Voices in my head, disembodied voices around whatever room I'm in, sometimes it grabs me or blows on my neck. Happens rarely but enough that I'm nervous of it at all times. Seems to be when I'm in a really bad way
- Bright lights/flashes/lightning and textures on objects move. Again, only when I'm in a bad way
- No longer in control of my mind or thoughts
- Losing massive chunks of time
- Wake up/come too in weird places around the house with no clue how or why I'm there
- Can barely control myself in any emotional situations
- No memory or train of thought
- Also terrified of being sectioned - my wife's a carer for elderly dementia sufferers and I'm the designated driver, also gotta do school runs and it feels like if that happens, I'm failing my family. We also have fuck all money and serious debt (due to my issues) which adds to it.
- *Wife's addition* - I think you need to put what the specific suicidal thoughts are, crashing car whilst in it eg into water. Like you said the other day even imagining using a blunt knife, as it's not just a case of you think you want to kill yourself, you've put the thought into how &amp; where you'd do it.
Alot of people say in jest they wish they were dead . That's not the case with you. I think that's what a lot of health professionals arn't taking seriously with you


I can keep things together around my kids, no clue why (paternal instinct kicking in maybe), and my wife can calm me down some of the time but if on my own and other people are involved, it will escalate indefinitely until they stop/leave, or I will stop it

I can manage about 5-10 mins of normality out of the house/car on my own , but when it starts getting close to that, I start to unravel and I either walk away and won't talk or I flip my lid and become completely unreasonable, irrational and will stop at nothing to stop whatever is happening that's making me feel like that.

I'm not a violent person at all, I've never hit my wife or kids, not had anything even remotely like a fight since school, but when strangers and in some cases even people I know back me in a corner, I will do anything to get out of that situation, and that terrifies me, as soon as I panic, even slightly, I become completely unhinged and usually can't recognise the danger I could potentially cause others, only preventing something happening to me.

I was at Halfords (car accessories/bicycle shop in UK) not long ago and got in an altercation (non-violent) with a member of staff - I think he could tell I was cracking and wanted to help, he was really nice but wouldn't let me leave or leave me alone, followed me to my car and proceeded to hold my car door so I couldn't drive off, I went to drive off anyway, which would of killed the dude, I was 100% aware at that point that if I set off it would kill him, luckily my wife saw what I was doing and stepped next to the guy, I've noticed her and instantly clocked on to what I was doing and how crazy it was and stopped. The look in his eyes, I wanted to die on the spot, he wanted to help someone out who looked in trouble, and he could of died for that.

I had a seizure the night before last and my wife called an ambulance. We figured it was due to rapidly tapering my medication down to nothing (at GP's request so I could switch to something else), Got admitted and referred to the mental health team. 7 hour wait, I'm climbing the walls, finally get in to see them 9am the next morning, not slept in 30 hours, no meds in a few days, in complete meltdown, they still hadn't given me any meds yet. I instantly panic, try to start telling them what's brought me in today and one of the nurses asks ""Have you always had mental health issues?.."", I start talking for a split second, I think about starting talking about my childhood and then freak, run out the room, discharge myself from hospital and walk home from the other side of the city.

My wife's at home panicking, police and hospital are calling my mobile non stop, I can't deal. I manage to just about get home a few hours later, completely destroyed, had a bath and got a couple of hours sleep. 

Wake up feeling worse than before. My wife calls round pharmacies, no help, I freak and drive to the nearest pharmacy and break down telling the clerk my whole life story whilst shaking and barely ably to string a coherent sentence together, he instantly tells me to call 111 (non-emergency ambulance number which we rung the day before, when I was admitted to hospital) I freak again, run out the shop, it quickly escalates into me panicking and driving home like a complete fucking lunatic. 

My car's starter motor is knackered and it's in a really hard to reach place in the engine bay, so I use the end of an aluminium baseball bat (tried a tire iron but not heavy or big enough) to gently tap it to free it and get it going. I keep the bat by the front door so if the car is knackered I have something to use I can grab quickly (don't keep in car for obvious reasons), my rational after getting home was to grab the bat, go to a different pharmacy close to my house that's closed, smash the window and grab the meds. ""If they won't give me them I'll take them myself, I'm preventing me getting worse so its fine."" After a few minutes I notice how insane this tangent is getting, and how quick it's escalating (it doesn't feel insane, feels like the best idea imaginable, but rational thought can just about be heard). I tell my wife.

Wife manages to calm me down and get me back a little bit but I'm fucking spent.

Literally spent. 

I've missed out 60-70% of other shit that's happened otherwise this post would be 10 times the size, and I'd probably snap before I finished.

I feel like a hostage in my own head, being held at gunpoint by a completely delusional psychopath and no matter what I do, who I talk too, it always ends up back at ""You need coping strategies before we can move to psychotherapy"" which I completely understand, it'll cause more harm than good if I progress without them, but where does that leave me now? I can't talk about it without getting emotional and when I get emotional I go thermonuclear. 

I'm slipping and finding it harder and harder to control myself or remove myself from situations. I've started getting more argumentative and running away less which is scaring the hell out of me. Guessing it's due to constantly wearing a mask and feeling stronger when my face is hidden maybe. and the thoughts that go through my head during all these times are insane. 


What can I do now? Everything everyone says I need to do I've tried to do but cant, my whole body shuts down. I've watched self help videos (specifically Russel Brand and Jordan Peterson) and they make sense, I can really relate to what's been said and can see how it would all help, but putting it into practice never seems to have the desired effect.


Fuck ""I'm between a rock and a hard place"", this is being a fly on the wall of a black hole."

714,Reliving a memory,"When I was 12/13yrs old, one morning, I was getting ready for middle school, which was when I was most bullied because of my hair. I was trying to brush through my weave and blend it to my hair but it wasn’t working. I couldn’t get my hair to stay straight and flat(I have 4c hair, even with chemicals my hair was never straight enough). I put in a ponytail but my mom saw and though I look bad. Both my parent yelled at me for wasting time and for not fixing my hair when I started crying my dad stop, but my mom continued yelling. I didn’t want to go to school because my mom word was worse than the bullies but I knew they were coming fuck any self love I had too. I had a panic attack reliving that hell of a morning. That morning was only 30minutes tops but I  have relived it for years. I’m turning 25 soon. I thought I would be in a loving relationship by now, but nope, I spend my night crying over things that happened in middle school and binge eating, which I am working on."
715,Need as many perspectives as possible on this,"I (25m) met a beautiful and smart girl (23) through tinder. As we started talking in the beginning of July I learned that a couple of her relatives died of covid, she was raped when she was 18 and raped again two weeks before we started talking, she has bipolar disorder, she had a brain hemorrhage in January which left her 80 percent blind, she had multiple suicide attempts, some blood condition that doctors can't fucking diagnose that makes her lose consciousness on the spot several times a month, hoping that she's not gonna break her face  in the process of falling, her mother would lash out at her and beat her badly since she was 5 to 7 years old, because she looks really similar to her father who divorced her mother. And there's more, fucking hell, there's so much more. She had no fucking chance at normal. I'm not gonna go into further detail, it's too fucking long. To put it short her whole life people were fucking cruel and hateful and ignorant towards her. And you probably guessed by now that our relationship didn't work out. Yep. She was inconsiderate, insensitive, ungrateful and just plain shitty to me. I was nothing but kind, supportive, understanding and caring. She saw my kindness as a weakness to exploit, decided to ride on my back. Drained the fuck out of me. First I ended our romantic relationship, wanted to cut her out of my life completely, but couldn't imagine her being In real fucking hell alone and stayed. Toxic shit continued, resentment grew and I called her to say goodbye forever. She was like ""bruh, no problem"". No remorse in her voice. Like I'm a fucking speck of dust. 2 months pass to this week. She texts me ""hello"" i respond with ""don't"" she responds with ""I had a second brain hemorrhage please donate blood on my name"". I did, me and my best friend donated 2 packs of blood the next day.  Thought this will be the end of it.  Then, she sends a voice message ""I know I'm selfish and toxic, but I'm desperate and I have no one to turn to"". We started talking again. She talks and I listen. I have nothing to say to her, because I don't trust or respect her. She wants me to tell her everything I think about her cause she knows she hurt me, everything I'm angry at her for.

716,Why don’t I feel sad enough,"So for the past month/2 months I haven’t really felt sad in awful situations, like I’ll initially cry then just feel nothing. For example me and my long term boyfriend split up: I was sad when we were actually splitting up but since then I’ve felt nothing about it, not even relief or anything, just blank. Another example is that my nan (my fave person in the world) died today and I was crying when I was told and when I’d talk to my friends about it but again I’ve just been feeling blank since then. I really don’t know what to do as I feel like an awful person for not being sad enough :/"
717,"Help, I feel so empty inside. How do I fix this?","I don't feel like doing anything and I feel uncomfortable in my own skin. I can't lie down, sit or stand or walk in peace. Nothing is bringing me joy or peace. I don't want to do anything. Don't want to use my phone, read, sleep, talk or anything that I'd otherwise enjoy doing. Idk how else to describe this other than feeling empty inside. Maybe just constant anxiety or agitation? But it's very lowkey so idk. I just want to feel okay again. I want to do things I used to love and enjoy doing, I want to not be in this mental and emotional vegetative state. Please help me."
718,Can't leave bipolar ex alone in hell. Need as many perspectives as possible,"I (25m) met a beautiful and smart girl (23) through tinder. As we started talking in the beginning of July I learned that a couple of her relatives died of covid, she was raped when she was 18 and raped again two weeks before we started talking, she has bipolar disorder, she had a brain hemorrhage in January which left her 80 percent blind, she had multiple suicide attempts, some blood condition that doctors can't fucking diagnose that makes her lose consciousness on the spot several times a month, hoping that she's not gonna break her face  in the process of falling, her mother would lash out at her and beat her badly since she was 5 to 7 years old, because she looks really similar to her father who divorced her mother. And there's more, fucking hell, there's so much more. She had no fucking chance at normal. I'm not gonna go into further detail, it's too fucking long. To put it short her whole life people were fucking cruel and hateful and ignorant towards her. And you probably guessed by now that our relationship didn't work out. Yep. She was inconsiderate, insensitive, ungrateful and just plain shitty to me. I was nothing but kind, supportive, understanding and caring. She saw my kindness as a weakness to exploit, decided to ride on my back. Drained the fuck out of me. First I ended our romantic relationship, wanted to cut her out of my life completely, but couldn't imagine her being In real fucking hell alone and stayed. Toxic shit continued, resentment grew and I called her to say goodbye forever. She was like ""bruh, no problem"". No remorse in her voice. Like I'm a fucking speck of dust. 2 months pass to this week. She texts me ""hello"" i respond with ""don't"" she responds with ""I had a second brain hemorrhage please donate blood on my name"". I did, me and my best friend donated 2 packs of blood the next day.  Thought this will be the end of it.  Then, she sends a voice message ""I know I'm selfish and toxic, but I'm desperate and I have no one to turn to"". We started talking again. She talks and I listen. I have nothing to say to her, because I don't trust or respect her. She wants me to tell her everything I think about her cause she knows she hurt me, everything I'm angry at her for. But I can't, i'm scared fucking shitless that it's going to finish her. There's nothing in me for her, but heartwrenching pity. I just can't picture her being in my life. But I also can't stand the thought of her being alone and eaten alive by all the shit that fell upon her for no fucking reason. I can't fucking stand the thought of all this evil winning. Fuck. And here I am writing this. Because I have no fucking clue what to do. I'm not from USA, we have an atrocious mental healthcare situation here. Hence her life.

735,Effect of digital freedom restrictions on women’s mental health,"COVID has made the world desperate. It has taken away millions of jobs. Just as organisations are working out ingenious strategies to keep their heads above water, people are getting creative in their ways to earn a living in these disrupting times. This pandemic has forced people to not just fight for their physical immunity, but also fight for their mental immunity.

The World Federation for Mental Health has urged all countries worldwide to invest heavily in reviving the mental health of its citizens, whilst investing in reviving their respective economies. From loss of jobs to loss of loved ones to loss of freedom, the COVID disruption has brought about a climate of uncertainty among all generations, especially women. Falling incomes, job uncertainties, isolation, social restrictions have impacted women during the pandemic.

In South Korea, there was a 7% increase in suicide rates among women. 1,924 women in their late teens and 20s committed suicide in the first half of the year. Less than a thousand kilometers from South Korea, in Japan, the economic crisis has impacted women, which resulted in female suicides jumping up by 40% in August 2020. Far from the Asian continent, in the U.S., between February and May this year, 11.5 million women were laid off compared to 9 million men. And to add insult to injury, these jobs that women were laid off from were in America's top lowest paying jobs.

As World Mental Health Day 2020 focuses on investing resources towards improving mental health, the world needs to invest in a broader mindset towards improving the mental health of women. And that can only happen by giving them their due freedom on both fronts - digital and physical.

ENABLE AND NOT DISABLE

In its last survey that was conducted in 2018, ‘Freedom on the Net’, a comprehensive study of internet freedom in 65 countries around the globe, covering 87 percent of the world’s internet users. It tracked improvements and declines in internet freedom conditions each year. The countries included in the study were selected to represent diverse geographical regions and regime types. Of the 65 countries assessed, 26 had been on an overall decline since June 2017, compared with 19 that registered net improvements. The biggest score declines took place in Egypt and Sri Lanka, followed by Cambodia, Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Venezuela.

According to news service AFP, in recent years, Egypt has enforced strict internet controls through laws allowing authorities to block websites deemed a threat to national security. It also allows the monitoring of personal social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers. Earlier this year, in June, the Egyptian government arrested five of its citizens — all of them were women — all of them in their early twenties — all of them were social media influencers — all of them were from working-class backgrounds.

This was for posting videos of themselves on social platforms promoting products and services from brands they have been paid to endorse. In Egypt, with influencers imprisoned for ‘violating public morals, and the values and principles of the Egyptian family’, the question being asked is if the alleged wrongdoings are being tried under the correct legal charges, or if broad cultural grey areas are replacing the legal black and white. Egypt, and especially her youth, has repeatedly shown the world the desire and willingness to be a valued member of a global, digital community. They are now at the cusp of another transition.

DIGITAL CENSORSHIP IS NEEDED FOR THE RIGHT REASONS

Laws need to be applied to content that clearly incites danger – whether to do with individual harm, mass violence, or national security matters. Governments need to listen, to adapt, and to harness their energies, rather than impose unreasonable expectations. There needs to be a new social compact to meet the youths’ desire to express themselves freely, and, at the same time, respect societal values – one that is achieved by consultation, not coercion.

In Germany, instead of censoring the content shared by its people, it introduced a law called 'Network Enforcement Act' or NetzDG in 2017.  NetzDG obligates all social media platforms with over 2 million users to delete any content that promotes hate speech or offends religious sentiments posted on their platforms within 24 hours from the time of posting.

NetzDG is effective, because when a social media platform fails to delete the content within the stipulated timeframe, NetzDG punishes the violating company with steep fines of up to 50 million euros for non-compliance.

While social media platforms, whether, due to their own aggressive content guidelines, or the restrictive framework set by the countries they are being used in, are proactively deleting content that's even remotely sensitive, it must be remembered that over-implementation of such censorship is a violation of human rights law under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any censorship that misleads people at large must be censored. Only then, can we pave the way for a more transparent future. Many countries have shown that highlighting and recognising influencers with positive social messages can have an impact on the wider pool content being created.

At the same time, Governments need to recognise that it is not feasible to impose ‘One Country, One Culture’, as the Internet already provides spaces and content for every imaginable interest group. This seriously impacts the mental health of today’s youth especially women.

If it appears that internet censorship is a syndrome of the developing countries, more so in countries that are governed by the laws of religion, as opposed to countries that are run based on laws drafted towards protecting human rights and improving the overall state of affairs for human life, the appearance is certainly misleading and one built on false impressions. Whether afraid of being without a job and not getting a job is a concern in itself, for women who are laid off or working from home, their problems are only made worse.

When the lockdowns began, there was a drastic surge in helpline calls for domestic violence against women. Italy’s domestic shelters for domestic violence victims filled up quickly after the city went into lockdown. Spain recorded 18% more calls on the emergency helpline asking for help. Singapore recorded 33% more calls on its AWARE women’s helpline cell. Australia recorded a 75% increase in search on Google for domestic violence help.

At the same time, Governments need to recognise that it is not feasible to impose ‘One Country, One Culture’, as the Internet already provides spaces and content for every imaginable interest group. This seriously impacts the mental health of today’s youth especially women.  done without. In its defense, it has brought to light the inequities, the gender divide, and the suppression that women are continuing to face and endure in silence.

Are we ready to help them?

736,Lately I’ve really sad and I feel like everyone keeps attacking me even if they aren’t.,"I keep arguing with people even if they aren’t really rude and I feel like everyone hates me and is against me personally. I cant shrug off this feeling and nothing changes this. I had way too many fights with family and friends recently and I dont know how to fix this. Could someone please help me out, any tips would help."
737,So i guess i hallucinate,"I work in a warehouse. I was driving a forklift past the main door and as i went passed i see a figure of a man wearing a white shirt and nice black slacks standing in the middle of a fenced path. Looked out of place so i went back to look again, and it was gone... secure site with few staff who wear coveralls....

There were a half dozen rusty nails hammered into a crack in the wall. I went passed and they appeared to be worms trying to wiggle free. I started removing them when a co worker walked by. Asked me what i was doing 🤔. I told him i had to take them out cause they were bugging me.

So that coupled with randomly hearing my name being yelled by ""a crow somewhere"", has lead me to wonder... Am i okay? Im going to see a pychologist soon for anxiety but i dont really know how to bring this up without sounding insane..."
738,Opening the can of worms,"I donno how to handle me correctly. I am finding myself in absolute reaction mode way to often. 
Quick rundown of me. 20 year heroin addiction filled in with any other substance I could find. 10 years behind the walls. Been off of hard drugs for over 4 years now. Still taking 10 mg of methadone daily.
If I find myself in a disagreement with another I cannot turn the volume back down. It feels like a manic episode until I can get myself away. I don't know how to approach mental health professionals I've never been for lack of a better term diagnosed. I'm trying to figure this out before I end up where I started. I don't know if there's even a question in here maybe I just needed to vent..
Thanks either way"
739,Why did i suddenly become so ignorant?,"I'm not a very smart person, all i know is that i used to be smarter, more civil than what i am currently.

I dont know a good way to describe my situation, but ill use this as an example.

Im an anime fan, not the kind that continuously tells others to watch it, i simply watch it for my own enjoyment.

If you dont know, there is a debate about whether or not the english dub is better for anime, or the original (Japanese dub with English subtitles) is better.

Personally, i prefer the japanese dub.

But i never hated the english dub, i never thought of anyone that watches it as losers, i just accepted that people can like what they like.

But then, for some reason, i just suddenly didn't want to accept this at all.

I don't know how to describe my mind and way of thinking currently, but ill just have to describe it in this way.

I thinkmy mind changed into that of an ignorant loser who cant accept that people likes things he doesn't like.

I know i should just try and shed off my sudden sensitive mind, but i just cant.

Whenever i would hear the english dub, i would move my arms around, whispering loudly to myself about how much i hate it, and when i would see people say that they loved the english dub more, i would just get pissed off.

Of course, its a stupid thing to get mad about, but i know its stupid, but it seems that my mind just forces me to be sensitive and rude.

I don't know when it started, all i know is that it was not long ago.

Whenever i would watch feminist's, vegans, or fat people say that their way of living is ok, i would listen to them, and actually think to myself if they are right or not.

Sometimes, a vegan can be good and civil, but other times they can just be the worst.

But now, whenever i would see any of these people talk about how their way of living is ok, i would just flail my arms around, whispering loudly to myself that they are wrong no matter what.

I think i got scared of becoming someone people hate.

I think i got scared liking something i myself didn't like.

I feel as if it will be permanent, if i watch a good english dub, i will forever love it more than the japanese dub, but i dont want that to happen.

If i listen to a feminist say that all men are stupid, im scared that i would actually think of her as right and just become a simp.

I know that I'm scared, i know that i became stupid, i know that i became much more sensitive than i was before, but i cant change it for some reason.

I just wanna be the person i was before, not a smart person, but a person who would always listen to who or what he hates, and actually think properly whether or not he should hate it or love it.

This has also altered my intelligence, i remember watching the first episode of fate/zero back them when i still was a civil person, i remember understanding everything kerei, Tokiomi, and the father discussed.

But when i decided to watch some other stories, such as movies or series' with the same style of dialogue as well as complicated plots, i never managed to understand them.

I remember watching all of attack on titan a long time ago, i understood everything, from the eldians, to the history of the titans, ymir, and the walls, but now, i cant even remember the name of a main character in some movies.

I cant connect things well anymore, i cant understand things anymore, i just became child minded, ignorant, sensitive, stupid, and a degenerate."
740,What is wrong with me?,"I have no idea who or what I am anymore, nor do I know how to help myself. I’m a 17 year old female, and I might as well list my mental health diagnosis’s before I go on:

- Depression 
- OCD
- GAD
- Trichotillomania
- Nightmare disorder 
- DDD
- ADHD
- Chronic Migraines 

I am so confused on how to receive help if all my trauma, illnesses, imagination, are all internal. I don’t wanna explain myself too much, since I’m not sure what to say, but to be frank my mind created it’s own trauma. I live in a good household, accepted, supported, I have a good life. But even with that, I am unable to function normally.

I take medication, but it doesn’t stop my imagination from growing. I feel like I know things people shouldn’t be allowed to know. I rarely talk through anything my head expresses because I’m unsure of how to explain something even I don’t understand. Am I going crazy? I’m not sure. But has anyone been in the same boat as me, trauma created by vivid imagination?"

743,"Anxiety, Paroxetine and the in between.","Just wanted to write a post sharing my experience with anxiety, and more pertinently, paroxetine’s place within it.

I’m 26 now and have had severe anxiety since early teens, worsening over time but always arriving and passing in swaths and phases. It has manifested it self in different ways over time, both in interpersonal relationships and work life. It has affected my ability to maintain relationships and keep a steady job. Over time I have developed a better reasoning and response to it but the chemicals that cause it have always won - no matter how much better I became at coping or reasoning with it.

I’m yet to be clinically defined, but I’d say my anxiety leans more to social anxiety than any of the other forms. I am a very outgoing, social, and communicative person. Which makes having anxiety difficult, and doesn’t always correlate to who I am or what I like in my life. I love to be around people, meet new people, and relate to people. But my anxiety doesn’t always feel the same way. I’m of the belief that the chemicals in my body that display themselves as anxiety do not define me, but are mere passengers that are along with me for the ride. And within that I find not only solace, but strength. Nobody chooses to have anxiety, but we can choose how we relate to it, and in turn how little or not it defines us. We all share the same fears, some just don’t have their body’s reminding them of it everyday.

I’ve been on Olanzapine since early teens at varying doses, currently at a sweet spot of 7.5mg. I’ve tried propranolol and sertraline for my anxiety but they did not work for me, for me being the important factor. Different medication works differently for different people, I think.

Up until paroxetine I’d been on CBD at increasing strengths since late 2018. I’d say it worked for me around 60% of days. Which I felt was enough, and that was the best I could do. I was wrong. I was scared in all honesty, of the side effects of starting any new medication, but with lockdown and Covid-19 my anxiety became unbearable, so I spoke to my GP and I got started on 20mg Paroxetine. 

2 months later and I’m yet to put together into intelligible words how incredibly happy I am, but I’ll give it a go and hopefully it will speak to some of you. Firstly, the fight or flight sensations I’d feel walking past a stranger in the street have gone, the dread I’d feel at going outside have dissipated, the overwhelming sense of fear feels like a million miles away and I no longer live within the storm. I feel care-free, as broad and unaware as that sounds. The things that felt to me so all consuming no longer cross my mind. My response to my usual anxiety triggers has been dampened and eased and I feel calmer, stronger, happier, and healthier.

That is my experience on paroxetine. Medication isn’t always the answer, a conversation can be just as powerful. A hug, a message, or a gesture of understanding can offer undeniable resolution. But sometimes medication can help, and it isn’t anything to feel ashamed or upset about. I must note that I’ve been happy since I recovered from severe depression as a teenager and I am not taking Paroxetine for those reasons, just simply for my anxiety. I hope this is of benefit to some of you but I must add that paroxetine worked for me, personally. But there is help out there that will work for you, and you shouldn’t feel weaker in asking for it."
744,Recent Homicidal Thoughts,"Hello!
I’ve recently been struggling with homicidal thoughts.
Like for the past 2 months I’ve been hearing voices in my head whenever someone makes me angry.
This voices tell me to kill the person. At first I didn’t like this voices, because I thought that they were going to make me something that I would regret.
Now when someone makes me angry, I don’t hear the voices anymore, but I just get an INTENSE urge to kill the person that made me angry. I’m constantly getting thoughts on how to kill this person, whenever I imagine a situation to kill them, I have started laughing, it’s just too fun to imagine this.
I don’t know if I’m just going crazy at this point. I just feel the urge to kill them.
It’s kind of hard to find psychological help in my country so I don’t know what to do.
I hope you have a good day/night!"
745,Dad thinks that there is a website about him where people make fun of him.,"It probably started around half a year ago, my dad stopped talking to his family members and we didnt know why for like 3 months. He opened up to my mom and said that there is a website about him where family members and co workers share videos and make fun of him. He also avoids every single question about that website, everytime we ask how he found out about it, he avoids the question or ends the conversation.

He also accused my mom of cheating with our neighbours son. My little brother once came late from school because he talked to his friends and my dad just looked out of our windows for like 30 minutes waiting for him thinking that something happened and said that he is the next one. We tried to get help and he was in a mental health center, but refused to stay longer than a week. Im not really close to my dad and my mom is the only who really talks with him, he even avoids speaking with anyone but my mom."
746,"Spiraling, bipolar 2","Lost my job due to the pandemic, which means I lost my insurance.  I've been unmedicated for about 4 months now? Had to stop my meds due to side effects, then got laid off.  

Tried calling local human health services, they directed me to social services, social services told me to fill out an 18 page application??? Totally not possible when you're suicidal imo.  Plus my partner's (low) income counts against me, so I am going to be denied help regardless.  

Hoping I can apply for insurance using the (US) marketplace. But can't do that until i figure out how many hours I'm getting and how much I'm making.  The job I managed to find is literally half of my previous income, which I was already struggling on. Oh, and it's part time with no benefits.  Soooooooo.

Also lost my best friend and fam during the pandemic. They're not dead, just horrible people.  Went NC with the whole lot.

I'm just so tired, if I had kms years ago I wouldn't even be dealing with this.  Living is hard."
747,Forgiveness,"I found out my partner (m) was texting another guy not in a sexual way, just for dominance (to cuck him), I suffered a similar situation with my ex, he liked to exhibit himself on Snapchat, saw the messages and begged me not to leave him, I eventually broke up with him since he kept doing that in my back and much more things.

This time I’m having a healthy relationship, long distance relationship which makes this harder, I don’t feel he cheated on me but I feel insecure, I forgave him but I’m still scared of hurting again.
I dont have friends to vent about this. I vented asking him about details because my mind was torturing me about when/what questions, I believe him but it’s hard."
748,parents don’t feel real,"tbh i don’t know where to start, there’s too much to fit so i’ll try to summarize as best as i can. i always feel really disconnected from my family, they all feel so robotic sometimes. they lack empathy and any emotions other than being happy or angry. we can’t exactly be sad in our household, mental health is a joke here. I think both of my parents are emotionally distant. whenever i try to hug my mom she rarely hugs back or gets annoyed and snaps at me because she’s “busy” even when she’s just on her phone. but when i ask her to hug me or show affection she says i should be doing that because “i’m her daughter” so i don’t know when it’s a good time? it’s hard to talk to her too, i feel like she doesn’t really care about what goes on in my life and always mocks me when I talk about something that makes me happy. she always just makes weird faces when i talk really happily about something. my dad and i have always had a strained relationship so i don’t like being affectionate with him, there’s just too many bad memories. a couple times a year he will try to hug me but i just shove him away because i don’t like it, it just feels weird and uncomfortable. He’s hit me several times before and has anger issues, so he blows up every couple of months and breaks things, etc, so i find it hard to show affection to someone like that. It’s terrifying when he’s mad. he’s a little easier to talk to though but i still can’t open up to him either because he doesn’t care much for my mental health or uses something I tell him against me. he’s always on his phone too, talking to other family members and friends, he makes at least 5 phone calls a day. he doesn’t make that much time for us. I’ve always liked my mom more but now i’m coming to realize she isn’t really any better than him. Honestly they’re both toxic for each other. Their marriage is obviously broken and it’s clear that they don’t love each other, at least anymore. they seem more like coworkers. when my moms dad died she cried for 15 minutes and then went back to her routine and she hasn’t spoken about him since. she didn’t really seem to care after that which is what shocked me. my dad made a joke about my grandpa a couple hours after he passed and my mom didn’t even seem fazed. i mean what normal people do that? i just don’t know what to do, it feels like i’m the only emotional one in this household but I always get made fun of for crying or even just being human. everyone acts like a robot. there’s so much more but this is the main stuff i can fit, i’m just tired and drained. i really don’t want them to find this so i’m using a throwaway."

751,It's getting much worse,I just told my mom about my dpdr and since then it's getting much worse. Everyone including me feels so empty. Nothing feels real. I feel like I am going crazy and death is only solution. I can't feel my emotions. I suffer from dpdr for a long time but last few weeks were realy bad and I am scared that it will get much worse and I will lose my last conection to reality.
752,Like a brickwall when you try to talk to people,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a 28yo guy who most people would qualify as introvert. Although I'm I can enjoy being by myself at times, I sometimes get very frustrated and annoyed at myself when social situation occurs and I feel I'm missing out a bit at having an as developed social life as I'd wished. I would like to engage people in conversation, but for a starter it does not come naturally, it is quite often that I have nothing to say, idea/words just do not come to my mind but even if I have something to say, it is often like I'm imprisoned in between 4 brickwalls, and the more I try hit against it to get through it and start talking, the thicker it gets and the desperately harder it becomes. Sometimes I manage to say something despite it, but by the time I manage to produce sounds, it is after so much efforts and under so much pressure that I often say things completely stupid/weird which makes me pass for a weirdo, and I end up regretting that I talked at all.

 I notice this happens even more (intensely) with people of interest i.e. girls i'm interested in or for  important person I should network with for work related reasons. And as well the only times when I really felt free from this walls, able to be the my full self, with ideas and words flowing freely is when i'm on MDMA. Although be assured, I'm aware drugs are not sustainable way to deal with this issue long term.

I'm starting to wonder if it is not a sign of a form of anxiety, but it's hard for me to tell, as I have no point of comparison but myself. And despite this, I've managed to be good at studying and professionally, although on the friend level it's not the greatest and on the dating level I've definitively missed out so much because of my ""paralysis"".

I was wondering if other people had experienced the same kind of feelings, and if yes, if they have somehow succeeded to manage it, break the pattern and if so how. Thanks for your help!"
753,Too many things!,"Been married for 5 years things started going south after 1 year or so. I am to blame for a lot but have tried counseling, online resources, church, etc multiple times, marriage counseling which partner refused to continue after two visits. Counselor said I have a form of PTSD and major depression disorder. 

I was bullied in school and learned to overcome it, had anger issues also which I also dealt with. The last three years has been absolutely horrible. Many many fights, anger, rage, attempts to resolve things or get out of the situation. Here I am again attempting to make it work and have been doing better then previous but my partner continues to name call (pretty bad stuff), response to things i say is that's cute, degrade my attempts to do better, etc. Last night and today I snapped big time which I havent done for a long time. I am miserable, unhappy, majorly depressed and not able to have space in the home to just be by myself to unwind, think, etc. I am losing my ming again and i hate it. I am again lost and don't know what to do. I try so hard and never feel I make any positive ground in any aspect of this."

756,So much anxiety...,"Today is my cousin’s birthday. I want to tell him ‘Happy Birthday’, but I fear he will be angry with me or want to spend time with me.

1. I think he will be angry with me because I never go over there to spend time with him.

2. I don’t really know that side of the family very well. It’s not that I don’t want to hangout with them, but I feel awkward I never know what to say when I’m over there and I feel like they are judging me. They probably aren’t, but I cannot stop the thought that they are.

I hate this shit so much! I just want to be ‘normal’ for once. It shouldn’t be this difficult to tell someone ‘happy birthday’ or see them every once in a while."
757,"I'm so overwhelmed, i just can't anymore"," I'm so overwhelmed and sad, that I can't do my homework and the due is getting very close, I can't, I'm so sacred to fail again I just finished crying and I feel like crying again, I hate how many I'm trying not to fail but every time I do that I end up failing and my parents don't see it I get it he wanted me to be the best but that isn't helping they're just putting more stress on me then helping me, I just can't any more I'm just feeling that stress is getting on my head and fucking me mentally more and more, I don't want to feel again I'm really tried, I will never be enough and I'll never be loved or find someone who will love me, I'm nothing no one would care if I disappeared I'll be forgotten"
758,Tried cutting myself for the first time,"Everyday I wake up and just feel numb. I have nothing to look forward to. I had to move to Ireland back in March. I didn't want to, but I had no choice, so I just had to make the best of the situation. 

Immediately after I moved here, lockdown hit and I was stuck at home for months doing nothing, just wasting the days away. Eventually I started at a new high school and failed at making any friends. I just couldn't talk to people. The year I'm in is basically a doss year, we don't do anything, but I still find it stressful. As soon as I walk in the door in the morning I feel an overwhelming rush of anxiety and stress, the only thing I think about is how I wish I were elsewhere.  It gets worse and worse each week, I spend everyday alone. I'm stuck here in the middle of nowhere for another two and a half years at least, the thought of that brought me some comfort in the beginning, but now it just feels like an eternity.

With all the terrible things happening in the world that you see on the news, I gradually started thinking that the entire world was an awful place. You just see and hear about so many awful things that it wears on you. I kinda just stopped caring about anything. I just realized that the world was filled with awful people and things.

Then one day I thought about cutting myself but distracted myself from the thought. But then I thought about it the next day, and then the next, I thought about it more and more. Until today, when I actually did it. 

I keep thinking about whether life is worth living, I just don't care anymore."

763,can't deal with it anymore,"idk guys

I really can't do this anymore.

I feel as if i'm a disappointment to the world and it seems as if no one even cares about me. Even my own mother doesn't care. All she does now is mumble mean stuff about me, hoping that I won't be able to live my dream because she couldn't and now she's jealous.

I used to be good at school, but now everything seems so difficult and no one will help me. They're only telling me that it will be much worse next year (since I'll be going to the conservatory then).

I can't even describe everything that's going on. My head is a mess, everything's a mess.

766,Questions I have for people without OCD,"Hi! Ive had severe, hygiene related ocd for almost three years now so my hygiene routines (/”rituals”) are hyperspecific to the point where I genuinely cant remember how I did them before I had ocd. dunno if anyones gonna answer to this but Ive compiled a list of questions I have for people who dont suffer from ocd. This is not a research study, I’m asking out of personal curiousity to hopefully gain some perspective; also, if you have ocd (relating to hygiene) this may be triggering for u obviously, proceed w caution pls!

1. How long does it take for u to shower, on average?
2. Do u have a specific order of which parts u wash while washing ur hands/showering (for example, must wash hair before washing armpits)?
3. How often do you clean your shower, as in the tap/faucet and stuff?
4. What should a basic, weekly cleanup of a bathroom include, in your opinion?

Hopefully this isnt against any rules and if someone actually responds... thank u. lmao"
767,How do you know if it’s time to change therapists?,"I have one I like, been with them for two years at least, but I feel like I’m stagnating... I know the pandemic has made it worse and tele-therapy isn’t as effective for me. But how do I know if I could get more from another therapist? I’ve seen two others once each during the past two years when my usual therapist was on vacation, didn’t like them but maybe I didn’t give them a chance? I have specific needs (adhd that went undiagnosed my whole life and morphed into co-morbid adhd/anxiety/depression/rejection sensitive dysphoria as shit snowballed and I kept being put on ineffective meds that exacerbated certain symptoms and made it harder for the psychiatrist to know what was causing what). I want someone who can address those needs. I like my therapist though, like a security blanket. But it’s expensive as hell and I need to progress to justify that expense (and to achieve happiness/mental wellbeing/balance). 

Anyone got some advice?"
768,Mental breakdowns frequent and severe with period,I made my boyfriend lunch and he wanted to eat chips that smell really bad. I said something like “Noo those chips are gross don’t eat those” and he said “fine I won’t eat anything” and put his food down and won’t eat it. I flipped out. Instant 180. I screamed and cried and beat my head with my fist and ran off to the bathroom so I wouldn’t bother him. I don’t know what to do. I cooled down in the bathroom and I feel fine again. This usually only happens if something really really bad happens but when I’m about to get my period it’s so much worse and almost unpredictable. I have big bumps on both sides of my head. How can I stop
769,Deteriorating mental health.,I am sorry to bother any one here but i just want help.i have been suffering from anxiety since the start of the virus outbreak. i no longer have motivation nor have fun. i cant start new things because of the fear of my death. most of my fear is about electricity and health issues yet most of them are irrational yet even knowing that i still cant shake them off. i even start to suspect my family spying on me and being afraid that my devices are somehow  being used to spy on me to the point of installing linux on a live usb and using custom roms for my phone. and as of recently i have been seeing things move at the corner of my eye and hear people calling me or ringing the door bell yet there was no one there and it happens at least once or twice a day. and sadly i cant even contact professionals for many reasons. please i just want to enjoy things again.
770,An update on my son's panic issue,"Last week I posted in this sub about the conversation I had had with my son about the panic attack he'd had while while we talked on our weekly podcast. The feedback I received was not only amazing, it was extremely reassuring for me as a father. As a lot of you probably know, being a parent is a job that comes without instructions, and we are always questioning whether we are doing a good job or not, whether our decisions are affecting our children positively. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all your heartfelt comments meant the world to me

After we recorded the podcast, he kept having some issues with anxiety. A couple of times he began to panic and think that he was getting sick, or that something was wrong with him. I stayed up with him throughout the night on Saturday to make sure he didn't feel alone. The next day I made an appointment for us to go to go to a sensory deprivation tank, which has worked for me in the past in reducing anxious thoughts. He loved it and it really seemed to help. The rest of the week we took it easy, and discussed going to a therapist. He agreed. He has been doing much better since then. 

We ended up recording our following podcast a couple of days later, and we discussed the float tank and some of the reasons for his anxiety, in a lighthearted way, trying to seek answers, not to judge or offend. If this can help you or someone that you know, please feel free to share it them. Thanks again for all the love!!!

Know what you think!

772,Looking forward to just let some things out.,"So, the past few weeks have been weird, some times anxiety filled, sometimes good, sometime just frustrating. I feel like there are things in the past that somehow keep affecting me in ways I had not realised, its only now that I understand it some what, or maybe not, I am not sure. And recently something happened that has been bothering me on and off, and I don't think I can talk to someone that I know about it, so maybe just letting these things out to a stranger might help feel better, maybe. That's why this post."
773,In a loop,"Hi everyone I’m a 16 year old male and ever since June I have gone through periods of extreme mood swings of extreme happiness and highs one day, and extreme lows of with self doubt, low self esteem and confidence, self hatred, suicidal thoughts, and anger. Also, ever since June I have had terrible sleep, I wake up several times throughout the night mainly due to nightmares. I don’t want to self diagnose myself either. Honestly I feel like I don’t have any solutions left and I’m just tired of feeling like this."
774,How do stop seeing everyone who wants to get close to me as a potential abuser with bad intents?,"The title says it all. I grew up in an abusive household, things are getting better and everyone in my family is getting help (even the one who's abused) to stop this cycle. But I can't stop seeing everyone that even talks to me someone who can abuse me. So I don't get close to people and get paranoid."
775,I hate my brainnnnnnn,"Do you know those moments where you have a thought and then you go to do that thing and completely forget? That feels like me everyday. Going out in the morning, ""feels like I'm missing something but I can't tell"" five hours later, bam you forgot your keys and no one is home, now you have to climb through the window! Found something interesting and want to research it? Well you opened Google and now that thought is completely gone and never coming back my friend. I feel like I'm just dumb now, I used to be able to read books for hours and now I can barely read a full paragraph without getting bored or not taking it in and having to reread the entire page for the third time. I nearly got hit by a damn bus the other day because I was that zoned out and I'm gonna fail my classes unless I can actually focus."

My partner(21m) and I haven’t been having regular sex now for around 3-4 months &amp; although I’ve tried to explain to him the side effects of my antidepressants, he thinks it’s because I don’t find him attractive or that I don’t want to sleep with him, when I really do.

Has anyone got any tips, or anything I can try to up my sex drive, absolutely anything? I’m willing to try anything as I’m sick of my partner and I feeling this way..."

im so, so so fucking tired. i dont want to feel this anymore. i have multiple anxiety attacks a day, some are silent. i lay completely still and stare at the ceiling and i cant move because its just so crippling and scary and horrible it feels like im going to explode. im afraid of myself im afraid im going to take every med i have when i have my attacks

779,"I should probably see a professional, but I’m hesitant to be medicated again (Trigger Warning)","So, I’m in my mid-twenties and after taking a hard look at my life over the past ten years, I’ve come to realize that I’m not “normal” and that I’ve spent the vast majority of my time mentally unwell. There’s a cyclical nature to my moods and whenever I manage to get out of the fog, I have the tendency to convince myself that it’s finally over and I’m completely normal, yet there’s a continuation of a pattern in my life that I simply can’t ignore anymore. 

I was treated for dysthymia when I was 18, and tried an anti-depressant that seemed to make me self-destructive at a level I couldn’t have imagined. I’m a naturally squeamish person, yet began slicing up my arms and legs. I ceased taking the medication shortly thereafter and tried a few others that either had no positive effect or made me feel like a zombie. 

I haven’t been able to hold down jobs for very long, spent the vast majority of last winter in bed, etc. I honestly don’t know where I’m going with this, I just really want to be healthy again. I’ve noticed that I’m less dysthymic these days in that I feel pretty well when I’m well, but the rebound depression is more intense than what I experienced in the past."

All I want to do is pace the room and scream, I'm uncomfortable in my skin and my mind, and it's taking everything in me to not let it take over. I'm not going to hurt myself, that's not a risk, but I want to pack up and run.. I don't trust anybody, I feel like my boyfriend is lying at every turn, even though I know he probably isn't. I'm a prisoner in my own insecurities and paranoia. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to turn, I want to ask for support but I dont know what for, or who to ask.. I feel like I'm constantly chasing my tail, never moving forward, never moving anywhere.. I'm stuck, and I feel like I'm a failure..

I don't really have a question.. I just needed to let this out somewhere without someone arguing or trying to one up me.. I'm done.."
781,Thinking of leaving,"I’m not in any immediate danger so don’t stress but I am thinking of heading out. Being alive in this world just isn’t for me anymore, I grabbed a handful of Tylenol from the cabinet earlier but I’m obese so I don’t think it would actually take me out unless I grab some more, I was doing some research and it seems like if you try to over dose on Tylenol it’s take hours though because your liver shuts down that’s probably why I’m hesitating. I don’t know things are just really weird right now and I don’t know what to do there’s no reason for me to stay here and continue to make the people around me miserable I just wish I could make a quick exit and have people not notice"
782,I don't know the words,"I'm tired 

I'm exhausted, living is exhausting and death is terrifying I've considered suicide for a while now and everytime i try to act on any of it i stop to think of everyone who would be distraught and everytime i have froze like a dear in headlights and just hold it in for longer. The more it builds up i just get a stronger push to commit to it the next time and more and more lately i feel i should tell someone.

I don't want live i don't want die i just want to be in a coma at this point. I don't want to hurt anyone i love but i don't know how long I can bite my tongue anymore.

783,First Time talking to a doctor. Where should you even start?,"Next Week I have a appointment because I want to talk about some issues that I have for several years. Its like my normal doctor not a therapist. I already regret calling there because its just so terrifying to even think about talking to him on Tuesday before work. Struggle with extreme Mood Swings for several years, feeling nervous all the time, having extreme Up and Downs all the time. Not for longer episodes, only shorter time. Changing for small or no reasons at all. My Thoughts are so chaotic; I have trouble to focus or think about something in an objective way. Its getting worse and I am barely able to get trough my work. There is so much mental pressure that I feel trough those chaotic thoughts and emotions and its so hard to stay calm on the outside. I have a past of self harm since my Teens and only stopped around one year ago. Still have thoughts like this and even suicidal ones. So especially with that I don´t know if you should say this. I remember reading somewhere online that you shouldn´t say that, even if you get ask because they could get you in a hospital or something. I don´t have plans and I have them for so long that I am kind of used to it. Weird to say. No matter its just extreme and not ideal if you already have trouble with impulse behaviour.

 I am worried that he is not going to take me serious. That those mood swings are normal, hormones or whatever especially as a woman. I struggle so much with it and I am constantly worried to hurt someones on an impulse, to do something I regret. I often have times where I feel so upbeat, not really happy more like you are on drugs or something. I am such a shy person but at those times I talk a lot and say stuff without really thinking about. On other times I feel like I am the worst person ever, a lot of self hate, can´t do anything right, get extremely angry at other people for small reason. Really have to hold myself back to not scream at other people, stay nice at work or not just leaving in the middle of work. I don´t know how to do it, what to say on Tuesday. I am just so afraid that he is not going to take me serious, that its going to be so horrible. Its probably normal to be scared to get help for the first time? Just feel like I really need to finally change something."
784,I can’t get a grip,"I’m 18 years ild and lately I haven’t been myself. I haven’t been able to focus or think straight and I have been constantly losing concentration. No matter how hard I try I just can’t get a grip if myself and I’ve been feeling off. I’m not good at what I love anymore and I don’t enjoy it as much. My anxiety has started to spike whenever I try to do something because I’m afraid at being bad and losing. I can’t focus on games, reading, and I’ve been constantly hungry and just a total mess. This has been going on for weeks and I just can’t get a grip. Is there something wrong with me? And how do I get back to my normal self?"
785,I'd like to know if this is something to be worried about.,"To give some context I'm an 18 year old guy and have been a loner my entire life. By that I mean that I had absolutely zero friends my whole life and even though I had an ok relationship with my family I usually don't talk to them unless necessary. Basically this causes me to only say at most 30-50 words a week. Due to this my social skills are horrendous, but it gets worse since I end up stuttering quite a bit sometimes in the middle of saying a word I become physically incapable of finishing said word causing to just fake cough so I don't look any weirder.
Anyway because of this I have become very self conscious when I end up talking to someone and once I'm about to go to sleep I end crying myself to sleep because of how much I embarrassed myself in public. I'm even worried that people think I'm mentally retarded when I'm actually not."
786,Is it cowardly of me if I want someone else to kill me so I don’t have to.,I’m too scared.
787,5 Ways To Reverse Mental Exhaustion,"I've become more mentally exhausted since lockdown this year. Working full time, for people who don't give a shit only makes it worse.

This article has been quite relatable and has helped me with reversing the mental exhaustion I've experienced this year.

788,how do you talk about your emotions without crying?,"every time someone asks me a question about my mental health, i go to talk about it but i can’t stop myself from feeling the need to cry. it’s hard for me to be vulnerable and open up to people because for my whole life i’ve never really had anyone i could express everything to, so i’ve always had to keep it in. i’m afraid if i talk about myself i’ll seem self centered, conceited, and annoying so sometimes i just preferred to bottle it up. i want to tell someone everything but i can’t because i’m afraid to show emotion"
789,I’m just sad,"All the time I spent online today I spent posting about how sad I am that I will never be with my crush. And slowly I see what I’m actually upset about, that I managed to hide all day, from myself. 

My dad is going to leave tomorrow. He works abroad for 11 months sometimes. He usually visits us around three times. He left in January to go to Mali. We hadn’t seen him since, until he arrived home last Friday. But tomorrow, early in the morning, he will leave. He’ll return in January, completely. 

I mean, the fact that he will only leave for another three months calms me down very much. I already stopped crying. But then I start again, because I realize that he will be gone. That’s what I keep forgetting. He won’t be here. It hurts. At least he managed to be here on my 18th birthday on Wednesday, because I really didn’t think he would make it. I’m so grateful for that. Because he didn’t get to be here when I graduated from school. 

Damn, I don’t know if I should just calm down or keep crying. I still can’t realize he’ll leave again. When it comes to those things, I’m kind of numb. When my mum said he will make it to my birthday, I only realized he’s actually coming home when we were at the airport and I finally saw him. It’s the fifth time he had to work abroad, so… yeah. I’m used to it. 

One time things were so bad I had to cry in front of my cousin (she’s the person I respect most over everything and everyone, so that’s something I really avoid doing). This time the most I cried was when we were told he had to work abroad again, although he hasn’t even been home for a year yet. And when he left I cried. But when he was gone, my emotionality towards this kind of just turned off. 

Well. It’s kinda late and I don’t know what else to say. Goodnight everyone"

I feel like I’ve just made this all up and I’m just doing it for attention. Which I know I’m not but I keep thinking well what’s the point in doing this. I don’t know... I don’t know what to do :/"
792,Messaging App (thought experiment),"just for argument’s sake, let’s assume there is a new messaging app. it’s sole purpose, unlike its competitors (i.e. snapchat), is the mental health and well-being of its users. how does it accomplish this, and with what design and mechanics? apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this"
793,I'm losing my sanity.,"I seriously am empty. 

I try to convince my self that I'm normal and I'm just lazy and excusing my laziness with depression but I just have no motivation to do anything.

When I try to pay attention to a class it just takes so much energy. I feel like I'm suffocating. 
I don't even have motivation to type this post, or think about what I'm writing or the spelling or grammar or vocabulary of it. 

I don't have motivation to read and understand anything. I can read a paragraph like 10 times and I just don't understand it. 

I'm trying to do my homework but I just have absolutely no motivation. Thinking about doing it makes me depressed as fuck and suicidal. Yes, a piece of homework makes me suicidal. 

I've just fallen so hard into a hole of laziness that I can't get out of because of my laziness."
794,I can't trust mental health providers," I'm not in a great place right now. I feel like I'm failing in life and I have no friends. Even the things I used to be passionate about, I just can't seem to care about these days. I'm having suicidal thoughts pretty much on the daily. I went to see a general practitioner for constant fatigue and pretty much the only advice she gave me was to go to therapy for my depression. I know I need serious help right now but I'm way too scared to try seeing a therapist.

I've been Baker Acted twice, once when I was 15 (I'm almost 21 now) and then again a year ago. I'm not sure how mental facilities in the rest of the US are, but here in FL they're absolute nightmares. Both times I was told I'd only be there for 72 hours at most and both times that was a lie. The first time I was in a hospital I had a panic attack, and to calm me down the staff decided to get me a prescription for a sedative and then locked me in a room by myself until I stopped crying. Last year the staff in the hospital constantly belittled me and played weird mind games with me. I swear the doctor in charge of my treatment was actually a sadist. After he realized I'd get upset when he said I couldn't go home he started pausing after saying things he knew would upset me and looking at me like he was trying to watch my reaction, waiting for me to cry. I don't know if I explained that well but it felt pretty disgusting. I also found out after I got out that second time that they violated several of my rights in terms of allowing phone calls and consenting to treatment. Hospitals don’t help at all with mental health. It’s just this bizarre mind game where you always have to smile and laugh and pretend everything’s just perfect until they decide that you’re acting “normal” enough to gain the privilege of not being locked up like a rat in a cage. I still have nightmares and flashbacks about what happened to me in these places.

After both hospital trips, I’ve tried seeking out psychiatrists and therapists to help me get back on track. Through both my experiences in the hospitals and with outpatient doctors I must have interacted with dozens of psychiatrists, nurses, NPs, PAs, therapists, and counselors. I think there were one or two that I felt actually listened to me, tried to be compassionate, and were any good at their jobs. I'm so sick of trying to put my faith in somebody who’s supposed to help me improve myself, only to be treated like garbage and just feel even worse than when I first got there. I’ve had psychiatrists unapologetically laugh in my face when I tried to explain how I feel. I want help so bad, but I just can’t trust anybody to give it to me.

One of the things that scares me the most about potentially going to see a therapist is the idea that if I say one wrong thing about having suicidal thoughts, they’ll cart me off to the mental hospital again. I just can’t go back to one of those places. Even though I’ve had suicidal thoughts, I don’t have a plan and I’d never act on them, in large part because I’m afraid of failing and then going to a hospital again. I’ve begged people not to send me to a hospital and told them it’ll just make me worse, but they don’t listen. I can’t be honest with my feelings or I might have to go back again. I can’t trust anyone and I’m so sad and depressed and scared. I don’t know what to do. I just want help.

If you’ve made it down here, thanks for reading what is undoubtedly a wall of text. Hope y’all are doing better than I am right now."
795,major trigger warning 🔞⚠️,"This may be really triggering for some people as it's about childhood  s*xual abuse, I really dont want to hurt anybody so please if you feel uncomfortable, please dont read this. PLEASE DELETE IF NOT ALLOWED









As a child, I dont remember many times where I was alone with my dad. There was a couple times, all filled with him going on (heavily intoxicated) and either telling me that I was his favorite child, or that he hated me and wished I was never born. Always either showering me with love, or treating me like garbage

I dont remember being completely alone with him, which scares me because my mom was always telling me that he was always taking me places without my brother and sister. Usually the beach or river

As a freakishly young child, I was always really hypersexual. I was 7 years old, maybe even younger, staying up all night and watching porn to get off. Its terrifying to me that I even knew what it was, or knew what to do. Around this time, I had some major behavioral issues. That's whenever I started harming myself, starving myself, doing alot of self destructive things. I regularly told my mom I wanted to die, and I do remember trying a couple times. My mom never took me to see a doctor about any of this behavior, as she was afraid that they would take me and my brothers away. 

That's another thing that scares me. Was she afraid I'd say something? Something that she knows, and I dont? 

I recently tested her, and told her that I didn't remember alot of my childhood. I asked her if we went on a trip to North Carolina, to go see some zoo. This never happened, we were poor and could barely afford our power bill. She said we did, and that I had a blast. She made it sound like we were a perfect better homes family, and everything was some kind of happy ending fairy tale. I did this to see if maybe she'd try to convince me that I did remember my child hood, and that I would have remembered if something happened to me
 
She regularly makes up things that happened to try and fill in the gaps of things I don't remember, or convince me that my child hood was perfect. My siblings have told me multiple times she was lying about half of the things that supposedly happened

Nowadays, whenever my dad's in the room, despite logically having ""nothing"" to be afraid of, my brain shatters into a panic whenever he's around. I get such a level of anxiety that I can't breath. 

I just wanna know what's wrong with me, does this seem to be something I should be worried about? Should I just leave it alone and be grateful that I can't remember if something happened? 

I wanna find a way to remember, so I can move on. The past couple years, my life has been nothing but hypersexuality, drugs, alcohol and self destructive behavior in an attempt to get this weight off my chest. I don't even know what the weight is, but I feel like if I did, then I could work through it and move on. I just feel stuck, all the time. Constantly I feel like I can't move forward in life because I run into this brick wall of fear, like whatever happened is holding me back. 

I can't have a healthy relationship with sex, eating, self love, none of the things that you think would make a person happy. They all just make me anxious. I just wanna find out what it is, beat it, and move along."
796,I need advice on a family member's mental health,"I (35F) have a younger sibling (33F) who is struggling with a plethora of issues and is now violent. She suffered a spinal injury five-six years ago and became heavily dependent on smoking hash to relieve the pain. Over the last three years, however, she's started blaming others for all her issues. First it was our mother who, I know, was abusive while we were younger as she herself was going through the loss of her husband, our father, at a young age. She has always been rude towards everyone but it's gotten worse and worse. 
 Earlier this year, she said she felt paranoid around all the family and it was stemming from her past life experiences that she remembers. She became obsessed with watching WWII documentaries and movies, going so far as to say she was the wife of a holocaust survivor and she remembers her time in the camps. And now, over the last three months or so, her anger has been directed towards me. She has decided that I raped her, and took food out of her mouth as a child, which just completely blanks my brain. She knows I've suffered sexual assault and she uses that to tell me that I'm the one who rapes and not the one who got raped. She says horribly vile things with such conviction and two days ago, she physically assaulted me badly. My mother refuses to get help because she's worried about what people will say (Asian society). I am at my wit's end because i am financially dependent on my mother and I don't know how to get her help. She refuses to believe that there's anything wrong with her and that her entire family is against her. It is taking a toll on all of us; we walk on eggshells around the house and it's effecting our mental health as well. Please advise. What do I do? We live in New Delhi, India."
797,How should I deal with my older brother?,"Hello, I'm just posting here to get some advice about my brother. He's 29 and I'm 26. 
My family and I are a little worried about his mental health.

I'll give some background. My brother only left home once when he was 18 for a few months to go to college. He studied a science course but couldn't manage it academically. Perhaps he was to young to be by himself but he's never tried to move out again. He's lived with my parents ever since. He has shown very little interest in pursuing any education but my parents almost forced him to get a degree in a community college here just because if it was up to him he would do nothing at all. He complains a lot about his lack of employment, a relationship, the fact that he has no friends outside of immediate family but he makes only feeble attempts to fix his situation. 

He has always been absent minded but it seems to be getting worse. For example he likes to drink tea, so he'll make a cup, maybe drink some then forget he made it and make another. This leads to sometimes 5 or 6 cups of tea lying around not even touched. It's a small thing but it just strikes me as very strange. He can never remember his phone number, always loses his phone and needs help recovering his passwords for things all the time. I find this frustrating sometimes because in my mind it can seem like he's being lazy in a way. Believing everybody around him will fix his problems. My mum does his washing and I feel like this is doing him a real disservice because he just isn't developing any survival techniques. 

He can seem very emotionally distant. This is something people would notice when we were in school. People would usually interpret this as unfriendliness. He also has painful social anxiety. The sort where when I'm with him in town and he's talking to someone he doesn't know where to look or where to put his hands etc. 

He has a degree in Digital Media and is looking for work in that field, but as awful as this is to say, he isn't ompetent with the things you would need to be to find employment in that. And he refuses to get anymore education or training meaning that he'll basically only be able to do minimum wage jobs, but he keeps failing the basic aptitude tests to get in, even though I don't believe that he's unintelligent.

Another thing worth mentioning. My oldest brother, 44, who's married with kids and has a stable well paying job in the city invited him over a few years ago to find work and get on his feet. He was living there for a few months, he would say he would go to interviews but never did and here's where it gets really weird. While living with them I guess he left his computer on and my sister in law finds that he's trying to become some kind of online porn star with his webcam. Totally inappropriate while you're living rent free and with a family with young children. He's had sexual hangups which have confused us now for years. All I've been told is that he somehow damaged his nether region years ago and is somehow impotent or something.
He's got an obsession with some very bizarre genital modifications too.

I just want him to be happy and functional. But I have no idea how to approach him about it. Any advice is really appreciated!"

800,Help me cut my brother out of my life!!,"Okay, I'm 16, turning 17 next month and I'm currently living at home with my parents, younger brother and younger sister.

I need to cut one of my older brothers out of my life completely because he is homophobic, transphobic (I'm gay and trans lol), racist, antivaxxer kinda, misogynistic, literally everything and  can't do that anymore, especially with Covid and I'm just wondering how I should break it off with him. 

Shall I tell him that if he doesn't stop ranting about how gays are bad, how black people are trying to take over, how muslims are all terrorists, how trans people aren't trans and that they are lady-boys or boy-ladies or whatever he says?
Or
Should I just tell him to get lost and if he ever wants to talk to me again, it won't be happening?


Also, I have to make the decision to cut my niece out of my life as well cause it's my brothers kid, obviously. I just don't know how to get around it because I fucking hate my brother but, at the same time, he's got my niece and I don't know... 
Please someone help, I don't know what to do but I don't want to have my existence be reminded as being wrong every two minutes when I see him."
801,An online friend of mine needs help (tw//death),"I have an online friend that I met because of a twitch streamer. I don't know much about them in real life, but they came to me for help because multiple members of their family have passed away recently. I don't know how to help them or what to say to them because I've never been in that situation and also don't know much about their real life situations. They said they don't have anyone in person to talk to and I really want to be there for them. I'm worried of saying the wrong thing, so I came to reddit to see if people can give me some advice on how to go about this situation."
802,Why is the world continuously slapping me,"Ever since I remember myself I always was the kind of guy that would get hit in every single situation. I was always the center of mockery at elementary school, middle school and still am at high school. Even in everyday scenarios, Id have strangers try to irritate me, insult me and ridicule me. Eg 3 days ago I was at an ice cream shop and a bunch of guys just went and told me ironically: ""hey big boy lemme tell you something"". They were about my age. Today, 2 dudes on a motorcycle were passing by when I was at the sidewalk trying to cross the road and the passenger just says ""hey"" and they give me the middle finger. No previous contact or relation to me at all. I am continuously made fun of and ridiculed when Im just trying to be nice to everyone. There hasnt been one person in my entire life taht I didnt try to be nice to, even if I found them kind of off at first glance. Om the other hand everyone at school makes fun of me. My life is literally hell and I cannot do anything about it. My mother prevents me from taking self defense lessons, because if the fact that ""Ill not use them wisely"". Im so tired of being alone and having no one feel like me. Even in my friend group Im the guy that is constantly made fun of. My best friend who once was ny best company found a girlfriend and Im alone yet again, while inside my friend group there is a kid that has been bullying me for 7 years. Im so tired of living in this hell"
803,I don’t know what I’m feeling,"I haven’t felt like myself for a few weeks now and I have no real reason for feeling like this just super super down and normally when I’m like this I can snap out of it especially when I hang out with my friends. Recently I feel uncomfortable with my own friend group and like I don’t belong with anyone and have nobody to talk to even though I know logically I do . Nothing has happened to me, my home life is fine other than my brother moved away and I feel lonely in the house alone with my parents sometimes. I feel guilty for feeling so down all the time because nothing bad has happened to me and when friends ask me to talk about it I say I can’t because there’s nothing to say? I just feel really upset and not myself and don’t know what to do about it. I can’t even cry I’ve tried I feel more numb than anything, I started burning myself with cigarettes to try and deal with this strange feeling but after I feel like I’m being dramatic because nothing is wrong with me at all. I don’t know how to get rid of this feeling and go back to normal it’s taking over my school life and making me quiet and sad in school and not just at home like it normally was. It sounds stupid but I feel as if I’m being over dramatic when I try explain my feelings to someone because I’ve never experienced any trauma and nothing bad has ever really happened to me."
804,I want bad things to happen to me,"TW

I am a 15yo person w/ OCD, GAD and I am autistic. I likely also have PTSD, AvPD, PPD and Social Anxiety Disorder. I self harm. I have therapy and a psychiatrist and I take fluoxetine daily.

I often have thoughts of being beaten up, assaulted, attacked, stabbed or sometimes even sexually assaulted and I don’t know why. When the injurious thoughts are not about sexual assault, I actually find some sort of solace in imagining myself injured. But when they are about being assaulted like that, I feel disconnected and empty. I feel like I need more trauma to “count” as being traumatised if that makes sense. I don‘t feel like what happened to me was “enough”. But the thoughts unrelated to sexual assault - I cannot explain why I find peace in the idea of people stabbing me or beating me up.

These thoughts are almost debilitating. I am always thinking about some stranger bursting into my classroom and holding a knife to my throat or stabbing me in my stomach. I never die in these scenarios - I am always somehow invincible or immortal or unable to die from my wounds, so I do not think that this is passive suicidal ideation. 

I don’t know how to tell me therapist this either."

808,How to best help a family member with an Eating Disorder?,"Hey all,

So I have become fairly close to my niece (15f) over the several months (gay uncle here so we vibe) and last night she confessed to me via text that she has been binging. She says she will binge then not eat for some time (maybe even days though I am not sure). She also confessed that she has been having some pretty severe anxiety to the point of shaking (how she described it) and I need advice about how to help.

I have been trained as a crisis worker so I am aware enough to know how to talk with her, not push her away, and intervene with her immediate family if I feel she is in danger. Right now though I don't want to involve my sister though in order to respect my niece's privacy. The kicker is that I know my sister used to struggle with bulimia which I vaguely hinted at with my niece but she was unaware so I didn't go into any detail beyond the fact she had an ED in the past.

My question to everyone here is what do you think would be the most effective intervention from my point in the relationship? I have thought about sending over some resources but don't quite know where to start on ones relating to EDs. I am also very ignorant on the subject in general, does her saying she binges potentially imply that she purges as well? Are those two things often correlated or do they often exist separately? I recently saw my niece in person and she does not appear to be under or overweight (from a very untrained eye).

Any and all help/advice would be greatly appreciated."
809,A question I need answers to,"How can you have a healthy relationship without preparing for betrayal. Is there really something called unconditional love? Everyone has their demands to a certain degree, and they also have their limits. They're prepared to leave you always and vice versa. 

How do you honestly have a real relationship without preparing for a possible betrayal, and is there anything really called unconditional love?"
810,*that escalated quickly*,"When a particular inciting moment occurs, something mundane and rather usual, my thoughts, sometimes, jump to extremely unlikely and somewhat dark conclusions. Sometimes, not all the time. For example, I’m lying awake in bed at night. I hear a soft creaking sound coming from the corridor, at the end of which lies the front door. I automatically think, ‘Oh, there must be an intruder. *le gasp*’

Or there was this other time at the supermarket, I was just standing around waiting for my dad, who was doing something. I had my mask on and I dropped my glasses while adjusting it. I had to carry them for the rest of the time we were there because I didn’t have the case on me and I was basically just kind of uneasy and wanting to get the shopping over and done with and then I pondered the possibility of someone sneaking up behind me and grabbing me.

I know what you’re thinking. But in fact, these thoughts don’t really bother me. It’s just the fact that I have them that’s kind of emotionally inconvenient I guess or something, like I don’t actually think these things are gonna happen or whatever just— idk why I’m posting this but I thought I’d just do it idk. I guess my previous post on this subreddit is kind of more important but whatever byee"
811,Imposter syndrome when coming to terms with depression &amp; BPD. Anyone else?,"Has this happened to anyone else? I always seem to get a sense of imposter syndrome when I'm coming to terms with my mental health. 

It happened too with depression. I spent years of self harm &amp; suicidal thoughts thinking I was just being dramatic. Even though I never told anyone about my feelings, I felt like I was lying to myself and just being dramatic? 

Then I went to therapy about a year ago after a very difficult night. The night itself is pretty hazy, I don't exactly remember what triggered it but I remember hurting myself with a knife, getting high &amp; then driving around at the middle of the night (completely reckless and selfish I know). Then I found a hotel a few hours away from home and stayed there. I really thought that was going to be the night I ended it all. I'm sure I spent hours on the floor staring at the walls in this hotel. I managed to snap out of the haze and finally decided to arrange to see a therapist. After a few sessions with her it became so obvious, I wasn't 'faking' anything. I was actually depressed. It was hard to that admit to myself and even harder to talk to her about it. 

She did help me a lot with my anxiety issues and things but I never told her the entire truth about why I was there. But as I opened up a little bit it was clear the issues I had were 'real'. Still no one knows about them, yet I still feel like an imposter? Even though I have memories, scars and regrets to remind me that I'm really not okay, why is it still so hard to accept? 

The possibility of being bi-polar has been on my mind for a few years. But again I thought I was being dramatic and just feeling the same as everyone else does. But as I started to notice patterns or see a 'shift' in the way I feel, act and perceive things. It made me wonder more and more that perhaps this is more than just depression &amp; anxiety. 

Honestly I don't know what to do about it. In a world where although mental illness is being destigmatized, it's also been blown up with words like 'depression', 'bipolar', 'OCD' used as casual descriptions rather than diagnoses. I think personally I use this change in perception as a way to keep denying the real issues I have. I know I don't want to admit I have anything 'wrong' with me. If I do then I have to move to the next step of facing my issues and starting the journey to fix myself. I was on Zoloft for around 4 months before I just stopped taking them (why? I honestly don't know. I can't remember why I stopped even though it was only a few months ago).

 It's just really hard always being at war with my own mind. Forgetting, denying, ignoring. If I can't even trust myself to believe these problems then how can I trust anyone else? 

Maybe I'm just blabbering on because it's 2am and I can't sleep."
812,I feel suffocated,"I’m a 20 year old male and I’m depressed. I feel like I’ve been depressed for a long time but haven’t admitted it. I ask myself why and half the time I don’t even know the answer, I have high hopes for the future, I’m working really hard to achieve my dreams, and I would say my life is going at a fast pace but I have no one to share it with, no one to support me at my lowest or share my happiness when I’m at my highest. Unlike those around me, I have no support system. I give a lot of support to the people I love but I feel it’s one sided, I feel like no one cares about what I do, why I do, how I do, and mostly importantly how I feel. Whenever I reach out to someone and express how I feel (which is hard to explain), my problems aren’t valued and I come across as weak and incompetent, when in fact I know I’m strong and competent, so I choose to bottle it up (not sure if that means I’m emotionally immature). I don’t want to talk to someone who can help me understand my problems (therapist), I want someone to genuinely care about my problems, and to ease this weight unconditionally.

To put it in short, I developed attachment issues to my mother. She worked for long hours and I was under extreme stress and pain. I’m the eldest girl and I can’t even fathom showing my younger siblings any of what I’m going through. I just need help and I need it soon.

I really wanna die but don’t want others to care, so scared of growing up and not having a good life. Along with this I feel really selfish as I’m quite well off as it goes I live in a safe area in the UK in a nice house with parents that are still together. Just wandering if I should do anything. Thank you for your time. :)"
816,I felt like a spectator,"Hello, I'm just venting.

For context, in my country the COVID situation is very bad, specially in the capital, the city where I study. Today, I moved there because I couldn't continue with online classes, I have to physically go to class. I've been very anxious about it. 

But this is about something that happened when one of my five flat mates texted me if I wanted to have dinner with them and a couple of friends in the living room. I don't usually accept, but I didn't want to be rude and it was only dinner, I guessed it would be ok, so I agreed.

Half hour in and they were partying. If my anxiety wasn't high enough, it got worse because I'm a very socially awkward person (sometimes I wonder if I am asocial, I also fit so well in the autistic spectrum, never diagnosed as such, but that's another story). I couldn't talk to them except very basic words, I just smiled and nodded. I started feeling dizzy, my heart was beating so fast, I got a headache and everything became confusing. I couldn't even form real sentences in the texts I was sending to my friend. They told me I was having like an adrenaline peak (or something like that) because I wasn't having a panic attack, but I was on edge for a very long time.

For a moment, I felt like I was watching a scene from a film and I wasn't there, I didn't feel like I was physically there. It's so weird, I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that. At least that I remember.

I wasn't able to communicate. I somehow owe money for a pizza to some guy I don't know and I wasn't able to ask him if I could giving him the cash instead of sending it online. My flatmates tried to make me dance and drink, and I just stood there. This sounds odd, but I could only watch them dance, watch the colorful lights and that's it.

Finally, my mind went to a different place. Suddenly I felt sad and wanted to cry. They wouldn't leave me go, I just ""locked"" myself in my room (I don't have keys, my landlady forgot and I can't leave the house or lock my door). My head hurts like hell now, but my anxiety isn't there anymore.

817,Is it normal to still be upset after an ended friendship longer than the friendship actually existed?,"Sorry if the title is confusing. What I mean is that I was friends with this person for X months, and it’s now been X+1 months since they decided to end it. I feel like this person impacted my life a lot and I associate the most ridiculous and tiny things with them. Is it normal or bad that I still think about them for hours literally every day? Keep in mind X was a relatively small number so I feel like I should be able to move on, but I cant at all. I miss them so much and I think it’s making me depressed honestly."

822,Would you describe this as being a panic attack of some sort?,"This was much more prominent when my attachment issues were at their peak. I would often times get jelly legs (feeling as though my legs were actual jello and had no bones), have Arctic levels of coldness throughout my body, completely dry body but extremely sweaty palms, dizziness, sometimes hearing goes in and out, feels like a heart attack (as if I will ), and my breathing become extremely out of wack or irregular breathing patterns. At the time, I was very worried and had no idea what panic attacks or anxiety was. I know it sounds silly to ask because it might sound obvious but I’m honestly quiet confused. I am a paranoid person who struggles with overall feelings of emptiness. I honestly don’t know how to describe it, emptiness doesn’t encapsulate it."
823,"Anxiety, depression and productivity","Does anyone else feel like they can’t deal with schoolwork anymore? I constantly feel overwhelmed just thinking about all the things i have to do to the point where i just distract myself to avoid them without even attempting to start them.

824,it's never enough,godddddd no matter what i dp it's always the same shit. ppl will always hate me and im always going to be a dysfunctional mess. living is literally just torture. this is so fucking stupid i dont even know what i want
825,"I'm done, sad and fed up. I don't know what else to say","Im just done, i don't know how to put it, i just hate my life and i feel like such a fuck up.
I never thought my life would go like this, single, hate my job, hate my home, basically hate my life most days.

I wake up dreading to go to work and once im there if feel like I'm mad/pissed off all day, its gotten to the point where the office people at work noticed and said I havent been my self lately. I used to always be the joker, that funny one, now i just mad and fed up with it. Once I go home I basically do nothing until work the next day, play video games is about it and think about the past. I thought I would have moved out by now but i can't because it too expensive and I'm afraid to be alone all the time.
I look back on past relationships and I was so happy, now im just sad. They all moved on are basically forgot about me and I'm still so fucking hurt inside I'll cry sometimes, some man i am. The whole dating world is so broken nowadays, just swipe until you find a match, too bad it doesn't work. Everyone jokes about it ""did you try tinder?"", yes i tried tinder, bumble, pof, amost all of them, none seem to have any results or are just full of fake profiles. Part of me says I should message my ex's and at least get some closure, even tho it has been years since I've talked, all of them except my last one cheated on me, even my high-school GF of 3 years, never talked since the day she left
I feel like everyone in my famly won't understand, they think I it good, but they just don't get it. I just don't know what to do anymore, feels like my life fell apart around me and I didn't realize until it was too late."
826,why do i feel normal,"when im down and suicidal for no reason it feels 100% reasonable, when im paranoid it feels reasonable, when im chaotic and destructive it feels reasonable. people have said i act erratic or abnormal but i don't see it. i think everything i do makes sense and i have no idea why people are the way they are.... im abnormal.... but im not lol"

828,How can I find happiness within myself?," 

I(f18) feel like I'm only ever really happy around one person(m18). We've been together for over two years and the first few months felt like heaven to me. I got used to him being there for me all the time and always being by my side, however, over the course he has been enjoying his own life and I've realized that he can't always be that person for me He has his own life, a job, and his own friends and I'm so grateful that he does his absolute best to balance time for our relationship between that. On the other hand, in my past relationships I've always been accustomed to having my s/o as my only friend and being around them 24/7. That's resulted in me becoming way too codependent, wallowing in self pity when in reality it's so important to have a life outside of your s/o. I also have a very anxious-avoidant love style and my mind likes to make up things, so if I feel like something is going wrong, I don't really have anyone or anything else to turn to and I will most likely distance myself and end up feeling upset over nothing. I have communicated this with him and I'm so thankful that he is patient and is helping me unlearn a lot of these things. It has gotten a lot better than before, however I still find myself spiraling into shit-feelinged weeks that end in me I feeling upset that my s/o can't tend to me every single day, which is totally understandable. It's just difficult because my mental health has been getting really bad again lately. I don't want to stress him out because he already does so much for me and I know that this is something I have to work on fixing myself.

In my personal life, I have no problem being friendly with everyone I meet, however I have a hard time keeping friends because I am really introverted and everyone around me is not quite my type of person. I keep myself busy with books and writing, however that becomes draining every once in a while and it's also a place where my thoughts have learned to become intrusive since I can't focus on it as much as I used to be able to. I really enjoy music, however good songs don't really come on the radio anymore and it's been a long time since I've listened to something new. I have siblings that I don't really talk to at all, and I am also expected to be the ""good kid"" to my mom which means I don't really get as much freedom as my siblings or I don't get to go out as much as them. My family isn't very well off, as my mom works to support 3 kids at minimum wage and she lost her job to covid so we've been really tight on money lately. It's also my last year of high school and I feel like there's way too many expectations on me to succeed. These are all of the biggest reasons why I've been feeling stressed and upset. I mostly just stay in my room and try to distract with things, although the distractions are starting to feel draining as well.

What can I do to improve my situation? What other hobbies could I take up? Is there any advice that could help with anything stated above?

Overall I want to find happiness, but I'm not sure where to start. Thanks in advance, Reddit!"
829,Panic Attack,"I just had a really bad panic attack. I haven’t had one this bad before, it’s the second one I’ve had today, I haven’t had one recently besides these two (as in I’ve been good the past six months), they were over trivial matters, *and* I had a panic attack *because* of a panic attack. I’m just feeling so fucked up today.

I’m posting about it though because this one I just had really scared me, I’ve never had it this bad. I was in the passenger seat of the car on the way home after a day out with my family, when suddenly my face tensed up on the right side. I got super light headed suddenly, and I just laid back. The whole right side of my face was seizing up then twitching for a couple minutes. I just laid still not talking or anything, then it stopped and it began to feel tingly. We pulled into a parking lot waiting to meet up with someone, and while still feelin tingly I just started shaking badly, and all down my right arm and hand felt tingly too. Before this point I wasn’t panicked at all though, just weirded out an a little concerned. It wasn’t like a normal reaction for me. It was only at this point I began to cry and panic suddenly, and tried to tell my mother, who tried to calm me down and let me breathe. I got over it in five minutes or so. But this was so weird, I’ve never had that happen before. Even now, fifteen minutes later, I can feel a slight leftover tingle in my right arm and face. I have a bad headache now. I feel so disoriented almost, or hazy. I don’t know how to describe it. Also, I don’t know if this matters but I’m 16F"
830,I am full of indifference and apathy,"I don't care a bit for anything, I feel as if everything is slowly dissolving into each other and will amount to the very essence it was before reaching our consciousness.  I cannot sympathize with anyone and it is our journey and there is nothing but the shallow requiem that create to elude ourselves from reality. The reality that we have evolved beyond our understanding, industrialization controls us and that there is nothing to be done.  


My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better  world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on  others. I want no escape.

831,The only place I can me truly honest.,"Hello all,

I made a new Reddit account just to write this. I have to let all this out, this is going to be a long one but I beg you to read through this and attempt to help me in some way because I can’t go on like this anymore.

- Background Information -

My name is Vincent, I’m 20 years old, Study Law at University and I’m quite a big guy, 6’3 and around 17 stone. I come from a less privileged background and I’ve never really had something as much as a girlfriend in my life but I’ve not been short of offers. So yeah, growing up I never really had a lot of cash, but yet I’ve always been the exact opposite of flash inside so I didn’t really mind. 

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Anxiety &amp; Depression. Which surprised a lot of people, including myself. It came from nowhere, and I think gradually it just became worse and worse. 

- Family Life -

My family have been good but it’s always been a rocky road, my father left when I was 9 years old and he was never really there for me.  A lot of family members have been to jail and are still doing a lot of illegal things but that’s none of my business. My mother is an angel though, I can’t express how much I love and care about her. 

My brother is always there for me too. 

Noteable Events [Recent]

- Nearly got into a fight at Uni a couple of days ago  with a security guard when I was heavily intoxicated, thus giving me a panic attack when it was over, thus making me go to the security office and apologise to them to get that sense of well, it’s over now. 

- Broke down over my father not coming to see me off to Uni, had a family meeting over this. 

- Moved away from home to Uni. 

- Latched onto a girl I met in my own accommodation at Uni and got my heart broke... Well that’s a lie, it was just a stupid crush which was my own fault. I needed some way to cope and she was it, we’re cool now though, I explained it all to her and she understood. 

&gt; My Thoughts &lt;

I feel like life is pointless, like I can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, like what’s the point? I can’t see the point in doing anything anymore. Gaming, what I loved and adored now seems pointless to me. I’ve been thinking of suicide, but I’d never do it because of how much it would hurt the people that care about me. I’ve been considering self harming once again, slashing my face and hands ect. I feel like I deserve it, I don’t know why. I guess it’s self hatred I suppose. I look at myself in the mirror every single morning and I think “ I hate you, I hate you so much “. 

Every single time I feel an inch of happiness, I put myself back down and I become the same depressed young man I’ve been for years. I honestly feel like I’m being torn apart. I’m close to breaking, and it’s destroying me. The only thing that used to help was drinking, and even now that once again destroys me and my thoughts come back. My heart and mind are honestly so heavy but I won’t tell anyone that I need the help, but the truth is I do, I’ve lost myself. I honestly feel like I’m going through hell at the moment, my own personal nightmare. That’s been my life for a while. Every single time happiness comes it gets ripped away from me and I’m left to rot. I’m given it and it takes itself away and truth be told I just don’t see the point. In anything anymore, life just seems pointless and it’s destroying me. I need help. I need to be completely free of this pain. I guess I think about suicide because I feel like that’s a complete end to the pain that I’m feeling. 

It’s weird, I’m a big guy but I’ve always been quite shy in terms of confrontations, that’s why the whole security guard fight thing came around the aftermath effected me so much.

As I’m writing all this, I just want to fucking die. I can’t. I need help from some of you, please. 

Thank you for reading."
832,Am I making up my ADHD?,"i just today got diagnosed with adhd and mild major depressive disorder with anxiety. it felt like such a relief that something ive been struggling with in all the 20 years ive been alive finally has a name. ive been having so many issues because of it from my grades to my home life to my work life and i was nearly in tears when i got my diagnosis.

i got some great advice from my friend and several online resources to schedule an appointment with my primary care doctor about it, talking to my friends for support the entire time and theyve been so supportive.


but what if im just trying to find an excuse for my laziness and inattentiveness? what if im making it up? ive struggled for so long. my grades and relationships have suffered because i can never seem to concentrate or finish my work or get something done. im constantly losing and forgetting things i need. but what if thats just me being a lazy klutz who can get off their ass?

im not looking for validation i just am not sure what i should do. its making me scared to take the antidepressants ive prescribed. i dont want to cause more trouble just because im being paranoid and a hypochondriac."
833,Has your physical health been wrecked as a result of your mental health?,"Like for example, my anxiety has been so bad that in the last sox months I’ve lost a significant amount of weight. I can’t eat and when I do, my digestive system is totally wrecked and I end up with severe stomach pains and the runs for hours. Right now all I can eat is a little bit of meat and some crackers. The rest of the time, I live on Marlboros and coffee. I can only eat once every 3 - 4 days and it’s usually just a few bites before I can’t eat anything else. If I eat more than that, I feel like I have a nasty stomach bug. So now it’s reached the point to where I really no longer like to eat, but it’s not anorexia. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
834,Anxiety/Driving,"I’ll start out by saying I’m a very confident driver. Got my license at 16. I’m cautious but confident and have never been in an at fault accident. 

About 3.5 months ago I took my car in to get my tires rotated and now my car bounces/wobbles. I’ve put $2600 into the car and it’s still doing it but the tire shop I keep taking it back to says nothings wrong. My parents think I’m crazy. The car was so smooth before I got the tires rotated and now I feel like I’m driving on cobblestones.. 

I had a full on mental breakdown about it today. A complete meltdown. Felt like a 4 year old. In front of my mom and grandma. I can’t do this anymore but I can’t afford to fix it further."
835,my sister asked me if i’m happy randomly and i had no idea what to say to her,"we were just on the phone not talking about anything in particular and all of a sudden she asked if i’m happy. i didn’t know what to say and i just started laughing, not because i found anything funny but because it’s just something i do when i’m uncomfortable or i’m not sure what to say/do. i fumbled with my words and ended saying something like a “i- well- i mean- uh yea maybe idk”. i don’t know, i just wanted to share that"
836,"My friend has DID, ASPD, and SCZ","ok, i'm using a throw away account for obvious reasons.

Basically, i found out a few months ago that my friend has DID (dissociative personality disorder aka multiple personality disorder), ASPD (antisocial personality disorder, aka  sociopath) and SCZ (Schizophrenia). 

He had a DID episode at school a few days ago, and I want to understand whats happening so that I can help.

If you or anyone you know has any of these, but especially DID, I was hoping to ask a few questions about it/them, free of judgement. If you don't want to answer a question I asked, then move on, i won't bring it up. 

Please, I'm worried about him, and I need to know more, thankyou."
837,I don't want to live anymore.,"I'm a 26 year old male and I still live with my parents because of the recent pandemic.  for a long time I've been thinking about killing myself. I feel nobody would care if I died and would just go on without me. I tried talking to my parents about it but they just dismiss it and downplay it. My mother has said ""It's just a faze, and I'm acting spoiled"" my Dad is an extreme doormat and doesn't care. Growing up I had no friends and was bullied. Recently I visited a doctor and I was diagnosed as a Sociopath. I've tried going to therapy but my parents quickly stopped it. To be honest I hate my life. Please help me I don't feel normal and nobody cares."
838,not feeling love,"for many reasons i find myself not wanting anyone around and literally never needing emotional support from anyone, its like the idea actually disgusts me? like i dont feel happy w people who are nice to me, i don't feel warmth, i dont want to help or protect them and if we argue and they leave i genuinely don't give a shit? im incapable of empathy as well so yeah. if someone expresses empathy for me (feeling sad because i am) im literally disgusted and irritated. and ig i just don't care about anyone except myself lol im not suppressing emotions im just so distant from everyone naturally and deal w being alone just fine...."
839,My abusive employer is becoming famous,"Please help me process this. Until recently, I owned a fashion company that provided services to entrepreneurs. At the end of 2018 I took on a major client. The client turned out to be very demanding and the CEO required most of my business and personal time. It was also one of the top two most toxic work experiences of my life. (The other was answering critical complaint calls at a major US Bank while the leaders of said bank attended Congressional hearings.)

I admit to not setting proper boundaries, partly because I’d never made that much money and partly because I considered the CEO a friend at the time. While working there, the CEO:
Publicly reprimanded employees 
Pit employees against each other
Walked out on photoshoots, which compromised relationships I’d personally cultivated 
Blamed employees for her errors
Created unrealistic deadlines

If that doesn’t sound abusive, I’m sure I’ve blocked out the worst of it. Only the feelings remain.

It was the type of environment where everyone pretended to be happy and “on brand” but secretly no one was getting sleep and we all felt constantly anxious. 

When I first began, she asked me to help on a special project. I showed up at the office on the planned date and time only for her to ask why I was there. She’d cancelled the project without notifying me. This meant I would not get paid for the time I’d taken away from other areas in my business. Situations like this would happen often. I partly blame myself for feeling intimidated and allowing this to go on without voicing my frustration. 

The partnership ended when I found myself in a deep depression, no longer caring about the work or any deadlines that had been set. I’ve struggled with depression all my life, but the 8 months I spent working there triggered one of the lowest points in my life. 

Since then I’ve been taking better care of myself and my mental health, but I have resentment for an industry I’ve always loved, fashion. I’m unemployed, I barely feel like looking for work, and we’re in a pandemic. I don’t even do much to nurture my creativity any more. I’m definitely blocked. 

On the other hand, her business has flourished. I don’t follow the company on social media, but we are located in a small metro area so every few months I hear something. She’s very ambitious and has made millions growing her business. Today I found out she was cast in a reality show on a major cable network. 

Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been feeling optimistic about my future and regained some of my confidence. Usually, I can be supportive to a fault and, on a good mental health day, I’d even say I’m happy for her and the company. But for some reason, today, this news made me feel like shit. How should I cope with this? I don’t want to get stuck again."
840,I’m slipping,I’ve been sitting in my room and these thought that cross my mind make me wanna die I don’t wanna wake up anymore I punch myself when these thought cross my mind it’s dumb but it makes me feel a different pain I love it.
841,Third time posting on this stupid sub in a row hell yea,"I just. 

My friends were talking about forgiveness and people who hurt them/they've hurt

And I was staying quiet because I didn't have much to say. Nobody in life has wronged me enough to even warrant my forgiveness. That's fine. I was quiet of my own accord and didn't mind it. 

Then one of them specifically ASKS me if there's anything I want to say, and alluded to a specific relationship I'm sensitive about. I brought up something that had been bothering me for a while--

And the one that asked literally repeated it with a disbelieving little laugh-- like I had said a joke, and before I could explain it suddenly the subject changed. 

Like

I don't know. 

They have much worse shit to talk about I know they don't wanna deal with my emotions and that's FINE but then WHY ASK. Why fucking ask. Nobody ever asks me to talk about my feelings so I don't, that's fine, I'm fine with that, but for god's sake if you're gonna actually get my hopes up that you're actually INTERESTED in me and then cut me off

That shit hurts."
842,"I feel like my life is a waste, I missed my chance to be somebody","I wanted to be a professional musician. I graduated high school early and did a talent show and got far on it. Released some albums and as a 19 year old female moved to a big city to chase that dream. I didn’t “make it.” I ended up moving back to the prairies to go to 2-year community college.

After a year working at an ad agency I was laid off but had an Etsy store that has been successful but unfulfilling. This year with covid my sales are down so much. 

I just feel like a failure. I’m 31. I feel like I wanted to do something important. And I failed. 

I love working at home and being my own boss. That is something I want... but I feel so alone and isolated. I have like, no friends, and it’s not like I can join a volleyball league or find a way to meet anyone right now. 

I just don’t know how to find fulfillment. I am so desperately lonely, unfulfilled with my work, and I’ve tried other things to get out of my Etsy store but man... I feel so stuck! 

I have so much potential and I wanted to impact the world in a special way and I feel like I’m just... utterly... mediocre"
843,"I'm trying really hard, but idk if it's actually working.","I've been off anti depressants since January. I had a therapist for 4 years that saved me after my last serious (serious as in hospitalized) suicide attempt that left in 2019, due to getting another job. Like most people quarantine hasn't helped with my mental health. I've isolated myself from a lot of my friends (I used to have a shit ton of friends and now it's down to a handful, just people who are able to put up with me, my ups and downs) and the oeoe I have left are the people that have proven they'll stand by me. 

I've been through 3 therapists since August 2019. 2 of them from the same place my exlongterm one was from but quarentiene came and they ghosted me. (the guy I was with was shit. Fresh outta college. No hate but he didn't know what he was doing yet) The third one was just one session, and the guy who wrote my top surgery letter. I pretended to be okay for that. And it worked. 

I got top surgery a month ago. I should be happy. Since I did, I've been spiraling. I relapsed last night after almost two months of being clean. They weren't bad, I got control soon enough but still. I can't do the workouts I love to do due to top surgery. I just, I don't know. I feel stuck. I need to go back into therapy, I know I do. But it doesn't help. It just doesn't work for me. I feel like I need antidepressants again. But I don't wanna go back on them. Idk. I just don't wanna be dependent on them."
844,What to do,"I'm still pretty close to my ex - we talk quite a bit and both realise and understand that while we can be really good friends, there will never be anything more then that for reasons we both understand (at least I think he understands). 

Last night, I was having a rough time - I struggle with depression + suicidal ideation which he knows about - and even though he usually is really caring and tries to help, he was being a bit thoughtless and telling me I only give him stress in his life and that he doesn't even know why he even talks to me. I was a bit shocked at this as it is so uncommon for him to act that way and so I told him I thought he was being thoughtless as he knows I'm going through a really stressful rough patch at the moment. 

He then said that he was sorry, and someone had just sent him a message that had kinda ruined his whole evening (something about a previous gf I think) and I said I could understand that but it's not fair to take it all out on me - especially as he was saying all girls are pathetic and useless bitches etc. 

Well, then a little bit later when I said something about how I really didn't appreciate him directing all of these comments at me and that I was going to go to bed cause I didn't wanna put up with this anymore, he said ""go and fucking kill yourself"". I was really surprised by that (shocked actually) because he knows I have almost attempted suicide before and that my mental health is really fragile at best. He immediately unsent the message, but he didn't apologise or anything. I stopped messaging him shortly after and went to bed, but this morning he still hasn't apologised or anything about it. 

I just don't know what to do, part of me doesn't want to talk to him again because him saying that really hurt, but then the other part wants to as he was the only friend I felt free to talk to about my struggles etc. 

What should I do?"
845,what do you all do?,[removed]
846,Did my former therapist mistreat me?,"For context, I'm 27f and have been in therapy and on medication since I was 18 for anxiety &amp; depression.  Last year, my long-time therapist and I agreed that I needed a little extra help with my food-related anxieties, and he recommended that I see someone who specializes in that sort of thing.  He referred me to another therapist in his building that might be able to help.  So I started seeing her as well as my original therapist (yes it was extremely expensive and I'm very privileged to be able to afford two therapists at once). 

After several months of seeing her with not much progress on anything, she suggested we start trying EMDR therapy to address my traumas (we weren't really working on my food-related issues).  From her explanation of EMDR, it sounded great.  She made it sound like it would really trick my brain into thinking about my traumas in a completely different way.  We agreed to start trying it.  

During the first EMDR session, she asked me to tell her in detail about the specific trauma we agreed to tackle that day.  I told her the whole story, and we began the eye-movement exercises.  But I felt strange about it.  She was reading from a textbook the whole time, reciting the ""script"" verbatim.  After every round of eye-movement, she would ask ""how do you feel now?"" and every time I wouldn't feel much different.  

After a few sessions, she decided that the EMDR wasn't really working for me and maybe we should try another method.  I left that session feeling very hopeless because I really thought EMDR was going to help me.  But an hour or so after our session she called me and said ""Actually I've been thinking about it, and I think maybe it IS working!  Let's keep trying it!""  So we tried it a few more times.

Each session with her would just make me feel worse and worse.  I would cry and have breakdowns in her office quite a lot, and I would leave without feeling any better.  After a few weeks of this, she said ""I don't think I can help you anymore.""  She said it was unethical of her to be accepting payment for therapy if it wasn't helping me.  I agree with that sentiment, but it was devastating to hear that she couldn't help me, like I was helpless or something.  She said, ""everything I say just upsets you more"" which makes me hate myself 1000x more. 

 I started crying and having a breakdown and instead of comforting me she immediately ran to turn up the music in the waiting room so that no one would hear me crying.  She promised to refer me to some other doctors she thought might be able to help me.  But I was so distressed in that moment that I just couldn't see any hope.  I was so mad at myself for not getting better with her help that I started calling myself stupid and I ended up hitting myself in the head a few times.  Once I did so, she immediately stood up from her chair and said ""I need you to leave.""  Which made me hate myself about a million times more because I thought I'd offended her or something.  But before I could get up and leave she scrambled to find a pen and paper and quickly jotted down a contract for me to sign, stating that I would not hurt or kill myself.  Which means her priority was protecting herself legally.  I signed it because I genuinely didn't want to hurt or kill myself, I had just hit myself instinctively due to extreme distress in the moment.  She let me stay and calm down for a few minutes but then I left and never saw or spoke to her again.

After talking to a friend about it, we did some research and discovered that this particular therapist was not even registered to practice EMDR therapy (which apparently isn't illegal, just frowned upon).  

The entire experience has left me pretty traumatized in all honesty.  I just wanted to share my feelings with like-minded people, and I wanted to hear some of ya'lls opinions.  Do you think she was in the right to immediately ask me to leave once I hit myself?  Was I being too sensitive to let this affect me so much?  Did she actually mistreat or abuse me or am I blowing this out of proportion?

Regardless, thanks for reading, love you guys."
847,What do you think of this? (Eating issues),"I've been really insecure about my weight for a bit. Eventually it got to the point where I don't eat much, because when I do I can't help but check the calories and decide it's too much for me. I'm not sure if I have an eating disorder; I don't exercise or do anything to stop it. But I have thought about it and tried, I don't have the energy to. 

What should I do about this, and what do you think it is..?"

850,How do you keep a job when anxiety and depression rule your life?,"I’ve been out of work for over a year and a half (with the exception of a job I held for 3 weeks) but I got a job doing what I know best (coffee) and I really, really want to keep it. I’ve been interviewing for and getting jobs all this time but never calling back. The anxiety overwhelms me. I have anxiety about work but also anxiety about becoming so ill again that I’m suicidal and work has a 100% success rate of eventually driving me to that point. 

I’m on disability because of my mental illness and I’m only trying to get a 12 hour per week job.   The stakes are so low it’s hard for me not to just flake. But my therapist told me she thinks working will build my self-confidence and turn me into a slightly functional human. And I’d really, really like to have something to do with myself and some more money would be very helpful. Plus I have goals and I need build references so I can get the job I really want. Any advice on how to achieve that would be appreciated."

852,"Feeling down, never had these feelings before","Recently I’ve had feelings of almost emptiness within my life, and it seems like even when I’m doing stuff the feeling is still there. I’ve always tended to worry about things that I care about, and recently my relationship came into a rough patch but we’re good now. Throughout the day it seems like it comes in waves of emptiness, like for a while I’ll be good, and then all of a sudden the feeling will just be there. I just don’t know if I should wait it out a little longer because it’s been only a few days that I’ve felt this way, plus my parents have told me stories about how they went through hard times throughout their lives and battled through them to the other side. I also have been having digestive issues that have been persistent over the last few months and I was wondering if it’s possible that a side effect of them could be depression like symptoms? 

Really I’m just scared that I’m not going to be able to get out of it and that it will cost me things in my life that I truly care about. Any feedback would be appreciated."

854,Does anyone know what this is?,"So there’s this thing that keeps happening to me, and I have no idea what it is. For reference, I have never done any psychedelic drugs before. 
The phenomenon feels like an incredibly frightening moment of clarity. Like a mental version of when you jerk awake when you’re falling asleep. I basically realize that I’ve been interpreting my entire life as it I weren’t “me”, like some sort of security guard dozing off in front of a CCTV screen that shows my day to day business. Or my life is a movie that I got really into and now the credits are playing and I am wrenched back to reality. It sets in really fast, and is gone a couple minutes later. 
The first time it happened I was in the middle of a debate round (I used to do highschool debate but it really stressed me out so I quit) and I couldn’t keep my train of thought whatsoever and I ended up loosing match. That was four years ago and it has happened once every couple months since then. Recently (the past two months) it has gotten way worse. 
So, what’s it called? Should I be worried?"

I literally don’t know what to do anymore to help him. I truly feel like he’s at a point in his life that if he doesn’t get help, nothing will ever be able to help him. I can’t convince him that a psychiatrist or therapist could help him. I don’t know what to do anymore."
856,Is this ADHD?,"This may or may not offend people with ADHD, and if it does, I am truly sorry for that but my friend would like to know if whether or not if she has ADHD, just in case and I'm saying this in her place on reddit and the reason why she's saying this in reddit and not to a therapist because she's not able to at the moment, so if any one who reads this could at least hear her out and give a bit of insight into this, it would be really helpful and feel free to ask any questions. Symptoms she's been having are being extremely forgetful about things that are important, and she does know that forgetfulness does happen to a lot of people but she's also lost a lot of things, which also does happen to a lot of people. She also tends to fidget a lot and like from what she had told me, her feet and hands often taps and fidget whenever she's not holding her phone. She is also reluctant to participate in tasks requiring sustained mental effort which she get that can happen to many other people too. She also seems to overlook stuff a lot, even when she's paying the utmost attention she can, she just can't help but overlook something that is really important and her mother does call her careless a lot, which she believe since she's very clumsy and forgets about her surroundings a lot. She also hate listening to stuff that take a long time. This might just be her being lazy from what she said, but she'd like to make sure."
857,My psychologist is pissing me off!,"Anytime I bring up something and laugh at it, he laughs too.  I bring up my sister died, I start to laugh that she drowned to death.  He starts laughing and says “well that’s not good hahaha are you ok haha”.  

I’m not laughing because it’s funny, I laugh b/c I laugh when I tell ppl I don’t know this stuff.  I’m not comfortable around him.  Fuck... is he a fucking idiot?

What do I do?  Am I the one at fault for laughing?"
858,I feel like shit all the time,"Hey all, so basically for the past few years, I've had moments where I sweat and can't breathe, and more recently they have been occuring daily and hitting heavier. I've been talking to a girl and it has seemed to help, but whenever I get one off vibe I freak the fuck out and get into a sweat and feel like crying. She always seems to really want to hang when she sees me and I feel the same,it's only been like once a week, every Friday for that last few weeks. I feel like Im way too clingy and like can't read the vibe all too often. I don't know how to feel man, I've been crying in my room listening to Guns n roses just not ever vibing unless I'm talking to her and like it's just gotten so bad. I really like her and like wanna be with her, but I'm a senior in highschool and if we don't go to the same college it might ruin like whatever it could've been. I don't know how to talk about my feelings properly, you might have to read this like it's a back to the future movie man."
859,I feel empty,"Lately, I've been feeling a sense of emptiness, mild despair, and constant worry. I bite the skin around my nails off, I'm very hyper when sitting down, I'm irritable, and I have been sleeping for much longer than I should be. I also feel as if my mind has been slowed down by a large margin; I find it hard to make rational decisions and think logically as I did previously. I have a massively reduced passion for my hobbies other than schoolwork (which is an obligation I fulfill out of fear of failure). I realized that this emotion comes in waves for me, as in I feel this way for a week or two, but everything goes back to normal for a week or so. I'm almost certain that I have depression and anxiety, and I have contemplated going to the doctor to get tested and possibly get medication, however, I don't know how accepting my parents are of mental disorders. I will see what I can do, but what is something I can do on my own to attempt to alleviate the repercussions of anxiety and depression?

Thanks"
860,"I'm losing it, I need advice on how I can survive if I'm unable to work due to severe mood issues",I have anxiety/depression/ maybe some kind of mood disorder and I'm really struggling right now. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't stop crying. I can't keep it together at work anymore. I'm employed full-time but I can't do this right now. Does anyone know of any program or assistance or resources that can help me not fall into a pit of debt if I can't continue working?
861,I just had a strange but great experience,"A little context: I play college baseball away from my home country, and one of my best friends does too but at a different school. A while ago I got drunk (because I sometimes heavily rely on alcohol) and told him (who I haven’t told any of my friends other than my girlfriend) about all my mental health shit. Depression, anxiety and shit that I started getting help with, and my previous suicide attempts. 

Anyways, today he asked me to talk to his friend at college (that I don’t know) about mental health shit, because he got asked if he experienced anything, and said “no but [my name] has”. I was sort of pissed, thinking I trusted him only for him to be spilling things about some of my darkest times/thoughts. However, the call ended up making me feel so calm and so much better about myself. It felt so good to talk to a dude, especially another athlete about it, and be understood completely. If I were to talk to my friends I would feel judged, simply because I could not be understood. But I feel it helped him, as I am able to understand him, but it helped me as well. I realized I’m not alone with this. I am not the only one. I am not a pussy or attention whore because I feel like a sack of shit a majority of the time. There are others, just like me, who have the same kind of things going on in their head. It’s just so comforting to simply be understood, especially by another college athlete, and as a male, where there is normally a huge stigma around mental health."
862,I just realized my brain isn't normal? I'm confused and don't know what to do.,"Here's some things:
- My brain chooses to forget most negative experiences I have. I hardly remember any of them and just know that they happened.
- I don't feel guilt, period. I don't do most things not because of the morality but cause of the consequences.
- I find I put on different acts for different people not because of a sadness but for a reaction and to see what's gonna happen.
- I'm extroverted and happy to most people because I genuinely don't know how to be the other way, the second I'm alone I don't know what to feel at all.
- I lie/exaggerate about myself alot and feel like I need to be interesting to keep people (of any kind) around me cause I feel the need to be around people.
- My brain would rather focus on others and other things than myself all the time. Writing this thing was a struggle.

However I think I empathize really well (second hand embarrassment kills me), and have alot of friends.

 Before I realized these things I just thought I was an average run of the mil person but apparently realizing these things I'm not and I dont know what to do.

What does this mean? Do I have anything? Am I a bad person?"
863,I’m alone and I crave hugs,"because of the quarantine and the fact that I just moved places I have no one who I trust enough to hug them, I miss my friends and their hugs, now we barely talk because we’re all on fucking college, I miss being there, hug them everyday and I regret not hugging them more before. For the first time in years I felt loved, safe and strong, now that I’m alone again it’s even harder than before because I already taste what good friendships are and how good hugs can feel. I don’t think I’m ever gonna be okay with being alone again, now that I lost it all."
864,"Today I woke up this morning for the first time in YEARS feeling overly positive about life, and now I feel the exact same way I always feel? What?","I woke up feeling happy and excited, telling myself nothing could go wrong in my life and that I'll get out of my current situation no matter what. I actually felt happy since who knows when, everything around me looked beautiful and new.

865,I just don’t know what to do anymore.,"Hi. I’m 17 and right now, I have a lot of college applications that I’m stressing about a lot and some family matters, as well as my depression (another whole different story, a huge one actually..) or anxiety kicking in at the same time, I can’t really get myself to do things.

It’s getting closer until the due date of my applications, and I just can’t get myself to start writing my essays or work and end up procrastinating. I’m mentally exhausted and stressed about the things around me. 

Can you please give me some tips on how to cope with procrastination? I really need to wake up and start working. Whatever I’ve done so far didn’t work for me."
866,Should I go to a therapist,"I  feel like I have a dependacy for attention from others.  I feel like toxic person.  Yesterday I didn't go to my friends house because her mom said no and I broke.  She just doesn't want me to come over because she doesn't like me.  I'm annoying and toxic and she doesn't like me.  I started crying but then became extremely enraged that she would blow me off like this.  I called her a good fifty times within the span of 1 hour without her answering. I was crying and cursing spamming her phone.  A girl who sat next to me in class who was very annoying got her seat moved by the treacher because of me constantly arguing and yelling at her for doing various things.  I've had people from my old school tell me how rude I was to them and how I was toxic.  I used to be quite confident and rude.  However now I can't even gain the confidence to smile in front of someone or buy any new clothes.  Its hard for me to clean myself in the shower.  I don't believe any of my friends truly like me.  My mind is constantly telling me I am an attention whore who is faking cutting herself for attention.  I don't want to go on with day to day living but a can't kill myself.  I also for some reason bite my tounge until it bleeds on purpose, although that could be unrelated.  I go through periods where a starve myself and then I get home and eat everything in sight.  No matter what I'm always ugly and no matter how much I starve myself I'm always fat.  I feel trapped and I don't know how to mange myself.  What do to think I have the symptoms of?  Do I have a disorder?  Should this be a concern?"
867,"If I wanted to have my mental health fully examined (in the US), and checked for all forms of illness, disorder, etc, how would I go about that?","I've always been curious about my mental health, whether there are problems I've never picked-up on, and whether my thoughts and way-of-thinking are normal and healthy. How would I go about doing that in the US?   


* Is there one blanket exam I can go have done that'll cover everything, or would it have to be several specific, targeted exams, looking for particular illnesses/disorders?
* Would I have to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, and how would I do that? Would I simply go to a hospital, or are there particular services I would make arrangements with?
* What kinds of things would I expect? A questionnaire? Scans?   


Thanks for answering. I'm pretty sure I don't have any serious issues affecting my life, I've just always had my doubts and curiosities about this."
868,i want to get help,"i am not okay. i haven’t been for years. when i was 13 it was really... really bad, but i hid everything and got passed it somehow. that part is mainly a blur though. i am now 18, to be 19 very soon and well, it is getting bad again. i tend to deal with everything alone, but i really want help. i need it. i just don’t know how. my mother is not the supportive type. two years ago, i told her that i think i may have social anxiety and her responses and actions afterward were cruel. my mother thinks my sister, who went to therapy &amp; was diagnosed with anxiety, was just crazy and on drugs or something. she doesn’t believe in mental illness. i might be 18, but i am completely dependent on my mother. she takes care of everything for me and so i want to get help, but i don’t know how to do it without going through her. i can’t drive and i don’t have money, and she takes care of all my insurance and medical stuff. i just really want help and need it soon."

I just want to be treated as a person, a human being, because that's what I am. 
I guess I've been kinda lonely and feeling disconnected. Sorry for the rant.

My main friends all have other friends they’d rather be with and everyone looks at me someone lame and boring. I used to be a bright kid and goofy 24/7 which helped me escape reality but now i’ve changed due to everyone treating me different and pushing me away. Although this whole circumstance sounds very immature its been happening for a good year now and i just need some advice on how to finally rely on myself and prove everyone wrong.

878,"Inability to form coherent, efficient sentences?","I wasn't sure where to post this. I figured this subreddit is the most appropriate. I hope you can help.

When I was younger (early teens) I went through a phase where I would sometimes struggle to form coherent, efficient sentences. I struggled to think of the words I needed, and forgot obvious descriptions for certain items. For example, if I forgot the word for school, I might have said ""The learning place I got every day"", but my mind would instead draw a blank. I would fall silent mid-sentence because suddenly I would forget what I was talking about. This often happened right after my turn to speak begun, so people would have to wait in silence for my first words to formulate. I would repeat sentences many times in the same block of speech, because my mind was too slow to think of the words I actually needed for a new sentence. My speech became rambling, difficult to follow, and very slow. It was painful to listen to, and frustrating for me to cope with.

The IDEAS were there, but the words just disappeared from my mind. I couldn't speak them.

The one thing that helped me was the time my dad got tired of listening to me stumble like a drunk blind man through my sentences, so he told me ""Go away. Think about what you want to say. Organise it in your head, then come back and say it"". I came back, and even though I stuttered and spoke slowly - like my tongue was made of lead - it was much better.

A few years later I overcame my speech issues. When I noticed my little sister developing the same traits, I gave her the same advice dad gave me. She also improved.

The strange thing is - I've always been excellent with language. I write bomb-ass essays and I can finish cryptic crosswords. My language skills are above average. Yet I struggled to formulate a basic sentence.

Possibly relevant mental health stuff: As an adult I experience depression and anxiety (both pretty mild usually). As a little kid I used to whisper instead of speaking clearly. I also had severe anger issues (which I now suspect stemmed from anxiety and self-esteem problems). 

Can someone please tell me what the fuck happened to my brain around that time? Why did I develop such bad ""speakers block""? Why did my sister also struggle? What is this phenomenon called? It's not relevant for me now or anything, but I'd love some clarification."

880,Just lost the 1 thing that I felt like was keeping me together,Yesterday my dog got scared of someone who snuck behind me and he took of his collar and ran. I have looked everywhere for him spent yesterday and most of today and currently as I’m typing this with only 3 hours of sleep and my dad is not supportive at all we ended up arguing about my dog and a little cart he had me drive around to find my dog who is like a son to me I love him with my heart I have no one to talk to and at times I talk to him even though he can’t understand anyways we argue about about the cart cause the seat was loose and I took it off and he blames me for breaking it and saying I’m aggressive and don’t know how to be careful to which he tells me to break the other one and I do so as he sat and stared telling me too I do so and he throws it at me and I pick it up and put it back on the cart to which he starts insulting me and even goes for a weapon on the back of the cart to which I told him that he can’t do it and that I feel like I don’t have anything without my dog anyways to which he replies with how much he hates me and wishes I wasn’t born. Me and my sisters all agree he is a super narcissist and he never lets me out and complains I don’t do anything with my life when I literally can’t get a job cause he won’t give me my birth certificate and social security number and refuses to teach me how to drive I’m almost 18 but it still sucks to have to go through all this alone I don’t have someone I feel like I can truly talk too. That is all thank you for hearing me rant and I hope if your going through something you will pull through cause I’m always told it gets better but for me it’s been like this for years atleast in terms of me and my dad
881,Why don’t I feel anything.,"All my life, I’ve had chronic mood swings. One moment I’ll be happy and borderline crazy, the next moment i’ll be screaming and crying and panicking. No matter what the situation, I’ve always had some sort of emotion and while it might not be normal, it’s what i’m used to. All of a sudden though, during this week, I feel nothing. I don’t feel happy or sad, I honestly don’t feel anything. Just out of nowhere it’s like my ability to feel emotions just up and left. Nothing really traumatic happened, I had a handful panic attacks last week, but other than that there’s been no real reason for why this is happening. Life just seems pointless now and I want my emotions back. What do I do??"

Fo the first time I don't feel trapped though and I have hope that I will eventually get out of my parent's house.

Just wondering how anyone else handles it. Maybe there's an easier way for me to handle it or I'm not seeing things in a better way. Still bothers me at my old age of 25 and I embarrassingly live at home at the moment :( Still makes me feel awful."
883,Does this sound like an eating disorder or anorexia?,"Hello. This may be long but I am wanting to include as much information as possible. I am unsure how much information regarding calories or specific weights is allowed here. 

I am sixteen and male.  I believe I may have developed an eating disorder and may be struggling with anorexia.  I am technically underweight and I have lost a large amount of weight in the past six months or so.  I cannot give specific numbers on here because that seems to be prohibited in the rules.  I say technically underweight because I still believe I am fat even though I am in the underweight category for my age.

I am trying to lose weight by restricting my calorie intake and exercising because I am wanting to be even more thin.  I am obsessed with counting calories and macronutrients on a spreadsheet on my phone for everything I am eating.  I will become very upset and panic whenever I ate something that I consider to be unacceptable or not healthy enough.  Sometimes I will also overuse laxatives or start fasting for several days to try to compensate for whatever I ate that I considered to be not healthy enough.  I have heard about orthorexia as well and I believe this may apply to me also. 

Neither of my parents and none of my family or friends know about this.  No one has ever confronted me about having an eating disorder before.

I am not usually eating much and on restricting days I usually have one or two small meals each day and a protein shake.  I also do fasts for two or three days in a row sometimes.  I make sure to stay under my calorie intake goals for each day to continue weight loss.  I was hardly hungry at all today and I had one protein shake today and nothing else.  I had been fasting for the previous two days and I realize this is unhealthy and maybe anorexic.

I am writing this here because I believe I may have a problem and I am wanting to get advice or perspective from someone who is more familiar with eating disorders or someone who has gone through anorexia themselves.  Eating disorders and anorexia seem to be much less common in males than females.  Does this sound like an eating disorder or anorexia?"

886,It's impossible to speak up about wanting to kill myself. I wish depression and suicide idealations were easier for others to understand.,"Suicide and depression is always a sensitive topic. I don't want sympathy, attention, and i don't want to he treated differently... but i always am. 
I don't know how to talk about my feelings, or ask for things I need. Even asking for help from medical professionals seem like a lost cause. They see my PHQ-9, and I get an emergency call and they try to get me to the hospital.
I'm not saying I'm going to end my life, but it's something I think about daily. I have plans of how I would do it and keep things around so if I ever decided I would. I sleep for hours and never want to wake up and when I can't sleep I feel awful. 

I can't even tell friends or family. I've briefly mentioned it a year or so ago and I was called selfish, ignored, shut down or freaked out on. At this point I've shut out everyone, and I just want someone who will understand. I don't want to always fake being happy and exhaust myself. 
I wish people would be understanding when I say ""I'm sorry i didn't answer your calls, I haven't been feeling well and just wanted to sleep"" on a regular type basis, instead of getting mad at me, annoyed with me, or blowing it out or proportion like I have covid or pneumonia. 
At this point, I feel like I just can't have anybody in my life due to my suicide idealations and extreme depression. I feel like I have to hide how I'm feeling to be treated respectfully too, and to not make people uncomfortable around me like I'm a bomb about to explode. I'm just a human, fighting a constant war with my mind so it makes simple things a little bit harder for me. I'm not handicapped, I just often don't feel well."
887,What's wrong with me? Why do I do this to everybody?,"I've come to realize I've screwed with so many people in so many different ways over the years I don't even know who's screwing with who anymore. Because of this whenever somebody screws with me, I start screwing with people around me, usually with verifiably poor judgement, often based on bigoted or prejudicial reasoning, even if they haven't done anything wrong, sometimes using my P.I. and law enforcement friends to stalk the shit out of them, which often includes some pretty illegal and nefarious tactics (like planting GPS trackers, hacking, fabrications, privacy invasions, very invasive home surveillance, etc). I've even gone so far as to steer some of these investigations with confirmation bias, fabrications, and my influence as a former Secret Service agent, almost always being the recipient of information I can use as leverage over coworkers, neighbors, etc. This creates adversarial relationships among innocent people who, in turn, later screw with me. It's just a never-ending, self-reinforcing cycle of screwing. Usually things get so bad I conduct the figurative form of an execution, ruining a life or a career in the process, which leaves me forever fearing it will come back to haunt me. The sad part is, anybody that knows this can use it against me or use it against a target of theirs, getting me to believe another person is responsible for certain incidents.

What's this called in psychology? Self-fulfilling somethings?"
888,I hate it when my family adds onto stress that I already have with school.,"It's a struggle to even get out of bed in the morning because I'm already weighed down by so much on my mind. I try hard just to make my parents proud of the tiniest things that I do, and it's still never enough.

Last week, I had a huge project and two exams in one day, and as soon as I wake up, what do I hear? Nothing but screaming and insults from both of them when I'm just trying to do my work. Even getting a job didn't make them happy. 

I've actually considered quitting school because of all the heartache they cause me. I can't focus when they're upset. All I think about is them and whatever they said and whatever I can do to appease them. But it's still never enough. I honestly don't know what to do. I have no motivation for anything."
889,How to approach conversation with brother about being sexually abused.,"Hi all, I believe my younger brother (20) was sexually abused as child. I also was abused by my uncle growing up and I’m scared someone in my family abused him too. 

Today I realized that he was a bed better and fecal soiled till he was about 13/14.  As a family, we would always get upset with him for doing so, and he would always tell us he could not help his accidents. I just learned both of these ailments are found in children who have been abused. 

I feel certain something happened to him, especially since we were both always around my uncle. How can I approach this conversation? I also worry if he remembers being abused, his mental health will plummet. Should I even ask him? Are some things better to stay swept under the rug? I’m sorry if that’s a bad take, I just don’t know what to do and don’t want to harm him."
890,self diagnosing is kinda stupid,I hear a lot “I’m self diagnosed with depression anxiety adhd etc” and I think it’s stupid. When I tell people I hear “I don’t have the money to go to the doctor” (I live in the us and it’s $150 - $200 without insurance) but you still can’t self diagnose you can have suspicions but you can’t diagnose yourself from reading a few google articles. To the people who do self diagnose why are you self diagnosing? You can’t get referrals or prescriptions for it and it’s not going to treat your illness. Are you doing this for self validation or because it’s a “trend”? I’m not accusing anyone but be honest with yourself. Because if you do have a mental illness that needs to be taken to a doctor right away. Again I have no problem with “I think I’m depressed” but I have a problem with “I’m depressed because I read 3 google articles”
891,"i don’t necessarily want to die, i just don’t really want to exist anymore","idk it’s such a complex feeling. i don’t want to die, but i also just don’t want to exist. i’m just so... tired."
892,I need a hand,"I just need a vent or I need someone who can relate. For the past 2 years my grades have been dropping, I've gotten too wrapped up in my own thoughts that it makes me procrastinate the work and it's made worse by the fact that my parents are angry with me and about it and I have a hard time explaining my feelings to them which ends up with me saying  ""I'm stressed."" all because in turn I feel as if my parents won't understand and brush me off. I haven't been diagnosed with anything like depression or anything I just feel like it's concerning for me to think about how  grim my future is. I believe that's everything I wanted to say, if anyone sees this can you lend a hand in anyway they can."
893,GAD and Depression returning slowly (18m),"Earlier this year I went to my doctor and decided to talk about the way I've been feeling.
After some blood tests and questions, they diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression.

I got started on 50mg sertraline daily, as well as a 2mg (three times daily) diazepam prescription for my first two weeks.
The diazepam worked wonders, I was finally free of my anxiety and I felt much better about myself in a matter of days.

I finally cut out caffeine, I was cutting down on nicotine and marijuana, everything was getting better.

After cutting the diazepam, I was doing pretty well for a month or so until slowly I started experiencing panic attacks again. I went to my doc again on very short notice and they adjusted my dosage to 100mg sertraline. I also requested a referral to a therapist but that was declined after my triage on the phone (my case is not severe enough according to the letter I got).

I'm kind of falling back into the same hole I was in before. Brain fog, panic attacks, inability to focus, they're all surfacing again. Started smoking again, but thankfully I'm not into caffeine anymore. I wish I was able to take a break from life but unfortunately that is not possible at the moment.

I ended up discontinuing my tertiary studies as the daily panic attacks were too much to cope with.

I'd visit my doctor again, but I doubt another dosage adjustment would work for me. Also kinda spooked about SSRI withdrawal if they decide to put me on a different one. Not to mention that I would feel as if I'm annoying them by constantly visiting.

I'm supposed to move back to my home town in a few months, but I feel no excitement for it. All my friends live there and I've been pretty isolated from people and interactions since I first moved.

Any advice is appreciated :)"
894,i feel like therapy isnt working,"it took me so long to work up the courage to ask for therapy, but i dont even think its helping. its my fault too. i am so bad about talking about my emotions. im really trying, im just not used to it. i also really want some medication. i cant control my suicidal thoughts and self harming tendencies, and i think medication could really help me (especially since therapy hasnt done anything). my therapist says i qualify for medication but i haven’t received a prescription yet. its been like a month. does it usually take this long to get meds? i also havent gotten a solid diagnosis yet either, just that im some kind of depressed. i know i cant get better immediately, but i feel like no progress is being made. im starting to feel hopeless again."
895,Becomes emotional after every argument,This is something I've realized since some months that I get all emotional in between or after every argument. This was not the case always but it's very recently I don't know if I've became over emotional or sensitive (?). I don't know. I don't understand why I tear up even in a heated argument. I hate this!

897,do i matter?,"Hey all, short introduction about me. I'm a 20 year old med student, I've been in my university for almost a year now. I live in Colombia, so excuse me if I happen to write a little strangely.
Anyways, this last year has been a complete emotional rollercoaster for me. I think mainly due to the change from highschool to a University. I've been having really dark thoughts sometimes. I'm not planning on doing anything drastic, I know I'm not capable of doing so. But I still feel sad and scared.
What I think (or fear, I'm not really sure) is that I'm a bad person. Or that people don't like me, I never can tell. I talk frequently with old friends, and I spend time with my ""new"" University friends barely frequently. And they all seem to enjoy my presence. But I can't help but feel that I'm just there as ""decoration"" (idk how to put it in words). We've shared a lot of personal stories and secrets, and we trust in each other a lot. But I know for a fact I'm the friend of the group that talks the least with everyone else, they've told me that and I already knew. People don't usually text me, or talk to me, outside of conversations about school stuff. The majority of the time it's me who starts the conversation by asking ""Hey, it's been a while haha, how have you been?"" (or something similar), because my friends don't usually check on how I am. Also the fact that almost all of my highschool friends moved to Europe makes me feel like I have less people to talk to, I'm losing my friends that I've known for a much longer time. We still talk but not that much, I know they are also starting their own life on their own paths and that's nobody's fault. But I feel forgotten.
Doubt is the only thing that comes in my head constantly. Am I a bad friend? Do people care about me? Am I uninteresting?
I'm scared for my future, I doubt all the time if I'm even capable of finishing my medicine studies, it's what I love but I don't trust myself.
I have loving fathers but I still feel like a disappointment. I usually take all my frustration on my 17 year old brother. And I don't know why him. And I feel terrible afterwards. But I still call him names and make him feel bad. I even treat my friends better. I even treat my dog better... I don't do anything physical to me, but I feel like I'm a bully that lives with him.
I want to help others but I don't know how to help myself. I just found out about this subreddit a few minutes ago. I just typed ""mentalhealth"" and this was the first result. I don't know if this is the correct community, so I would thank you if you could recommend me other subreddits.
I think it's imminent that I go visit a therapist. Quarantine hasn't helped at all, that's for sure. But I wanna act as soon as possible. I haven't talked to my friends or family, but I know I should.
Thank you if you read this. I know it's a mess and my english may be a little bit broken... but I appreciate everyone who reads this."
898,"My dad used to hurt me. Physically, mentally.","When I was younger, we got into several fights. One time, he broke down my bedroom door and put his elbow on my neck against the wall. It was over the stupidest shit. I was helpless. Not like my step-mom would of done anything. She couldn’t even help herself. 

That incident happened 12 years ago. I’m an adult and can’t help but think about it, amongst the other times we got into it. It’s just the one that really sticks out to me. 

The crazy part, I told the therapist I was seeing at the time about it. They sent a child services person to my school to ask me about it. I defended my dad. Told them ‘it wasn’t as bad as I made it out to be’. 

Why can’t I get over this? I never talk to him anymore. Our relationship is stale. There’s nothing there. I really thought I’ve moved on, but it’s creeping back in. These negative experiences, thoughts, emotions. It’s a struggle. Telling me, ‘I’m weak. A pussy. Too emotional. Sensitive.’ I am those things, I guess. You were right. You won, dad."
899,"Honestly, I’m very, very confused how kids my age don’t want to kill themselves already","I don’t even know. I don’t understand. How. I realized when I was 8 that life will just be pain and suffering. Nothing good out of it. After elementary school you get kicked out and go to high school, where it’s even more stressful and things actually count there. After that you need to choose a career you don’t like but makes you a lot of money in order to survive. Go to college. Work work and feel like shit. Then go through the hell hole of finding a job and working at one. Like where’s the good in that???? Give me one good reason why I should stay alive. There’s literally nothing good in life"
900,Why do I like it when people see me smoke?,"Content warning: Self-harm

I’ve been an on and off cigarette smoker since I was 15. A particularly strange element of it was the sense of catharsis I got when other people saw me smoking when I was obviously a kid. This extends to today. Although I’m no longer a kid, I get a similar feeling catharsis when people see me now, especially people who knew me prior. 

I’ve had some ideas as to why, but don’t quite know. It’s very similar to the feeling of release I got when self-harming (especially with the cigarettes themselves) or listening to depressing music (especially when self-harming). I don’t get the same feeling when drinking with the same regularity, and alcohol doesn’t really feel like a part of me the way smoking does.

Is it a form of self-harm? Is it a way of communicating to people that I’ve got shit going on? A way of distinguishing myself from others? Maybe all three? I’d like others’ input on this."
901,How quickly everything spiraled to desperation,"I’ve struggled with addiction and/or my mental health for as long as I can remember. I had been doing really good with my mental health and sobriety for the past year but everything spiraled so quickly for me. I started feeling overwhelmed by my anxiety and stress, my wife is pregnant with our  2nd child and we are about to max out our credit cards. I became more and more depressed. I withdrew from my family and isolated more and more the worse my depression got. I ended up relapsing 4 weeks ago. I tried to stop, I couldn’t. All I could feel was shame and guilt and hopelessness and I decided I couldn’t take it anymore.  I was home alone all day ruminating and it finally became too much.  It happened so quickly it seems like an instant thinking of it now. I acted on the impulse to give up struggling and before I could give it a second thought I filled the bath and cut my wrists. 
That was 3 weeks ago tonight. 

As I watched how quickly the blood turned my bath water from clear to a dark red my life literally flashed before my eyes, I knew instantly I had made a mistake and wanted to live. I wrapped my wrists in gauze and tape and FaceTimed my dad crying that I didn’t want to die. I truly believed it was too late as I grew faint and weak.  I wasn’t going to make it and would never see me son again or get to meet my daughter. I was terrified and filled with instant remorse and was sure I had made a tragic, horrible mistake.  

I am so lucky and grateful to the paramedics who saved me. I had cut my right wrist so deep I severed a tendon, but I was saved and survived.  Why? I don’t know. I don’t believe in God and don’t know why I get to still be alive when so many others who didn’t choose to die have had theirs taken, but I’m never throwing away the gift of life again.

I have been sober since that night and going to an outpatient mental health program Mon-Fri mornings and have such a strong will to live today and I have hope for the future. 

I can’t believe how fast my life spiraled to that night, and I hope that by me sharing my experience it will give someone a second thought about giving up. 

No matter how much you’re struggling or have lost hope just don’t give up. Depression can be so powerful and make you feel and think unbearable things but don’t believe what your mind is telling you.  Things can and will get better. Start small.

1.	Put an affirmation on your mirror (even something simple like “I can do this” or “I am worthy”... you don’t have to believe it just say it every time you go in the bathroom and eventually your brain will start believing it). 
2.	Help someone else in whatever way you are able. If you don’t know where to start just ask if you can help any of your elderly or in need neighbors.  (it will get you out of your head and your problems and you will feel better about yourself for helping another person).
3.	Practice gratitude (don’t just think of what you’re grateful for. Take some time and just sit with that thought until you actually FEEL the gratitude and your motivation will grow) 

It’s ok to not be ok, don’t beat yourself up... you are worthy of love and happiness and you can do this!"
902,How do you get your parents to accept that you don't want to get married?,"I come from a very religious family. My parents can't accept that I don't want to get married. They are scared of ruining their ""perfect"" images and want all their kids to be married, make a lot of money, etc...

I just want to be happy &amp; live free. It just hurts to see my parents so disappointed and upset that I'm not who they want me to be etc..."
903,I think there might be something wrong with me.,"Hello, my name is jack and I’m 16. (Don’t turn away yet I know my age just might make some eyes roll please just hear me out.) 

I was originally thinking of making this post on mental illness but I figured here would be much better sense I’m not diagnosed by a doctor with anything. 

Ok so where do I start? Let’s get the negatives out. I’m highly likely to become an opiate addict at some point in my life. You’ve probably heard the “i got them from my surgery or I broke a bone  and I’ve never felt better!” well same shit happened to me. The only reason I’m not an addict is because I don’t have a reliable source for them. I’m  only truly happy when I’m off opioids which isn’t often because I can’t find them. (I only take prescriptions not that pressed Fentanyl  junk you see on the streets). I don’t want this post to turn into a ‘don’t do drugs and here’s why’. Believe me I know the shit I’m doing could hurt me in so many ways and not just physically. To ease some of your nerves I haven’t taken anything for quite some time. 

Ok let’s stop talking about drugs for a minute this isn’t what I intended to write 

I get sadistic thoughts. I know that’s normal for people to have. It’s just weather you chose to act on them or not. The fucked thing is the only thing that scares me from not just assaulting someone is the jail time. What the fuck is wrong with me? These thoughts usually come to mind when I see people I either don’t know or dislike. I understand why I get those thoughts for people I dislike but why do I get the urge to do that shit to people I don’t know? 

I think it’s also a good time to mention if I get bullied or if I’m looked down upon by my peers. Nope I don’t. I’m really not trying to sound like I have a massive ego but I get along very well with classmates and teachers. I’d consider to have a decent social status. However I feel fake. I hide a lot about what I really think but I won’t just say what I want others to hear. I speak my mind when I think it’s needed a lot of kids my age do really just plain annoying shit. Swear on my life the kid with an exotic hair color starts talking above 105 decibels again ima lose it. 

Lastly I wanted to talk about something recent that’s been happening. I’ve been seeing things. Not  full on distinguishable things but i often mistake certain things for blurred people there never standing still either. It’s always them walking but they never face me and believe me it scares tf out of me whenever it happens, like full on yelling.
I’ve been shaking, my hands just start twitching sometimes. I look over my shoulder for no reason at all. I’ve continued to do well in school but simple assignments are starting to take much much longer to do. It’s not because I don’t understand them it’s because I’ll just... stare? I’ll zone the fuck out I originally thought I just needed more sleep but that did not help at all. I’ve started chugging coffee by the gallon and that didn’t help either. 


I know I’m at a point in my life where my body both mentally and physically are going through some big changes but some of this stuff just seems off and I thought it might be a good idea to reach out to people who might have an idea what is going on with me."
904,so frustrated by my mental health,"i feel completely messed up. i have 4 different diagnoses and its like everything I do is just incredibly difficult. and it feels like im making this up because four different diagnoses is ridiculous for one person. but there are clearly symptoms of them all, and it still feels fake to me. and because of this, I cant talk to anyone about how i feel because it just feels like im asking for attention. i mean, what one person has depression, anxiety, ocd, AND adhd. that’s ridiculous to me to be so so far from neurotypical

recently, i got diagnosed with adhd and it feels even worse to have gotten this than to have continued living undiagnosed. because now im going back like, yeah i did that because of adhd that makes sense. and im just so angry that my life was driven by this. i dropped three different career choices because I couldn’t get anything done. I want more than anything to not take medication to just survive. I just want to not struggle to focus or pay attention. or to be able to talk to people without it being a mental hike. or to not scrub my hands bloody because of a stupid compulsion. i just want to live, not barely survive anymore. im so sick and tired of being weighted down by my own brain"
905,Something's wrong with me,"Idk man, I got some issues. 

It's almost like i'm on the brink of mental collapsation but I consistently talk myself out of it. It's pretty messed up. No one can really notice what's wrong because I'm so self aware that I can easily put on a facade. Everyone thinks i'm some perfectly normal guy, like I have no mental problems whatsoever. The one time I tried to open up to one of my friends about it, she scoffed at me and demeaned me. I'm always there for other people, but my entire life i've just felt so alone. Like no one is truly ever there for me. They come to me for advice, and that's it. People suck man. They put on this mask acting like they care but deep down they only care about themselves. I mean in an evolutionary standpoint, it's built in our genes to put ourselves above others. Whether it's a subconscious ideology or just straight up narcissism, that's how it is. 

Let's get into how I'm feeling. I'm not okay. Some days I feel great, others I feel the opposite. It could be a symptom of Bipolar, as my mom has it; but i'm not about to get diagnosed with it. I feel apathetic when it comes to myself, but when it comes to others, I feel extremely emotionally linked. Like my emotions run off theirs. If they aren't happy, I'm not happy until they are. When I say happy though, I mean more of a self peace. Another thing I feel is a mass amount of depersonalization. It's almost like i'm sleep walking through life. I feel this unending feeling of loneliness, even when I'm with a group of people. I feel like my mentality could shatter at the blink of an eye if I just stopped thinking for a second. I can't ever stop thinking. I can't allow myself to stop thinking. It's insanely annoying and I never sleep because of it. There was a time in my life where I quit all my bad habits, and did nothing but work on myself and my body for around a year. I managed my goal of gaining 30 pounds of muscle mass within the first 6 months, and honestly I still wasn't happy. I'd argue that I was a little happier than I am now, but the work was suffocating. Yes I went on breaks, but that didn't matter. I have a lot of anxiety but I definitely have that under control as I can switch certain mindsets on and off. This is probably how i'm able to fake my personality so well. I'm never happy. Honestly it seems like the only way to be happy is by lying to yourself. I know some of this may contradict other details but it is all true. I'm explaining everything exactly how I experience everything. I feel like I'm constantly shifting in and out of reality.  

I also want to strike into the reasons why I don't talk to anyone about anything. I don't know if it's a fear of vulnerability, fear of change in the way people interact with me, or just the fact that if I go to them; my advice could be seen as less mature and more shaky if that makes sense. The one thing that these 3 issues have in common, is fear. Why am I afraid of those things though? Idfk man. It's insanely immature. What I do know is, the last one is more of a self righteous fear. It stems from an idea that my advice could be taken less seriously, and therefore completely worthless.  The reason I don't seek psychological help or whatever is because I don't want to be diagnosed with anything. I feel like if I'm diagnosed, I'm gonna subconsciously integrate that into how I define myself in my head. I don't want it to seem like a problem I can't solve just because I'm unlucky. I've given up on talking to people I know about my issues, so I'm gonna talk to you guys about them.

Side note: It feels like I can switch of either side of my brain off if you know what I mean. On the other side of this thought, my mind is in complete chaos 24/7. It's so hard to explain and I feel like no one will understand but I pray to God someone will."
906,Fantasizing about beating people up?,"Sometimes I get lost in simulations of what I'd do to someone who's trying to mess with my family or friends.

It can get pretty hardcore, and i only realize when i catch myself staring into the distance with a horrifying grin on my face. 

Should i worry?"
907,Is this part of anxiety?,Sometimes I get an overwhelming feeling and it takes over my whole body. It’s really hard to explain. I’ll just be chilling in my room then suddenly I feel like I’m missing something or I need to get up do something but there’s literally nothing I need to do. My heart starts racing and I get this weird body sensation. It takes me a while to calm down from it and I always feel like I’m forgetting something.
908,I think im forcing myself to feel sad,Im not sure why im just trying to feel sad now it's just like I missed it after taking my anti represents that I just wanted to feel like that again..
909,Lost Friends,"I’ve lost all my friends in the past year. They all left for various reasons, but they left regardless. I’m not in a relationship either due to personal reasons. I don’t even have my family available for emotional support, so I quite literally have nobody. I’m profoundly lonely and depressed to the extent where I feel there is nothing I can do. Thoughts?"
910,I feel like there's nothing more to life and I have failed miserably.,My poor financial conditions and lack of any hope for getting any form of success in future has led me to believe I have nothing more to live for. I am all alone and nobody would even care if something happens to me. I just want to end my misery. I don't know why I keep on thinking about all the abuse and traumatic experiences in my past and I just want to get out of this pain. I don't know what to do.
911,Is this a panic attack?,"The first time I’ve experienced it, I didn’t know what was happening. I was crying and suddenly screaming and I felt like I couldn’t stop screaming. The second experience was slower. My breathing was building up loudly and I was telling myself to stop but I couldn’t. Then I was screaming again. I couldn’t control myself. I could feel my body trembling. I couldn’t breathe. 

Is it a panic attack or an anxiety attack? Should I get help? I don’t know how to talk to my parents about it.."

913,Friend Problem,"I feel excluded from my friends. 3 or 4 times now I've been told that different variations of my friend group have gotten together and that I wasn't invited. The first time or two with Girl E (now on, E) were miscommunications where she didn't actually tell Girl S (S) that I wasn't invited, but S thought she meant that. Which was understandable the first time given that it was for S's birthday. I was still really sad and cried over it because while I understand that it was for a special occasion, I wished she could've stopped by (me and S live on a college campus) and said hi. On the day of E told S that I could come and so they brought me with them. I felt really in the way the whole time (though I was happy to see E). Later E came again and I was sort of added last minute into their plans of which I was not originally planned into. And on the same day Friend M (M) was coming to bring S out for birthday plans alone. Me and M are not very close, but I was really happy that I got to see them. And now this past weekend M planned to come amd grab S with another friend, J. That's almost our entire friend group. I miss J and M like crazy, but they just grabbed S and told me I wasn't invited. There's no special occasion or anything. It's just because they want to see S. And I keep telling myself that If they actually wanted to see me they would have dropped by for a quick hello or invited me. I keep asking myself if they even want me as their friend. I knew I wasn't invited to their plans since Monday. I've been crying all week over it. I don't know what to do."
914,How do you deal with depression fatigue?,"Chronically depressed. Currently struggling to do more than one or two things in a day because I'm just constantly exhausted. Tried a number of anti-depressants that have helped short term. Sleep has been decent, a solid 8 hours or so but also having naps during the day."
915,I have troubles with dealing with my emotions and I need to let it all out.,"I quess I need someone to look at this from the outside, without the blockades keeping me from thinking rationaly. This may be long, not gramaticaly correct and messed up. I'm just writing what comes to my mind.

My life messed me up. Not as bad as many people, but still. I was basicaly alone. I think only mom cared enough to try her hardest. Still played a part in why I have so much problems. 

Let's start from the beggining.

Childhood. I don’t miss it at all. I was way more shy and easier to scare. My introvert nature truelly shined. Because of that I already didn't have a lot of people around. I constantly went between mom and now ex-friend for support. I was blind at their faults, how they hurt me, desperate for positive relationships. 

What about dad? He kinda wasn't there. What I missed the most was emocjonal investment. Once I just wanted a hug... he got pissed. Stayed silent and played his game. Mom had issues with yelling. Many times also looked annoyed. I never knew if I did something, were they tired, nothing. 

The rest of my family only made us miserable. Few of them were fine, but for one reason or another contact was weak. I realised one day they are simply not worth my time. It's not like they gave a shit.

Ex-friend? I thought we were close. I was stuck in a toxic ""friendship"" until I turned 15. Long story short, it was one-sided. That's how he made me feel. He acted like an ass out of nowhere, insulted my mom for an incident that was our fault, ruined the last day I got to spend with my group of friends (that lasted two years) before I moved away to a different country and could see them I don’t know when... I told him off once. It was summer after we finished elementary (12 years old). He promised to change. 

School was also shitty. Being bullied for 6 years had a huge efect on me. Teachers never reacted. I was send to the psychologist. Mom was called for stupidest things like not fitting into a stereotype was bad. I mentioned it in some post. A quiet girl (not exactly, but that later) with hood on, drawing in the corner. More interested in space or fantasy than parties or pretending to be an adult as a teenager. I'm not trying to point out how quirky I am. Just what kind of ridiculous things I was pushed away for by classmates and seemed to bother the teachers.

Well... I had nobody I trusted enough to talk to for longer than I should. Remember how I mentioned moving out? It was because of my parents divorce. I lived with mom at aunts house in Sweden. Then in mom's boyfriends apartament in Norwey. There we found a bigger place. Returned to aunts place. From there landed in Poland yet again. I was so tired of this I was crying. 

My living conditions weren't the best. 

First: my aunt - mom's sister:
She has two kids. 
The older one grew up since I last saw her and was less annoying. Actually, she was quite fun to hung out with. Even though I was around 15 and she 9. We played together - we were the characters. We laught at their anticts and cried at sad moments. She liked to listen to the stories I wrote. 

We managed to have quite mature convestations about belief. She was (not sure how it is now) Christian. But didn't flinch at one of my stories. I kinda forgot it was about Satan himself. I just grabed the notebook that had the most full pages. She was cool with it. In her opinion the relationship forming between him and the human baby boy was cute. Little one called the ruler of demons ""dad"" all of a sudden. He cried. Boy called for the servants in distress ""Uncle! Dada is crying!"". Don’t ask how many times I had to read this scene... We had a little talk later. The fact that I wasn't sure if God existed or if Satan is embodyment of all evil was fine by her. Btw, I didn't start the topic on purpouse. It... just happened.

But where is the bad part of my stay? It sounds nice! Yeah, everything else was awfull. Mom started to get mad faster. I had no privacy, since I slept in cousins room. Younger kid was a spoiled brat.

He yelled, was beating his sister, biting her. I saw her blood and tears so many times. Her arms looked like she had couple nasty cats. She was forced into playing with him. She got punished more. Her parents even made her hate eating, while little brat could rule over the house.

Second: my now step-dad
He is a great guy and makes mom happy. He is also a great father to my sister. Always treated me like his own child. My biological dad was basicaly out in almost every way back then, so... he was kinda a dad to me. The one I always dreamed to have.

But right now I'm describing the house. It sucked. I lived like Harry Potter minus the stairs. You had to leave to use the bathroom or shower. Both were is separate rooms. Since windows in the staircase were open all the time, I got sick. 

I heared everything from my room. Them talking, the tv... It was small. There was just a bed and a freezer. Nothing else could fit.  One day I cried. I couldn't handle it. I wanted to be alone. They left for a walk so I could rest. It helped a little. 

After we moved I luckly got a bigger one.

My depression was worse. I didn't wash myself for a week. I refused to go outside. I needed pills to sleep.

I found out mom was pregnant as a 17 year old. It was hard to be happy.

Skipping to when I was back in Poland. 

Due to what happened I started high school year too late. At first I was excited. I tried making friends and to keep good grades. It fell apart so fast. My will to live was going away. 

Mom's yelling reached apogeum. From nice and caring she changed into a banshee in matter of minutes or seconds. My sister was one of the triggers (waking up at night and refusing to fall asleep, being constantly on her arms...). Deep down I loved her, but hatred blocked all of the positive feelings. Just shut up, both of you. Let me have some silence, let me sleep, let me be comfortable in my own house.

I hated everything. I didn't even have her anymore. Step-dad... was not living with us then. I don’t like this subject. I was on my own.

One of the teachers noticed something was wrong. Couple more and the principle wanted to help. I was still going to a point of no return. I started skipping classes. Hiding somewhere is school. Mom had no clue. I didn't trust her. I trusted nobody. I was scared. Becoming apathetic.

Slow realization I'm trans and gay opened another Pandora box.

A day came when, while I was alone in the house, I screamed. Begged for death. I grabbed the knife. I almost hit my arm. I already met my therapist, so I called him, shaking. No answer. Suicide line. No answer. Line for depressed teenagers. No answer. He finally called back. It felt like an eternity. I was sitting on the floor in my room, far away from anything sharp.

Next day I came for an early visit (therapy). Since after mine mom was comming to ask how she can help me, I told him my home situation in great detail. I knew she wouldn't dismiss words of a profesional. He talked to her with my permission. 

My situation did a full 180. In short:

-  The relationship with my parents in normal. No, it's 
   good, really good. Even with dad.
-  I live with him now, which gave me a much needed 
   break from stress.
-  Mom also started therapy. She came a long way and I 
   am proud of her. 
-  I got a friend. And she is amazing. 

But that's not the reason of my post. I quess I got overly emotional and memories returned.

It's been three years. Three years since it all happened. 

I don’t know what is going on anymore. I thought I'm depressed. It looks like everything about me got fucked up. I still find new problems to fight.

Lately it's worse. 

I need to find a new psychiatrist. I quit taking medication, it doesn't work. Change of weather is driving me insane. I pushed myself from other people. I have even more troubles with sleep. I have weird dreams. I have less energy. My apetite got worse. For couple of days I lost my sense of taste.

I'm just stressed all day almost. Writing this is hard, because my concetraction sucks. I have no clue what I'm writing.

Due to renovations I had to temporarly move out. This new place is fine... but there is no privacy. There is only kitchen, bathroom and one room which serves as a living room and bedroom for me and dad. After two days I had enough. I hate sleeping with someone else.

It doesn't help that dad snores. I put on headphones and still heared him. Telling him to turn over constantly is pissing me off. Even when he isn't doing that, he is huffing or puffing. Often loudly. This night I simply refused to try falling asleep. I did once. Hearing him go at it again, after I woke him up minutes earlier, made me mad. I cried. I have no clue how I will not go crazy when those three weeks pass."
916,"20 Min talk with Intern, 5 with Dr and Prescribed 3 different mind altering drugs? Lexapro Trazodone and Ambilify. Overkill for depression or no?","I have had depression for several years then some friends showed caring and fellowship which brought me back from the brink.

Now those friendships and friends are brought into question.  Every interaction now questioned as either manipulation or forms of judgment and I cannot help feeling lied to and in some ways betrayed.

Even though what they tried to do was good. The fact that lies or the true feelings behind it always left some sort of doubt in my mind that they'd explain away.  This same doubt would eat at my belief in my self etc

Then this negativity that I've verified through overhearing conversation - and after I spoke when the main one found them lie and out everything on someone else as a scapegoat.

I am feeling alone and hopeless in ways I cannot fathom or out into words.  Those I used to convey would then bitch or complain behind my back and now everything they say seems some form of calculated lie.

So my depression is at an all time low.  Thankfully sucidal thoughts aren't as prevalent but they do exist.  I mean you cannot tell what is real or fake in terms of people and their intentions and you feel whatever actions you take won't matter anymore because you are so alone.

So I have had poor luck with Therpists or finding a replacement.  But saw a psychiatrist.  Or his intern, for about 20 min. Then him for another 5. 

Only to get 3 prescriptions and told to come back in 4 weeks.  

I don't really want to take meds.  I have proven at times that with support or believing my friends and family to be genuine (lost family too prior to this - deaths and their toxicity ) or just how I'm thinking and well.

I have held off taking the meds because I'm wanting a second opinion whom can delve into these things.

Rather than just resulting in changing my brain chemistry.

Tldr seeing if this is too much"
917,Can someone help me figure out what is wrong with me? Is there something else wrong or is it just BPD?,"First of all I would like to apologize because this is going to be long and English isn't my first language. 

I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was around 8. I grew up in a happy home with my grandparents and my mother, my parents weren't together but I would see them once or twice a year. He was nice to me but I never saw him as a father and we didn't have that much of a relationship. When I was 14 he disappeared, never heard of him again, it's been 16 years. I had never met his family so I had no way of trying to figure out what happened.

I don't know if it was because of my parents not being together but I remember going to school for the first time when I was 6 and feeling different than the other kids. That's when the self esteem problems started and I became shy and quiet, afraid of people. Up until then I had been an outgoing child, happy, with no issues. At this point I started having mild anxiety and felt like I didn't belong anywhere. Making friends was hard, I was friends with the other girls but I never had a best friends, I wasn't anyone's favorite. At 10 I started showing signs of OCD, I had these rituals I had to do because my brain would keep telling me that if I didn't do them my family would die. It was really bad at first but I was able to control it at the time and I lived with it ever since.

When I changed schools things only got worse, I was bullied, raped, beaten on a daily basis for two years. I failed those two years because I didn't feel motivated and I would skip class, I was also acting reckless, smoking because I wanted to fit in but no matter how hard I tried I always felt like I didn't belong. My mother decided I should change schools again and in this new school I was once again bullied every day, this time for 4 years. That had a bigger impact on me than anything that had happened before, I don't know why but the psychological bullying I was put through during those 4 years really damaged me. I was afraid to go to school and would skip classes, stay outside in the cold for 6 hours because I was too afraid to go to school. I ended up quitting.

This is when the self harming and severe anxiety began. I fell in love with an older guy when I was 16 but he made clear he wasn't interested in me and only want sex. I had never had sex before, willingly at least, and I wasn't ready, he ghosted me and for the first time in my life I felt suicidal. I was dumb enough to try to kill myself with painkillers but luckily all I got was an upset stomach. I don't know why I did this, I guess you can die of a broken heart but it felt so intense, I couldn't imagine my life without him.

Life went on, as it always does and months later I met a guy my age at a birthday party. He resembled the guy I was in love with and I 'fell' for him immediately. I think I was never in love with him, it was the resemblance to the guy I liked that made me attracted to him. We end up dating for almost three years, he was my everything. At this point I wasn't going to school and was at home, all by myself all day, he was all I had, the only person I talked to. During this time my grandfather, who was my father figure, died unexpectedly. I never told anyone how sad I was or how deeply it had affected me, I just bottled it all up until I had a massive panic attack that sent me to the ER, panic attacks were the norm from them on and I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

Back to my boyfriend of three years... One night he texted me saying he needed to talk to me. We met and he broke up with me because he had met someone new. I have never felt so much pain in my life, I remember getting home and feeling like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. For the next two weeks I fell into a deep depression, stopped eating, slept all day and whenever I was awake all I did was cry. The sadness and anxiety were so overwhelming that my hair fell off. When I noticed I had a mental breakdown and was taken to the psych ward. They didn't do anything and I was discharged. The pain was so strong that I decided to move to a different country because I couldn't imagine seeing him again or living in the same city as him. I know that's drastic but that's how I am. In less than a month I was living in another country. 

While it didn't help completely it was easy to pretend he didn't exist and that this situation had never happened. I was happy and when I came back to my own country things were easier to handle. I wasn't the same person though and years later, after taking an entire bottle of benzos I ended up in the ER and was diagnosed by the psychiatrist there with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have wasted the last ten years of my life at home, no friends, no social interactions, nothing. I can't work because I'm chronically ill and things are so bad right now that I don't even know how to keep up a conversation when I talk to another person. I feel uncomfortable talking to people, I'm afraid of them, I have always been. I have had two relationships through the years. I met them on Tinder and none of them worked. One was a psycho who stalked me and the other guy was nice, we just wanted different things. I didn't love them, I just felt lonely and wanted to have someone.

Lately I have been having a hard time beliving this BPD diagnosis. While I believe I have BPD I do think there's more than that. My feelings are so confusing and I know what I'm about to say sounds terrible but I'm my biggest fan, I love my mind, my thoughts, part of me wants to be adored, admired and I get extremely depressed and suicidal when I don't get that adoration. This happens mostly online, I always feel ignored or hated by people and it seems like everyone hates the stuff I do (edits, videos, stories)... Then there's the other part of me where I hate myself so much, I hate the way I act, I hate my appearance, I feel disgusted by it and I don't think there's a reason for so much self hatred because I'm an average looking person. I also have issues with my feelings, I will use my mother as an example, I can't tell if I really love her or if I just need her, I can never tell if my feelings are genuine or if I'm just faking them. I don't feel much for other people, I feel emotions when it comes to those who are part of my life but when it comes to other people I feel nothing, it's like I'm numb. Whenever I feel bad for someone I don't know I don't think it's genuine, it's like I force myself to feel bad for the person and then quietly pat myself on the back for being a good person.

I don't even know how to explain it and I feel embarrassed by admitting I have these thoughts but I'm struggling, I have been going through a lot this year (we all have) and my mental health is slowly deteriorating, I'm severely depressed, having suicidal thoughts, my anxiety and OCD are worse than ever and having access to a doctor is so hard right now. I'm sorry this is so long, I felt the need to give some background info to try to help people understand where I'm coming from. I'm not looking for professional advice, I just want someone to tell me their opinion based on the experiences they also have. This has to be more than just BPD and anxiety. I hope someone here can help me try to understand what's going on so I can bring it up in therapy (I'm supposed to start therapy with a new therapist in a month or two) I used to have a therapist when I was 21/22 but I had to quit because I couldn't afford the appointments."
918,I get embarrassed when people ask me about my mental health. Why?,"I get SUPER uncomfortable and embarrassed when talking about my persistant unhappiness, self hatred, and self harm. I really cringe when people label what I go through as depression but the most embarrassing topic is my self harm. I can’t figure out why I get so embarrassed.


For the record, I can go into great detail about my mental state on the internet but, I’d never be able to say half the shit I say on here to another person."
919,"I know I need to be admitted to the psych ward again, but I want to go about this in the least traumatic way possible, and I want to go to a place that isn't scary.","I've gone to the psych ward twice. First time was a 9 day stint at a nice hospital where I was treated like a human being and they really, really helped. Ideally, this is where I want to admit myself to tomorrow.

Last time I went to the psych ward, it was at the university hospital I go to for my chronic illnesses, and it was some scary shit straight out of One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm really environmentally sensitive and everything was gross, outdated, bright florescent lights, violent patients, overtired nurses who didn't seem to care.

How do I go about this in the way that will be the easiest on me? I'm terrified. I've had 911 called when I was suicidal before and the cops were straight up mean to me. They took me to the ER, who promptly sent me home and said ""Let's just see how you feel tomorrow!"" when I had a straight up suicide plan. I went home and had a 12 hour depression hibernation. 

I really can't go through any more sad or scary or traumatizing shit right now. I need to go somewhere to heal and get my fucking meds in order. I am to the point that every minute of being awake and alive is overwhelming and painful. See post history for more - my fantastic best friend wrote a very detailed thing about my health in askdocs, etc.

Please, please give me your best advice... I'm debating if I go to the hospital's ER that has the psych ward I want to go to (but then what if they're full up and they send me to the terrifying hospital?), or if I call a mental health service I know in my city who has some resources. It sucks that it's the weekend so I can't make all these calls right now.

I need a game plan so I feel more calm. I need to get well.

Thank you for your time. If you feel like you are a person with lots of experience in psych admissions etc feel free to DM me so I can give you more deets that can help further."

923,"I don’t know what I have, possibly related to OCD?","Apologies in advance if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of question. 

There’s  a topic I’ve wanted to talk about for a while but I’m not really sure how to describe it. It’s almost like I get super paranoid over “timers.” Allow me to explain.

Often, whenever I microwave something, I CANNOT stop thinking about the timer. I always have this weird countdown in my head that anticipates when it’ll be done and it’ll make the loud beep. And the worst part is, the more I think about it, the more paranoid I get about getting startled because my estimation was wrong. I know it sounds silly, but this is just one example. This feeing reoccurs through out a lot of my everyday tasks .It almost feels like everything with a timer on it is a “jump scare” waiting to startle me, and I can’t stop thinking about it because I need to know when it’s going to make a sound or whatever.

If I wake up before my alarm, I won’t be able to go back to sleep knowing that the alarm will eventually sound. I always end up needing to turn off my alarm so I can have a peace of mind. 

Heck, this even happens with animations. I remember playing a video game when I was young and I specifically avoided this one area because I literally got scared of this character sprite do a weird animation (I don’t know why, but I kept getting paranoid about it’s movement pattern). And also, not sure if this related, but whenever I’m waiting for anything, I will automatically start a countdown until whatever I’m waiting for has finished.  For example, if I’m waiting for a stoplight, I automatically create a counter in my head (10,9,8,7....) trying to pinpoint the moment it’ll turn green. Often people will ask me what’s on my mind and I don’t know what to tell them.. I can’t say something like “oh nothing, just counting down from 20.” So I usually just say it’s nothing or whatever.


I don’t know if this is normal but I feel like most people don’t think like this.

What do you guys think? Maybe I’m just overthinking this.. I’ve had a long day."
924,"How brief, overnight fame can destroy you.","My year started oddly. In February, I made national headlines after a CEO from my hometown (Tempe) called me a racial slur in my vehicle. 

[CEO fired by company he founded after video showed him shouting racial slur at Uber driver](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/06/hans-berglund-fired-uber-video/%3foutputType=amp)

[CNN: Arizona CEO Forced Out After Calling Uber Driver Racial Slur](https://youtu.be/a56l92DfeEQ)

The experience was very bizarre. It was a local story that gained international press. I didn’t expect it to be like this; I simply wanted to get Uber’s attention about the discrimination as well as racism I experience daily in my vehicle. 

What many passengers don’t know is that Uber’s support is garbage. They don’t actively listen, they are never able to solve your issues, and they tend to go against the driver when corrective action is taken. When I called support on this guy, the dude who happened to be overseas didn’t know what the N-word meant. I learned from the Local ABC reporter that Uber took no action on the man’s account until he called them.

Even myself, someone who met the CEO and emails corporate at least monthly, felt alienated since this was something I repeatedly brought to their attention. I was always told that it’s going to be fixed, nothing was ever done until after this incident. This incident was one of the many catalysts that spearheaded Uber’s Anti-racism campaign.

https://www.uber.com/us/en/u/right-to-move/

When you are in the public eye, people will have negative things to say. As a result of this incident, I’ve been told on many different mediums that

-I want people to feel bad for me.
- I’m a psycho.
- I’m a narcissist.
- I deserved it.
- I’m somehow racist.
-I’m weak and dense.
- I’m some lazy millenial.
- I’m only a uber driver.
-I’m a sellout.

It’s hard being called those things when you were already going through a breakup and became a single father by choice when this media was making rounds. When you slowly cut off connections with your family because they hate the attention and make it all about them. This is after they privately commend you for sticking up for yourself. The only person close to me that supported me through this was my twin brother, nobody else... not the mother who was the most popular person at her job because you were on World News Tonight or the sister who talked me out of making a go fund me for a nonprofit you wanted to start that would help out female drivers and Uber drivers of color. Imagine being begged by your family to stop talking to the media because they’re embarrassed. Imagine everybody making money off of your disfranchisement instead of them using what you said on camera or on the record to help start a movement that would empower minority drivers who deal with this and other forms of subtitle/ blatant racism daily. I wanted to make this bigger than me, but in the end, it only became about me. I didn’t enjoy a second of it.

I was tired of this man getting death threats; I felt terrible for his teenage daughter and his wife, who had nothing to do with this. So a meeting was arranged; we peaced it out and gave me a small financial gift towards my education since I was a senior @ Arizona State at the time. 

When people saw the word “settlement” in the news article (after I begged the journalist from the ABC station not to include it), people got angry. People thought I was making big money off of this; those people don’t know that
- I’m facing eviction
-I’m facing repossession
- I can’t pay my bills

The business has died due to COVID. The PUA ran out; my Pandemic SBA Loan was only to be used on business expenses; that money is dry. I have a 20-month-old child with who I share custody with.

A few months ago, I met with the Uber CEO and other drivers for a Roundtable meeting. It followed up with a testimonial that features myself and my infant son.

[Uber: Randy’s Story](https://youtu.be/lsiGoG2iVzw)

It was a self-esteem booster since I felt that Uber is finally listening.

I am not holding my breath. I can only hope they are since I haven’t seen anything from them that would help out all of these drivers during the roughest part of the pandemic.


I soon started to make anti-trump political content on YouTube with a production company I  started. People liked the videos, but I wasn’t able to get the views, subscriptions, and support I would expect. I ended up selling all of my gear after my car broke down last week. I can’t afford the repairs.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3sZh5TsXWaMFlITbSmN4VA

After all of that, People started to distance themselves from me. I began to feel that I’ve rubbed people the wrong way and became someone I didn’t want to be for some reason.

People don’t want to talk to me anymore. Girls get turned off when they learn of the story. Although I graduated with two degrees, I can’t get a job because of the pandemic; I do crush an interview, employers learn of this news story and don’t want to hire me.

Sometimes I simply feel that my purpose in society was only this news event, and that’s it; there’s nothing else out there for me. 

I mean, I double majored in college in political science and communication; I would only think I’m someone whose desire able in the workforce.

Sometimes I ask myself, why haven’t I just killed myself already. 

People don’t know that I’ve had Depression and Anxiety since childhood. I was never diagnosed since I was told many times by family members that “DEPRESSION IS FOR WHITE PEOPLE; it's ALL IN YOUR HEAD.” It wasn’t until last year when I got my own health insurance that I was formally diagnosed with those two mental illnesses and PTSD. 

That event was challenging, covid has been more challenging, and I simply don’t know what to do anymore.

I don’t want anyone to feel bad for me. Maybe I do deserve this; perhaps I was the problem in that situation that gave me temporary “fame.” 

To be fair, I wasn’t the most vanilla person before, during and after all of this.

I hope people read this and took something from it."
925,Am i depressed?,"Btw I am not trying to self diagnose, I am going to seek help for this. Just don’t understand what’s wrong with me or if this is cause of my anxiety 

I’ve had problems with mood swings my whole life. As I’ve started growing up and becoming a teenager it’s became a lot worse. My emotions are really powerful and it’s easy for them to overtake me. One second I can be on top of the world and it takes one thing to completely change my mood and do a 180. Even one off putting comment can change my whole day. 
I started experiencing this different type of sadness I never felt before during sophomore year. I had no friends and ate lunch alone everyday. Everyday my body just felt like i got hit by a bus and it physically felt like there was a hole in my chest. I just felt so weak. It went away for a while after I transferred to online school. 

This year has been a lot worse for me though, and even worse recently. I would never kill myself but I just want to stop existing so bad. I just wanna leave. I feel like I hate everyone. Every day is so tiring. Dealing with people is so draining. I spend 85% of my day sitting in my room on my bed doing nothing just sitting on my phone. I feel like I should do something but I have no motivation to do anything else. I stay up as late as I possibly can, usually til 5-6 am so I can sleep through the day and sleep as late as possible. I cheat on all my school work because I don’t even have the energy to sit there and watch the videos. I get angry so quickly at stupid shit all the time and it make things 10x worse. I lash out at people and it makes me feel terrible because I don’t even mean it. I can’t even imagine having to wake up every single day for the rest of my life and just have to live. I feel like my entire life has been on fast forward for months and I’m watching my life play from a movie screen and I’m not really here. Sometimes I feel like I’m watching myself from 3rd person. The days just fly by and I feel like I’m so stuck. Idk how else to explain it but just feeling empty. I rely heavily on weed more then ever now because it helps me escape from all of this for a while. I also picked up smoking cigarettes and I heavily use nicotine/vapes. Idk if this would be considered self harm as i use them because i like the way they burn my throat??? I’ve never cut myself but sometimes when I get really angry I hit myself really hard in the head.

But the reason I don’t know if this is depression or not is because this feeling lasts for like 2 months tops, sometimes a month and then I’m happy for 2 months and then it happens all over again and I get pulled back into it. I still get up everyday and do shit. When I hang out with my friends I put on a happy face and crack jokes and it makes me feel guilty like I’m faking it or something. I really honestly haven’t considered going to therapy because every time I went I was forced by my parents and I just had really awful experiences. I’ve never really opened up to my mom about this"

How do I renew my patience and be the rock she needs?
929,Scared of myself?,"My mental health is really going downhill. I’ve been struggling with anxiety, depression and self harm for years but I think I’ve never been worse than I am now.
There are so many things in my life that changed very quickly and I can’t deal with it. I never knew life could be so painful.
I feel like it doesn’t take much more before I try to do something stupid. I don’t really want to kill myself but I keep thinking “what if I don’t wake up tomorrow?” and it’s a soothing thought. I really wouldn’t mind if I got run over by a car or something. I smoke and drink a lot. I don’t value my own life anymore.
I’m scared of what comes next. I don’t want to die but I don’t trust myself anymore."
930,I finally got a job after 2 years out of the workforce and I ended up quitting after 2 days. Now I feel super worthless.,"I’m bipolar and this is triggering a massive depression phase. I feel like the biggest loser in the world. The job was too physically demanding for me to handle because I’m morbidly obese and really out of shape. I was hoping that the job itself would help change that but I couldn’t stand it. I thought I was going to faint the whole time I was there, it was horrible. I gave it my all and I couldn’t do it and I feel like such a piece of shit. My husband is going to be so disappointed when he finds out. I told all my family and friends about this job so now I’m going to have to tell them all that I quit it. I’m just embarrassed and mad at myself and all that. A few years ago I would’ve been able to suck it up and stick it out. But I couldn’t do it. It’s just embarrassing."
931,Depression,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place for this but I was having a conversation with my step brother about depression and he was saying that he has suffered it himself then I opened up to him about how I have been feeling quite depressed and he then said that I have no excuse basically because I have no responsibilities, he has a girlfriend and a daughter I am 20, the reason that it made me angry is because my mum died a few months ago and she was an alcoholic and me and my sister had to watch that

My dad left when we where young too so for him to say that just made me angry because I feel like I have every reason to feel depressed, don’t even know what I am trying to get from this post

I think I am just trying to understand wether or not there is some value in what he said to me and to be honest it really pissed me off. it’s an awkward situation because I want to have a good relationship with my family but when he says thing like that I feel like I just have to put up with it even thought I cant stand him because that is his belief"
932,Help for a friend,"I have a friend who lives in Iowa, while I am in Texas. I recently visited her to see what was going on, and I'm convinced she has schizophrenia at least, if not more mental disabilities. She has been 'off' for some time but it has gotten worse. She has very limited resources, so I wanted to see if anyone has information on free or public mental health resources there that I can direct her to or help her with?"
933,My parents affect my mental health- I might have to unwillingly see them,"My parents affect my mental health so much. I’m a 23/f if that helps at all. After I graduated high school I moved halfway across the country to go to college Hawaii and have lived there since. My sister is coming back to live here and do school in January. My mom texted both me and my husband saying how they were planning on coming with my sister. They’ve attempted before, but with Hawaii’s strict covid restrictions, they didn’t want to do the quarantine. Hawaii just opened the pretesting program but it’s still piloting. So once I saw that text, I freaked out because my mom’s a crazy control freak and emotionally abusive. It affected me so much growing up and I’m still trying to heal from it. She’s gonna want try to see me but I don’t want to see her. I’ve cut her out as much as I could, but unfortunately I’m not in a place where I can fully cut her off yet. My parents (and my mom especially) tried to stop me from marrying my husband back in March. We were supposed to get married in April but Covid got bad, Hawaii announced the state shut down, so we decided to get married that week instead of waiting until who knows when. They called us and yelled at us- my mom was livid and crying, my dad said my husband was trying to steal his daughter. My mom tried to convince me to wait until August when she thought it would be over. We got married anyways (with them on a zoom call) and then my mom tried to be all cool with my husband and brag to everyone how she has a Hawaiian son in law. Now she’s trying to plan on coming here and has the audacity to tell me to schedule our temple wedding to when they come, and so my sister can be there too. It’s not her place to tell me what to do. Like yes, I know it will be helpful since they’ll actually be here, but isn’t it my choice about when to do my temple wedding? I don’t want to get pressured by everyone else to do it, when I want to pick my own date. I’ll look like the bad guy and my mom will be mad until she gets her way. I’m done being controlled by her and I want her out of my life because all we do is fight while she tries to control my every single move. She degrades me and makes me feel stupid and worthless. She silently judges my husband for not being in school and looks down on him for being a painter and finished carpentry worker. My husband has his own damn painting business. He’s doing fine. What do I do about my mom? It seems like she isn’t really that bad and other people have it worse, but it really affects me. I’ve had people tell me that I should at least be nice to her and respect her, even if I don’t like her, because after all, she’s my mom. But I honestly can’t do it, and I don’t believe in respecting someone who has never given me respect. That’s why I avoid seeing or talking to her at all costs, and now I might not be able to avoid it.

TL;DR I moved to Hawaii away from my emotionally abusive (and many other things) parents and now they are coming here to drop off my sister at school and my mom will try to manipulate and control me. Don’t want to see parents because it affects my mental health."
934,Advice for resources about moving on from guilt?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking, but I was wondering if anyone could please share any links or resources about moving on from guilt and the past. 

Thank you so much in advance."
935,"Symptoms of OCD, PTSD, BPD, APD but where did it come from?","Currently on Fluoxetine 50mg. Started 20 weeks ago but only been on 50mg for 3 weeks. Prior to that tried Lexapro for 20 weeks. Felt absolutely nothing and still don't.

Late 40s now but I've always harboured some weirdness since primary school. Always felt different. Not in an inferior way but almost like a superiority. In high school I always thought my interests, music styles, appearance, fashion sense were way cooler than everyone else.

Then I got to that age where rebelliousness was cool so and my friends thought they were rebels (14 or 15)......they were all too lightweight for me. They never did anything rebellious except fold their collars up at the blue light disco. I on the other hand, hacked the school IT system, obtained a master key to the school for after hours access, indulged drink/drugs, didn't conform to the norms of society and then I developed a wickedly fiendish sense of deviant fun.

I was a good musician and had good looks so I had plenty of attention from girls but I was too shy and anxious to be able to socialise with them, so my drinking and drugs got worse until finally I had this false confidence and a night time persona who was mysterious, dangerous, fun, rebellious but intelligent. I was then able to be the social and sexual animal I wanted to be. This formula worked for a while.

Got thrown out of school half way through my final year with the school telling me I would never amount to anything. This still goes around in my head. I still want to take revenge on that teacher. I still haven't amounted to anything.

Eventually at age 17 I got some work, but blew my first 3 or 4 jobs before long. A deep sense of shame (maybe a breakdown or burnout) then forced me to leave home and hide away from those who cared for me in an inner city shithole. Fell into a bad hedonistic cycle of clubbing every night of the week and rejecting society during the day.

Then in my 20s came a wave of traumatic events one after the other which I felt altered my mind and personality as they kept hitting me before I had time to heal. For the next 10 years I was a horrible shallow person with addictions, compulsions and no control. I lived each day like it were my last.

Late 20s out of desperation I forced myself into corporate work, really knuckled down for 3-5 years wearing a suit every day working in a skyscraper but I felt like a rat in a cage. Eventually I relapsed into another drink/drugs/clubbing phase and had even less self-control this time around. Did some crazy shit, wasn't proud of myself built up another lot of shame.

Then in 2001 9/11 really messed me up, so I was unable to work for a few years after that. I developed major anger issues which made it really hard to drive a car without having a melt down. Eventually I got difficulties walking on a footpath. Every person would trigger me in some way. My public outbursts started to scare me.

Since then I've never held down a job for very long, I alienate people, I prefer to be alone, I obsess, I find flaws in everyone, I have no trust for humans and I am cripplingly critical of everyone and everything.

Been on meds all 2020, been doing CBT therapy for these ""schemas"" that I have but nothing seems to work. The CBT makes me feel like I'm acting. My psych tells me to force myself to engage in social situations, well I tried it yesterday and I seemed really dishonest ""hey good to see you"" when in fact I was dying inside. Then after it I was completely drained. I nearly collapsed from exhaustion. CBT forces me to act like everything's OK which puts me in draining situations, then I walk away feeling sick from the experience.

I feel like CBT is just teaching me how to ""band-aid"" my schemas which makes it such a load of shit. It's not fixing the problem, its just burying it. I find it odd that my doctor and psych aren't interested in ""diagnosing"" me but just trying to cover the symptoms.

From anyone's experience......what is wrong with me?

At first I thought I was just depressed with anxiety, but then I read about the various bipolars and could identify with ultra rapid cycling bipolar. But then, because I've had 3 major burnout cycles followed by bouts of hypervigilance and perfectionism I thought I had OCD. I had a lot of loss, sadness and rejection as a child so it could all be because of PTSD. I'm always right and I'm always correcting and ""teaching"" people so I have a bit of NPD. But then I also appear to have APD or BPD.

How can I ask my doc and psych to help me find what came first? I need to know what is causing what."
936,Is it ok that i like spending time alone ?,"I was en extrovert, but suddenly became an introvert and I love it.

I really do enjoy spending time alone and not talking.  Even at work I love spending time alone and sitting quietly. A small part of me wants to socialize, but its a really really small part of me.

I just want to know is this normal ? Should i get worried about being an extreme introvert ?"
937,How do yall do that?,"How do you feel good about yourselves? Like im kid 14f but i feel like crap all the time. I dont like myself. I feel like im always being a horrible person. I know i am. Im a scholar and school is such a btch. Everyone expects me to be perfect and i start doing that too. So now whenever i fail at some things, I slowly hate myself gradually and think everyone hates me too."
938,What happened to me last night?,"It started out as intrusive thoughts about being abused by my father but, as it went on it became something else. I eventually began to shake and I believed that if I slept in a certain position that my father, who's been dead for 4 years, would come out of the darkness and start abusing me again. I've never experienced anything like this before, what was this?"
939,"Why do I want to hit my head when i get angry, upset or annoyed?",Like wtf is that I don't act on it but the urge is really strong to?
940,Is it normal to be suicidal as a child,HI (And sorry for my english) When I was a child (about 6 to 10 years old) I started thinking about death a lot. I remember wanting to be a fly so I could only live a few days. I was thinking about the best way to kill myself without hurting my family. Every night I was crying because I imagined my mom and dad crying on my funeral when I woke them up they asked me whats wrong and I just told them I don't know. I realy wanted to die without hurting my family. Is it normal in a such a young age? I never attempted suicide because of the same reason but I am still kinda suicidal. I had some mental issues when I was young like strong ADHD mild symptoms of autism etc. but I still dont think this is normal.
941,"Movember, men’s mental health","Hey everyone! I hope everyone is doing good, I’m not sure if this goes against guidelines but here we go. Some of you may know what movember is and some many not, it’s a month (November) where men/women grow out their Moustaches to support Men’s health. I’m participating in it and would like to ask for you support, even just donating $1 could go along way. The goal is to to reduce male suicide by 25% by 2030. In average (in Australia) 6 out of 8 suicides are by men. This is a big topic in my life as I have struggled with thoughts and emotions. It would mean the world even if you share the link to see how much money we can raise for men’s health. Thank you guys and I hope everyone has a good day :)

942,How do you study?,"How do you all study when you have an episode?
I feel emotional and cognitively impaired  when I have an episode, which makes understanding anything impossible.
[I have BPD + Bipolar (worst tag team ever)]

(waiting an episode out is currently not an option because my current episode's already gone on for 3 days continuously and I've got exams)
I've got to do well in the exams because I've got to get into college based on some merit (the minimum criteria atleast).

Is it viable to think that I will become fine after a few months (or years) and be able to learn again ? (if not at my pre-illness efficiency).

Will I be able to do a memory taxing degree ?(that would require me to study 6-7 hours a day) or should I go with something easier?"
943,How do I talk to a doctor about mental health?,"Recently I've noticed that I'm struggling a lot more than I have been - the last time I felt like this was five years ago, and my doctor put me on medication to help. For the last two years I have been off my medication, and for a while things were good. But now, not so much. I really don't remember how I spoke to my doctor the first time, or even how I made the appointment in the first place. Among other things, I'm feeling incredibly anxious about talking to people about how I'm feeling, so I'm worried that even if I do make an appointment I would mess it up and not get across what is actually happening. I'm not even sure if this is the right sub, but any advice would be greatly appreciated x"
944,Mushrooms saved my life,"I’m not recommending anything to anybody, I just want to share that for me, a trip on Liberty caps, after a day of a juice and water fast, very moderate dose of two stems and two caps. I was guided by a friend who is experienced with this and also happens to have been a psych nurse. We went to a beautiful wilderness area. The trip snapped me out of my depression and my anxiety is much less now than it was. The effects have lasted over 18 months now and the dark thoughts/depression has not returned although I still have difficult stuff to deal with and the situation could depress anyone, really. But I deal with things better. Like I say, not recommending anybody do this, (disclaimer blah blah woof) but it helped me enormously, took only a day and a night camping, cost about $12 for the dose of psylosiben (I’m not spelling that right) and $20 for gas and food. I threw out all the anti depression and anti anxiety meds that had nasty side effects, were addictive, required lots of doctor’s visits and tests, and didn’t work! I don’t take them anymore. I feel a lot better, it opened up my mind and heart in the places where I was stuck. I don’t know how else to describe it. I hope this post helps people to understand that the old native ways should not be discounted and dismissed so much and medicine and mental health treatment must not be politicized. I’m glad I went looking beyond the mainstream for help. One guided vision  quest facilitated by that natural medicine, away from the city, in the wilderness-for me, that was all I needed. I don’t understand why more people don’t get this treatment. Oh, duh! Greed of big pharma I guess. Just my 2 cents."
945,Attempting to learn how not to self sabotage when it feels necessary.,"I'll be okay but right now I'm not okay. Another journey into the abyss of self destruction leaves me contemplating my actions. I could've responded better. I didn't need to torch everything (metaphorically speaking). I didn't need to answer the call of self destruction just to get me to through that hour. I've been here before. It's so familiar. You would like I enjoy piecing myself back together the amount of times I take myself apart. Truth is I don't enjoy it but for some reason it's necessary for me learn and relearn the error of my ways before it's impressed upon me how quickly everything around me can descend into chaos. At the drop of hat things can change and I guess this simple fact continues to catch me off guard. It's not all bad. I've had close to as many positives to even the score but what's a positive with a negative lurking around the corner? 

I need to do better. I've waiting 4 years for the good news I've received last month and being so close to the finish line where everything is about to completely change for better the last thing I need to be doing is actively making a shit situation x10 worst than it has to ne. I'm gradually, one speed bump at a time learning how to be okay with not being okay. It's a foreign concept to me because my default programming is to fix any problem asap. When it comes to negative emotions that doesn't apply unfortunately. Or at least my method of fixing by blowing out a small flame isn't working. It's just burning everything around it faster as opposed to letting it burn itself out. 

Subconsciously I expect perfection. I don't anticipate things going wrong. I get complacent in good things occuring because for the majority of the past decade it's been bleak. Since that I've overcome most of that I didn't anticipate having to transform again this soon. Parts of how I view the world aren't working for me, clearly. I need to discard any aspirations of perfection and be mindful of the possibility of both catastrophe and celebration. And also how to be when neither of those are happening. When it's just the middle ground.

If I have a broken window and I burn the house down, the broken window isn't the only problem anymore."

I've gone through enough pain in the past to not want to look for it actively (rather hoping that it would come to me when I don't expect it). I'm trying to be strong every day and just focus on establishing my career, but I sit here and feel sick to my stomach sometimes just thinking about how alone I seem and how purposeless everything is."
951,I don’t get upset anymore with thoughts of suicide,"Posting on here not for the sympathy, but only because I don’t have anyone I can talk about this to. I just can’t handle life anymore, it’s not like I have a horrible family or any abuse in the past to complain about, it’s just me and my over thinking mind with the fact that I can’t speak anything mental heath with my family because I’ll just be told “we all have stress” or “I wanna kill myself too” I’ve been feeling suicidal for a while now and when I ever got thinking about doing something, I would get upset thinking about wanting to kill myself, but for the past year, I don’t get upset thinking about it anymore, I’ll even go into detail of possible ways but idk, I’m fucked up and I don’t know how to change that."
952,I'm terrified of something happening. Should I isolate myself from the problem or keep checking to make sure it hasn't happened yet?,"I'm kind of ashamed of this so I'm going to be vague and I'm just going to refer to it as a ""thing"". I'm not comfortable being specific because this ""thing"" because it's not a big deal at all, definitely not a normal thing to be upset about. It started as just an afterthought but now I've become less accepting of even an insignificant form of this ""thing"" happening. I don't know the chances of it happening, whether it does or not, and it's not something I can ever prevent. The chances of it happening or not is both reasonable but I think it's likely to happen in some form. I've spent months being so paranoid and just shit-scared of this ""thing"" that I've gradually let it get to me even more and I just can't accept this possibility of it becoming real. It could happen sometime tomorrow or in the next 5 years. If this ""thing"" happens, I'll be so hurt because it just could have not and I'd be ok. Should I distance myself from this ""thing"" to avoid getting hurt? or should I see what happens with the chance of getting relief."

So many people act sickeningly sweet because they know it gives them upvotes and makes them look good. There's so much virtue signalling it makes my skin crawl.

Just once, I want someone to talk straight with me.

Call me a fucking retard if I do something dumb. Joke with me. Don't sugarcoat your opinion. I WANT to hear it. Don't give me those heartless 'loving' quotes like ""It gets better"" when you don't really mean it. EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU DON'T MEAN THE THINGS YOU SAY.

Genuine comments on this website just hit different. They stand out because they are so fucking rare.

I don't want people to get mean! I just want them to really speak their mind. I want honesty. Be polite. Be decent. But don't be afraid to be straight up.

I dunno. I feel like the reddit conversation 'culture' is lowkey bad for my mental health. I feel like I'm speaking with robot housewives from the 50s. Everything must be perfect. No swearing. No intimacy. No heart. Just play happy families forever. Fuck that shit.

This isn't directed towards anyone in particular. I know I'm guilty of it too. This sub is one of the better ones. It's FULL of platitudes (oh god, so many), but there are also lots of people here who genuinely care and it shows in their lovingly crafted and imperfect comments. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

Lmao Want to hear something ironic? I trust 4chan users more than this place. Here, people act nicer to the detriment of everyone around them. People put each other down to make themselves look good. On 4chan, people act meaner to the detriment of others. It's easier to deal with. And the nice comments shine like gold."
957,possible personality disorder? idk im really not sure i just wanna know why i feel this way.,"So ever since i was little (like 6-8) i’ve always felt like being a different person every single day, like everyday i would romanticize being a different person and i would make up a name, a personality, and an appearance and imagine myself like that, next day it would be a completely different person. Ever since i started using social media i always deleted my accounts and made new ones every week pretending to be a completely different person behind a different name, and a completely different personality. i always find myself talking to these different personalities in my head, like ill have one of them who’s name is addison, who is a quiet and chill dude talking to another personality named maya who is an upbeat girl. this whole thing also makes me question my gender identity every single day, one day i am feminine and only use she/her, next i’m enby, next i’m male, next i just use every pronoun and i cant keep telling my friends that i want them calling me by a different name every single day. its like i feel detached from who i actually am and i just make up these characters in my head. even when i was a kid i would stay up all night talking to these characters/personalities and i still do today, everyday and its seriously effecting my sleep schedule. i just feel like a completely different person every minute, sometimes with internet friends i’ll disappear on them completely and show up pretending to be a different person because i don’t want to lose them but i’m not the same person. like the idea of running to a different country and changing my name every single day doesn’t bother me, if anything it sounds amazing. i don’t know whats wrong with me, is this a thing everyone does? cause none of my friends understood me when i told them about this, it’s genuinely hurting me and the people around me and i at least want to know what it is. i don’t have access to any therapists or anything cause of family issues so this is the best i could do. if anyone could help that would be great. thank you!"

960,why am I like this ?,"hi !
(i'm 14, also sorry for my bad english.)
so I've been feeling weird since 2-3 years ago. 

at the beginning, I was feeling really down, sad and everything. I cried everyday for months for no particular reason. I guess, I just felt so pathetic. and I would get better, but ""it"" ( not sure about the word in english...?) would always come back after a month I think?

Then I had my first panic attack, it was horrible, it took about 50min to stop...Shortly after I had a couple of anxiety attacks because I was so scared that it would happens again. I've never wanted to k¡ll ms more than back in these days.

Anyways about 3 months after, I started to feel extremely happy sometimes, i'm like really excited for nothing. It's like the best feeling in the world, it's like I can do anything...I can't really explain...but then I would have these sad ""episodes""? Can't explain it, but it's a bit depressing, and I felt even worse when I thought about other people who have hard times, but that i'm the one being sad. It doesnt seems right... but anyway I wanted to k!ll ms very often. I also tried but stopped because I thought maybe if I did my family ( at that time my mom was sick) would have to go through the same thing as me because of me. 

Then It just alternate(is that a word???) over and over again, i'm tired. I also feel like i've lost empathy and some other feelings. I don't really want to go anymore to be honest cause I feel like its gonna hurt but if I could have a fast and painless death that would be the best thing in the world. actually I just wish I wasnt born. i'm a bit selfish yeah... i'm like the most useless thing in the world.
i'm just bothering everyone and thats why people ignore me maybe.

thats the first time i actually talk about it so im nervous. but please help me?? I don't know why im like that and i dont know what do i have ? i mean if i have something...? I dont think thats normal?"

the people my age at work exclude me. i don't know why they don't like me. i try to be nice but no one is interested in being my friend. they only talk to me when they need help.

i have nobody. i cant help but think that im a horrible person and no one will ever like me. i don't think i'll ever feel better.

i live alone so if something happened to me, i don't think anybody would find me. im not sure if that is a good thing or not."

963,"Trigger Warning: Mental issues, self-hate, self-degradation, confusion, desperation etc. Vent.","I feel like absolute shit. I can’t do this anymore. Why do I keep fucking thinking that I’m traumatised when I’m clearly not?. I wish someone could just give me some fucking answers, tell me the truth about me, tell me what’s wrong with me? Different about me? What’s going on with me? What’s been going on my whole life? Inform me on the answers to the mysteries I always have to ponder. This fucking hurts. I fucking HATE myself and my past and who I am and what I am and fucking everything about me practically. I’m beyond disgusting, perverted, tainted, tarnished, ruined, humiliated, dirty, shameful, a ****, bad and evil and self-serving, weak, stupid, needy, ungrateful, a spoilt brat, a villain of the world, the shame of the world, the worst that the world has to offer, a monster, an animal, other things, I should’ve suffered so much more than I have, especially when I was a kid. I was a fucking DISGUSTING kid. I deserved so much pain as a kid. I still do. God I can’t take it. I don’t deserve anything. I don’t deserve posting this. The fact that I’m even doing this is fucking shameful and disgusting, I’m allowing myself something that I do NOT deserve.... I want to talk about how when I was twelve, I think I came to the realisation that people were always going to treat me badly, because I am just inherently different and things that are inherently different, built differently, just make people react badly towards them. And then everything changed. It was a turning point. Although I don’t know what I meant by people treating me badly anymore I know I am in fact fundamentally different from everyone else. I just wanted to write this down because I think about it so often. God I’m a fucking pig in a pig stye. Fucking hell. But before that I think I had issues too, it just was different to when I turned twelve. I remember in my early childhood having a sort of madness I think, there were things to be known that I knew and did not know, did not understand, but I always believed in it, identified with it, even found comfort within it. This madness I emotionally knew and didn’t know, something a part of me but beyond me as well. I can remember things like this from my early childhood the most. I just want someone to give me some answers."
964,How do I fix a small hole in a door?,"Hi, um im not really sure if this is the right place to ask this. And if its not please please tell me so i can ask somewhere else more appropriate.

If anyone knows how to... Please do :)
Thank you.

965,I don't know if i'll ever get through this,"I've been in survival mode for the past few months now, just barely holding on, ignoring the suicidal thoughts at night time. 
I thought going back to live with my parents would solve things, so I did. Nothing's changed. I've lost interest in everything, I try my best to put effort into my studies but it's not getting anywhere 
I'm still so hung up on that one dude I met and broke up with like months ago, which makes things so much worse. Usually I'm not like this during breakups, it's just I was in a bad place and he was the only thing I held onto. I still can't let go.

it's not helping that he called me a few days ago, said he loves me and then just ghosted me after that

I honestly feel like this is how it's gonna be for the rest of my life. Hung up on this one guy thinking he's my ""soulmate"", that he's the only one that gets me and accept me for the fucked up mess that I am. 

All I do now is smoke, listening to the songs we just to share while thinking of him. In doing so I forget about the things that fucked me up and the people I've fallen out with, which are just reminders that my life isn't going anywhere. 

I'm exhausted. Mentally."
966,It just feels like everything is out to get me,I know that isn't true but the minute something good happens to me nothing but horrible thoughts just flood my head. I do my best to brush them off and tough it out. But I get so tired and drained doing that all the time. There are times where literally nothing going on to trigger my anxiety then boom I am miserable. Like i have a job and a girlfriend. But for some reason my brain makes me think that I am always screwing up. I cant even have a conversation without feeling like that person hates me after it. I am scared when I talk to my girlfriend about this because I feel like a burden. I honestly just suffer all the time because of this. I guess I am just asking if anyone else is like this. Or for any advice on how to get through it.
967,Dealing with complete isloation,"Hello all. I've been on a pretty good run Mental health wise. I emerged from depression and got off my meds around a month ago. However, I've been facing a significant challenge as of recently.

My brother came home one day infected with Covid-19. I currently live with my family, and it was a couple of days of contact with him before the news came forth. I was the most likely person that he may have passed it on to. As a result, I have been isolating in my Room/Study. We all agreed that it is the best course of action, since we don't want to risk passing it on to other members of the house.

So it has been 3, maybe 4 days (I lost count) of my being totally 100% isolated from any human interaction. Food is left outside my door on a tray and I am left to my own devices. I am starting to feel that deep sense of dread re-emerging, characteristic of my depression.

It's hard literally having no interaction with people, as well as the worry that I could be infected with the disease (I have Asthma and a Sensitive Immune System which complicates things and adds to the concern).

So I suppose my question is this: What can I do to make this time more bearable, and hopefully stave off the depression until the isolating period ends?"
968,Idk feeling shit,"I don't get what's wrong with me. I can feel normal sometimes, or really bad or really good. It comes out of nowhere and I don't know how to control it. Super frustrating, and it makes me scared about my future like will I get into uni or will I get a job or will I have a family etc. When I'm feeling normal I know I would be able to do all of these things but then my mood changes and it seems like everything will be really terrible and sometimes really good... I don't know why I'm like this. My emotions are currently starting to go downhill"
969,"PTSD makes me hate myself before my boyfriend can, it's like a race I'm programmed to win","I have PTSD and I can't handle guilt, I can't handle making a mistake and I can't handle being in trouble. It's because I'm scared I'm going to die. Because in my previous relationship every transgressions I made would be met with threats of violence, starvation, actual violence, suicide attempts, theft of my money and theft of my car and theft of my body. I spoke over the top of my boyfriend today and I feel like a monster. I feel like I don't deserve to.live and my anxiety is through the roof. I can't relax or act normally around him because I'm anticipating some kind of pay-back. I know these thoughts are irrational because I am in a new relationships and he's a really amazing man and has never threatened me at all. 

Guilt physically hurts me, does that happen to anyone else? I have a stabbing pain in my throat and I feel like I can't breath and then the pain turns into hands around my neck and I'm down the rabbit hole of another flash back... 

All because I snapped at him. I don't think it's fair for him to have to comfort me after expressing his honest feelings. I worry that my reactions will prevent him from speaking up about his feelings in the future. I love him so much and I just truly hate myself for causing him even the littlest bit of pain. I feel absolutely worthless. I feel like I deserve to die. Or I should try and find him a new girlfriend. Someone prettier and less fucked up than me. Would that be enough? I feel like if I stabbed myself a thousand times in the chest it still wouldn't be enough. 

I am so so so sorry. I'm sorry I snapped at you. I'm sorry I made you feel unheard. I'm sorry I cried when you told me. I'm sorry I haven't stopped crying. I'm sorry I haven't told you why. But I can't handle the thought of causing you anymore pain and I want to give you the space to feel hurt and not overshadow or dominate it with the way I am feeling.

I'm sorry I'm posting this online instead of talking to you. I hope if I can write my guilt down it will fade and I can make another attempt at being a functionable adult again. And you won't have to share my pain. I love you so much and I promise I am trying to get better."

971,Where did these socks come from? Am I being paranoid?,"So last night I left my apartment with my SO around 16:30, and right before we left I said 'oh I should change socks' and opened my colourful sock drawer (I have one drawer for plain black and one for FatFace patterned ones). There was hardly anything in there, which I commented on to my SO, then opened my other drawer and took out some black socks. 

This morning I wake up and my colourful sock drawer has got an extra pair of red ones AND three new pairs that I got ages ago sitting folded (in the way only new socks are) on top. I would have remembered putting these in as I would have been excited to see I have a few new pairs (as I said, I'm running low). SO has no idea about it and swears he didn't put them there.

I've made a list of everyone with keys to our place (maid, family) but between 5pm last night and 10am today I can't find any reasonable explanation why anyone would be in my apartment messing with my socks?? I can't stop thinking about it and spiralling."
972,"Today my (18, male) longtime friend (18, Male) came out to me as trans. I am in denial.","Hello all. The past few days my friend has texted me for my attention but never mustered up the courage to say what he needed to. Tonight he finally did. He simply said “I’m trans” and assured me that he was serious. However, I really don’t know about that. I’d support him no matter what, but I feel in this day and age gender dysphoria is a huge coping mechanism among depressed teens. He had attempted suicide about a year ago, and has shown signs of mental issues, with crazy ideologies and such. He never showed any signs of not feeling like he was himself, and did have a girlfriend who emotionally abused him. I don’t know, I’ve seen far too many transgender people who regret it, and far too many transgender teens/young adults who end up committing suicide. Whole I know there are people in this world who genuinely feel like they aren’t born with the right identity, I truly think this is some sort of new age coping mechanism, and I feel like it will only make my friend more mentally confused, leading to an actual suicide. As selfish as this sounds, I am heavily introverted and really prefer being by myself, and have considered slowly leaving my friends behind even before my friend came out to me. Am I in the wrong for that? I really don’t think I have the mental capacity to make sure my friends’ mental health is ok. I’ve got a lot on my plate as it is with nobody to vent to but myself. Either way, should I advise my friend that it could just be a coping mechanism and to make sure he is 100% sure he is a female? Or is that completely wrong to do? I really feel like he’s at the end of the rope at that point. I hope I’m wrong, and he becomes happier."
973,I can’t cry anymore,"From a couple of days, whenever my parents shout at me or belittle me or irrationally get mad at me, I can’t bring myself to cry physically. 

For instance, just right now, my dad raised his voice and got angry that while parking, I parked a little close to the road for his liking. My uncle and aunt were with us and when we got off, she asked me if something was wrong. I shrugged it off, but felt a lump forming in my throat and I swear I could feel tears welling up. I thought I’d just go to my room and cry silently, as I usually do. 

But as soon as I entered, the tears just didn’t come out. I don’t know what is wrong with me. (I mean, apart from my dysfunctional family and my depression and my declining mental health lol)
But I used to be able to cry at small things and I can’t cry at all now. 

Seems like I can’t do anything right. 🤣"
974,"Used to be anxious, did not really do anything to fix it, it just went away. Should I be concerned?","I know this might sound like a good thing, but should i be concerned for something deeper like depression or something?

I am in medical school and since high school i used to have anxiety about every test i took up until the end of my first year of medical school. Now I am in my second year of medical school and I literally never got anxious or stressed anymore. I even try to get a little bit stressed so I can care more about my exams so I would actually study more. I am too carefree to the point where I barely study (luckily still passing though- I think i've just gotten smarter at studying?).

Another thing that used to stress me out were romantic interests. Before when i was talking to a guy I would be anxious like omg does he like me does he not? Now I dont really care if I am rejected. I do feel sad but i get over it way faster than before and I dont really try too hard to make them like me. My attitude is more if he does he does if he doesnt he doesnt.

This sudden change in my own attitude is kind of freaking me out like I did not get on any medications or really change anything so I am really confused?

I don't necessarily feel depressed, I do feel sad at times because of the pandemic and feeling lonely and such but i've definitely dealt with depression in the past, and I am definitely not as sad at all.

Has anyone dealt with something similar/ know what might be going on? Slightly worried lol"
975,Why don’t I enjoy life?,"I don’t think I’m depressed. I go to uni every day and get top grades so I have motivation(and somewhat enjoy my studying) but I get back from uni and there’s just nothing I really want to do. I play video games and exercise to pass the time, but I don’t think I truly “love” these things. I don’t enjoy the everyday grind of study, chores, cooking, exercise and sleep. I don’t see myself killing myself anytime soon but I’m just confused. Does anyone actually enjoy living?"
976,I've been withdrawn from society and i'm ashamed of it,"2020 was a fucked up year for me, I got into 2 toxic relationships, one of them actually started with me being raped while i was blacked out drunk and I just ended up sleeping with him again. so yeah...

Overall, messy messy year, fell out with some people, got drunk wayy more than I should (fortunately was still smart enough to not got into drugs). Now I've gone back to living with my parents but I'm still recovering from most of the things that happened. 

I don't go out much often anymore, I don't dislike human interactions but I try to steer clear of it. I still call my friends once in a while to help them with our studies but overall, not much socializing. A large part of me just wants to stay home, play video games, read and keep up with uni. I'm still a bit scarred and just overall hesitant to be around people I don't know too well, or just people in general. 

I don't know if it'll pass, but I don't think I can stay like this. I'm still 19 and there is so much left to experience. I have friends that are super outgoing and they were basically horrifying when I confessed I haven't left the house in weeks. 

Idk if it's the trauma but I'm a lot more socially awkward than how i used to be. I just want to withdraw from everything and just physically disappear."
977,Personal development over the past year.,"It's nice to meet everyone here I have accomplished a great feet for myself as a person.
I finally moved out and away from family and with my boyfriend.. 
But there are some negatives I guess I couldnt spot with my naked eye. 
So I have been with family for the past four years and I'm 21yrs old at the moment  this was ""due to epilepsy"" 
I live in the bible belt where everyone is either a trust fund kiddy that lives of mom and dads wealth or a rough neck that's been partying and trailer hopping since age 10... 
To elaborate on how complicated I believe my problem is I feel as though I am not allowed to have an opinion on my parents. 
I know I was an isolated kid and treated like a possession (I'm kinda forced into denial about every other form of neglect)
And daddy rewarded me with food so I'd shut up. 

I also know my parents and most of my family dislike but ""dont hate gays"" I dont remember coming out to my dad. 
I know what happened with my mom. 
I think my dad asked if i needed a hooker. 
I was like 16 i think and my mother just hovered over the idea of my gayness until graduation where she took ""graduation photos"" that where suppose to make my ass pop out. 
I have no Idea what her intentions were and she was being lewd. 

My situation now has led up to leaving moms to my grandparents on dad's side and you could call it disowning most of my family even though my father and my grandmother have forced their way into texting and calling. 
My grandmother wanted a ""wellness check like I was in trouble or needed help"" not the most selfish thing one of them have done but ridiculous considering I went to their house for shelter and they can't pick up on me just wanting peace and quite cause they need to see the house, buy shit, and even wanna pay Bill's and I'm not and won't let them but it pisses me off they assume it's something they have a right to its mental. 
I could tell you about the rest of my delusional family and how they compete and gossip over one another but that's different.

I never expected to start dating my friend until sometime this past April when he came out to me. 
I loved him in many ways and do now I just have never been connected sexually or atleast romantically really at all. 
I suppose my sexuality was brought on by depravity? 
But I dont know I digress. 

He recently got upset and apologized that we dont have enough sex and it's not long enough. 
I'm the bottom and anals a little rough for me maybe because I was born either constipated or because I have family with bowel problems that could be genetic. 
But i think he knows i enjoy sex i love foreplay but i also think I'm scared of having gay sex and most sex in general cause everytime I've downloaded grindr or tinder that shit got deleted. 
Last night was good though... I think I made up for it. 
I also think when we started having intercourse we started either to early or I was to straight forward to soon about my interest in submission. 
I haven't been able to handle him come onto me it  doesn't feel safe like dignified. 
Other things are okay like I talked to him about groping I love it but I feel degraded by being asked  something about sex directly.  
""You wanna get fucked."" 
""Wanna get clean for me."" 
Just things feel like commands even though I should like it it's what I asked for and I told him I needed a change in attitude and kink so that's chill but I dont know if my heads fucked or not. 

I started chuckling a little at uneccesary moments. 
Not at funny thoughts or I dont even think nervousness but it seems like stress. 

I just got a job after two months of unemployment. 
Maybe 3. 

My bfs been regretful cause he feels like he's been taking stress out on me. 
He has a really shitty job that PAYs lots. 
So we dont question it yet really but he had a breakdown and he seems to be better like morally or he told me he wants to be more thoughtful in a way. 

I can tell his boss is a fucky shit head.
His boss has basically given him his left overs and the slight disapproval of high up managers he barely knows. 

He drives around feeling like a dick asking people to pay for unpaid bills. 
Sometimes for 7hours to all 11hrs and at times has to get a set amount of people done. 
He also got in a crash the first week on the job. 

Its fucked him up me being unemployed even though I just recently started running out of savings. 

I know i am just starting with life but the problem being. 

Its led up to these facts. (Relevant or irrelevant to what I said I have memory problems.) 

I have problems with sex that either turn me off or have to do with enjoying it sort of in the euphoric way you normally would it's mostly just jacking off with another person's help nothing exciting about it. 

I have no real idea what I'm doing not even in life but in a commited relationship that I've told my self for years are equivalent to hell on earth. 

My feeling are muted in alot of ways but I know how they feel and there just isn't enough time to fix that I guess meditation helps but the sensation of sadness, happiness, scared are all just responses. 
Anxiety, anger, positivity and being useful are the only things I worry about. 

I'm a sentimental person and I have finally found people that just tell me that kind of shit out of the blue and I've wanted to make other happy for a long time. 

I have also never understood my moral disdain towards money though I get I was raised by  Christian's and that's the root of most of that stuff and my lack of understanding. 
I'm mostly using money as an example. 
But if I have an abundance of it I dont need I have no problem giving it out or using it on friends or others. 

I love getting high and have found the drugs that dont affect my epilepsy *non light sensitive tonic clonics* 
And have tried ALMOST everything in the book. 
Dont plan on trying crack. 


Like my personality as a kid went from liking and doing things skateboarding, videogames, tv, music. Going to the theaters and other places you would with friends but at some point my dad decided I didnt need friends anymore and I didnt want to be like that so I found new interests. 

Idk I guess I came here to say everything to see if someone could try and give some kind of evaluation on the internet! 
Because I guess I'm antisocial or some shit and I'm tired of talking to rude ass therapists that I know are to professional to be real about their job and more about their pay. 

I really am just only happy when I'm stoned or on acid or some shit and nothing else really matters when I'm back to earth. 
I can drink like a sailor and then I feel like I'm being shamed (when I know I'm not) for doing so because deliriant and depressants are bad for me.. 
I have told someone about that before feeling like I was shamed and they made it sound like it was psychological or schizoid.  
It's more of a situational thing because I never had the privilege to be stupid, party, go out or anything as a kid or something idk. 
I try to explain to people that self medicating doesn't help with the pain obviously but I was one of the few kids that didnt really literally get to be social or a wild child. 

My social distancing as a child was so bad that I took random pills and huffed things to pass time. 

I'm going over the whole isolation bit again but it's hard to add details to one thing when you are typing a life story for no reason. 

So I guess I'm done I dont really know if I said enough or if I even said anything. 
I just needed to get it out but I hope someone helps me figure out what's up."
978,How to get over an ex,"I’m a sophomore in college. My freshman year I fell in love with someone and it didn’t work out. The breakup was very very not mutual, as I woke up one day and found that he blocked me. Ever since then I feel as if I am very sick all of the time. I haven’t had a single good dream since February. I also have a hard time finding anyone else that attractive. Anyone else but my ex I pick apart until I find something I don’t like. I don’t even want to do it, it just happens without me thinking. Yesterday I saw my ex out in public and I had a panic attack. It is the worst thing I’ve felt in a while. And I hate this little conflict. I love him and would do anything for him but the sight of his face makes me angry and afraid. The whole world feels dark again and I just don’t want to do this anymore. Everything is too painful to the point where sometimes I can’t even get myself out of bed. It’s been nearly a year since this all has gone down, and I don’t think it should be as big of a deal as it is. I’ve never felt like this in my life before. It is as if a loved one has died, if we want to put my grief on a scale. I’m mentally sick to the point where I just don’t eat anymore because I don’t wanna and I have no sense of self preservation. I don’t have any hope anymore. I don’t know what to do but I feel that I am running out of time and energy before I shut down for good."
979,I think I might have bipolar disorder,"Now before I say anything I'm 14 and further looking into this was prompted by one of those quiz websites that said that I probably had it even when I was on another thing. If you wanna know what I was doing it was the one about teenage depression.

So anyway, I can't really explain it very well since I'm bad with words but most of the time I'm either very happy or very sad example: I can fall into like a deep depression but can get happy very quickly and it goes back and forth a lot but there's no in-between. I'm not sure how to describe the rest but sometimes I'll get very bad but quick bursts of anger like cussing someone out whilst not feeling anything aside from slight annoyance. I do get hallucinations aswell and these usually make me not go to sleep until I pass out from exhaustion. This doesn't really correlate with what I'm saying but whenever I try to get myself something to eat, particularly cereal, I feel like I'm going to throw up and need to stop eating even though I wanted too just a second ago.

I'm sorry if I'm being an overactive teen making your disorder look small also I do have aspergers if that changes anything. I would also like to thank you for taking time out of your life to read my post"
980,Advice or any?,"My whole life has felt like a movie, I have so many problems that when I solve them, i get more. I’ve always been bullied and when i moved to a new school, i thought that my life would be better. I was wrong. I was more bullied and i was getting touch by guys and furthermore i had friend that backstabbed me. I fell in love and i was violently heartbroken and shunned by my new school. I moved to a new school and the problem intensified and i was so lost and scared, Coronavirus started to close school so i haven’t talked to anyone, i feel lost &amp; confused. 
My house is a constant reminder of who i used to be and i just get mired depressed in this house, i feel the urge to kill myself sometimes but i don’t feel brave enough to do it. I feel so numb that when i cry, i feel more pain. I have moments where i want to get something and kill all the people, that hurt me. I’m sometimes afraid of myself. I feel like i should be a great straight boy that love sports but that’s not who i am. I was a sex slave all of those years and i have the urge to go back to them, just to feel some sort of validation or satisfaction, food can be my only source of happiness.
I want to get away from all of this but i can’t 
i hate myself for all of the bullshit
i hate the world.

981,(TW Suicide) I decided not to kill myself right now,"I was gonna. I had the pills in my hand 2 minutes ago. Paracetamol. Then I looked it up and I didn't have enough, and apparently a paracetamol od is really painful. So I flushed them. Nobody in my family and none of my friends know about this. Maybe I'll do it later, but not for now. Don't know why I posted this."
982,Violent thoughts. What do they mean?,"I'm overally happy person but nowadays I deal with those quite weird violent thoughts. For example: When petting my cat I start thinking about me beating her with a stick or throwing to a wall (**I won't do that for sure in my life**) and suddenly I become sad, almost crying about this thought, having thoughts about meaningless life. 

Same with people, I often find myself thinking about them being beaten up or getting their eyes poken even if I wouldn't do it to any living creature. (**I also get really sad after thinking this**).

Could someone tell me what's going on with me? Am I developing some kind of psychopathy? I'm really worried."
983,what can i do to help my mental health in this situation,"I don’t know if i’m depressed but i know that i definitely suffer from some form of anxiety, I have this extreme guilt hanging over me everyday from something i did in the past (I was 14 and stupid) and i know people know what i did and i also know it could come out at any moment. I know if this came out it would ruin my friendships with many people. I feel as if i have nothing left to give and have this self hatred for getting myself into this situation, i cannot form good relationships with people because of this anxiety. each day is a struggle. Please help me"
984,Overwhelmed.,Im drowning in school work. Im too depressed to do anything let alone have a shit ton of sixth form work to do. OCD is fucking exhausting. My ED is making me hate myself day in day out. I just cant be asked with anything anymore.

Just had a weird 12 hours and I decided to turn the boat around and share some much needed love in these crazy times."
986,should i be worried? (tw: possible symptoms of mental illnesses),"so recently I noticed some things I do/feel and wanted to check if it's something all people experience at some point or if I should be concerned:

1. when I close the door just before going to sleep I feel like I'm watching myself do it from outsider's perspective (like I see my back if I was another person standing behind myself)
2. sometimes I feel like there's someone behind me (especially if I'm alone)
3. a few days ago I thought I saw my dog - it was very realistic, I saw her move her head and tail but when I moved closer to what I thought was my dog it turned out that it was just a pile of hay
4. I stuttered once 2 weeks ago and it surprised me because it was the only time it happened
5. when I come home from the hairdresser's I obsessively look at my hair until I find a part which I'm not satisfied with and than I fix it by myself (in reality I mostly make it look worse)
6. I talk to myself out loud when I'm alone
7. I'm convinced that I'm making my family/pets/stuffed toys sad by for example going out with friends, not hugging them
8. sometimes I feel like I'm in a video game:

* 2 times in my life when I was walking back home I felt like I was in a horror video game - everything was foggy, unreal and I was convinced that when I get home my family won't be there and I will see some kind of monsters instead of them - but it passed and only happened 2 times in my life so I'm not that worried
* sometimes when I'm walking I feel like I my body is just a creation of a game - as if I'm playing using 1st pov in which I see my body without my head

1. also I think that I have an OCD: before going to sleep I check every corner of my room 3 or 5 times in a fixed order every night + the same but with a flashlight after that (+some more minor routines with repeating 3 or 5 times) - and I feel like I have to check my room because If I don't someone will murder me and I won't be able to save my family 

Should I be concerned?"
987,Confession of sorts,"I literally created this user to talk  fully on certain things I don’t want anyone I know...to know. 
I have addiction problems - but I’ve been vanilla about it because deep inside I am aware of this and petrified about getting hooked on harder drugs. 
Until recently, I’ve accepted this fact and I do have alcohol issue I’m handling. It’s just harder because I don’t drink to pass out, I don’t drink to get destroyed. I drink to relax, to get into this “happy” buzzed mindset where anything bad just slides off my skin. I’m not an angry tipsy person, not violent, not moody, I’m just...happier because I care less. It only takes one or two beers. And I’ve learned to hold on to it for hours by having more. I rarely get hungover. I hate it, I never over do it. This drinking doesn’t really hurt anyone other than my health and my finances in the long run.
And I’m not only addicted to this - I like my body, my mind, my chemistry altered. Even if it’s by running 10k, kicking my own ass on a workout for those endorphins (and yes...I would still do the beer buzz). But prob the one I miss the most is falling in love. Jesus Christ, that’s the highest high. 
To wrap up, this is me owning up to it. I’m fighting the alcohol dependency, I’ve stopped smoking, I’m trying to take care better of my body and my relationships. 
But god it’s hard
PS: I’ve had therapy, this venting and owning up to it out loud is product of that"
988,Feelings of emptiness and apathy,"I feel an ever present sense of ennui. I just feel numb and empty like I'm adrift in an ocean with no rutter or oar. I have no guidance or direction. Nothing seems interesting to me anymore, like everything I used to enjoy is a huge waste of time now. I hate my life and feel I've wasted all the potential of my 20s just partying. The last few years feel like such a blur that I can't recall if something happened last year or five years ago. Wasted years of vapid people and hollow relationships. People that said they were my friend until it was inconvenient for them. I was trying to be liked by people that didn't care anyways. 

I just want to feel like I used to. Please help."
989,Had lunch plans with a friend and I think they forgot...why am I so upset?,"Earlier this week my friends and I made lunch plans and I've been looking forward to them since. Today I tried texting and calling both of them asking if we're still going and neither have responded, and I've seen them online on snapchat and instagram.

Why does this bother me so much and what should I do?"
990,More and more Im starting to realize that I might be protected by something extremely evil and powerful.,"This protection comes at a cost. With the same entity controlling those around me to push me to the edge of destruction. When I meet someone they are normal people and then as they get to know me, they become something else. As if someone flipped a switch and they seem almost robotic in the way they portray evil. 

The thing is. I kind of like it. To be able to make even the most stone cold gang member feel the need to connect with God while in my presence feels Empowering. 

I'm thinking of the possibility of being the son of (Lucifer) or deity equivalent to. But I realized that, if that deity of evil, destruction, and war is my father.....then that makes God, (or equivalent deity) my Grandfather.....

I can feel both of their power. 

It's like evil pushes me to the edge, and then God gives me the ability to fly. 

But I feel like the more I fly, the more evil gives the ability to people around me to try to shoot me down. 

And it's an endless circle. 

So to fix this.

I'm avoiding being around the same people at all cost. Lmfao."
991,Don’t we all wish,Don’t we all wish we could just sit down with someone and talk everything out? What would you talk about right now?
992,Constantly feels like I’m treading water.,"It’s as if I’m always steadily cleaning up my life while trying to finish current objectives whether it is cleaning up, doing school work, exercising, or maintaining a social life. I understand I’m not the only person who feels like this but it’s nonetheless overwhelming. How do you guys cope with the stress of daily life in a healthy way and how do you balance your life?"
993,Difficulty Finding a Job due to My Mental Health,"So, I'm new to this subreddit, so I apologize if this isn't the place to post this kind of question, but I'm in a bit of a slump. I'm 17 and I have severe depression and anxiety (also severe). I've been fairly picky about looking for jobs that might impact my mental state negatively, but have had no luck. Is there by any chance an agency or something similar that is geared towards helping people with mental illnesses find jobs? (I live in the U.S.) And if so, do you have to be 18? I'm just curious, as my family is not doing well financially, and I would love to contribute."
994,Today is one of these days I am struggling to get out of bed.,I just keep going back and forth about stuff. Asking myself questions and if I will succeed with stuff. Will I ever get out of my situation. When you were starting to feel better again but mentally get beaten down again and have been in something for 25 years and wish you had someone help you get out first. I accepted that suicide is not an option but I’m still really struggling to fight. Life is way too hard
995,"After an embarrassingly long amount of time, I'm finally deep cleaning my 10 gallon fish tank.","Due to certain... circumstances *gestures broadly*, I've been so stressed and depressed that I've been building up a little depression nest in my room. Unfortunately for my fishies, that means they haven’t been getting the treatment they deserve as frequently as they need it. I decided to just go for it today. I know it isn't much but it's a start.

996,Finding the Middle Way in Black/White All/Nothing thinking with Marbling,"Black and white thinking is a trauma response that is important to break down for our overall happiness and wellbeing. When we are not feeling safe, it’s easy to slide into rigid thought patterns such as everything is either good or bad, friend or enemy, kind or mean, awesome or awful etc. The reality is things are rarely ever all one or the other, and as we break down binary ways of thinking we allow more space for connection and collaboration to move forward in our lives. 

If you click on the picture in the link for the blog post below it also goes through a video that explores a mindfulness practice to help get back to feeling like our body can hold multiple feelings at once. I hope it helps someone else as much as this practice has helped me!

997,I’m failing out of college,"I have struggled with diagnosed depression and anxiety since i can remember. i am currently in a very bad, very LONG episode and it’s resulted in me failing out of college my junior year. I have been unable to get to class and keep up on class work, i went from a 3.7 GPA A and B student to idek what it is now, i just know i have all fails in my classes. will i ever be able to come back? i work with a therapist and a psychiatrist, but my mental health is still very bad atm and i don’t see it getting better in a few weeks. i’m disappointed in myself for it getting this bad, but i also don’t know what to do at this point. i want to pursue an associates degree from my local community when i am able to get back on my feet, will they accept me since i’m failing out of my university rn?"
998,From the Body to the Brain: Understanding our Nervous Systems with Polyvagal Theory,"When I was first training in yoga therapy nearly a decade ago, the primary line of thinking about our autonomic nervous system, was that it could be broken down into two parts: the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) and the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest). The old school way of thinking about our yoga practice used to be focused on the parasympathetic nervous system and getting the body to rest. The recent research coming our on our nervous systems offers a much more nuanced understanding of our nervous system through Polyvagal Theory. I feel like understanding what's going on in our body and nervous system can be so empowering and helpful to our understanding of ourselves.

If you click the picture in the link to this blog post it goes to a whole video explaining Polyvagal theory. I hope it feels helpful!

999,Racing thoughts.,"Lately I’ve noticed that my mind has been racing and wondering what it could be. I would like some answers comments. Seems to me like every time i talk it is rapid and quick. My mind just flutters up with thoughts that I have to say. I think it is temporary but I’ve noticed that this happens once in awhile to me. 

Does anyone have anything on this??
It would be much appreciated! :)"
1000,Just Trying to Hold On...,"Woke up today and everything was *meh*. No sadness, no happiness, just emptiness. Went to the gas station for an energy drink like I normally do, got back home, sat down, and just started crying. I don't know why, but I did. I'm usually a dude who doesn't cry. Ever.

I quit drinking alcohol a few days ago, so maybe my emotions are trying to level out. I think I'm gonna journal for a bit to clear my head and then hit the gym. Today is a rest day, but iron is much needed right now. Take care, guys."

1002,"if you do this, dont.","okay. this drives me crazy. why is it that when you talk  to a ""friend"" with a problem, lets say its a relationship issue.... their way of ""helping"" you is to say things like... ""I would have left a long time ago"" or ""I would have done x, y, and  z."" how is this helpful? by making me feel like I suck? that i did this to myself? really does NOT help to hear what someone else would have - keyword - hypothetically done.  and the best part about it is I know, FIRST HAND, that the ""friend"" I have who ""would have left a long time ago"" clearly would not have- because she was in a waaaaay worse relationship (kids involved, DCF involved, drugs involved) than mine that went on for SEVEN years. So its really annoying to hear how ""perfect"" she is and how she would have done something I did differently. so annoying."
1003,Does anyone else freak out when someone doesn’t message back ?,"I don’t know if it just me , but when I call someone or text them and they don’t respond. My brain instantly goes to “they hate you , they saw the message but they don’t wanna awnser because they don’t care and they find you annoying . They probably looked at the message and went , oh not her again leave me alone” then I go on a downward spiral of “everyone hates you , you are an inconvenience to everyone . Why didn’t they text back ? Because you are a piece of shit and no one wants you in their lives , do them a favour and fuck off” . Then I spend all night crying because I am worthless. I am aware this is a huge overreaction and they probably didn’t call back because they are busy and not everyone spends every waking minute on their phone , but my brain explodes and I end up sending messages like “are you mad ? , I’m sorry are we still friends, it was my mistake please forgive me “. I’m a grown ass woman but when I feel abandoned my brain reverts to a child and I fall apart . Do you experience this or am I just a freak ?"
1004,Can’t feel anger?,"I’m 24 and I realized last year that it’s impossible for me to get angry. I’m not talking about repressed anger, I mean like my brain can’t compute that emotion.

It took me years to realize, after being told countless times how calmly I react to situations that would normally get people extreme mad. I can certainly get frustrated, but once the dilation is resolved, all negative feelings vanish. I can’t hold a grudge no matter what people do.

Does anyone know what might be the cause of this? I’m genuinely curious if its genetics or something that happened later."
1005,Mentally unstable s/o,"Hi! My s/o has been experiencing an intense amount of self-hate, self-sabotage, anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. I really want him to get professional help, but he won't do it. I could tell his family about it, but I'm afraid he might get angry because he's the type who gets mad when people don't listen to him or people force things on him. (He's really stubborn and independent - keeping things to himself and all that, which I think may be a trauma response. Idk I'm not a professional.) But then again, I'm also afraid he might wake up one day and decide to kill himself. I'm also thinking that maybe I could ask his friends to constantly check up on him. Maybe it could help since we've been in quarantine/isolation for so long and he hasn't really been able to physically interact with people outside his home. I'm desperate. I want to help him but I don't know how to (coz, once again, not a professional), which leads me to this last question: how do you guys deal with your mentally unstable s/o? Do you just let them vent then reassure them that you're there? Go with toxic positivity that there will be rainbows and sunshine soon? What if they negate every reassuring/positive thing you say?


TLDR: s/o is mentally unstable; how can I help him? should I tell his family about it so he could maybe get professional help or should I ask his friends to check up on him? Or both?


Thanks in advance!

I’m medicated and saw a therapist for the better part of three years, and I plan to slowly ease off antidepressants soon in hopes that I can live independently.  But I just found my old suicide note, one of many.  I don’t even know where they all are anymore and they feel like mines in an empty field.  I hid them in childhood journals so nobody would think to look.  I’m lost right now.  How to I proceed from here?  I’m throwing away the journal and don’t feel any urge to self-harm or anything like that.  I’m not really even sad.  I just.. I don’t know what to do."

1009,need advice,"so the only way i could get mental help was to go into the er about it, after I got out of the hospital they said I would have a follow up to adjust my meds. during the follow up they could hardly hear me, asked to speak with my mom who knows nothing about my current mental health status, said I have anger issues, mentioned a mental problem I had as a kid (bipolar disorder) and long story short they took me off my anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants and put me on lithium and abilify, which I haven't gotten the lithium yet because it is only going to be ready next week but the abilify i stopped taking because of fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and made me even more depressed, which I cant handle that, I only had 2 doses so I don't have any withdrawal symptoms  but I don't know what to do to talk to my doctor and get it changed back"
1010,I left my job today and I feel like an utter failure.,"Today I quit my first real government job. I really liked what I did, however my coworkers were starting to treat me really unfair, causing me to cry during my shifts. Whenever I wasn't at work I'd be home having a breakdown over my next shift at work.. I finally gave in and said I had enough. I'm so terrified I won't find another job that I like as much as I did/in the same field. I could really use some support . I've been crying for hours.."
1011,"Extreme paranoia, what should I do?","Throwaway account because guess what, I (18F) am paranoid.

I don't know how to explain all of this. But I feel stressed and stuck and I don't trust anyone enough to tell them this. And it isn't their fault. It's because I am too paranoid, I always feel as if people are out there to get me.

It all started after I broke up with my ex. He was my first everything, and now that we are broken up, I get horrifying thoughts about how he might use the fact that we had sex at 17 against me, tarnish my reputation. He has never given me any reason, whatsoever, to doubt him about something like this and it's mostly me overthinking, but this has caused me to have anxiety and mental breakdowns which involve me crying profusely but not being able to give a reason for it to anyone because I feel afraid that if they know, even they can use it against me.

I told a very close friend of mine today, and she has reassured me that no matter what happens, she will never tell anyone but what scares me is that people are temporary - what if their loyalty is temporary too? 

This isn't the only example. I am too scared of what will happen when I start going to college as I will be travelling alone and my country is legit the worst place for women. I feel unsafe and just...paranoid, so extremely paranoid.

I cannot afford therapy right now, but it's affecting me so much. I have no idea what to do or how to deal with this because the fact of the matter is that I am only overthinking about something that has a near 0% chance of happening and all I do is spend my time being afraid and not enjoying my present.

If anyone has ever been in a similar situation or has any advice on how to deal with this, please help me. I don't want to stay so afraid all the time and stop enjoying life."
1012,Losing touch,"So my girlfriend and i have noticed that i get agitated when my family posts on facebook or texts me. I love my family i would kill for them but i never wanted to stay intouch with them after i left. I want freedom from them and there numbskull selves. Is that too much to ask for? 
My brother and I are closer now then ever BECAUSE we are away from the rest of our family and since we have a combined IQ of well over our hometown all together we can have civilised disscussions on Soo many topics and we can agree to disagree or look from other angles on topics we agree on. My brother and I grew up 8 years apart but our IQ is very similar and so are we(mentality, physically etc.). 
I hate that i hate talking to my family but at the same time it is liberating to not have to care about what stupidity they are up to. I have always dreamt of getting a plot of land in Alaska away from everyone and living my life out in my cabin with my wife and kids."

1014,Anxiety? Hyperventilation? I'm going mad,"Alright so, 36 y/o female.

In summer I probably had an, what I know now, anxiety attack. Heart racing, weird breathing, couldn't control it. I was lying in bed, all chill, and suddenly boom. Called the emergency gp who came, said my heartrate was up, had an ecg and he saw nothing wrong. 

Fast forward to now. Since about 3 weeks I have a constant off feeling. Light pressure in my chest, unrest, occasional attacks of higher heartrate etc. In rest I always feel.my heartbeat, whether it's fast or normal doesnt matter. Been to the gp a few times, had another ecg and bloodwork done, nothing weird. So I believe there is nothing seriously wrong physically, I am going completely mad. I mean.. I can't keep feeling like this. I have evenings where I just can't get my heartrate down, and it beats 120-130 beats a minute. 

I was given something to help me sleep, which works, but doesnt fix how I feel during the day. For my ADHD I take methylphenidate, which we are now replacing with dexamphetamine to see if that makes any difference. I see my gp regularly at the moment.

All in all, not a clue what's up. Anyone have any relatable experiences and tips on what to do?
I exercise daily, I try breathing exercises which sometimes work, I do not drink caffeine or alcohol, but I do smoke. I'm at the end of the rope, any tips will be appreciated.

Thank you!"

1016,Is there a way i can stop thinking about the same thing over and over?,One day i was thinking about the past like digging real deep and  since then i have this image stuck in my head any advice?
1017,Consequences,"I stopped showing up to my job because I was experiencing a really bad spell of paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety, and depression + the job itself was stressful for me. I never even called to quit, I just stopped showing up. I started babysitting recently because I still need income. I’m 19, starting my second year of college, I have to pay my car insurance and my car is a junker that has so much shit I need to fix, but Ive been on a spree for the last few months. I’ve gained 20 pounds and accumulated $600 on my credit card with no real means to pay it off. I thought I wanted to major in nursing because I want to help people and a lot of my family members are nurses, but I took my anatomy class online, and I am NOT retaining the information. I’m procrastinating my work now; I might not pass my philosophy class because I elected not to do a lot of discussion assignments when I was manic or depressed. Today is the last day, I got a good grade on all of the test and on my final. The professor is giving us the opportunity to makeup every discussion we missed by writing a two page paper about it, but I probably won’t do all of them because I’m sleep deprived and tired.  I am going to retake the final because we get two attempts and I think I might be able to get an A+ which would be helpful in elevating my grade. I’m lying to my whole family, they don’t know that I stopped my job. Im selling a ton of my shit to try to get some cash to pay off my card. I know that this is another episode of mine, but this has by far been the worst. Im cyclically dysfunctional, I’m at a low, I’m disgusted by myself and actions, I’m tired, I’m ruining my future. I feel like I should just end it or send myself to prison so I can’t burden anyone with my disaster behavior and stop wasting the worlds valuable resources"
1018,Apparently those with mental health shouldn't have kids,"Just reading a post on a ""open minded"" group on Facebook and everyone saying that anyone with a mental illness who has kids is selfish and horrible and messed up and that it trumatises the children. 


They also said if you don't have alot of money your just as bad pretty much. It makes me mad that people still think of mental health like they did in 1902 and I don't know why it still hasn't changed in some instances. Treating us like we are a different breed of people who can't do normal things like others can. Or somehow we are evil people. 

I just needed to vent because I feel disrespected and less of a human after reading that and it was every single comment just about in thousands of comments..."
1019,I've been struggling with depression for most of my life and it's gotten really bad recently.,"I've been admitted to psychiatric hospitals twice, over attempts. 2020 has hit all of us hard and it's certainly not done me any favors. I got a job towards the end of 2019 that I enjoy, but my hours were reduced earlier this year. On top of that I'm having a severe health issue with my teeth that's causing me immense pain, and I have no way of taking care of it. 2020 has wiped out my savings and I'm living with both severe pain that's causing me to lose sleep, miss time at work, but puts me on the verge of tears almost constantly.

I feel like everytime I start to get ahead I'm dragged back down. One step forward, five steps back. I'd say life has a vendetta against me, but I know I'm not that important that it gives me a second thought. My last attempt was December of 2019. I was given a strong antidepressant and it's done nothing but make me feel physically sick and pathetic for needing a pill just to feel normal. I've been taking it for months now and it's only really causing me to feel sick... and everytime I talk to a doctor about it they say it can take ""awhile"" or ""months"" to adjust to it. I've missed so much work over the dental pain, and the wellbutrin, I'm on the verge of losing this job. 

Honestly, I just wish this stimulus would pass already so I can buy a pistol. I just don't want to do this anymore, and I felt like that before the constant physical pain I've been in this year. I'm tired of struggling. As embarrasing as it is to admit I made a gofundme for my teeth, and posted it. A week passes and nothing... which is fine. it's charity. You can't get mad about that, this year has been hard for all of us. But today I see another post about dental work but it's just someone wanting braces and they got like 200 dollars within an hour. When I see stuff like that it's feeling this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm useless and not worth anybody's time, and everybody knows it."
1020,My severely depressed friend,"I have a friend who is in severe depression for like four or five years. It's related to some childhood traumas and kind of an extreme existential crisis. I'm trying my best to help her but as you can guess I cant do a lot, I didn't have the same thoughts, feelings nor I didn't get any mental health education. She is 18 and doesn't have a financial independence thus she needs her parents for the therapy costs. But her parents aren't so mentally healthy too. Her mother acts so unbalanced and unexpected. She once went to a therapist for some time but her mother made up some stupid excuses to avoid the therapy and she had to stop getting it. She occasionally (and unwantedly she says) thinks of suicide and I really don't want her to die. Everything existential, or something about universe always gets to the suicide and I'm afraid. I don't know what to do can you guys help me a little please."
1021,The eternal boredom and nothingness called my life,"Wanted to write down how I felt so I could maybe make some sense of it. 

I'm 20 years old and have been feeling like shit since I was 13. Nothing interests me, I have zero motivation for anything and am bored 24/7. There are some very rare periods when I am interested in certain random subjects, when this happens I  can't stop researching and reading more about it but after an X amount of time I don't care about it anymore and feel like I've wasted my time. This has happened a numerous amount of times now resulting in me already nothing in life can interest me enough to actually care about it. 

The same thing goes for school, I've never cared about my grades or put effort into studying. I always leave my tasks (in life and in school) until the last moment because I just cba to make them, I don't care if I drop out or disappoint my family. I just don't see the point in living and/or completing homework/tasks. I'm currently in my 3rd year at uni and am so unmotivated. This endless procrastinating leads to me having to study exams or write essays a couple of hours before the deadline and only then I feel an immense amount of stress. For some reason my grades have always been just enough to pass but I always feel so bad when I have to do everything in the dying minutes.

I also have nothing in the future to look forward to because there just isn't anything in life that I want. As a young teen I used to think about killing myself multiples times a day but that feeling also no longer entertains me because I'm so used it. I feel like I'm just riding an endless wave called life and that there's nothing I can do. 

The same thing goes for my love life. I've had two amazing girlfriends but broke up with them because after a while I was so bored of them and now they both hate me even though I can't do anything about it. Professional help also hasn't been doing anything for me either. I've been to a psychologist, a psychiatrist and group therapy sessions but I don't feel any difference at all. I feel like I already know everything that they tell me. 

Congrats to those who've been able to read this until the end because I can't even read posts longer than 100 words with my terrible attention span.

Tom out."
1022,Why do I care so much about people's opinions?,"I'm not sure if I'm venting or asking for advice or maybe just trying to see if anybody else feels the same way..

I have always struggled to get friends. I'm not very social and I don't have any redeeming qualities (I'm not attractive or funny or intelligent, I'm just kinda here...people don't want that). Because of this, it matters a lot to me how others view me. 

Going to work nearly wrecks me everyday, even if I'm happy when I come in, by the end of the day I'm in tears because I don't get why my co-workers don't really seem to get along with me very well, they like eachother a lot more and will add eachother on Facebook but not me, they'll all follow eachother around if somebody goes somewhere but if I go somewhere they won't even look up, when I talk they interrupt me even though when they talk I will try to sound happy and interested in what they say and be patient and conversational. I don't get it."
1023,Electroconvulsive therapy?,"I just found out that this actually still exists and actually works really well. The only problem is the only place in my area that does this is the same one that locked me up for no reason about 8 years ago which still haunts me to this day, and then tried sending me a bill afterwards

Likewise, the only other major psychiatric hospital in the area is just as bad and I don't think offers ECT either. They are also universally hated by everyone who goes there.

It's really sad when you want to get help and find a place to help you, only to find out that most likely you'll be abused or forced medicated and won't get the counseling time you need nor the support. The stories I read are just horror stories.

If I end up getting committed and wasting yet more of my life in that depressing place not getting the support I need, it's not unreasonable to think I won't be around much longer after I'm discharged"
1024,Advice regarding a friend's behavior,"I'm going to begin by saying my friend has Aspergers Syndrome and sometimes has trouble with social situations. However, there are times his behavior borders on the narcissistic. In conversations, he always directs the topic to himself and his accomplishments, no matter what we are discussing. He doesn't take others feelings into consideration.

A year and a half ago, I was in a bad wreck. I was driving on my way to my Community College and a lady pulled out in front of me, I couldn't stop in time, and I hit her. She unfortunately died in the hospital from injuries in the wreck. There are days I barely think about it and then there are days where I still feel responsible and have survivors guilt.

4 months after the wreck, I moved to University where I met this friend. He was the RA here for the first 2 semesters I was here in the dorms. A few months after meeting him, I opened up to him about my wreck and the woman dying. His first question was ""were you drunk?"". I told him no and just never brought it up again. He steered the conversation to another subject.

The other night (nearly a year after the conversation) I brought it up to him. We were discussing another topic and we got on the subject of how the things we say affect people. He brought up how his parents said some hurtful things to him and he never forgot it. He's mentioned this several times before. I brought up how what he said (assuming I was drunk when I was involved in a wreck) hurt my feelings. He told me ""you gotta think, I grew up with an alcoholic father so I expect the worst of everyone"". He neither apologized for what he said or acknowledged what he said was hurtful.

I'm torn because I know he had a difficult childhood and struggles to understand people because of Aspergers but at the same time I've been depressed as fuck over what he said."
1025,Accidentally ran out of my Effexor prescription 4 days early and I don't know what to do.,"Not sure what happened, I probably forgot I'd taken it and doubled 4 days out of the 30 day period.The withdrawal can be real bad. I'm up to 150mg...
I am planning to get a weekly pill organizer to be safe in the future. Right now just staying moment to moment.
Any suggestions on how to get through until then? Thank you in advance."
1026,How do I to my parents who don’t think mental illness is a thing?,"So I can’t sleep in my room because I share it with my sister and she makes noises that make me anxious and is very distracting. I can’t study I can’t do anything in my room unless she’s a sleep. I can’t blame her for what I have but when I try to tell my parents about it they don’t believe anything I say. I had sleeping problems because of it. Trauma because of the repetitive noise that I skipped going to my room most of the time because it scared me so much. I only go in there when she’s out or sleeping and as a university student and as a human it’s just inconvenient and is very hard. I slept less than five hours a day waking up with anxiety. It’s not just noises it’s just the thought of it makes my anxiety creep in. So I started sleeping in my brother’s room (since he’s absent most of the time) and waking up at 6 am to go back to my room and I just don’t wanna do that anymore. Sometimes I wanna stay in the dark but I just can’t do that and I just it hurts. One of my parents told me something that gave me hope but then they said that I could move on. I never explained what it is exactly as I never understood it myself and because I always just freeze and I’ve been delaying it because I found a temporary solution. I just wanna get over it and I just want my parents to believe what I say. 
Also. My anxiety isn’t only about that, I get anxious anytime without any reason. I talked about one of my biggest problems affecting my sleep, studying, personal time, and doing activities for my own. 
I like to be isolated as that’s most comfortable to me. I use video games as distraction and it works. I don’t want temporary solutions as they will affect my life negatively in the long run. My parents never seem to understand."
1027,Feelings of being watched from a young age,"Okay this is super confusing for me and I really want to figure it out. For background purposes, I’m a female in my early 20’s. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, if not please direct me to the right thread! (Format - Mobile) 

For as long as I could remember I dealt with feelings of being watched. At first it started off with family that wasn’t there, then crushes, and ect.. It would get to the point where I would do something alone in privacy, but feel embarrassed as if someone where there. I would constantly feel this way growing up. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and I did experience some type of slight trauma in my childhood. However, I can’t shake this feeling. Even when I’m out currently it’s like I’m imagining if someone I know is around me or watching. Has anyone else dealt with these feelings? Again sorry if this isn’t the right place to post, I’m new to reddit. Thank you!"
1028,I need advice,"I don't know what is wrong with me. I feel sad almost 24/7, and at night I get so sad I think about suicide. I cannot go to a therapist as I don't have enough money to do that. I don't know what to do.. I am scared"
1029,How can I help my gf?,"So my current situation is that I have been diagnosed with adhd and am in the first month of my treatment. During this time I have started seeing a girl who started the conversation of adhd without even knowing about my recent diagnosis.

We talk loads and agree on most things to do with it but there's one thing that's throwing me slightly and it's the mood swings she has. Take today for example. We woke up had a nice morning, but she felt a little ill and couldn't come to the event we had loosely planned so she got really frustrated with herself. Then it turned in to her worrying about what I thought of her with these frequent ups and downs. We've looked in to bi polar together and we're not so sure that it is that. Maybe elements of it but probably not enough for a diagnosis.

I guess I have a really loose and general question about how to help her as she is starting to get help and is writing a bit about her adhd but I can't help but feel there may be another underlying issue that also needs addressing. While she is being tested for adhd is there something I can do to try and find out what triggers her but in a respectful way rather than getting her wound up? I guess adhd affects everyone differently but these mood swings are probably above my understanding being a guy. Does this sound sort of normal? I hate to put it like this but it can be a little childlike but it doesnt scare me off at all like she worries about as previously this has ended other relationships. How do I support her more than what I'm doing right now?"
1030,Mental Health Awareness,"Both me and my girlfriend have a history of mental health issues, ranging from depression to anorexia to paranoia. After recovering and learning to live a normal life after such extreme issues, we have decided to make a youtube channel with plans to produce a series of videos aiming to educate, raise awareness and provide help for people. If anyone can show their support and follow our journey it would be appreciated a lot. Planning to begin the series in the next 2 weeks, but here is a little introduction video for now. Thanks :) 

[Introduction - Who Are We?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWsS3RjTDhI&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=Loosh%27sSpace)"
1031,Money problems,"I've had them in the past and here we are with a pandemic and I'm facing them again. The amount of shame I'm feeling is not currently bearable I'm on crisis text with someone who basically told me I don't have any friends and I just need to know it might the only person who has money issues? 
Hate myself."
1032,Broke down at work,"Ive been off sick for a month and a half, i thought i had gotten better. First day back i broke down in tears after an hour. It feels like ive taken a step backwards and i dint know if i can keep up or where to go from here..."
1033,An Interview with Aaron Stark (known for his ted talk about nearly becoming a school shooter),"Today I interviewed Aaron Stark a man who has had one of the toughest goes at life ever. His father was an abusive veteran and his mother lived in fear. Aaron was pushed to his limits as a teenager and at his breaking point, he just wanted to hurt people and planned a school shooting. days before he was going to commit to his plan an act of kindness took him off the ledge. here's the story as he tells it and I hope it helps those who need to hear it [https://youtu.be/vSNAVRYk3-U](https://youtu.be/vSNAVRYk3-U)"
1034,I’m unsure if my friend is even alive right now. Please help.,"Reddit, I need your help because I don’t know who else to turn to. My friend who I met online is bipolar, and his behavior lately has been concerning. Early this morning on twitter he tweeted that he wanted to k*ll himself and also texted me that he needed me. He was also tweeting all night meaning he didn’t sleep. 
If I would’ve been awake I would’ve called him immediately, but by the time I called and texted when he woke up he didn’t answer. This was at 9am my time (6am his time) and still no answer. Since we live across the country from each other there’s no way to know that he’s safe.

He was also being really erratic and instigating this kid he got into an argument with, taunting him and telling him to pull up to his house with a gun and that he wasn’t afraid.

In February he tried to overdose on Fentanyl and is only alive because the paramedics gave him Narcan. 

He’s not on meds and I’m really concerned if he is even alive right now. Please help."
1035,Loving alone vs living with family/friends,"The people who live with families, girlfriend, friends (or live with anyother people in their house) are often distracted from life's sickness and worries because they are busy and involved in household chores. They have a support system which keeps them calm and happy.Talking to their parents, friends on every day based makes them feel better. Family is important in life. Mom is very important. Distractions and household environment is good for ones mental state.

People who live alone on the other hand have no distractions, they often get bored and then all they can think of is themselves, life, career, problems, etc. They over think and become anxious and stressed. They think living alone is about freedom and independence in one's life but little do they know that human beings are often referred to as social beings and they thrive in social settings and on the contrary living alone makes them a slave of their own thoughts.

Do you agree ??"
1036,Partially emotionally numb,"Hello i'm a 17 y/o guy and i think i got a problem. I sometimes don't have emotions i can kind of control it i think. But i don't know if i control it or if i just act my emotions if i just tell my mind you need to be happy you need to be sad. Obviously sad situations can leave me completely cold. It all isn't really improved by the fact that i sometimes cry on cue when i wanna feel sad. I can have every emotion if i want to. But it's not just pretending it's really feeling the emotion but only if i concentrate on how i wanna feel. Only the feeling of being overwhelmed or that general bad feeling are the ones i can't control.
I don't know if i am emotionally numb if i don't concentrate. 
Every comment is appreciated. Thanks"
1037,Is this just me or does everyone go through the same?,"I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with someone I was not exclusively with. I kept running back to this person despite wanting to cut off from the beginning because my gut sensed something was wrong... But I finally got the guts to do it after 2yrs.
I realised that I attract and fall for men who I eventually want to cut away from as I have intense feelings for them which are not reciprocated.
It leaves me with a lot of hurt, pàin and guilt to cut off ties early on seeing the things that trigger. I keep thinking maybe if I give it time it'll work but whom am I kidding. 
And have been in situations where I cut off and go back, cringy -I know. But I feel I give off a very unstable vibe to everyone and I feel sad out of nowhere because of these events, its plain painful...to feel unloved and to be unlucky in love"
1038,Can I have a small farm animal as an emotional support animal?,"I suffer from severe depression and having an ESA would be helpful for me. I want a dog but don’t think I can take care of one right now because they are a lot of work. I’m thinking of having a duck, turkey or a chicken. I used to have a rabbit but don’t want to raise another rabbit. The problem is, I live in an apartment so space might be an issue. I don’t like cats, reptiles, rats, etc."
1039,i used to be so happy to interact with people,"now its nothing. i dread it. i hate that i dread it but i cant change that, i dont know how to."
1040,DASS TUFF!,"Now that I think about it, the only reason I have never been bullied in school is because people think I’m special Ed. I’m short with a thin body frame and I’m really skinny and I have a small head so I look really weird and ugly. When I walk my body shakes, especially my head. I am very stiff, I don’t know why, I’ve tried to record my self doing stuff like dancing and I make sure to exaggerate my movements and stuff so it’s not stiff, but when I watch the video I look terrible. also have no social skills and I definitely have social anxiety I just am too scared to go to a psychologist. I am really awkward. 

People at my old school said they thought I was special Ed until they talked to me through text and stuff. 

To be honest I do feel like I have some type of disorder or something that’s undiagnosed. But I don’t wanna talk to anybody about that. 

But as of now, I am just seen as a normal person. So being ugly with social anxiety and no friends is kinda torture. I really see no fun future for myself, just going to college and doing nothing, graduating, getting a job, and dying alone."
1041,Help!!!!,"I’m in the middle of a manic episode, and it’s decided to do a nice cross over with my suicidal thoughts, I have no idea what to do, please help"
1042,How do you deal with being emotionally numb (post depression)?,I'm doing a lot better than I used to but no matter what I do I can't seem to feel anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
1043,I don’t know how I feel anymore,"There are days where I feel like I’m living my best life. I would be just fine, casually doing my thing and then just out of nowhere, this random wave of sadness kicks in, leaving me a certain way that I can’t even begin to describe. I feel like this sadness resides in me. Like it always has. But I try to convince myself otherwise. I can’t be feeling this way. I mean how can I? I have a pretty decent life. Friends, family, grades - you name it. I don’t have any past history of depression either. A part of me feels like it’s just inside my head, I just overthink and that’s it. It can’t be real, It’s just my mind playing on me. And then a part of me feels like everything that I call my life is aa big massive lie. This sadness, it’s always been there. It’s a part of me that I’m too weak to embrace. I distract myself with things, burry it as deep as possible and pretend like it’s not there at all until it randomly pops up and consumes my entire being. I feel like I’m running but getting nowhere. It’s to the point where I can’t even think straight. My mind has become a mess. I can’t go to school, keep myself isolated for hours, there are days I don’t even want to get out if bed let alone get other things done. I’m a very optimistic person. I’ve never taken my life for granted. There’s still so much potential and life in me but when one these days strike, I just don’t want to do anything anymore. I’m not suicidal but I don’t want to live either. I feel like I’m slowly fading away, things that I once enjoyed doing, don’t excite me anymore. Some of these episodes are so severe that I feel like I can’t even get up again. But what makes it complicated is that it doesn’t last very long. I’ve heard that people who struggle w depression have it going for days but that does not necessarily always happen in my case. It does last for long periods some times but very rare. 

I can’t figure out if it’s a legit mental illness I’m struggling with or just a normal thing that everyone experiences at some point in their lives. I’ve had a friend tell me that I could it be potential bipolar disorder because I’m either very happy or on my lowest, with USUALLY no in betweens. Ive been trying to make it come together for days but I just can’t figure it out. Not sure if it’s a good idea but then again, you either say how you feel anf fuck it up or say nothing and let it fuck you up instead."
1044,What happens once you realize you just can’t anymore?,I’m not okay and I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s been a series of trauma and bad decisions. The spiraling is real and I don’t know the way up.

1046,Getting increasingly harder to function,I hate the term “high functioning” it’s just code for hyper empathetic people that hide their suffering for the sake of everyone else. As soon as I step out of this shower I’m going to be gaslit to no end. I want to leave but i just feel so stuck. Anyone else their family’s favorite punching bag?
1047,Does anyone else feel as though they can’t get the full effect of therapy since COVID happened bc now it has to be a zoom call or a phone call? Or do you like it better that way?,"I absolutely dread therapy nowadays. Here’s why;

1. In person therapy is a good way for me to get myself out of bed and out of the house for something that’s actually good for me. Most times, that was the only time I would leave my room. 

2. I get very bad anxiety on the phone and on video calls. 

I’m not trying to downplay the importance of staying safe during this pandemic, I promise. I 100% understand why and support it. It’s just something I’ve noticed.... that, it’s messed up my ability to be able to enjoy therapy and benefit from it, the way that I once have. 

I’ve quiet therapy since the pandemic started and I know that I need it. I’m just dragging my feet I guess :("
1048,Sudden derealkzation,Everything feels fake and weird all of the sudden I'm scared shitless how do I ground myself
1049,i feel like such a burden,"hi guys, i’m really new to this sub but i just feel like i’m a burden to everyone around me. my parents dont even bother trying to help me anymore because “if i don’t take care of myself, no amount of medecine will help” but i can’t figure out how to help myself. i don’t have any close friends and i have my boyfriend but i don’t want to drag him down with me. any advice?"
1050,I don't believe that my boyfriend thinks I'm attractive.,"I mean, I kind of do. I feel like there's 2 people in my head, one of them believes he does and the other one believes he doesn't. But the one that believes he doesn't is way louder and the one that believes he does is so quiet I can barely hear it. I feel like I only ever believe it in moments where he says it when I wasn't asking and he sounds really genuine. Me and my boyfriend are a lot different in how we express our love. I'm very verbal and physical, always kissing and hugging him, and telling him how cute and sexy he is. Well he's not really the same, and I understand that not everyone expresses their love the same. My problem isn't really how he treats me. He does make me feel LOVED. But if he told me I was pretty 20 times a day I think I still wouldn't believe it. I have gotten upset with him because I know he would be more attracted to me if I was skinny. I'm not obese, but I'm chubby and have a belly. I get angry when he says it's not true because I know it is. Because I don't understand how he could PREFER my fat body over some models skinny body? Like, there's no way. I'm 100% sure that when hes watched porn or been infatuated by a model or celebrity, the woman is skinny. I mean, it's not his fault. Obviously the media pushes the idea that skinny = good, fat = bad. He says he wouldn't be with me if he thought that, but I feel like he would. At the beginning of our relationship I thought he was just desperate. That's how I feel about any guy that's been with me. Because it's just true, most men like skinny women. And by skinny I don't mean like a stick figure, but like skinny waist, big boobs, big butt. I have big boobs but that's it. I have no butt and a fat stomach. That's NOT what people desire to look like, and that's not what men look at online or whatever. So how am I supposed to believe he actually LIKES my body? Leave alone LOVES it... I feel like he just loves my personality and thinks I'm pretty maybe, and then just accepts my body for how it is. I know he would like it more if I was skinny. I know it's bad that I get upset at him sometimes, I just can't help it. One time I caught him following some Instagram called like ""sexy, beautiful women"". He told me he used it as porn. And all the models? SKINNY. So? What am I supposed to think?"
1051,"I've just realised what I suffered from as a kid wasn't ""puberty"" but childhood depression","I was a very sad kid, like really sad. From the age of about 10 I found that I was crying from the moment I woke up to when I went to bed at night. I didn't sleep or eat very well and most of all I felt so so guilty about the tiniest things. 

After finding this [NHS artical](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/children-depressed-signs/) about childhood depression, I've been able to put the pieces together. I showed a lit of the symptoms shkwn in the artical, down to the considoration of self-harm, at the age of 10.

My mum disguised and excused my childhood depression as symptoms of puberty, telling me that 'my body was changing and things would get better' they wouldn't get better, because I now know that my depression was brought on by emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my older brother (which I won't go into, the scars are still fresh from that revolation) which she ignored and took part in.

She hid her and my brother's abusive nature and the fact that I literally wanted to die by the age of 11 as puberty

PUBERTY

I don't really know what else to put, my brother no longer lives with us, but I still contemplate discussion my childhood with my mum, but I feel like she would deny it, I've since been diagnosed with depression which I am coping well with. I guess I'm just angry that excuses were made about a very concerning time in my life and the abuse I experienced. My mother did nothing to protect me.

I'm safe now, and with people who care about me and my mental health, but I still fear what I will do if I ever see that man again. 

That is all, thank you"
1052,Feeling Burnt Out,"I feel completely burnt out. I’m not doing things that need to be done, and I don’t care to. After failing my last math test that I studied so hard for I didn’t care enough to start studying again. I made a 87.75 on my A&amp;P test. Now usually I’d be so excited, and that would motivate me, but after it was over I crashed down. It was like I let out this long breath, and I was relieved it was over. I have a test in 11 days, and I haven’t studied for it. It’s more like a chore to me instead of a task I need to complete, and I do not want to do it. I’m tired, I’m burnt out, I’m extra sleepy, and I want to cry. I needed to let this out in hopes someone could help me with some encouraging words or tips to help me stop feeling like this."
1053,I’m so lonely it hurts,I’ve always had a great social life. Amazing family although just like any other family we’ve been through shit and I always had great friends too. But recently I moved to the U.K. for university and I’ve been struggling so hard make new friends that are like mine. I’m not into the hardcore parties and stuff. But I just miss my home so much that I’ll be studying and suddenly I’m hit with a desperate thought of wanting it back. And my friends too. Legit I’m sitting writing this down crying the fuck out cuz of how much I miss my life. I’m all alone by myself. Everytime I call my family I’ll have to try so hard that I’m happy to make sure I don’t worry them but soon as the call ends I’ll be there left with tears and crying fuck ton about it. Today I finally told my brother on a call how I felt and stuff he even cried with me saying how much he misses me but I don’t know what to do. Like it’s been so hard mentally just trying to go outside distract myself with no one to talk to is so fucking lonely. How do you make friends and I get so scared of not being able to make friends and it fucks with my head so bad that I won’t be able to study. Please tell me what to do.

1055,"I think I might have ADHD, how to ask about it? (TW: mentions of suicide and sh)","So, I'm 14, and I'm already diagnosed with depression and anxiety (got diagnosed 1 year ago, stopped taking meds because of massive headache), and I'm starting to worry about my mental health again. I'm kinda in the ""mental illness community"", and I started to see a lot of things about ADHD and its symptoms. I realized I have some of them (eg. zoning out, being unable to read text sometimes, problems with focusing, being easily distracted by small things, being unable to stand/sit still, excessive talking, being forgetful), and they last more than 6 months (actually I don't remember a time in my life when they weren't present, but the earliest memories I can recall clearly are from like end of the 4th grade, aka a little more than 3 years ago). At my last session with my therapist I told her all the symptoms I've written above, and she got really interested, she asked me if they make my life harder (I told her the truth, it depends on the situation I am in when they happen). I zoned out at the session and told her about it, she told me that it isn't visible. And the problem is: I want to tell her about what think, but I don't want her to think that I'm making this all up for attention. I'm really concerned, and I really want to seek help. What do I have to do? (some additional information about my mental health, I don't know if they are important: I had anorexia, now I'm dealing with bulimia, I also had three suicide attempts and I'm about 1 month clear of sh)"
1056,When I'm with my parents I tend to get angry and lash out easily,"I'd like to mention that I have anxiety,depression, as well as a chronic pain condition called fibromyalgia

My parents are honestly very traditional people mindset wise. They were raised to not talk back at parents or question them. Sometimes they say ridiculous things or make me feel bad and I'll tell them or shout at them if it really bothers me.

I rely on them to help me with stuff sometimes since I don't make much money because I work fast-food and can't work longer than 4hrs a day because of my pain.

Whenever I'm home one of my brother's always bugs me to sign him into emails and stuff because he's disabled and buys a new phone or forgets his password very often. If I don't he'll shout and my mom will start shouting at me to do it so he can stop shouting and trying to break stuff. I get so irritated and I shout too because I wanna be alone and he's annoying.

Right now my oldest brother is in jail but because of him, me and my mom have a huge rift between one another. He's schizophrenic and hit his wife once, almost burnt his room down, and tried stabbing our neighbors. 

My mom got mad when he went to jail after I told the police about him hitting his wife. She says ""I love all my kids"" and ""everyone has a defect"" but I'm Satan when I tell her that she's being stupid and letting my brother get away with things.
She buys me stuff as a way of pretending everything is okay and that she never made me feel bad. When I say something bothers me she just says "" I buy you all these things, why are you mad?""

I get anxious easily and almost everyone at home is loud and annoying. Is it normal that I often feel angry? I shout and tell them to leave me alone or shut up when they won't stop bothering me.

When I'm with someone who is nice to me and not loud and obnoxious I can be nice but at the same time I'm worried though because I get mad easily and I can't tell if that's just how I am or if it's the people around me that make feel that way.

 Sometimes at home I feel like I'm bubbling with rage. There's days where I can't stop feeling angry because I live with my parents and can't afford to move out. Sometimes I feel like I have no sense of peace here."
1057,What is this sensation I'm feeling??,"Idk why I feel like this and I don't think I've ever felt like this before but I feel like I'm trapped in my body a little bit. And I feel like if I twist or stretch myself the right way I (I guess my consciousness?) could get out and escape.

This isn't a delusion I don't think bc I know thats impossible.

I'm wondering if it is some kind of severe dissociation or a result of anxiety (my home life has been really bad recently, my dad might leave us).

But I have been just laying in bed twisting and stretching and trying to contort myself around because it feels more comfortable just laying here. My arms feel heavy and my body feels shallow.

Wtf is going on? Unless I just really need to stretch and am over thinking this, what is this?? Is this a sign of something worse?"
1058,I feel disliked and disgusting. And that people know I feel so and agree. Does everyone deserve to be loved?,"
Why can’t I just walk outside without worrying that everyone I see hates me for some reason and that they wish me harm? I don’t fit in anywhere; I’ve always been somewhat of an outsider. Do I even deserve what I am asking for? To deserve to be loved? I’m worried that this is just who I am, my role in this. Being the background character everyone hates in the play of my life. I’m so pathetic, and tbh, I can see that they don’t fully hate me for no reason; it is justified."
1059,Annoyed with the system,"As a person who has experienced mental health issues and as someone who has worked in the sector for a few years I am SO annoyed by the amount of people that are being let down by the system.

Don't get me wrong I know there is a large majority that is very well supported, but this does not include people that society as a whole have let down, for example, people come from low socio-economic backgrounds and racial minorities. But not only this, the fact that patients, people with severe anxiety for example, have to then chase their appointments, something that is anxiety inducing in and of itself is just ridiculous. A simple phone call or message from a professional to update an individual on the steps being made towards their care can go such a long way and are not that hard to do. I have seen delayed appointments and calls with professions make or break my clients days and its just **heartbreaking** to see, I'm just so frustrated and I want to change it all and make the care provided more compassionate but there is just so much that needs to change!

I am also *extremely* annoyed that there are staff, a colleague, who said to my face that people have mental health issues because of their drug and alcohol use and in a certain case an individual did not use either ""so they must be mad because of dark magic, someone has put a curse on their family"". Look, I get that people believe in dark magic and I am certainly not the person to tell someone what to believe but when it comes to mental health, it is so ignorant to say that the only thing that causes these issues is drug and alcohol use when in reality it is normally the other way round. A mental illness leads to use the use of drugs and alcohol to numb that pain.

I haven't said anything to this colleague of mine yet, I was just speechless and she left shortly after but I needed to vent to process wtf just happened.

Thanks for reading all of it if you did and just a quick reminder that people like my colleague are a small minority that really let mental health professionals down, so if you're not feeling too great, please reach out to your local services or charities :)"
1060,I’m losing time,"I’m not sure what’s been happening and what I’ve been doing each day. My birthday was in mid September and it feels like it was last week. I could probably dig through my notebook or my phone and recall some days - I haven’t completely forgotten, but it still feels like a dream. What even is time? It seems so inconsistent. How did get here? Why am I here? I don’t recognize myself, and my skin and body feel foreign. Conversations are lost in my mind, and I forget what and why I’m doing something (and when and how I started). Did I walk, bus, or drive here? I legitimately couldn’t say. I’m not sure I belong in this body, is it really mine? I think I’m living someone else’s life. 

That was dramatic, but it’s just how I feel. I’m not sure if it’s normal or not, but I really need help and I’m not sure where or who to go to. It’s getting so bad and I’m starting to feel suicidal. I feel so trapped and I wanna escape. I can get myself to the ER if I know I’m likely gonna do something really stupid, but before that, where should I go? And what does this sound like?"
1061,Do they know?,"Recently I am doubting about my behavior. 
Till last month I was sure that my husband has ptsd adhd and has high score in narcissist-test.
I still believe that’s true but what about me? 
When i talk to my husband I see that he often believes that i am wrong. And then it hit me. 
What if I am the narcissist? The manipulative? The one who can’t have real feelings? 
How would I see that? I don’t remember things right, I don’t know how I feel and I don’t know why I am like this. I am afraid of any decisions regarding our teenagers because I feel bad about not being there enough for them when they were younger.
I guess the narcissist doesn’t know he/she is that. If they knew they would change. 
How can I be sure that I just don’t blame my husband for the past because I am too weak, cold, selfish and manipulative? 
What if I am the cause of my husband’s stress earlier? 
Does a manipulative person know that they are manipulative? Or a narcissistic person? My experience is that they often can explain them selves out of it. 
How can I find out if there is something wrong with me? 
I feel sick when I imagine how I might have ruined my husband and children’s life’s by simply being a cold and heartless person."
1062,Feeling numb after a period of prolonged stress and anxiety,"Hi guys!

So for context, I'm a healthcare worker (not on the frontline). I recently sought counselling for extreme stress and anxiety after I endured a very trying placement which ended in August. My self esteem crashed to the floor and I felt pretty low. I had my last counselling session back in August, and to all intents and purposes, my stress and anxiety had lifted.

I thought I would magically feel better though. However, since August, I've felt like a complete shell of a person. Outwardly, I'm fine. And I don't have any stress or anxiety, but I feel incredibly numb some days. And I can't explain it.

I still have my good days but on my bad days, which seems to be half the week, I feel vacant, numb and distant. There's no obvious trigger either. I'm still going to the gym which gives me a short-lived lift, which disappears. I'm still writing and chatting to my friends, but the feelings still linger.

I've recently been thinking about what the whole point of all of this is - what's the point of me going to work, for my MH to end up in the gutter? What's the point in the gym? I've had strong thoughts of quitting medicine because I'm not sure I'm very happy.

I've had quite a few wobbles over the last few months and I just want to be back to normal. And I don't know what more I can do to get back to normal. I'm frustrated and I know something doesn't feel right, and I just need some advice on how best to proceed :("
1063,The Black Rope of recurring depression has attacked me again,"Fuck this, Im much better person I was few years ago, and yet i have less and less contacts, less and less passion to do anything. 

I've tried looking for someone that could like me, all attempts failed. 

I love being alone and I hate it at the same time. I feel im much better than everyone and much worse at the same time. 

School, work, whatever, focus on it, live in denial, thats the only solution for people like me. 

I fucking hate existing"
1064,I need somebody to tell me what is happening to me,"I’m an 18 year old male and I don’t know what’s happening.
I am kind of in a long distance relationship, and I love her so much. She cares about me much more than any of my other girlfriends I had before.
I just can’t stop thinking about her replacing me, because it’s so easy to do. I told her about me waking up at night shaking and overthinking a lot, and she told me I have panic attacks and she always seems concerned.
Two days ago I had one of those while we were in video chat and I didn’t want to tell her about this, because she has a lot of problems of her own, but I noticed she started crying when se saw me. That made me love her even more.
Tonight we were in a call but she left earlier than usual, and I started to think stuff. I told her to tell me if there’s something wrong and she said she has strange days.
And now I really want to cry, because my mind is telling me that she is replacing me. 
I always feel I am not enough. 
Let me add that I never had a good day in years, and I really think I’m deppressed, but I keep on telling myself that it’s not true.
Can somebody tell me what should I do?"
1065,How can I help my girlfriend?,"I (19M) want to help my girlfriend (18F) in any way possible. She is sad most if not all of the time and is always tired and wants to do nothing. The only exception is when I offer to hang out together for any amount of time because that makes her happy and can be herself. She has always struggled with body issues, people judging her and has a negative view about her body. She has felt like this for the past year, most likely longer as I don't think she was open to talking about it before.

I want to know how I can get her help, what I could do to help her and support her. I know she needs a therapist and all the ones around my area have not worked for her. I am looking for anything that may help her feel more positive about herself and not be sad all the time. Thank you in advance"
1066,GWEN aka G,Hi guys has anyone heard from this girl who posted on this page that she was going to end her life. I’ve been really worried about her ... does anyone know this girl personally? Please reach out x
1067,Struggling,Lately I’ve found myself in a vicious circle of feeling entirely alone. I have always felt ‘outside the group’ but this year I feel like I could scream and no one would notice. I have tried talking to different people about it and no one understands how I feel which just adds to the feeling of being completely alone.
1068,I don't know what's going on anymore.,"As a lonely kid, keeping to myself was always the way to go and that lead to an untreated chronic depression of 9 years that switched into anxiety, then mounted to social anxiety, and now I think I'm dealing with BPD, because I have never treated my other illnesses beforehand. Although I am not one to self diagnose, I can't help but relate to BPD with every symptom. And that is another problem. How am I going to get help and determine my BPD if I don't have a job, Im a full time student, and I'm always feeling suicidal because of my relationship and my attitude towards my partner. Whenever I am close to her I feel something ball up in me and my face going hot, indicating my body that I need to run away and hide somewhere. Idk why this shit always happens to me. I also read about suicide earlier, and I just wanna die even more. I can't get a job and keep it because I can't talk to people properly. I wake up and I throw up. I always fight with my gf for no reason and I don't even think she wants me to go to the hospital. Ive told her I called once and she told me not to call again. idk what to do besides kill myself or run away abroad for a break. I cry everyday while I do my homework, because I don't have the time to cry. I just feel so stuck with myself. I need help. someone kidnap me and force me into a psych ward, please. I'm 19 but I still need my mom and dad. too bad my dad killed himself and my mom doesn't wanna help me because she feels guilty about my childhood that she didn't help me enough through the abuse. like, I literally ran away from home so I could study at McDonald's and post this reddit for help bc I know everyone else will just make me feel even shittier."
1069,Legal name change to move past abuse,"I’m thinking of changing my name. My dad was violent ... horribly abusive. Almost 2 decades of horror with him, emotional, mental, physical pain. His ugly
memory is a painful scar that hasn’t ever healed even with therapy and medication. Having his last name always reminds me of him (been almost 1.5 decades since I’ve talked to him, he returned to our home country while I stayed in America). I want to obliterate his memory from my life completely. While his family is lovely, he was horrible. I have no connection with themes I want to change it to my mom’s family? Who are wonderful people also but live in another country. But at least I speak to them, know the language and am in good term with my mom.

Wondering if anyone ever went through with a legal name change to erase an abusive parent?"
1070,Why am I like this?,"I am a 17M and I would consider myself and introvert so I have a hard time talking to people. On top of that I always am angry and want to be alone and that adds to my introvert behavior. Whenever I’m alone though I’m unhappy because I’m super lonely. I spend a lot of time on the internet. For some reason, it brings me joy being a dick. Like I saw another post on this subreddit about someone dealing with paranoia so I wrote”be careful they might get you” I realize that was probably not an ok thing to do but it made me laugh and it bring me happiness to fuck with other people. I’m also happy when I’m angry. Like when I’m arguing with someone it makes me happy that I’m pissed off. I also get super violent in my mind. Sometimes I think about beating the shit out of people that piss me off and 8/10 times it’s my own family members. Why am I like this and Why do I think these thoughts? My brother also has anger issues and is also a violent person and I have the strongest bond with him than any other family member"
1071,I think I've messed up my perception of myself as a real person,"I (17F) have been feeling for a long time like I am detached from real life. Sometimes it's as if I'm existing so completely in the moment that my brain refuses to recognise that I ever have existed or will exist outside of it. Other times it feels like I have no connection to anything or anyone around me, as if everyone may as well be strangers. For quite a while, I've been the I might be asexual but recently it crossed my mind that perhaps this detachment has left me without the desire to form new, and especially, meaningful relationships. I've been talking to someone online who recently proposed the possibility of meeting up irl. The only thing really stopping me is the prospect that once we meet, I am no longer just words on a screen to him. I am a real person and that creates a sort of obligation in my mind to act like one. I also feel a sense of lack of consequence sometimes, like my actions are all meaningless.


As I said, I've felt this way for quite a long time but recently it's been worse than before. There have been moments in which I have completely forgotten the person I am and have taken on, just for a second and just in my head, an entirely different persona. 


As for a cause, I've settled on my nighttime routine. Right before I go to sleep, I imagine stories and worlds. I imagine myself as entirely different people. I have done this pretty much every night, right before I sleep since I was about 6 years old. Quite a few mornings, particularly on weekends, I will find myself continuing these stories for at least a couple of minutes before I actually start the day as myself. I know that other people daydream but I don't know exactly how. When I do it, it's as if I really become the character and instead of thinking as myself about the character, I find myself thinking as the character. Today I would say I spent a good 4 hours thinking the thoughts of a 6ft, 20-something-year-old man. 


It scares me to think that maybe I haven't given myself the right conditions to develop a real personality. That the person I present is just façade and that, really, I am no one."
1072,Leaving the house,I’m having a hard time leaving my house lately. It’s even incredibly difficult to muster the strength to take my dogs out. Do y’all have any tips
1073,Parents and my suicidal thoughts,"Ok! This will probably be messy and I apologize for that. I just need this to be out.

So. I’m a 16 year old girl. I’ve struggled with depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts for a long time.
A few years back I even attempted suicide at the time i had been cutting for a few years. Nothing to severe but still bad self harm.
It was a very dark time for me. But I got through it. I will say that I got thought it without any help form others but I couldn’t bring myself to reach out at the time.
I was even clean for almost a years!
But things have gotten dark over the past 3 months. I don’t even know what started, but I’ve been cutting again. 
It’s worse this time. But I’ve learned a lot about all of this stuff and I’m aware that I need professional help before I start getting some worse thoughts.
But here’s the kicker. Normally a person my age would reach out to their parents. At least with some of it.
But my parents know about my self harm. A few years back my dad found my old bloody razor. And he just threw it out and never mentioned it to me.
Both of my parents have also seen my cuts but always take my shitty excuse or don’t even mention it!
I’m so lost... this was also why I never got help in the first place. My brain keeps telling me that since they don’t care then I don’t need help. 
And who the hell am I supposed to talk to??? 
It’s not like my parents are bad parents. Their view on mental health and mental problems is just so broken. And I don’t even think they are aware...
I’m just so lost on what to do. I can tell that my mental health is declining fast, but I don’t know how to stop It...

I hope this wasn’t too messy. I just needed this off my chest."
1074,Is it normal to be suicidal as a child, HI (And sorry for my english) When I was a child (about 6 to 10 years old) I started thinking about death a lot. I remember wanting to be a fly so I could only live a few days. I was thinking about the best way to kill myself without hurting my family. Every night I was crying because I imagined my mom and dad crying on my funeral when I woke them up they asked me whats wrong and I just told them I don't know. I realy wanted to die without hurting my family. Is it normal in a such a young age? I never attempted suicide because of the same reason but I am still kinda suicidal. I had some mental issues when I was young like strong ADHD mild symptoms of autism etc. but I still dont think this is normal.
1075,"Just realized I might be a psychopath, what should I do?","Hey guys hope y'all are doing well! Something has been troubling me recently. I realized, after doing tons of research and talking to psychologists, I might (actually almost certainly) be a psychopath. Looking back on my life, I have always been the odd one out. I have had shown very little sympathy towards other people and acted in a way that made some people uncomfortable. My friends don't say anything but I've felt their unease. several of my friends said I sounded insane when I am speaking. I'm about to graduate from college, I really don't want to live as a psychopath. I wish to live a normal life but I don't know how anymore. I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable around me even though I keep failing to act normal. What can I do? I think I need help but idk where to find it."
1076,Is what I’m feeling depression?,"So my whole life I’ve had anxiety. It’s gotten much worse as I’ve gotten older (22f). Just the pressure of growing up I guess. But I won’t get into that. But I’ve been feeling like life is unbelievably overwhelming.

-Making breakfast is a chore
- Showering is a chore (I’ve gone daysss without one and it’s gross)
- Getting out of bed is the hardest thing ever. Weekends it’s easier but still so hard
-Leaving my house to hang out with friends is the last thing I ever want to do (always put that in being an introvert). Or even going on walks. Or walking outside....

Not looking for a diagnosis over Reddit. I’m talking to my doctor in a couple weeks. I was going to talk to her about my anxiety but I’ve been noticing these things more and more. Some days it’s worse than others so it makes me doubt it’s anything serious but it’s there often enough."
1077,HOW TO COMFORT FRIEND WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION?,"Hi so I have an online friend who I've known for a yr and sometimes he tells me about his mental health.  I sometimes give him advice but let's be real,  he probably is already trying his best and advice isn't what he always what he wants to hear?

So what do I tell him (via internet) when he expresses his feelings? Do I stick with the typical,  ""it's okay?"" am I supposed to give advice?

What do you guys recommend?"
1078,5 year old brother wants to die,"my brother is five and he concerns me a lot, he gets upset and cries very easily and when he does he says things like “i wish i was dead” “i’m gonna kill myself” “i want to kill myself” “i want to be dead” “i hate my life” etc. my parents aren’t the best at parenting and are very old school meaning my brother gets yelled at when he cries and etc. he’s very sensitive so it happens a lot. basically it’s just concerning to me and i don’t know what i should do? i don’t want him to feel alone yknow but i’m not good with kids, just need some advice"
1079,Food for thought,"Trying hard to find pleasure in the small things in life and not nitpicking myself over everything (weight, school, relationships...). I am notorious for setting such high expectations for myself. I need to not set myself up for failure and learn to set small, obtainable goals."
1080,Is this “normal?”,"For some reason I feel like someone is watching me whenever I’m in an open space for when I’m talking some can here me.  That’s why I spend I lot of time in my room with my fan on really loud.  I do enjoy daydreaming and I do it a lot. (I’m starting to use it as a coping mechanism). 
Now that’s all really worrying me. I’m 99% sure there’s something going on but I just can’t say it.  Today my mom tried  to ask me what’s wrong.  I always say “I don’t know” but I do know.  I have just lost trust in her because I feel like she’s going to tell all of my relatives.  I’m just started to feel trapped.  My mom always says it’s just hormones.  Now i think I’m starting to avoid her.  Any advice?

(I know this paragraph kind jumps from topic to topic but I really need some help)"
1081,Should I be worried about her snap score?,My first post ever sorry if its in the wrong subreddit. We’ve been dating for a few weeks now and she sleeps alot. Sometimes we’ll be texting and she doesnt respond for a few hours sometimes up to five hours to respond with only saying she was sleeping but then she doesnt respond after that. But i’ll see her snap score continue to go up. She hasnt opened my snap in a few hours as well and its still going up. I have severe trust issues and despression as well so i tend to overthink things and they in turn make me depressed.
1082,Does this sound like BPD?,"Hello everyone, I am writing this post out of concern for my mental health. I am not exactly sure what is causing me to feel the way I currently do. Below I will list symptoms that I have noticed are prominent in my life. 

• My emotions tend to fluctuated frequently (hourly) This is my main concern. I feel like my emotions shift around a lot more than the “normal” person 

• I tend to be very reactive (angry) when dealing with my parents 

• My parents say that I seem very detached when I talk to them

• I am very hard on myself (very low self esteem) 

• Overall sense of sadness. I will have waves of sadness come over where I feel the need to cry. 

I am unsure if this is BPD. I have been obsessively researching personality disorders. I am concerned about how fast my mood/emotions change. Maybe this shift is due to depression? Any thoughts?"
1083,the days i drink more than one cup of milk my mood becomes worse than normal.,the title. I searched a bit and found some stuff but nothing that says exactly that milk can worsen depression or anxiety. I'm asking if anyone else experiences the same thing? because I'm cutting off milk. the feeling I get for the entire day after drinking some milk is not worth it at all.
1084,Should I be concerned about my friend?,"I (male, 17) have a friend (female, 18) who I've known for almost a year now.  We like to talk to each other about our mental health a lot as emotional support.  And lately, we've both been struggling.

Last week she texted me, ""I just feel like I can't take life anymore. I feel like I'm dying everyday"".

I replied, ""What, like suicidalism???""

Her:  ""Nope""  ""Just wanna not exist wish I never existed in the first place""  ""Anyways it's fine \[\] how r u?""

Me:  ""wait... i take things literally... you wish you never existed... but its fine?""

Her:  ""It's just a topic for another day""  ""It's okay I don't wanna talk about it anymore actually so it's fine.  But how are you??""

She told me a couple of days later that she isn't suicidal, but she would rather choose not to have ever been born than to have been born.

Am I just overthinking this, or is it something I should be more concerned about?  If so, how should I approach helping her?"
1085,Does the pain stop,recently my life has gone to shit. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me out of nowhere. I’ve been stressed about maintaining friendships. I’ve been stressed with keeping up with school work. I’ve been stressed about my relationship with my parents. I’ve been stressed over everything. The pain just feels like it wraps around me and restricts me. Nothing makes me happy and life is just painful. Does the pain stop?
1086,Found Out An Old Therapist Was A Predator,"I want to vent about this because it’s bothering me and I’m upset as well as very creeped out ... I also don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to put the victim on blast. For their sake, I will use as little details as possible and will not be trying to take away from their trauma. 

Basically, I found out my old therapist is a creep. He’s in jail now for doing some really messed up stuff. It makes me wonder if that was all bubbling beneath the surface, just waiting for the right moment. I’m thankful that nothing happened between us, but I can see how it could have. He was always a creep, preying on innocent, traumatized girls. I actually had a crush on him that he knew about - again, thankful nothing happened.

It upsets me because of what he did and the fact that he’s a therapist and was also a “friend”. Even my parents loved him and talked to him regularly. There’s a lot of good therapists out there and I thought he was one of them but apparently not. 

Anyways, thanks for listening"
1087,How do I get over a fallout?,"I (14m) have this friend (15F). Let's call her M. Me and M were really close, we were really really good friends. Then shit started going downhill last month, her toxic ex gf started speaking to her again and she started prioritising her over me, then all of a sudden, on Friday night M blocks me on nearly everything with no explination.

The best explination I could find was from our mutual friend (14f), who we'll call L. L spoke to her about it but the best she could say is that M feels like I'm ""extra stress"" that she can't deal with. I've had a really rough through months and usually id go to M to vent or just talk, so ig I can see where she's coming from.

On the other side though, I feel like its really unfair. Surely if someone's having a really bad time and you're thier best friend, the last thing you'd do is block them, because now I feel even worse. I know she's going through stuff aswell, but she could have just asked me to vent to someone else and I would have.

But anyway, this weekend has not been great. I've felt constantly shit about our fallout, and so I'm not taking it well. I don't want to be in this shitty spot forever, and so I want to move on if that's the best thing to do. But I don't know how. That's why I came here. Does anyone know how to effectively move on from fallouts, especially with really close friends?"

Surely if someone's having a really bad time and you're thier best friend, the last thing you'd do is block them, because now I feel even worse. I know she's going through stuff aswell, but she could have just asked me to vent to someone else and I would have.

But anyway, this weekend has not been great. I've felt constantly shit about our fallout, and so I'm not taking it well. I don't want to be in this shitty spot forever, and so I want to move on if that's the best thing to do. But I don't know how. That's why I came here. Does anyone know how to effectively move on from fallouts, especially with really close friends?"
1089,Is this common,"My grammar won't be perfect in this.

A lot of the time (especially at night) my anxiety starts going to worst possibilities very quickly. And the most difficult one to deal with is the idea that the world is ending or will end.

Most of the time this thought comes out of nowhere and it really scares me.

Is it anxiety or just my mental health getting me down during lock down."
1090,Looking for tests that reveal the unconscious,"I took a psych course in high school. The teacher passed out images and asked us to write what we thought was happening in the scene, what we thought the characters were thinking about, and then  told us that it was meant to reveal through projection something from our unconscious that we were avoiding. I'd like to dig deeper to understand and integrate my shadow. I appreciate your suggestions."
1091,Change doesn’t just happen,"I’ve always dealt with bad mental health, and bad experiences. I feel like my life is one shit storm after another. I have diagnosed depression, GAD, and ptsd. I have maladaptive daydreaming and I suspect some kind of adhd, but that’s besides the point. 

I’ve expected large life changes to also change me. I’ll be happier, I’ll be more fit, I’ll have and develop a social circle, I’ll be new and fresh.

I was homeschooled for a long time, so I thought when I went to school I’d be more successful and social. When going into high school I expected so much more then what I got, and thought I would find motivation to be more fit. I thought it would be easy. When my parents got divorced I thought I’d finally be freed of my heavy self-expectations and high expectations from others. Now that I’m about to go into College in the next two years, I’ve found myself under the impression more and more that I’ll be changed again. That I’ll be happy just because of this change. I guess it really didn’t click the first few times, huh? 

But I’m really realizing now that I’m unhappy with myself, and that’s why I’m wanting to “restart” so much and change in a new environment. I *want* to be happy just being me, and I *want* the motivation to get fit, and I *want* close friends.... but I’m not applying myself towards those goals. My lack of motivation and depression have kept me from those goals, but I have too. I’ve told myself for so long that I *cant* achieve those goals without some outside force, that I’ve started to believe it. But honestly, I’m tired of waiting.

I’m so tired of waiting for something else to change me. I’m tired of being disappointed with my own shortcomings. I’m so *so* tired of lying to and limiting myself. So starting today I’m going to start working out. Starting today I will try to introduce myself to new people, and put myself in uncomfortable situations. Starting today I will *not* rely on some fantastical outside force to change me or my life. I’m unhappy about many things, so it’s about time I change that for myself.

I just wanted to tell someone I guess. I don’t have anyone to really vent to or share my cheesy “revelations” to haha so thanks for listening if you read this far"
1092,is being happy a choice?,my therapist told me that i should just choose to be happy and then I will be. I feel like this is ridiculous and that she was criticizing me for something i can’t help. is it really an easy choice or am i being a bitch?
1093,A piece I wrote about my mental health got picked up by a large publication!,"Hey everyone,

First time posting here, and apologies if this isn't typical, but it seemed like a good place to share. For a long while, like many of you, I've had issues with my mental health. I made some recent discoveries about myself and have been writing about it as a way of processing things. I've always been a writer -- I studied it in college -- but it always felt like some dream I was incapable of ever fully realizing. Like it would always just be a hobby while I worked a dead-end restaurant job. That might still be the case. Who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

But recently I had some exciting news. I found out that the IDONTMIND organization accepts journal submissions, and so I wrote something for them expecting not to hear back. A week later, they sent me an e-mail saying they would be publishing my story and that they believed ""it was pretty much perfect."" I genuinely don't think I've ever felt so proud. I hope this doesn't come across as me being a braggart. My mental health issues often make it hard for me to focus on anything or stay motivated. I lose interest easily and find myself overwhelmed with self-doubt and negative thought cycles, so for me to not only have finished something but to also have it be accepted by an organization I'd admired for a long time was borderline surreal, and I just wanted to share that with a community I think will understand.

I'm going to link to the story, for anyone who wants to read it, as well.

1095,Can’t stop having suicidal thoughts,I’m someone who can’t seem to get out of these suicidal thoughts. TBH the only reason I haven’t is because I’m scared of going to hell. Does that me me a b*tch? Much of it stems from my lack of ability to find a girlfriend or get any type of female attention. I’ve always been bullied and disrespected (from grade school to now at my VA call center job) and every time I’ve tried to respond they’ve responded worst ten fold. Please give me some help or advice from someone who’s been in a similar situation
1096,Supporting a friend with mental health issues while having mental health issues myself,"Hey everyone,
I have this friend that I was really close in high school with (now 4 years ago) and I still see her every now and then but we simply grew apart emotionally and we dont talk that often anymore. Lets call this friend Eva.
Recently I found out via a mutual friend that Eva has gotten pretty deep into an eating disorder in the past few months (Eva does not know that I know that about her now). Her ED is also the result of a lot of complex traumas that have accumulated basically over her whole life. She has mention that she wants to get professional help at a clinic, but she would have to wait a pretty long time for that to get in (about 3 months)

The thing is that I really want to help her (especially for the time that she wont be able to get into a clinic) but I am also dealing with some mental health issues myself (seasonal depression being the dominant one, and I also regularly have feelings of almost being burnt out. I also have a history of anorexia, but I recovered from that 6 years ago and I can confidently say that that is completly gone now, fortunately) and I am afraid that might take a toll on my own mental health at some point. At the same time, not being there for her right now also really messes with me mentally (especially because I feel like it would be good for her to be around somebody that went through the same and recovered). 

What would you do if you would be in a similar situation? Help your friend or giving priority to your own mental health first? I want to contact her anyway to at least not leave her alone, but I simply have no clue how (again I have not spoken to her for quite some time)."
1097,PLEASE READ,"My teachers often tell us to spend an hour on homework. If I spent an hour for every class, I would be up past midnight. And I often am. 7 hours of school + 5-6 hours of homework. Then straight to bed to repeat the same for the next however many years left of my childhood. How am I supposed to have a life or a childhood when I have NO free time at all? How am I supposed to maintain my sanity and expected good grades when I spend more time for school than my parents do at their jobs? This is a cry for help, school is overworking students (mainly high schoolers) and its not okay.  Adults don’t see anything wrong with what’s going on, but imagine coming home from a work day just to continue working into the night. You’re tired and sleep deprived. You have no feeling of accomplishment because the same will happen tomorrow. And the next day. It will eventually get to your head, and for most of today’s students it unfortunately has. And it is going unrecognized. Please. Make a change. Somehow. Some way."
1098,Is there a way to find out if my parents are hiding mental illness information about me?,I can’t ask them so I was hoping you guys could help :).
1099,I don't feel like I can do this anymore,"Is there really any point in continuing to live? I'm in my late teens and have suffered with my mental illness for 6 years now. I really don't feel like it's worth it to keep going, I can't make real relationships with people, everyone judges me and I'm known to be socially awkward and weird among other people my age. 

Even if things do get better I know it'll be really hard for me to keep myself together, I've had great things happen to me throughout my life but I still find myself craving death. I've made attempts before, even ended up having a near death experience because of it. I use substances and always manage to harm when something doesn't go my way. Is there any point In  continuing to live in this pointless existence? 

I don't care about anyone at this point, all the people In my life has told me I'll amount to nothing, I get picked on and bullied all the time even from my own siblings in front of my romantic partners. and I'm so tired of people finding things wrong with me. Even my own therapists can't support me because of the way I am. I don't know what to do except to give up and stop trying to be someone I know I'll never be able to fully be."
1100,I don’t know what is wrong with me,"I’ve always kind of new I had some sort of mental health illness but I’m not sure which one.
At first I thought it was depression as I felt sad and suicidal often but I wasn’t sure as I wasn’t always sad it was just sometimes. Then I thought I was a sociopath as whenever I felt depressed I also hated everyone and wanted everyone else to die too and just didn’t care about the people around me, once when I was really upset about something I planned to kill my dad/ hurt him and I started shaking and crying. Recently ive been looking into bipolar and thought maybe I have that as I have big mood swings from feeling really positive and optimist then I wake up the next day and think me yesterday was such an idiot I can’t be arsed to do that but I’ve never really felt that happy and energetic but when it does happen it’s usually before I go to sleep. I’m usually more depressed than happy but most of the time it’s just average.

A few hours ago I was looking into lucid dreaming and I tried it but I ended up having a sleep hallucination (I think), it felt like I was dreaming but more realistic but I could also feel myself awake and I knew I wasn’t asleep, I also knew I could move but I didn’t want to because I didn’t want it to stop.

I’m also extremely socially awkward and I don’t want to tell anyone about all this stuff, I’ve told a few of my friends about some of this but I don’t want to see a doctor or a therapist or talk to anyone cause that would make me uncomfortable and it would be awkward"
1101,How do i get over it,"I dont know how to start this but im gonna go straight in.
So today for some difficultys and some problems with neighbours i had to give my dog to a good family to take care of him. Im kinda happy that he gets to family that can really take care of him and at the other point it makes me soooooo freaking sad to go on without him. Any advice on how can i keep going on?
(Sorry for bad English not my main language)"
1102,I am empty,"I lost my father about 2 weeks ago. Me and my mother found him, and 911 forced me to do CPR on him. It did not work. Now, i’ve gone through plenty of traumatic experiences in life, and each one slowly chipped away at my “soul” i guess you could call it. I’ve had guns held to my head, seen friends die, etc etc. But this one? This was different. Before, i could fend off the numbness by drowning it out with booze. But i don’t drink anymore. This is different though. This shattered the last remaining care I had on this earth. Every ambition. Every feeling but pain and anger. I am purely a spectator to my own life, as i drift from here to there where people need me, constantly in a thousand yard stare reliving the moment i found my father. The noises. The screams. Everything. Constantly. I am a husk of my former self, a shell. The last spark that was showing me light in this life has been blown out. I can’t end my life, for that would only bring this pain to my family and friends. So i’m here. Existing in this world of constant pain and torture. Only existing to help others through their pain while I suffer it."
1103,I hate myself,"I hate myself. 

Depression, is an inconsistent feeling of emptiness, sadness, and anxiety for me. The inability to love, maintain relationships, feel joy, fulfillment, purpose, desire. I think of how killing myself could fix my problems (I AM NOT SUICIDAL). Not having to deal with these feeling any longer. How it would be easier than feeling like shit. Hating myself. Not feeling smart enough, not feeling correct with the life I’ve made for myself. Living a lie. No relationship with my father, mother, sister. Divorced parents. Father was hardly ever there. Never emotionally. Grew up w my Mother who was an alcoholic and I blame her for fucking me up. We still talk occasionally but there’s a undiscussed resentment there. Older sister is mentally unstable. Diagnosed as bipolar and possibly schizophrenic. She’s been hospitalized a few times. I know she’s in a dark place. Have a broken relationship with her and my niece. Pos uncle but she lives in NY I’m in Florida. Been moving around since I was 19. Hard to maintain family relations, plus I’m bad at communicating feelings and feeling in general. Add on the social anxiety and it doesn’t help either. 

Things too be happy for. 1- Stable job in the military for 6 years. Coast guard so hardly the military. Still regulations and rules I don’t wanna follow anymore. Uniforms and haircut standards. Fucking dumb. Military hierarchy-fucking dumb. Corrupt government that doesn’t care about its people. Only joy is actually participated in saving a few lives. Short lived pleasure. Aviation maintenance technician. It’s a good job in the coast guard, wouldn’t say I’m mechanically inclined but I’m able to do the job. Anxiety takes a large toll on me w my job, I don’t work well with others watching. My hands start to shake and I think they’re judging me but I’m really not a terrible mechanic. Think I wanted to become a mechanic to prove I’m a man and fulfill some stereotype that I missed out because of my dad not being there. I want to do something more meaningful but I feel stuck financially and have know idea what that would be. I’m 25 so maybe that’s normal. 
2- have a gf that I believe actually loves me. Don’t think I feel the same. She moved from her home state to be with me and is in school. I don’t want to hurt her but I find myself increasingly annoyed by her, finding myself less attracted to her. Did long distance for multiple years before hand, wasn’t a perfect man. But since she’s moved in, more than a year now. I’ve straightened myself out but still I know I’m a pos and it’s starting to feel like living I’m living a lie. Adds to the self hate. Was a lonely and depressed before she moved in and thought it would change. It didn’t. Go figure the problem is just me. Also I’ve distanced myself from any friends I had before she moved in. Blowing people off and just not feeling like socially interacting. Dug myself a hole. 

Didn’t plan on posting this, I started typing in my notes to see if it would make me feel better and it did. I’m really not planning on harming myself so please don’t think that. Just needed to vent and be honest with myself for once. Maybe get some advice."
1104,Hey guys what’s the difference between love and loyalty?,"Doing research for my podcast 
Legacy has left the building on Spotify"
1105,I feel tired and nothing at all a lot,"TW: Small mention of self harm


Hi. I’m on mobile so please excuse any formatting issues if they arise I’m gonna try my best, thank you :)

So I guess the title says it in a way. I feel tired (I think that’s what it is??) but nothing really. I’m just sort of empty? I get it a lot- every evening usually. When I don’t have anything that needs to be done and I’m not actively talking to anyone.

I have a great set of friends and an amazing boyfriend, but when I get like this I don’t answer my friends often until the next day and the only person I feel able to talk to is my boyfriend- and I know it sounds stupid “ooooh my boyfriend is the only person who really understands me!” 

I know my friends would understand- many of them having their own issues of that kinds but I don’t know- I guess my boyfriend is my best friend and he just makes me feel better. 

God that sounds so bad I’m sorry but I guess it true. I think a big problem is that I don’t have enough energy to start conversations. I won’t talk to my boyfriend unless he texts me first when I’m like this because I just can’t. I cannot pick up that phone. I cannot pretend to be not this. The thought of moving is so grey. Everything is so so grey. It’s the same feeling I got before I used to hurt myself earlier this year. 

That sounds bad but normally I’m ok. Normally I feel normal- basically with a bit more energy to feel anything. 

I can’t talk to my parents. My dad is complicated and emotionally unavailable and my mum doesn’t believe in therapy or ADHD. I told her about my hurting myself and she talked to me and I tried to tell her everything but I think I messed it up and didn’t properly express it? I don’t know but she didn’t ask me for the knife or anything. She just sent me to bed after a long talk. She’s asked me about it four times since then- this was April. She calls them “Silly thoughts”. 

I don’t really know at the moment. If you’ve gotten through that small novel of text, thank you :) I hope you all have a good day!"
1106,"I can’t tell if my emotions are valid, I can’t trust them anymore.","I have undiagnosed autism (twin sister has it, parents believe I do, counselor does as well) and clinical anxiety and depression. I’ve recently moved in with two friends of mine, and if kind of been upset with them because they are just so much closer than I am with them. But I’ve known one of them much longer than they’ve known each other and it just hurts. When they stressed our happy or excited the first thing they do is go to each other. They’ll sometimes ask just to hangout with each other alone. And neither of them ever ask to hang out with me alone. They’ll tell each other secrets long before they tell me and it just really hurts. It feels  like they might be singling me out because i don’t act adult enough. Meaning I struggle socially, and with things other people my age are expected to do, and it makes me feel stupid. I just can’t tell if them being closer is even a valid reason for being upset, but it’s been deeply affecting me for a while and I don’t think it’s gonna get better. And I’m wondering if I should just move on cause I don’t feel like I’m getting the friendship that I want. But I also feel crazy cause maybe this is all in my head and Im being irrational. And just don’t know what to do about this anymore. I’ve talked about it with them before, telling them how I felt left out but I feel like nothings really been resolved and they don’t understand the actual issue. I feel crazy, and like a total brat, but I don’t want to lose this friendship cause it’s the only one I’ve ever really had."

1109,[UK] need advice,"Hi, I've been struggling with my mental health since u was a child, specifically depression with panic and anxiety appearing in the last 5 ish years. 

I also am pretty sure I have ADHD and CPTSD and maybe ASD, I feel silly typing this because it is obviously not diagnosed but I'm sure I will never be able to get or afford an actual diagnosis.

I'm currently taking 200 mg of sertraline a day, I think it might have helped a little but I'm still not sleeping or eating well and the only thing I want to do is sleep.
Because of corona my doctors have a form that you fill in online and it asks you to rate things about anxiety/depression, whenever I do it it tells me to contact 111 but I know they can't do anything either, so I change my answers so I can see a GP.

I'm in my last year of uni and I really don't know how I got hear, I've barely put any work in, not for lack of trying, and I feel like a failure, I'm probably going to graduate with a 2:2 and I don't know of I'm going to be able to do anything with that, which would make the last 4 years of struggling pointless.

My parents were emotionally abusive, my dad wasn't very affectionate and I'm sure he has ASD and PTSD (from the army), also my birth mum died when I was 1 and he never really spoke to me about her. My mum (stepmum) has BPD, which i diagnosed her with (confirmed by her doctors) and is extremely hard to deal with because she gets angry at the smallest of things but she has literally no friends and I have basically been her therapist since I was 6 years old, so I feel responsible for her.

I went ""no contact"" ish with my parents last year and it was horrendous, so many manipulative abusive texts and I knew that there was a high chance of my mum committing suicide. We are talking now but it takes a huge toll on me.


Also both of my parents are disabled, my mum broke her back and is on a lot of painkillers and my dad has very severe fibromialgia. This upsets me because I can't do anything to help them, and although I have a lot of issues with them, I still love them.


I know I need therapy and help, but whenever I try to get it, they really don't offer much or really listen to me. I know it would take being suicidal to get help but by the time it gets that bad (it has gotten this bad many times) I know I won't be able to get help because I will feel hopeless.

I can't help but feel like I'm weak for not just getting on with it because I know I am able to do what I absolutely have to, but I just want to be able to get out of bed to do something for me. Like I want to go on a walk for no reason or be able to read like I used to, and I have no idea how to get there.


Sorry for the long ramble, I'm not sure that anyone will get this far. If you comment or message me don't be worried if I don't respond, I can get quite stressed responding to things like that. If you have any ideas of what I should do, please let me know. I hope this made sense.

Thank you."

1111,I’ve lost my motivation again.,"I’ve been crying for so long. Well my mom just basically told me she doesn’t care about me and that she favorites my brother. I already knew but it hurt to hear her say it. 

I’ve struggled for a long time. 

My mom went on this whole speech in the car about how she doesn’t care what I do anymore and how she’s given up on me on me and that she doesn’t care anymore. She said that my brother was more important and 3 seconds later said she never said my brother  was more important but she did and she knows she did. 

She told me she doesn’t think I’m going to go anywhere in life. I always thought I was going to do something good for myself in life but maybe not. She said my art was just coloring as if I didn’t put hours and hours into it. I thought I was getting good but idk anymore. I just don’t. 

I just want her support but she’s made it really clear that I don’t have it Because She said it as if she was giving me advice as if she was helping me out. 

I was in the car sobbing trying not to make a sound because of she told me. I feel like I’m nothing. I’ll never be what she wants so what’s the point. Honestly what’s the point. I was getting my motivation back after months of wanting to do nothing but I can’t anymore. I can’t stop crying and I just feel so lost. I have no way to get this out. I don’t know what to do."
1112,Is there a way to get over misophonia?,"I haven’t been diagnosed (I don’t know if you even need to be diagnosed for it), but it feels pretty clear to me that something is wrong.

This person is one of the most well mannered eaters I know, but I can’t even tolerate their chewing. Just thinking about them eating makes me mad or anxious. Even when I hear them scraping a bowl, I have to cover my ears because I know that means they’re eating. And if I’m with them when they’re eating (even if it’s just a small thing like a nut), I have to leave the room. Today, I actually left the room and cried because of it.

1113,school is making me hate my life // tw mention of ED and SI,"throwaway because this is a disaster and i'm kind of ashamed of my position. big ol vent ahead so sorry for lack of clarity or anything else. im not going back to edit it. 

i dont know how to do school anymore. i simply cannot handle it. i'm a senior (that will be taking an extra year) who has had a very troubled school experience. i have gone part time and taken medical leave in the past because of being hospitalized and getting treated for my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder. now i'm recovered from my eating disorder since that's what my treatment focused on but my depression and anxiety have never left me and i'm struggling to keep up in life again. 

first i was enrolled in 2 of my major classes and one minor elective. i dropped the minor elective (and the minor, for now) because the course difficulty was off the charts and i was completely unprepared. so i swapped it for some ""easy"" GE full of freshman so it couldnt be that bad, right? well wrong, i was a week and a half behind when i got in and i missed 220 points worth of assignments and attendance. so even if i got 100% in everything, i'd still only be able to get a 78% and let's be real, there's no fucking way i'd be able to get 100% in everything. the course material is mostly physics which i have never taken because my shitty high school never offered it which i didnt know when i enrolled because it was never mentioned in the syllabus or course description. then suddenly, on all the homeworks, i had to know physics to complete it. 

so i'm trying to get the documentation to go part time again, but since my therapist dropped me over summer because she felt like i wasnt getting any better and i have not been able to find another therapist, my documentation that the school had was voided. so all of my disability accommodations and qualification for part time is gone and i have to get new documents. the deadline to sumbit for part time is wednesday and it's sunday. i have an appointment to see someone from my schools health center on monday but they failed to inform me that this person is an intern and is virtually powerless in my situation. so i dont know what the fuck im going to do. i already changed my enrollment in the class to pass/fail but i cant do the work to even get a pass at this point. i have 2 jobs and before anyone asks, i tried to qualify for part time using the fact that i work 30 hours a week as an excuse but they wouldnt take it because i work 15 hours a week at each job which is less than their ""minimum"" of 25. so i need to get it based on my health instead. 

i feel so hopeless. this school is going to be the death of me. i think about dropping out every time i open my books or my laptop to work. on top of everything i am prone to chronic migraines so sometimes i wont even get 30 minutes into a lecture before staring at the screen causes me to be in complete agony for hours or even days. I had to watch 4 hours of lectures (2 2 hour classes) this past thursday and i was involuntarily crying the whole time because my head hurt so bad. when i ended the day it was the worst pain of my life. i took excedrin but i was still in so much pain i thought i might puke or pass out. im usually never on the computer for this long and ive tried the glasses, the screen dimmers/filters etc and nothing works. if i use it for more than an hour im guaranteed a headache at bare minimum. so im kind of fucking myself right now because i can feel the pressure building in my head but i just need to get this out.

ive tried to talk to the disability people at my school. i was on the phone with them for 45 minutes on friday but everybody says their fucking hands are tied. i tried to go to my professors and ask for anything, any extension, any possibility that i can handwrite/upload, have extra time to do quizzes, literally anything but they all say their hands are all tied. it makes me feel like im drowning, i feel like i have weights on my feet dragging me down and im SCREAMING for anything, any help, just someone to care, please at the very least just fucking NOTICE me and ACKNOWLEDGE that i am suffering right now and cut the shit they theres totally nothing that can be done for me. its like everyone would rather see me drown. one less email in their inbox, one less uncomfortable phone call where you have to pretend to care, one less person in the class asking questions when everyone else seems to understand. 

i dont know what im going to do. we are only on week 3 and this is the worst academic stress i have ever faced. not to repeat what everyone already knows but WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. expectations of us have not changed and we are forced to do it all online. everyone says its so easy! canvas is so easy, zoom is so easy and intuitive! it's fun! it's different! we make it work! but ITS NOT WORKING. ITS NOT WORKING. I REPEAT IT IS NOT FUCKING WORKING. just to stay on top of my assignments, i have to check my email, my spam sometimes, canvas files, canvas assignments, canvas modules, canvas announcements, zoom, yuja, piazza, gradescope, m-h connect, google drive, google classroom, hypothesis, and 4 online textbooks. this is absolutely absurd, i dont care how tech savvy you are. please understand that it is unacceptable to not have a single common platform from which to view and submit work. i can't keep up and i cant handle it. 

i cant take a leave because im already going to have to take a 5th year to make up for my past missed coursework. i cant imaging having to stay at this godforsaken school for fucking 6TH YEAR. and im not crazy intelligent so i cant drop out and start a business or whatever. at this point i honestly think i might just not be meant to be alive. i feel like a constant burden to everything and everyone and i'll never be fully self sufficient. it makes me feel like a fucking idiot. i dont know what to do anymore. i sometimes get stuck in loops of thinking i should just kill myself but im not gonna fucking do that. honestly? i like who i am. i believe that school aside i am a pretty smart person. i have great common sense, i am empathetic, i am emotionally intelligent and kind. other than the chronic migraines i am healthy and it took me so long to get here. i went from starving myself to the point of near death to binging uncontrollably but with time and consistent effort despite the discomfort i have reached a point where i am fit, active, strong, and healthy, no longer plagued by thoughts of food and my body, or compulsive exercise or purging. and for all that im grateful. i've worked too hard to give up now. i have so much going for me right now and the only thing weighing me down is school. 

the thing is school just has a way of defining your whole life. i need it to get a career, i need a career to make money, i need money to afford the cost of living, etc etc. it all comes down to having to just suck it up and do well in school for 2 more years. but i dont know if i can. school wasnt meant for people like me. i know other students are stressed but they don't get so anxious they become paralyzed. they dont get headaches so bad they puke. they dont get so depressed that they have to live another day just to spend it on zoom that they fantasize about killing themselves the whole 8 hours they should be catching up on sleep. when im not in school i actually pass as a functional person! i go to work, i do my chores, i run my errands, i engage with others and in my hobbies. school just turns me into a fucking wreck and a sad excuse for a human being. it's so sad because i actually love learning. i was always the most curious kid growing up and still, even now i just have an unshakeable curiosity for everything. i want to learn. so i dont know what to do. i dont know if ill get approved for part time. im probably going to fail one or more of my classes this semester. maybe that will be a relief though. it's gonna be confusing for me to throw this in at the last minute but i've made the deans list every quarter since i came to school for every semester i've taken a full course load. maybe i need to fail just to know i still can and it won't be the end of the world for me. when grades get published im not going to suddenly combust if i see an NP on my record. i'll see it and move the fuck on. i'll take another round of classes next semester and try again. repeat as long as it takes to get my degree and get out. and if any future employers or schools want to know, man what the fuck happened to you in 2020? how do you explain how bad you did? then i have no words. it speaks for itself. 2020 has been a shitshow of a year. 2020 doesnt encapsulate who i am as a student and as a person. 2020 doesnt mean shit. 2020 can suck my ass because i'm going to show up to 2021 in spite of it all ready to keep on going whether that means success or failure. i'll keep failing for the rest of my life if i have to but im not giving up, and thats a promise. 

but right now my fucking head hurts. it's a sunday night so im giving myself a tiny break but tomorrow morning im going to get back on the phone, write those emails, whatever the fuck i need to do to get the support i need right now. because i deserve it or something like that. and if i don't get it? fuck them. fuck the admin, fuck professors, fuck em all. it's not the end of the world if/when i fail and imma still be the same great person. none of my achievements and successes will go away from one dumb failure.

love you guys, if you made it this far then damn im sorry i guess lol. take it easy and if you're in school right now and feeling the stress you're not alone. im right there with you and we are gonna get through this shit no matter what."
1114,Am I destined to become my mentally ill grandmother?,"I’ve struggled with mental health my entire life. I’m unsure if I should talk to my doctor about it and worried about gaining more weight on medication again.

Age 5: struggled with anxiety, disordered eating, trichotillomania 
Age 9: suicidal thoughts, balding eyebrows and bald spots on crown from trichotillomania 
Age 16: binge eating but in shape due to sports, trichotillomania is now a hidden issue (picking only in random spots instead of specific spots) in therapy (did not discuss trich or binge eating)
Age 20: Went on Zoloft, gained 20 lbs. 
Age 23: Got off Zoloft and binge eating and trich resume (trich not as intense)
Current age 27: struggling with binge eating/compulsive behavior (checking the kitchen 20 times before leaving my apartment for a long weekend or even a day trip). Trich is not as bad but that’s because I noticed stress related hair loss lately and worried about it.

My grandmother, who I never met, struggled with mental illness until she took her life in her 50s. She was morbidly obese, artistic like myself and struggled with anxiety. My mother struggled with trichotillomania until her 30s but is petite and runs 10 miles a day, she still struggles with anxiety but uses exercise as “her medicine”. 

I want to be healthy, happy and not let myself become my grandmother. I feel so bad for her for not getting help but I feel like I’m sidelining myself because I’m afraid of gaining more weight and becoming more depressed over my appearance. I’m not obese for my 5 ft frame but I’m worried I can’t control my compulsive behavior anymore. Any suggestions? I’m going to talk to my doctor about something unrelated Wednesday."
1115,I cried last night,"Sorry. I’m on mobile. 

I am a 19 y/o male college student with high functioning Autism. I have a fear of showing my emotions in front of other people. I don’t like being seen as a burden. I also don’t like grabbing attention like that. 

Because of all this, overvthe years i’ve supressed my emotions. I’ve seen it as the safest thing. For everyone else, out of site out of mind. I can be what I want people to see me as: a happy person who likes to love on people. I want people to be happy when interacting with me. If they are not, then my brain translates to “I did something wrong this is my fault they probably hate me now. Logically I know this is false, but who actually thinks logically when your an anxious hot mess. 

Despite these fears, what i’ve wanted for a really long time is to be able to cry in someone’s arms. I want someone to hold me and let me be weak. But not only am i afraid to do that, but i’ve hidden my emotions so long that I have trouble releasing them when i’m by myself. It took me around 30 minutes. I wrapped myself in blankets. It would not come out. I tried sad thoughts, but i’m already sad. I’ve even tried hitting myself. I slapped myself pretty hard. No damage that anyone would notice, just enough to move the process along. I was close but no tears. I finally got the idea to watch a try not to cry challenge. I was already on the verge. I just needed a push. The first video got me and I bawled my eyes out like a baby. The only thing missing was someone else to help me while I cried. I took a shower afterwards and now I can feel better till the next time. I know I should ask for help, but again I don’t want people to stress over me like that. There shouldn’t be a reason for these feelings anyways. I have a good life with good friends and good family. Whatever is happening to me is my fault."
1116,What happened to me last night?,"Last night I hopped into bed and went to go to sleep. Next thing I know I just started to chuckle and then it turned into full blown laughter. Nothing was amusing me I just couldn't control it. I was laughing so hard I started crying and almost choking on my breath. Does anyone know what this means or what it is. I'm just so very confused.

I also suffer from an ED called ARFID aswell as depression, just as some backstory incase it somehow was related to that."
1117,Depression in college,I genuinely do not know how people are able to manage depression in college whatsoever. In the past I have been able to encourage myself thinking when I finish X will happen or I can do X but at this point I just do not care whatsoever. I do not like my major I do not want the resulting career I will be getting from it and I don’t want to keep continuing suffering through studying for it when I’m not looking forward to anything besides cutting off my relationship with my father. But what’s the point? The trauma and issues in my head aren’t going anywhere and I get no enjoyment out of being alive at this point. I don’t want to continue this and I don’t care if I fail this exam but I also think what if later I feel better and wish I tried harder? If i get below a certain grade I fail this class due to my program and I’m in a way hoping I fail so I can just truly give up on everything entirely.
1118,can't take it [tw SI],"Sorry I don't have anywhere to post this that won't alarm my friends and bring up conversations I don't have the energy to have but I'm just tired of carrying in my head how much I want to fucking die. I feel empty. I keep fucking up simple things. I work hard at my job but our team keeps shrinking so no matter how much I do I am increasingly behind. I'm just so tired, I don't want to do this anymore."
1119,Should I tell my therapist about my sleep talking about my narc mom ?,"I’ve sleep talked all my life , a few weeks ago I decided to download an app that tracks it . I was listening back in the morning and there are a few recordings where I am audibly distressed telling my mom “calm down mom, calm down “ . I was wondering if I should mention my distress to my therapist but I don’t know if I should because I’m sleeping when I said it so does it even count ?"
1120,How normal is it to wanna quit your job after a couple of weeks?,"Okay so I don't know what it is but it seems whenever I start a new job I feel a glimmer of hope, like this will be different this one will be new but I'm not even couple hours in to shift and I feel like I just want to walk away it's like I can't take the stress even know I wanna work I wanna live my life I even wanna pull longer shifts I wanna be happy but I literally lose my strength (not even being remotely figurative) it gets hard to move stuff around, I don't want to seem like I'm complaining about something little but I've never had the will to work or pretty do anything thing in my life I constantly feel so broken and empty inside and I hate it the only way I push through is I get angry at my weakness at my predicament I even sometimes physically smack and hit myself to even get myself motivated. I feel like everyday I'm trudging through sludge. 
Sorry I know the grammar is bad but you know I have a shift here in 2 hours and walking and clearing my mind seems to be the only thing that even remotely helps my mental state...
Even if you don't have an answer I still appreciate the read I suppose this is also a way to vent too. :/"
1121,Is this separation anxiety? Or just part of my PTSD and anxiety/depression?,"Since I was a child I’ve always been really unsettled when leaving friends or family behind. But to add to that, I have recurring scenes of the worst possible scenario and it raises my anxiety through the roof. When my SO leaves for work, I’m fighting the temptation to call him every 20 minutes because a recurring scene of him getting into a horrible crash cycles through my head until I hear his voice again. If we spend a lot of time apart, despite being transparent and trustworthy for the 4 year span of our relationship, I (unintentionally) imagine him cheating on me in the most vile of ways. Two weeks ago, I drove an hour back home just to stop myself from thinking that some unknown mistress was in our house with him. Only to come home and see him doing his usual work, it’s exhausting but I wouldn’t have stopped thinking about it otherwise. These feelings all go away when he’s present, they’re often just triggered by me being left alone. I can even laugh it off and acknowledge how irrational my fears get. But when I’m alone, my thoughts plague my mind and I don’t know how to ignore them without positively reinforcing this behavior. I think that giving in to calling and texting my family when I get like this will only make me more of a burden or nuisance to them..

It isn’t only with my SO, it’s with my younger brother also and it mainly revolved around my parents in the past, despite the relentless abuse.  I also ask my friends to text me when they get home after they’ve left my house. Does anyone else deal with this daily? How does one cope with it without being like a traumatized dog to their loved ones? 

TL;DR: I have vivid images of my family dying and being hurt in ways that make working and functioning day to day pretty debilitating for me unless I call and make sure they’re okay. Is this separation anxiety or just part of being depressed? Is this normal? How do I cope?"
1122,I want to feel something other than worried and paranoid,I feel nearly nothing each day. I have my ups and down but I consistently cant cry or feel joy. And paranoia and stressing about life is the loudest drum. I would like to be held as pathetic as it sounds and just let my emotions out
1123,Relationship causing anxiety?,"This post may be a bit rambly but I’ll keep it as concise as possible. For context I wanted to post this here due to the heavy mental health implications rather than on relationship advice based subreddits.

I’ve been with my partner for 5 years, we’re both nearly 30 and live together. He has been working from home while I’ve been working outwith. His behaviour has drained me, not just over lockdown but our entire relationship. I explain that he’s doing something that upsets me or dredges up old traumas and he will apologise and claim he won’t do it again. Then it happens again I’m left a wreck and the cycle continues. I’m noticing a lot of other things that don’t add up either, I believe he is being unfaithful due to certain things he’s doing. Things like hiding his phone screen from me and never giving me a straight answer for things, but also expecting to know everything I’m doing. All of these issues combined are causing me unbelievable stress and anxiety. I’d even go as far to say I’m becoming paranoid. I tell him this and nothing changes. That’s the issue.

I’ve been with him for five years and he still does things that I’ve told him hurt very deeply, I figured relationship counselling was the last resort because five years of talking clearly hasn’t helped. I told him that this was my last ditch attempt to fix things and I think that scared him, so much so he was uncooperative in arranging a day where we could go to the session, eventually we got to a session and we have another session planned for a week and a half from now. I don’t know if I’m just beating a dead horse at this point.

Additional context: the last couple of times I’ve tried to bring up the effect his actions have on me he claimed he has been depressed and feeling suicidal. Of course this was hugely concerning to me because he had not mentioned anything of the sort before, and we ended up discussing his mental health instead. Though his mental health may be contextual, it does not excuse his actions; but I worry about the implications this will have on the possible future of the relationship.

Fact is after years of constant disregard to my mental well-being while I’m expected to be the golden girlfriend I just feel so worn down by it all. I don’t know if it’ll improve but the effect it’s having on me is making me want to self harm again I feel so worthless. I don’t know if I should see the counselling through or if I should cut my losses and try to rebuild myself. Am I perhaps not emotionally dealing with this effectively? I have also considered the option of getting him to move out, and give us some distance. Does anyone have any similar experiences or thoughts on this?"
1124,Nothing feels real,It feels like I'm in a dream all the time. I'm not where I want to be and it feels like my life is supposed to be taking a different path right now and the different path is my real reality. I'm just stuck here. If I injured myself or something bad happened to me it wouldn't matter because none of it's real.
1125,I snapped,"I was talking with my friend about how I was struggling and they kept saying: I understand, I know how you feel, I know what it’s like. Eventually I snapped and shouted. Idk what happened really. Sorry for bothering I just needed to tell someone."
1126,What To Do When An Healthy Outlet Turns Unhealthy?,"I’ll go straight to the point. I suffer from severe ADHD. Because of that, I have anxiety, depression, etc. . It was always noticeable bad and even drew me to near suicide in 2014. However, until 2020, things were going fine. Then everything shut down. My adhd medication always made me anxious but just taking it with nothing else to do or go turned it against me. It’s now almost 2021 and I’m a shell of my former self. I suffer from Pure O/obsessive behavior, crippling social anxiety, near suicidal depression, paranoia delusions, intense RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder), etc. I’m truly in an terrible place and even though I switched my medication, the damage is already done. I’m never going to be mentally restored. The person I was leading up to this year is gone. That brings me to my current problem. Music. I’ve done music my entire life. It’s been a heathy and safe way for me to get my emotions out there. I love it. Music is where most of my social interactions are from now too. Everything should be good right? It’s not. As I stated earlier, I’m dealing with a lot of mental burdens right now. This has extended to music. My brain is driving me crazy and music isn’t helping me anymore. My RSD is so bad I read into everything and it’s catastrophic. Because of this, if I even lose followers I start to panic and get emotionally hurt. I’m confused on what to do. I’ve already realized I’m in an mental health danger zone. I’ve honestly thought about ending it countless times. Everything—including the things I used to love— have become pressure cookers. The only thing that doesn’t stress me out anymore is full on social isolation but that makes me super depressed and lonely. I need some help."
1127,Treatment for shitty defence mechanisms,"Been dating a guy for awhile and have actually been able to make myself more vulnerable for once and it’s going well. However recently all my defence mechanisms are going off and it’s sometimes hard to know whether I’m being paranoid or it’s true. Pretty much every time it’s been paranoia and I just try to calm myself out of those thoughts. However it’s starting to affect our relationship as my behaviour and mood has become kind of off more each day.
How can I get these defense reactions under better control? And improve my relationship by making my partner feel more secure?

P.s I was raised by a narcissist if that gives u a better idea of what my defence mechanisms are like"
1128,Confused about add,Font wanna self diagnose here but I feel like I have add/adhd purely based off of how people I know describe add and online tests. The thing is when I get asked a question about me or anything I do my mind goes blank and I cant really remember cause i dont really pay attention.
1129,Sometimes I get this feeling in my chest,"its as if a hand is squeezing my heart and pushing on my lungs, not hard enough to be painful but enough to feel wrong and uncomfortable. Its a real physical sensation i experience but i think it is my body reflecting how i feel mentally onto my physical state. Wrong and uncomfortable, too much pressure but not enough to warrant asking for help. So i dont. And the pressure on my chest builds. It keeps building and im starting to believe nothing will stop it."
1130,I don’t know why i suddenly can’t stop sobbing. This is not like me and I’m worried,"I woke up today feeling melancholic. It’s happened before so didn’t see it as anything unusual. 

As the day went by i started to feel more and more ambiguously sad. About an hour ago i started feeling like i was going to cry (for no reason) and for the past hour or so i have been just silently sobbing with tears pouring down my face. Other than the fact that the weather here has been depressing (i live in Minnesota and it’s already way too cold and grey) i have no idea why i feel so depressed. Nothing majors besides being diagnosed with POTS has happened to me, and I’m not sad about the POTS since I’ve been able to manage it. My boyfriend has been cuddling me and he said he’s never seen me cry like this. 

I do take depression meds and have been on them for a long time. I suffered from depression for a long time as a teen and when i was 17 was finally put in meds. I’m 23 now. 

I don’t know what’s happening. It’s not hormones or PMS. I really don’t like this."
1131,Big time confusion,"Hi. I don’t even really know where to start or what to say. For a long time I’ve felt like something is wrong with me/the way my mind works but I can’t pinpoint anything. I’m so confused and frustrated. I’m a generally happy person and I like to be social and go out, but sometimes I’ll just get this wave of numbness. I just sit in my car starting into blank space thinking about everything and nothing all at once. I know that doesn’t make sense lol but I can’t explain it any other way. I feel that my mind runs really fast, which I think has benefitted me when it comes to like school/work and stuff, but now I feel like I can’t control my thoughts. I keep spiraling and spiraling, but part of the spiral has been fuck I know I’m doing this why can’t I stop. Then I try to take a step back, figure out what’s wrong, and when I try to figure that out it keeps going back into the spiral again. It’s like I know I’m doing it but can’t stop it. I’ve been stuck in a spiral for like 2-3 days now and it only kind of stops when I’m in conversation, but even then, I can easily zone out and have to ask them to start over. I constantly feel like I’m being pulled back into reality, but confused about what reality even is. Then I think I don’t have problems and get sad about not having peace of mind. I constantly think about large concepts like death, purpose, etc, not in a dwelling way just more of an intrigue. I’m ok with the idea of death. Not that I actively want to die right now, but I’m just alright with it in general. Didn’t know I could find a way to ramble on reddit but I did. Oh well. Anyone feel any of this??"
1132,Advice on having a depressed and possibly suicidal grandparent,"This is a really heartbreaking topic. My grandma is such an accomplished, intelligent, and resilient woman. She was born just months before WWII began in Warsaw, she her entire childhood and early adulthood caused a slew of trauma for her. While she worked, she could generally distract herself enough to not feel severely depressed or anxious (I doubt this is 100% true, but this is what she has told me.)

She retired 7 years ago, and there was definitely a change in her happiness. Now it has taken a turn for the worst. Because of COVID not only is she more isolated than before, but she has also lost her younger sister (not because of COVID) and couldn’t travel to lay her to rest. She has become very fixated on her mortality, and I suspect a lot of fear of the unknown that she grew up with as a child because of her wartime trauma comes flooding back every time she loses “control.”

Tonight she told me she’s considering taking sleeping pills so she can die in her sleep, and it’s a really alarming and heartbreaking admission from her. 

I’d really like to hear what others’ experiences have been with similar issues. Obviously my family and myself have talked about what we can do to “keep her busy,” but I would also like to know what we can set her up with so she can feel happy when we aren’t with her. 

Thanks in advance ❤️"
1133,i feel so numb and i'm in despertion,"i've been dealing with depression and other mental health issues/disorders for as long as i can remember but right now i've really reached my breaking point. i just can't feel anything anymore, like absolutely nothing. it's been that way for soo long but i just can't stand it anymore i just need to feel something and i need to know why i can't feel anything. please help me. if you're dealing with this please tell me how you're dealing or what it could be. i can't live like this any longer."

1135,Lack of motivation towards school.. what should I do?,"(Posting on Throwaway account)

Hey everyone, long time lurker first time poster here. I (16M) have lost pretty much all motivation towards school. I used to be an A grade student two years ago but now I’m getting C’s and D’s. I’m not motivated to try and I don’t know why. Subjects I used to love now have absolutely no meaning to me, apart from one. I want to drop out of school as well, because I just feel like I can’t get any better. If it means anything I suffer from anxiety and my self confidence is sub-par. Do any of you have any advice? How can I get my motivation back?
Thanks,

Izaya."
1136,How do I deal with mental fog?,"So I’ve finally realized that all of the bad feelings and negative thoughts I’ve had are tied to this mental fog I have. I’ve had thyroid issues for years now and due to this, I have trouble remembering things and handling my emotions and feelings. In the last few months it’s gotten a lot worse. I no longer feel grounded or connected because I can’t remember things day to day and the past all feels like a giant blur. I’ve finally gotten a doctor who’s determined to correct my thyroid and fix the fogginess, but obviously that can’t happen overnight. 
I’m really just looking for tips on how to stay more centered and less depressed."
1137,Arguments,"My dad is getting more and more physical every time we get into an argument, I dont know why, he's mostly normal until then. I've tried to talk to him about it but he never seems to understand, its getting to a point where I really need to think before I start talking to him because I dont know whats gonna happen next. I dont want to deal with this anymore."
1138,YOOO I JUST SAVED TWO LIVES TODAY!!,"Stopped an online friend, a beautiful 19 year old girl from cutting herself too badly.. or my words stopped her from ending it all entirley. If she died apperintly her friend who we will call Andrea's to protect the innocent would've done something similar!

17 and I saved 2 lives whilst depressed myself I am freaking tired! Can I get a heck yeah though??"
1139,Do I stay?,"I’m currently “seeing someone” if you would even call this that. I’ve known him since March and I really like being near him and just seeing him makes me happy. We’ve never established what we are and what will happen, but seeing that I’m still here and also practically living with him when I’m not working; maybe it’s a good sign, idk. The past month or so it’s been pretty stressful and hard. Now there would be days where we don’t even speak or look at each other, even though we’re in the same room. I’d like to think my love language is by touch and I haven’t touched or felt him. I’m not gonna go into detail why it ended up this way, but knowing that both of us have suicidal tendencies; I don’t know if it’s great for both of us. I don’t want to leave, as of this moment I feel like leaving him alone will make me regret it. I’ve only known him for about 7 months and I don’t know what he’d do. We both have mutual feelings but for him I think it’ll be easy for him to say goodbye. I already know the answer to all this, but I just need help. I don’t think age will do anything with the outcome, but I’m 21 and he’s 35. I’ve cried way too much for him and I’m questioning if it’s worth it. Any feedback/advice will help."

1141,Does anyone here have intrusive thoughts and intrusive fears of having killed someone or commited a serious crime or crimes ?,"18 M here 

I've had this for a while on and off and but not commonly and only occasionally but last night I had a really disturbing dream where all the children in my place were being taken by eagles and the parents were terrorised ... And I was just there watching ... As If it was entertaining and part of me thought it was good since the kids in my society were pricks anyway.... Followed by a part in the dream where I remembered killing people with guns ... And it felt like all the memories were real so I decided to visit a psych in my dream then I woke up now I only remember a part of that dream and I'm not familiar with any location there. And I tried to remember everything over the years but I don't think I remembered anything like it but I do have cases of ""false memories"" but the fact that I don't know if those are false memories or not are equally scary.  As for that eagles taking children part , I'm scared it says something about my subconscious ... 

Has anyone experienced anything similar ?"

1143,"I developed a tic that progressively gets worse, and it’s effecting my speech, breathing, and overall well-being.","I have been dreading posting about this to an online discussion forum for the longest time, however no doctors, medication, or even imaging has helped shed light on this terrible disease that has progressively been getting worse these past few months. 

I’m going to start off by saying that this started cropping up a few years ago, and since then it has progressively been getting worse to the point where I dread going out or making relationships as I cannot form a coherent sentence, breathe properly or even eat in public. I work in a retail pharmacy, and my ‘tics’ as I call them sound like coughing or sneezing which upset many people, causing me to explain my issue. Working in a retail pharmacy however, I’m mostly just spat on and given a bad review for “spreading disease to the general public.” Yeah, that’s on my review sheet, apparently this brain-thing whatever it is that’s out of my control is the “corona virus.” It’s not, and I feel like it’s something much more serious than even I personally think. When I’m at home doing school work, I’ll suddenly erupt into a fit of “deep/short breathing” my eyes roll back, and I lift my chin up and breath with my “throat”. It is a loud and obnoxious sound, and can sometimes cause me to make a pressurized “pop” that can send my nose into a severe bleeding frenzy. When it’s not my breathing, it’s my speech, I stutter like jimmy from South Park but much more severe, I can’t control it and I end up exhaling while doing it too which in turn causes me to pass out or feel like I am suffocating. It won’t stop, and I’ve tried everything even with my doctors and they don’t have any clue what it could be. It just started one day, and like a hiccup it comes and goes. Medication helped for a little bit but it always comes back stronger than the first time I started taking the meds. 

MRI imaging showed my left lateral ventricle being more prominent in side than the right of “uncertain clinical significance” and the neurologist in professional UHC fashion said my case wasn’t “worth [his] time” and he had “more important things to do.” Yes, a neurologist actually told their MA to tell me this over the phone, while I was at work. So, I took this as an “I’m fine, maybe I need to just relax.” Even while relaxing I have an attack, where I pressurize the interior of my skull, like ‘flexing’ my brain and having a “breathing fit.” My family thinks I’m on drugs, because I cannot form a coherent sentence. What is even scarier now is that I’m changing personality wise, I used to be so kind and helping, now I lash out at people who treat me like shit, it’s like a bug takes control of me. I yell, scream, and cut people off instead of reasoning with them. I justify this behavior as “they treat me like shit, time to return the favor.” But that’s NOT me. I end up crying, and the pressure inside my head when I cry is so extremely painful it’s unbearable and I almost collapse from pain-induced shock. I feel like I have no emotion, no product of care anymore, I’m mentally deteriorating like I’m glitching out of reality, comically ‘glitching’ is a near PERFECT analogy for what I am going through. 

Please mods, don’t delete this. This is my last resort. No one seems to be going through this, no one that I’ve talked to locally has answers. I’m begging for help at this point, I can’t take this anymore.

Tl,dr: I developed a ‘tic’ a few years ago, and now it’s turned into a destructive mental-overload of some sort. No one knows what it is, or what’s truly causing it. I’m otherwords: internal-hemorrhaging hiccups that cause my brain to ‘jolt’ and my breathing to ‘suffocate’ me."
1144,Should I get this checked out?,"I feel detached from reality right now. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens a lot. I don't notice the shift right away, but after a while I'll notice it.

I feel like I'm not in control, like I'm watching from the back of my mind. I feel numb, tired, slow, and detached. It'll still laugh and joke, but I don't feel happy. It's like a feeling of numbing calmness all the time.

I don't hate feeling like this, it's comforting. I don't like feeling like this either though, it's lonely. It's almost as if I'm not entirely there. It's been happening for about five years.

I'll get random periods of numbness. When I first got them, they were short. Maybe about an hour or so, but now they last days, sometimes a week, at a time. It'll happen maybe once a month, last varrying times, and then leave.

Time becomes cloudy, memories feel like dreams, my body feels sluggish, my reaction time feels slow, but it's peaceful, calm. I don't feel a lot during these periods.

Most of the time it feels like a marky grey, it's unclear and numb. I know I've been using the word ""numb"" a lot, but that's the best way I can describe the feeling. I guess numb wouldn't be right though.

I still feel things, but there's still a numbness in the back brain. I don't know what is happening, based on the very limitted research I've done it sounds like depersonalization (don't know if I spelled that right)

I don't want to self diagnose, or even go see someone if this is normal. So, what do you guys think?"
1145,"Just when I thought I was improving, life started getting worse","My life was finally starting to turn around, i was getting good grades, and a girl liked me, which i thought was impossible. It was. She told me she was joking, then she told me her real crush, and to rub it in, sent me screenshots of them flirting, all while calling me stupid, ugly, and lonely, which i am.


Another great thing: me and my friend like to be ironically funny at school, kinda like okbr. We, very ironically, had a fake wedding on the bus one day, nothing big, just part of a stupid joke. He might even be reading this right now, and if you are, don't tell anyone about this 5 people posted it on their snapchat, and 500+ people saw it. So now the whole school thinks i'm gay, which i'm bi, and i was gonna come out eventually, but the kids at my school aren't very accepting, and it wasn't gonna be anytime soon. The few friends i have already treated me like shit, i think when i come back they're just gonna ignore me and pretend like i don't exist.


I just don't see a point in living anymore. I thought I would be able to live a good, happy life, but I don't know if that's possible at this point."
1146,I don't think this is all that important but,when I get nervous I feel like doing something with my hands I don't know what and I used to grab the skin on my neck and just squeezing it rubbing it scratching my face&amp;neck... after a while it make my neck all read from all the roughing it started hurting alot so I had a rock on my pocket to rub onto when I was feeling like that.. that rock broke and it only helped a tiny bit anyway ı still got itchy all around my head and neck now ı have this double layered ring  I wear that I can spin around with my finger but that makes to much noise at school and also doesn't feel enough since that's only one hand... does those fidget cube things actually work I don't want to waste money on items that won't work
1147,I am looking for someone who helped me years back with my eating disorder. If it's you please let me know.,"I really hope you see this.

I'm. Not sure if it's even this subreddit but I'm trying my luck. 

I lost my old account and don't remember it at all, because I changed my phone alot within those times.

I was a 16 years old male with Bulimia Nervosa, I opened up here about my issues and alot of you good folks helped me. 

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. 

Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good). 

She is a married middle aged woman with kids, she is Pyromaniac, would talk to me about it and  about her daily routine of how she handles it. 


If it's you, i'd love for us to chat again."
1148,An apology to myself and a promise to cling onto hope for my future.,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but here goes. The past year has been one of the worst years of my life, if not the worst. It just hit me how much I have been letting my past mistakes and misfortunes call the shots rather than my future. I truly do have a bright future with lots of opportunities--and I've been more afraid of the uncertainty than excited for the opportunity. Today that changes. I wrote myself an apology for how much I've been holding on to the negatives rather than the positives. Here is a picture of what I wrote, if you can read my crazy scribbles:

Hope it encourages somebody out there. Chin up, we've got this."
1149,How do I stop being a perfectionist?,"I want to start this off by saying that I’m someone whose entire life revolves around her passions. Because I want to go into academia this need to strive for perfection works really well when I study and I feel truly happy every time I write a good paper or make an actually well-thought-out point during my discussions. 

But it’s ruining my mental health. I use this same perfectionism in an attempt to wrangle control over my declining mental health and it’s not working because I’m not being gentle with myself whatsoever. How do you treat yourself gently? How can I stop attacking myself constantly trying to fix things? Why can I just take a break? 

Every time I slow down I feel like I may accidentally stagnate. I think the fact that I rapidly got a lot better over one year when I’ve been struggling with bipolar my whole life may have had a few unintended consequences like expecting that level of contentment constantly. How do I let go? What did you do?"
1150,Is it normal to sometimes feel like you deserve and/or exadurate your abuse and trauma?,"As the title basically says. So I've been basically abused my whole life. My two main abusers who were my father and older brother are gone, father died and brother is in the military. My mother isn't abusive, but she's ignorant and tends to ignore my problems and yells at me whenever I try to have an emotional conversation with her. I also have a bad history of choosing friendships and relationships that only hurt me cause that's all I really know. I will say on the brighter side I have two best friends who don't abuse me and I don't abuse them, which honestly they are basically my world, but whenever I talk about my struggles I get two overwhelming feelings.
That I deserved all the abuse I was given and that I over-exadurate what happened even though I am stating correctly what happened. Does anyone else feel like this? Is it normal to feel like this?

Thank you all in advance!"
1151,I’m at a lonely position in life and it’s been affecting my emotional health a lot.,"I’m a sophomore in High School, and I used to have a really good friend group. It consisted of probably 6-7 people, and we were best friends for about 7-8 years. One of the people in the group, who we’ll call G, was the Alpha. We didn’t work out as friends and he ended up basically socially bullying me out of my other friendships. He would invite every person in our group over to his house to sleepover every other week and he wouldn’t include me. I felt so upset because they were my only friends, and any time I invited those same people to sleepover at my place, they would deny it to go see him instead. It sent me to a bad depressed state, and I knew it was time to make new friends.

I’ve made some acquaintances at school, but none that I would consider an actual friend. It’s just sad because there isn’t a single person I know that would go out of their way to contact me and talk to me, as I would do for them or my old friends. 

Any activity I like to do, I have to do by myself. I used to paintball a lot with my older friends, but now I go by myself. I play video games, but no one I reach out to will play anything multiplayer with me. It’s just very disappointing. 

I’m a very very social person, and I like to get to know people and let them know I care, because helping others brings joy to my life, and not having that ability to spend time with others in conversation or just hanging out is making me really sad. 

I suffer from Anxiety and Depression, and sometimes I get very nervous and sad because I feel like no one wants to talk to me or be around me, even though I really try my best to be kind and thoughtful towards others. I just wish I had a BFF, just someone that I could seriously go back and forth with and really click platonically with. I’ve had too many bad experiences with girls (straight male) to want to date anymore. 

Any thoughts or advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated, although I know this is just a vent to anyone who is willing to listen."
1152,Hate being pressured for school,"I hate it, just let me live my life, I just wish they would just let me be and leave me alone. I wish I could just not do the work, yeah so what I’m fuckin lazy because I’m tired of constantly being judged. I didn’t have my computer for the first few weeks of school so my teachers usually gave me a paper copy and didn’t grade it, and it’s funny because if I killed myself it’d be better in hell knowing that none of the pressures I have would be real, anyway I wish someone was there that understood me and didn’t just judge in a single spiteful glare, my sister is coming over tomorrow when I’m at school so I have to hide everything that points to me being suicidal, I don’t want to scare her or anyone because if they knew what I thought about life all these years idk what they would do. Wish I could just get away from it all, and I wish we weren’t judged so harshly. God damn, if I just had a job already and quit with school I wouldn’t be this stressed, I’d rather do some physical work then pointless worksheets day after day and year after year. It’ll never end so this is what it’s come to, maybe I should just kill myself and get it over with."

I shouldn’t feel like this. I have a good family, good friends, and a good life. Yet, there are days when I feel empty. I am too afraid to ask for help. What if they worry about me? What if they see me as some weight or burden? What if I just get in the way? I just want someone to hold me tight and let me get it out. It swells up more and more. It hurts more and more. But i’m so afraid of telling anyone. I don’t want to hurt them or be seen as less from this. I don’t want to attract a ton of attention. I can’t let people see me be weak, but I just want to be weak. Who do I tell? Who can I trust? If I let it out, it will be out. I feel so trapped. This is my fault for letting it take over me. But other people have it worse. So why can’t I handle this? I hate myself so much. I can’t fix it. No matter what I try, it just comes back worse. I am so tired. I don’t know what to do? I just want it to stop."
1154,Anyone have an idea why some people don’t feel love?,"I’m not sure if it’s related to trauma or anything, but I genuinely don’t feel love for anyone, and I don’t ever remember feeling it. I feel everything else fine, and that’s why I’m confused. I’ve just kind of been using how much I respect someone as a substitute because I’m not sure what else to do. Anyone got an ideas why or what I should do?"
1155,"I need to take a LOA from work, and I don't know how to go about it. I'm suffering.","I have been hospitalized for health related issues and ulcers keep developing, and because of everything going on in the world it's likely stress related. I'm planning a wedding I don't want (would rather elope), and I am completely manic. 

Now I need to be tactful because I can NOT lose this job however I am on the verge of checking myself in to the hospital (that I work at) because the nearest mental health appt I can get is Nov. 3, and I seriously need to get regulated. It's a matter of life or death I feel like.

I don't want to disclose any of this to my job and I have used all my PTO due to my ulcerative colitis, I just want to ask for an unpaid leave of absence for 3 to 4 weeks for personal and health reasons. Because of my extreme anxiety I am so scared to call and talk, and if I get fired for it I'll lose my insurance and that would put me over the edge. I'm just begging for help on how to be tactful. I've resorted to lying to get out of work- like deaths in the family and such (they do NOT understand mental health and all have the don't be a snowflake attitude). I don't want to lie anymore. I desperately need the job, but I want to keep it vague.

Again, my anxiety prevents me from doing anything confrontational so I am just asking for advice."
1156,Buzzing skin while nightmare,"Hello, I’m having this problem since a while now and I cant find anything online. Maybe I’m describing it wrong but I hope someone out there knows what im talking about.
Since about a month now, almost every night I go to sleep and I get wolen up by a very intense nightmare where I feel my breathing getting more and more heavy and making a noise like im terrified and with it an increasing buzzing coming from my whole back and arms spreading through my body. Kinda like vibrating skin. Then it becomes so intense, the breathing, buzzing and me making “being terrified “ noises that it wakes me up. And the buzzing stays and when I wake up Im actually breathing very heavy and making becoz of it kind of cry/moans.
I notice that the nightmares aren’t that terrifying when I wake up and thing about them. But I still feel paranoid and like someone is in the room about to attack me. 
So every time this happens I turn on the light through the whole night. 
Im not taking anything mew. Ive been taking antidepressants for a while. Im also for info diagnosed with anxiety/panic attacks and ptsd.
I don’t know what to do, its so distressing that i hate going to sleep. Almost feels like night terrors but i don’t know if thats it."
1157,This is not for faint of heart,Hello I am a 15 year old. I seem to be a fairly average kid on the outside but I have terrible thoughts and am I very negative and Narcissistic person. I often have thoughts of hurting people not just anyone specifically people I don’t like I have very vivid dreams of stabbing people and disposing of people it’s terrible and I don’t know what’s wrong with me I definitely can’t tell my parents and I’ve been to many different doctors and therapists but it doesn’t work what is wrong with me and what should I do.
1158,Sedation due to Zyprexa and not feeling awake,"I’ve been taking Zyprexa for the past 2 years and everyday I wake up and feel like I’m living in a dream.

When I see the physical world around me and it’s objects I try hard to focus but I feel like something blocks me from being focused.

I feel like I’m slightly high on Marijuana all the time and I’ve quit a year and a half ago.

Could this be the result of being sedated by the medication I’m taking which is Olanzapine?

I also have trouble remembering most of the events that happened the day before."
1159,"This article made me chuckle, it should not have made me but come on","This article was insisting on how you're supposed to call 911 or something like that without hesitation if you're having suicidal thoughts. Made me chuckle. Am I supposed to call them every day? I feel like they have some better things to do and honestly if I've dealt with my shit up until now, why bother someone else. 

Also, what are they gonna do? Arrest my brain or some shit? Technically yes, my brain is responsible of attempted murder on my body, and premeditation too, lol. Or maybe depression. Depression has been trying to kill me for years but this bitch hasn't succeeded, and no matter what it's not going to, but yes, officers, it would be nice to stop fighting against a fucking invisible murderer for once. So if you could arrest it for me that would be amazing. 

Hmpf why not call 911 after all? 

But for real guys take care of yourselves, just wanted to share my random thoughts and hope I at least made you smile a bit. Even if it's in your head."
1160,"Parents give mixed signals, I’m so worried. TW for PTSD, violent thoughts, and sexual assault mention","  My parents are great. I love them very much, they’re all I have besides my sibling— they care for me and treat me and my sibling well but,, I can’t help but worry this is a delusion...

  I’ve been touched and had my privacy invaded (more times than I can count) and humiliated a couple times by them.. My sibling has too, and they have sleep/darkness related anxiety and I’ve caught them hyperventilating because of fear when I’m not there to sleep in their bed. I fear they did something really bad to them and they have PTSD. 

  I did ask them abt it— they said it was from scary vids on YT + kid me jumping out to scare them a bunch. I’m scared they are lying.

Here is some more stuff I have been experiencing lately:

  I also experience some emotional numbness, saying “I love you” and being upfront abt fears and being vulnerable are things that I cannot stand. 

  I can’t be around people for too long either or it becomes too stressful (esp. men) and I have nightmares frequently. Most are violent or of sexual nature (breaching privacy, to actual assault), the last one I was choked out twice. 

I also feel very disconnected from reality and other people as well as myself.

  I get weird spikes of worry/fear/dread. Especially if I had seen something abt r*pe or sex, something of that sort.

  I have intrusive thoughts about harming myself and others, bashing someone’s head into a wall or desk, or a violent daydream where I get hurt really bad.

  I struggle with motivation and I feel tired and sluggish all the time, I feel unable and unworthy of feeling happiness at times.

  
  I wish I knew more about what my sibling struggled with, but I can’t get anything out of them. I’m so so worried— sometimes I’d rather abandon this reality in exchange to not perceive and exist. Nothing feels real.

  I hope with all my heart my sibling doesn’t feel the same. I love them too much."
1161,I feel like I can’t control my body when I get excited,"For some reason when I get really excited, my body has to move. And I can’t control it. I pace back and forth a lot and I bump into walls a lot when it happens and not even notice. One time it happened when I was sitting on a chair with wheels and I started spinning a lot. Even though I didn’t want to spin, because I know it makes my stomach hurt, but I couldn’t stop spinning. I get excited as in, when I find something to write about I’ll start rocking back and forth. I don’t try to but my body just does. I have bruises from it. And I hurt my nose and head a lot. Like last night I kept banging  my head onto my bed which actually caused my head to hurt. I have a therapy session on Tuesday so I’ll ask her about it but I don’t know, I haven’t got my physc evaluation my therapist asked for yet because of covid. I’m 14 by the way."

1164,My mother makes me feel awful.,"So. I don't know where to begin. I am a 24 year old stay at home mom to a wild and smart toddler, I am disabled due being visually impaired and having mental health and neurological issues, engaged, and I live fairly close to my mom. We actually used to live together and will explain more on that later. 

About 3 years ago, I called her from another state about 8 hours away because I had no where to go and was scared for my life (long story). I moved in with her and her boyfriend. Got a job. My now fiance moved in as well and we split the bills. They broke up, we moved to a new place (my mom, my partner and I) and I couldn't get to work so I quit my job. Things went downhill pretty quickly. It didn't matter that I cleaned, cooked, and my partner paid all of mine and his bills. I still got reminded about not working almost daily. She refused to listen when I said I was losing my eyesight, even went far enough to call me a liar. Come to find out I had swelling in my optic nerves (paps) due to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension. Anyways. Then I got pregnant. Things were rocky but fine. Her new boyfriend started coming around and he was very aggressive (has threatened to shoot both me and my partner. He also stole my painkillers after I had brain surgery while pregnant) and when my daughter was born I had a falling out with her over him. I didn't want my newborn child around that for obvious reasons. 
Now, she comes over fairly frequently, and we have even offered to let her stay here (the only issue we had was with her boyfriend) and I still feel like she has control of my life. I panic when I know she is coming over (clean house, coffee ready, everybody act perfect), she makes comments regularly about my weight and exercising (not outright insults but still) even though I can barely move without getting dizzy and I'm on weight loss medicine and not even earing much, if she wants to go do something with me I HAVE to unless I want her to make me feel bad (example of this is a week after surgery i had to go to her birthday party and when I tried not to she threw a fit). I am always on edge because I feel like she's going to judge my life. No matter how hard I try. It all really hit me this morning when I tried to open up to her about my mental health and she acted like I don't have a reason to feel the way I do. I've never gotten that maternal warmth or whatever it's called from her. She acts surprised when I don't ask her to babysit but she's never available. I actually didn't even realize that she puts me down until it was pointed out to me because to me that's just her. And she's all the biological family I have close enough to see. Am I over reacting? I don't know if I explained this well. I'm very tired and my brain is being dumb."
1165,Fed up with life.,Hi. I'm a 21 year old dude from the Uk. Still never had a gf besides an online thing for 2 and a half years that didn't work out. I have no real experience with any girls or any confidence at all to approach any. I feel utterly hopeless as my life is just one bad thing to the next. I recently lost some of my closest friends due to an argument i tried to stay neutral in but I ended being shunned by my other friends for not going against another friend cause i didn't want to pick a side. My family often argue and fight and things get really scary sometimes. And I have so much anxiety that is really difficult to manage sometimes and holds me back alot. I'm incredibly lonely but at this point don't really feel like I deserve a gf because I would only hold them back with my anxieties.  I feel my phobia of planes makes it harder because most people want to go traveling and yet as  much as I wish I could I can't even do that. I've achieved very little. Completely failed school and only just managed to finally keep a part time job at a store at the start of this year and I don't know what the hell I want to do jobwise cause I just hate everything and I've tried so many and my anxiety makes things hard. The only real dreams I have would be to be an Internet personality and I'd like to try my hand at making music but I have no motivation to try and actually achieve my dreams cause I just always feel so hopeless.  I just feel like what am I even living for. I'm so utterly hopeless.  Nobody will ever love me cause I'm not worth anything.  I just play games and watch anime and that's it. I just wish I had a girl that would be there for me. I just wish that  I wasn't so afraid of everything and that I could travel the world with the person I love. But because I'm too afraid I'll just never amount to anything. I'll never achieve anything. Nobody will ever care for me. And one day the loneliness is just gonna become too much. I just don't know what to do. I don't expect any solution to this fat wall of text either. I just felt I wanted to express how I felt. Despite every problem I have if I just had that special someone to support me I feel I could somehow pull through. But I just have no hope it will ever happen. I think I'm fairly ok lookswise and I try my best to be a good guy.  But since there's nothing else going for me they just isn't any hope really.  I'm just a sad loser that only finds brief happiness in games and anime. I've truly had such a horrible year and I just don't things are gonna get better.
1166,coping with ptsd without self harming,"hi, i’ve never posted to reddit before but feel kinda at my end of people to talk to.

trigger warning: talk of self harm

i’m a man in his early 30s, my whole life i struggled with ptsd and depression and eventually later in life was diagnosed rapid cycle bipolar, for which i am on medication for. still i get these bouts of just worry, anxiety, and dread that just overcome me. it starts slow thinking people are upset with me then builds to this point i’m convinced everyone including my partner of 5 years hates me. then i feel just trapped by everyone’s hate, nowhere to go, and several times in my life i’ve just run off to be found wondering around aimlessly. 

it builds up and i start to think everyone hates me and i shake my arms if i’m walking, my whole body if i’m sitting. and the tension of the shaking and my body and the thoughts all just endlessly rev each other on, and always in these moments i’ve found the best way to kind of snap out of it is to self harm. in the past i use to cut myself a lot or punch myself which i still do often now.

and i guess, i just don’t know if other people
have anxiety/ptsd attacks like that where they just lose control and how they deal with it if they do. i feel my behavior like this, when i shake, seems so scary to others that it always pushes people away more and i’m so ashamed of it. i just don’t know how to stop it without more destructive paths.

i was seeing a therapist before covid hit then that fell to trying to do video calls which didn’t really work for me and then with work and stuff slowing down cause if it i couldn’t even really afford it anymore.

um, i don’t know what i expect, just want to know if anyone else deals with this too and how they manage.

thanks"

1168,Silence,I’m pretty sure this issue to mental health but is it just me who can’t handle silence at all? Like my heart rate goes up and I hate every second of it so i’m always watching or having something in the background. I don’t know if it’s thoughts coming in or what but I can’t stand it
1169,Help me :(,"I don't know what to do. I don't know if I have a mental health disorder or not. But I cannot seek help from a professional because I don't want my parents to know and I can't afford it by myself because I'm still a student.

I just want to know if I need to seek professional help or if I'm just thinking too much. This is how I feel.

1. I have thoughts about physically hurting people. I feel always on edge because I don't want to snap and do something bad.
2. I don't feel anything, literally nothing. I can only feel intense emotions, like anger, sadness, excitement.
3. I had episodes (few) of extreme sadness. They come out of nowhere. I'm alone in my room then I'll start to get really, really, really sad. Then i'll start crying in the corner. But I can't point out the ""source"" of my sadness.
4. It's hard for me to meditate because I get scared, of what I don't really know... but sometimes I'm scared that if I open my eyes a ghost is in front of my face, sometimes I'm scared that I might go to another dimension or might not wake up.
5. I have thoughts about killing my self. But I have dreams and ambitions and I want to achieve them, so I might not actually kill my self but the thought is there. I have acted on the thought oftentimes but I stop at the last minute. I think I might not actually kill my self but I always think about it more than once a week.
6. I self-harmed when I was a teenager. But I only did it because it made me feel something. Puberty is a difficult for everybody, so I self-harmed because I couldn't handle how difficult it was.
7. I used drugs and I drank too much. Not anymore though. When I met my current boyfriend (of 5 years), I stopped doing drugs and drinking too much.
8. It's hard for me to fall asleep. The darkness and the silence terrify me. I have to turn the lights on and funny videos to take my mind off things.
9. I get a very bad headache when I am angry or sad.
10. I feel like I'm choking. Like my neck is literally choking me. Sometimes I feel like something is trapped in my neck. It's weird.
11. It's hard for me to maintain deep friendship. I feel like all friendship I have are very shallow. They don't really know me... not one of them. I can be a very social person if I want to. I know so many people and I have ""neutral"" relationships. But it's hard for me to really connect with them emotionally.
12. Although I can be social when I want to, I sometimes just go off the grid because I find it hard to deal with people. I just don't have the energy for it. I don't want to deal with anybody, I don't want to talk to anybody, I don't want to hear from anybody. I don't want to respond to any text or email. Basically a subtle ""fuck off"".
13. I sometimes feel like my heart is going to explode. I know how to calm my self but I feel like it's going to explode. Once I had that episode when my sister was around, I made her put her hand over my chest and she was terrified because she thought I was palpitating too much, she wanted to call an ambulance. But like I said, I am able to calm my self down with water and Advil.
14. I get overwhelmed sometimes. It happens rarely but I had my worst episode last year. I was walking out of the mall. It was 2 weeks before Christmas so there were so many people and I felt overwhelmed. I couldn't breath, I started feeling faint, and I literally lost my way. It was a mall I frequent. I couldn't get a ride. The buses looked full to me. It was a scary experience. I was confused. I sat down the sidewalk for almost an hour til I was able to gather myself.
15. I can't focus or concentrate, unless what I'm doing is a repetitive task or something that does not require advance cognitive processes. I actually have good grades, from a good school, the girl who's ""on to something great""... but it's actually very hard for me to focus and concentrate. My mind is everywhere. Random thoughts intrude my mind. I have to try really hard to concentrate.

I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal. I'm worried but I don't know what to do.

I hope you can help me how to manage what I'm going through."
1170,Can starting meds make you MORE emotional?,"I got off my meds for awhile, became super suicidal, so my doctor put my back on my meds. I had not taken them in probably 4-6 months, but we kept the same dosage. I’m on Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Latuda, and Buspar. The meds used to work perfectly. Now I’m more emotional than I was. I’m angry and I’m crying a lot. Can the meds throw my emotions off and make me worse until they kick in?

TL;DR got back on my meds after months and now I’m angry and crying a lot. Are the meds the cause of this?"
1171,Do you think I have PTSD,"in my childhood...

I have been involved in many car crashes, 

almost drowned and died 3 times, 

fell off a skateboard going 25 miles an hour holding on to my friends car and fell super hard on the back of my head, 

I also lived in a warzone and been close to over 40 explosions. Car bombs, air strikes, rockets, rpgs, tank attacks. saw people severely hurt by explosions, bleeding, missing arms and legs, stacked one on top of the other in the back of pickup trucks being rushed to the hospitals, 

I’ve been stuck in an exchange of fire between marines in humvees with mounted machine guns and insurgents with ak47s .The marines didn’t know where the insurgents were so they were shooting anything that moved.

witnessed a rocket hit our neighbors apartment and their middle aged mother came out screaming and crying her heart out because her son died in a very traumatic incident where a rocket landed in their living room killing her son, 

saw a homeless man I knew laying dead in the corner of the street we lived on as we were driving out,

I also had many frightening experiences being super high on marijuana with a group of ghetto high school kids being stuck with them while they were driving super fast and me panicking feeling like we were gonna crash and die

Been jumped by a group of ghetto kids and getting my nose broken,

When I was 5 years old I was at my moms friends house and I opened the kitchen door and went out in their garden and their guard dog which they used to abuse, saw me, barking and running towards me. I froze in my place and started crying thinking I’m gonna die and at the last second my moms friend ran and lifted me up before the dog was able to get to me,

When I was also about 5 years old I went to get circumcised and I woke up from anesthesia shortly after the operation was done and remember feeling excruciating pain and I was screaming

When I was in high school my friend came to my house not feeling well and almost died from an overdose on 2 strips of suboxon and plenty of Xanax. He fell on the ground unconscious and I ran to him slapping him on the face screaming “wake up!” then He opened his eyes. My mom came to the house and was yelling at me because of the mess and I was in shock then I told her that my friend is very sick and about to die. I kicked a hole in the wall and I started crying. Then she called an ambulance and he was treated.

I was in a GMC car traveling on the highway when a convoy of marines started shooting at the car.

On one day in Iraq, me and my cousin went to play and my little brother followed us then a big loud explosion happened nearby and cars started to panic and he got hit by a car. A kid came up to me and said “your brother got hit by a car. He’s at the nearby hospital.” so me and my cousin ran to the hospital and saw him in the operation room with his face bleeding and we started crying. He got hit in the face and lost his front tooth.

I have many more traumatic incidents happen in my life but I don’t want this post to be too long.

All the stuff in the warzone was between when I was 7 to 10 years old in Baghdad, Iraq. The other stuff was during high school in the US.

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD by my therapist but I’m not sure why. I don’t have flashbacks."
1172,Trouble feeling and expressing my feelings?,i keep suppressing my feelings to the point where i do it unconsciously and it’s almost like i forgot how to feel. anyone had this experience/has any tips of how to start feeling my emotions again without letting get to the extreme?
1173,I can’t afford a therapist but it is crucial that I see one,"I am completely fucking lost. I am feeling incredibly stressed out due to what my life has been like over the last few years. I have no direct path in life and have no sense of motivation or hope to change anything. I feel useless and Always feel tense or angry at myself. 

I want to know if anyone can suggest any resources for those who don’t have a job and need therapy.  I have reached out to people I knew from college who ran psychology departments to try and figure out if I could get some help through there but I had no luck due to covid and other issues. 

I always remind mySelf that there are others out there who have it worse than I do and that I should be thankful for what I’ve got. This is by no means me trying to do anything less than that, but I do genuinely need help. I would not be on here if I didn’t. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and tired of it all.

Any help would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you all in advance"
1174,Is this normal for teens and I’m just over exaggerating? Or do I have a more serious issue?,"I have a shitty memory, plain and simple. 

I’ll ask my boyfriend something 2-3 times in a day and not remember his answer, or often even asking in the first place. He’ll sometimes say things like “dude were you even listening” when I was and just can’t remember what he said. I try and listen, I try and remember, but my brain is just fucking dumb I guess. I also repeat stories a lot because I’ll have no idea if I’ve told them before.

We built a small Minecraft village together with only about 5 buildings, a small wheat farm, and a cow area. I’ve been playing on it for hours everyday for about a week, and I still get lost and have trouble finding certain places each time. Chests also fuck me up because we have like 8 throughout the world, and it’s hard to know what goes where.

I wish I could remember things easier so I could be a better listener and a less obnoxious person.  I can tell after 9 months of dealing with my memory shenanigans that my boyfriend is starting to seem pretty annoyed. 

I get enough sleep at night and I don’t have any known health issues that affect memory in any major way. If it helps I’m 16M, diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder, and currently taking Lexapro. I’ve experimented with marijuana and alcohol in the past but only a couple occasions.

TL;DR 
I can’t remember shit, this normal?"
1175,I hate it here,I hate the body I’m in I hate the life I’m I hate the world I’m in I have zero friends zero motivation to make friends my grades are bad I’m single and my parents are dead if I die too what do I have to lose I don’t care wealth or not someone cry about me after I’m dead I’ll be dead why does it matter?
1176,Anyone feels like the peak of their life is over?,"I used to hang out with friends after school every single day. Now as a working adult, everyone just seems to be getting married, settling down or just having no time for friends. Is it just me whose ideal lifestyle is to be surrounded by a close group of friends every other day like in HIMYM? Or am I just not independent enough to be alone? I like to have my own space too but this is a far cry from how I imagined life would be."
1177,How to deal with intrusive memories? (Is there a term/condition other than PTSD that describes what I'm going through?),"So for context I probably have OCD (the bad/clinical kind) and get intrusive thoughts, but I also get intrusive memories. These memories are usually of something bad or stupid (or both) I did at some point in my life, and if things went differently, I probably could have ended up dead or maimed or suffered a blow to my reputation (i.e. could have resulted in disappointing a ton of people close to me). To give an example:

A few months ago, I was trying to fix a toaster with a **metal** fork while it was plugged into the outlet (long story). I quickly realized what I was doing was dumb and gave up. For a fair amount of the rest of the day I was thinking ""hoo boy that was DUMB I could have gotten roasted etc."" but (eventually) got back into my normal routine. Today I heard from someone that their friend was doing something dumb with a toaster and I was immediately brought back to the feelings of fear that I felt that day (even going so far to search online if I could have survived a current arc if my fork hit a crucial part of it, as well as posting here).

The thing is it's not like I have an irrational fear of toasters (my roommate was using one just today and I didn't run away), and for other memories it's not like I was worried at the moment I was doing said stupid thing (I've been fine, maybe even happy, in the moment, and it's sometimes taken months, perhaps even years for the sheer stupidity to register). One could argue that this is some form of PTSD but it's not like I was in a warzone or a car accident for any of these feelings to register, so does it even count as trauma if I'm at least a couple of degrees removed from immediate danger? Does anyone go through anything similar and/or have tips to deal with this?"
1178,What the Hell is Wrong With Me?,"I was not a normal child.

I had an extremely rare condition that made me grow a lot faster than other kids, which made me look older than I was. This caused people to constantly get frustrated with me and start yelling at me to, ""act your age!!!""

My father abused me. I won't sugarcoat it. He hit, screamed, swore, harassed- everything. This made interactions with adults extremely hard. This also turned me into a goody two-shoes that apologized all the time in order to prevent myself from being hurt. 

I also made attachments to objects. Erasers, nail polish bottles, dice- just the weirdest things that would somehow make me feel safe. I didn't have many friends, so these were like my friends to me.




I started liking certain toys and cartoons way too late to be socially acceptable.




I started watching My Little Pony when I was seven, and kind of... aged in reverse? I don't know what to call it. I bought a crap ton of toys, memorized every song, animatic, fan video, toy review, bought all of the comics, watched every episode, and I still did that up until it ended.

The Shopkins craze? I was a part of that too.

I became invested in Monster High dolls at, maybe 12, up until the reboot. 

I became invested in Pokémon.

I just recently started watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, and am just about ready to start buying merch.

But, I just realized something. I'm as old as Suki and Sokka, and act like I'm still seven.


And this is why I have no friends. 


Every single time I like something, it's apparently childish and stupid. I just want to feel normal and for people to not judge me. I want to have friends and I don't want to be alone anymore"
1179,I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know. I don’t know.,What do I do? School has been crushing me and I have basically no one to support me. Everything feels mediocre or hurts. My soul feels like it’s being sucked out of my body. Help me. What do I do?
1180,Why does mental illness sometimes develop later in life?,"Also, what are warning signs of it developing? Is it a genetic thing for late development?"
1181,Do I send myself to an inpatient or no?,"So I've been super sad recently. I guess depressed is a better word for it. I cry a lot, my self harm started back up, I go back and forth on restricting my food, and I feel this weight on me of inescapable loneliness. I don't know what to do though. I want to send myself to a mental hospital (the best plan I have right now is to just cover my body in fresh self harm, call the cops, and tell them I want to kill myself) because I feel like I just want an escape from my reality right now. But I also don't want my parents to have to spend money on an inpatient (especially with college right around the corner), and I know that the inpatients near me are dangerous/chaotic/terrifying. But I really want to leave for a bit. To give myself a break from the daily grind I put myself through. I have a great home life, wonderful parents, lots of responsibilities, I'm on meds,- and yet I feel myself slipping again. If anyone could critique my plan or give me some advice, I'd be extremely grateful.

1182,I’m such a screw up,"I didn’t do one of my quizzes for a college class that was due tonight because I got too tired, lost motivation, and figured I’d rather not turn in any work then turn it work that makes me look even more stupid. 

I’m staying up while tired because I’m dreading going to work tomorrow (well today actually, since it’s 12:47 am) because I’m stressing out about minor things, which to me feel major. 

I wish there was a way for me to not have to wake up and deal with everything. I’m tired of constantly stressing about stupid things."
1183,What treatment should I consider next,"I'm located mid Atlantic region of USA. I (22F) have major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. Lately (past 6ish months) I feel sad all the time (if not sad then apathetic). When it becomes my thoughts and I, its always just blatant sadness. All my psychiatrist wants to do is increase my medicine but I'm on one of the highest doses of Lexapro plus an anxiety medicine.
I saw a therapist before and it helped for a little while but we eventually reached a plateau. Should I try seeing a therapist again? I've also be considering residential treatment or maybe a day program for adults? I don't know but I feel so hopeless.
My husband is so incredible and amazing and loving and my parents are my #1 supporters. My friends are amazing but all I think about is how much easier everything would be if I was dead. The ONLY reason I haven't killed myself is because it would break my husband and parents heart.  But each day gets harder and harder and im afraid that soon I won't be able to take it anymore and just kill myself."
1184,I dont know why i keep doing this to myself,"(M 15) Recently i have been told over and over again about how i treat people, i thought i was an ok kind of person. But i was very wrong, i didnt notice it but i constanly lie about things such as schoolwork or what i did throughout the day, i have been told that dont respect anyone for even though everthing that i should be greatful for is from them, i am never grateful for anything to the point of not caring at all. and treat all my family members and friends as if they are below me (there are some exaggerations in there but you get the point). I dont know why i do this i dont even notice it, i want to get this fixed, but i dont know how. I havent had many people in my life that was there for me consistently. My father was missing for a quarter of my life and when he was there he would normally be gone because of work, i was not able to spend much time with my mom as she also worked and made me stay home to do extra work in these booklets that she would buy for me. My sisters would contact me but they would normally just talk to my parents as they lived scross the world. I have also moved around 8 time 3 to 4 when i lived in korea and 3 to 4 when i moved back to the us. To put it sinply i havent had a stable living situation for my entire life and my parents have put extreally high expectations for me as both of my sisters performed very well in school. But i dont know what to do, i dont want to do anything but i still want to fix things. I feel hollow and basically a husk, i was told about how good of a kid i was and how crappy i turned out for when i used to be such a good kid. But i dont know how to fix this, none of these issues ive had to deal with before as i would go out of my way to hide everything from everyone as i didnt want them damaging the little i already had, but in doing this im damaging everything and myself. Please if anyone could help me i would be genuinly happy for once."

1186,I compulsively hit myself when anxious or angry or distressed in general and i'm not sure why?,"So I have PTSD, DID, bipolar 1 and OCD but I don't know if any of those could explain such symptoms. But whenever I am distressed or angry, I start hitting myself which most of the time is compulsive, in the sense that my body literally does it even though I don't necessarily want it to happen it just sorta does. I don't really have any sort of explanation for this other than possibly the disorders listed before, don't have any sort of developmental stuff aside from trauma causing me to maybe act a bit more regressed or childlike sometimes but other than that i'm really at a loss. It only happens as well when I am in any sort of distress. Usually it will include punching myself hard, banging my head against a wall, scratching myself etc."

Her only happiness is animals and with the sudden death of 2 of our cats, she is mentally depressed, sometimes suicidal, and is not functioning in society properly. Sometimes I think she is just lazy and depending on my tired elderly mother who is almost at her wits end (as she has done everything for her in her life).. sometimes I sympathize with her. I don’t know what to do because I see a brokenness in her that I cannot fix to have her get her license, GED, take classes, get a job, find a lover etc. She lacks social skills as well. I don’t know what to do to have her gain independence, everything I suggest— she dismisses. It may be a combination of depression and laziness but what jobs can a person like this do?"
1189,I feel like i’m too dumb to handle life,"Hi. This is kind of long. My apologies for that. i don’t expect many people to read this, as i’m posting it sort of late at night and also,,,it’s just me venting. i don’t even know if it’s legible to be honest. but yeah anyways, here we go;

TW/ suicidal thoughts 

I am a 17 y/o senior in high school. I’ve never really been super good at keeping up with my grades. My GPA is really low. (last i checked it was a 2.6 and that was at the beginning of my junior year—i’m too scared to look now.) however, i was doing fairly well for the first few weeks of school this year. it was pretty easy since it’s all online now due to covid stuff. but now it’s fall, and i’m failing multiple classes at a time just like i always used to. it’s all because of missing work. all it takes is one late assignment and then i’m just STUCK. i don’t know where to start and so i just procrastinate...and then all of the assignments build up. 

to make matters worse, all of my friends have been posting their college acceptance letters on their instagram stories, and it makes me feel really bad about myself. I’m already so awful at school, and i really don’t think i want to go to college. it just seems too hard. i don’t want to pay thousands of dollars just to do more school. i’m already so stressed nowadays, i cry myself to sleep like 3-4 times a week thinking about all of the assignments that i’ve yet to do. i’m actually typing this up after my worst cry session yet. 

i’m just so, so, so very scared. i don’t know what i want in my life and i don’t feel like i’m ready to be an adult yet. i feel so stupid compared to all of my friends, who have perfect grades &amp; are involved in sports and theatre and whatever. they have interests and extracurriculars and the ability to produce perfect essays before a deadline. i feel like i can’t do anything. i feel like i’m a waste of a human. i just feel so incredibly fucking stupid. 

i don’t see myself living as an adult. i don’t know how i could exist as any version of myself other than this sad, stupid, scared little high schooler. why don’t i just do my fucking work? why am i so lazy? what if i don’t graduate? what if i don’t go to college? 

sometimes i think to myself, “just suck it up! stop being so whiny and just DO your WORK!” but then i open up my school app thing and i just...can’t. it’s too overwhelming. i give up and have a whole crying session every. single. time. i’m so frustrated with myself! this is why i feel like i’m too stupid to exist. 

so yeah, what if i don’t go to college? i don’t want to end up a bum, depending on my parents for the rest of my life. so i have to. i absolutely have to go to college and that FACT makes me have suicidal thoughts. i have no choice. i HAVE to go to college. i HAVE to spend thousands of dollars just stressing myself out even more than i already am. if i don’t go, i will be a failure of a human. even though i’ve heard people say that’s not true, it’s still so ingrained in my mind. it’s what all of my friends say, it’s what my s/o says, it’s what their parents say, it’s what my parents say, the idea just SURROUNDS me. but i don’t want to go. i have no choice. when i think about this, i sometimes think about how i would rather die. (i’ve been having a lot of these thoughts lately. i know it’s not good but i’m too scared to tell my parents because my dad is currently out of a job so asking for a doctor/counselor seems wrong)

everything just seems so hard. i don’t want the responsibilities of being an adult yet. i don’t think i’m ready. i just wish i had more time. but i don’t, and it’s coming, and i’m fucking terrified."
1190,I am very unfocused and unproductive. I take Zoloft. Would taking something else maybe help too? (See text),"I went to a doctor for the lack of focus + depression &amp; have been on Zoloft (75mg) for several months. My wife says my depression has improved. I can’t tell. But I know I still can’t accomplish anything. 

I went to a doctor a few years ago who had me do a computer test that said I don’t have ADHD. I definitely feel like I have ADHD. 

Is there something else I could take in addition to the Zoloft? 

Has anything helped you? I have an appointment tomorrow morning. I could make a suggestion to the doctor. Otherwise I’ll probably just say everything is going fine."
1191,Anxiety about finding love,"I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety about this topic. Is it difficult to find love, meaningful relationship after 30? Do men consider older women boring or not desirable?"
1192,Schizophrenia or anxiety?,"Lately whenever I get anxious, depressed or sad I am bombarded by negative thoughts. None of them sound different from my usual internal monologue voice but the thoughts are extremely intrusive and degrading. “What the fuck are you even doing trying anymore?” And “You are such a fuckup” are common and really impacting my psyche. I dropped out of school a few years ago and I’m still struggling to find myself. I came out as bisexual about a year ago and have mostly come to accept that after a bad/abusive relationship with an ex-gf. I blurt out shitty negative things at work (F&amp;B) when I’m stressed and overall am usually a very positive person otherwise. I am just unsure if there’s more to my anxiety or if I’m fabricating schizophrenia to justify my shit behavior. What are some signs of legitimate schizophrenia?"
1193,Panic disorder,"So for a while been diagnosed with a panic disorder being the topic. Around usually use music as a coping mechanism to help calm and concentrate, so, home neighbors may have a thing for me/it ""insulting/lies""😀 can be around home doing my thing and bam. It hits and can't calm down. Is there any way to deal with adversity ?"
1194,My boyfriend is thinking of committing suicide,"My boyfriend (25) has struggled with depression is whole life and attempted suicide in his teens. Recently he’s been talking about being a burden to everyone, he’s deeply depressed and has expressed thoughts of suicide. Now he is refusing to seek treatment because he doesn’t think it will help and doesn’t want to burden his family or myself with helping him. We live in the US and he doesn’t have health insurance and is very much against any of us spending money to get him treatment. I don’t know what to do. His family isn’t much help. I feel so alone in this and it’s only a matter of time before my boyfriend actually hurts himself. What do I do?"
1195,Hopefully this fits here! I feel like I’ve been declining over the past several months.,"(Long post)

I have several mental illnesses, so it’s hard for me to differentiate between new/worsening symptoms at times, but lately it’s been very bizarre...

By the way, for some context, I’m in the US. Important to mention since I’ll be discussing the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, my anxiety was pretty high. At first, in February, I was terrified. I then got angry at the constant news stories about it, and eventually decided to tell everyone not to mention coronavirus to me at all: no jokes, mentions, news articles, nothing. But one of my friends slipped up and sent me an article about how the first “presumed positive” case had made its way into my state. I panicked.

March 9th was my last day at college. I refused to go back after this day, and just days later it was announced that the college would be closing anyway and classes would now be online. But I still remember that day. I was on my phone after class, waiting for a friend to meet me so we could hang out. I stupidly looked up updates on the person who was in my state that fell ill with COVID. I started to panic. It suddenly felt like the room was closing in on me. The noise became overwhelming. I felt really hot. I wanted my parents. I wanted to go home. A horrible, intense wave of pure and utter hopelessness, helplessness, uncertainty and horror washed over me. I tensed up. I felt like I needed to run. I felt the urge to pace back and forth, so I got up and decided to walk around the student store; nobody would notice I was pacing if I was just walking around the store, they’d just assume I was looking around.

I actually came down with COVID-like symptoms just days later. Let me tell you, it was a horrible experience. If I did have it and that was a mild case, I can’t even begin to imagine what a severe case would feel like.

My fears were inconsolable, and I’d pace back and forth in my house asking my parents questions nobody could answer. “When is it gonna end?” “This is only gonna be for a few days, right? It’s gonna just go away right?” “When can we go out again?” 
Even ridiculous questions like “Is this gonna wipe out humanity?”

I’d ask for updates every day. I was afraid to look at the numbers myself. I also experienced some denial. Let me make this very clear: I have a DEEP, INTENSE hatred for anti-maskers and other “covidiots” who believe it’s a hoax or downplay it. At no point did I ever vocalize my denial. My denial wasn’t like “yeah, it doesn’t exist, screw quarantine.” Quite the opposite, actually. My denial came in the form of “this can’t be happening, and it ISN’T happening. It’ll go away within a few days. It’ll be fine.” I consciously lied to myself in an attempt to make myself feel better.

And then I got angry. Well, not just angry. I experienced pure, unadulterated RAGE. But who was to blame? My mind desperately searched for someone to blame. And I did come up with someone to blame: the person who brought it to the US. I wasn’t thinking clearly, so I thought what happened was someone went to China and then came back carrying the virus, intentional or not. It’s much more straightforward to be mad at a single person than it is to be mad at the world in general. Whenever I heard bad news about covid, I’d yell, “who the FUCK brought it to the US?!?! Who fucking did it?!?!?! I fucking hate them so much!!! Fuck them!!!!”

(Oh yeah, maybe I should also mention one of my mental illnesses is Borderline Personality Disorder, sooo my emotions are heightened. One of my many challenges is managing my anger.)

The anger is still there. So is the fear. I’ve experienced so many weird things since the pandemic began: sadness, anger, guilt, denial, confusion, fear, irritability, paranoia, hypervigilance, tension, frustration, restlessness, hopelessness, helplessness, dissociation, avoidance, numbness, disbelief, fatigue, apathy, particularly extreme angry outbursts, inability to cry but eventually having random inconsolable crying fits, and others.

I began to have nightmares every night. Every time I fell asleep, I’d have a nightmare. Sometimes they were just random nightmares, but usually they revolves around the virus itself (being exposed to it, coming down with it, losing someone to it, forgetting to wear a mask, etc), medical things, death and destruction. To this day I experience nightmares pretty much every time I go to sleep.

I’ve developed severe agoraphobia. I refuse to go anywhere unless absolutely necessary such as required doctor visits. Other than that, I refuse to go anywhere. Before the pandemic, I was always hanging out with my friends. Not anymore! I haven’t seen them in person since the beginning of the pandemic. My parents encouraged me to hang out with my friends, even if we both wore masks and social distanced, but I flatly refused. All of a sudden, the world became an especially scary place with no good at all whatsoever in my mind. I felt like something terrible would happen the second I left the house. I’m still mentally in March/April when it was complete lockdown except for grocery trips, doctor visits, essential jobs, etc. and it’s weird seeing people on social media seeming to go about their lives. I’ve been in quarantine since March 11th. Over 7 months. It’s so bad that I had a dream where I was at a restaurant, but I considered that to be a nightmare rather than a random dream because of the possible health consequences of going to a restaurant right now.

Not only have I been refusing to see people, but I’ve also been psychologically distancing myself. I don’t really text anyone unless they text first. I’m isolating in every sense of the word and pushing people away.

Just a few weeks ago, my parents were watching mass (church) on TV. I saw that the people there were wearing masks and social distancing, and that’s absolutely fantastic but the imagery got to me for some reason. I excused myself because I found it to be...I dunno, heartbreaking? It’s heartbreaking that we have to social distance and wear masks because this virus is going around fucking killing everyone. Like I said, I hate everyone who refuses to comply or downplays the seriousness, but actually seeing people doing that is such a foreign concept to me (another reason why I don’t wanna go out, because I don’t wanna see my loved ones in face masks because I guess there’s still some denial going on in my head and I suppose seeing loved ones in masks would pop that little bubble of denial). I rushed out of the room and ran to the bathroom, where I burst into tears. It just all hit me hard. I can’t explain it. I literally cried over seeing people doing what they’re supposed to. I guess my mind still didn’t wanna accept the situation.

The images of healthcare workers in hazmat suits, people lining up around grocery stores at the beginning of the pandemic when everyone was panic-buying toilet paper and stuff, images of dead bodies in hospitals, clips of covid patients twitching/struggling to breathe/falling and suddenly dying, descriptions of how covid patients die scared and alone feeling like they’re drowning - and nobody can do anything to help - and/or experiencing ICU delirium, and patients on stretchers surrounded by workers in hazmat suits are all burned into my mind. Whenever I hear a certain word, all those images come rushing back: words like coronavirus, covid19, pandemic, quarantine, etc etc etc.

Now I’m dealing with brain fog and other things. I feel really stressed. I don’t know what the hell is going on with my head.

Sorry this was so long. I highly doubt anyone actually read this, but if you did, thank you so much. I don’t even know how to do a tl;dr on this, lol"
1196,Need somewhere to dump my feelings...,"Most of the time I can pretend to feel ok and I even fool myself, but right now I just need to get it all off my chest. I can’t even express everything in enough detail to do it justice, but here it is.

Me. Selfish, uncaring, a wolf in very innocent sheep’s clothing. A taker. Someone who acts charming, weak and innocent just to get attention from others without having to do anything in return.

I’m a very quiet person. Too quiet. When I was little I was labeled as shy and people said I would grow out of it. I didn’t. If anything it’s worse. If I went to a psychologist, they would probably say I have social anxiety. That’s fine. But I feel like it’s more complicated than that.

I really have a problem with avoidance. I avoid talking to people more than necessary, I really dislike signing birthday cards etc., I dislike buying gifts. I don’t do nice things for people. I don’t always text people back. I’m awful at staying in touch. I procrastinate on paperwork and adult business. There are many things I should do that I don’t. How can I accept kindness when I give so little? How can I be in society when I’m such a poor participant? I have emotionally isolated myself even though I’m around people every day. 

The shame I feel for being this way is made worse by the fact that I am so much like my dad. He’s an awful selfish sh*t (even though he’s charming to people who don’t know him well), very quiet, has a nasty skeleton in his closet and is the reason my parents marriage has been a disaster for more than 25 years. My parents have always fought and I had to listen to my mom talk about all his faults. I feel like I’m looking at my future. I imagine that people will someday feel about me the way they do him, if they don’t already. 

I just feel like a very flawed person. I put on a happy face, but my mind can be very negative. And I am the most negative about the person I’m closest to. I live with my mom, and she loves me so much. But our personalities are so different. She talks too much for me, and it’s a daily point of friction. She’s more tidy and also more organized with time than me and I get annoyed. But she’s not doing anything wrong. I end up being snappy with her when she doesn’t deserve it. It’s like I’m trying to push her away like I do everyone else.

I wish I could either not need people, or want to be better. But it’s always a battle. I do need people. I get lonely and want affection. But honestly I don’t want to learn to do all the things that make me so deeply uncomfortable. It doesn’t help that I don’t know how. I don’t share my emotions, and they all swirl around until they ooze or explode out. I feel anger, guilt, shame, sadness and pain but I don’t know how to live any other way. I feel like a special kind of “invisible” bad person that no one should love. I wish I wasn’t born as me.

If anyone read this, I’m sorry it’s long and incoherent. Thanks for caring to read it."
1197,I feel like im so stupid,I feel like im so stupid. like im typically smart. I am good at studies and can speak well but im so stupid and worthless because I just cant understand the ways of the world and I think everyone thinks im not cut out for it. some times I feel so dumb and worthless I don't even know what the reason is for me to wake up everyday. it's not like anyone except my mum and dad rlly like me anyway. I feel like a headache and a burden to everyone and I can't even talk about it coz times are tough and no one wants to listen to some idiot kid having issues when they obviously have bigger problems. im such a pointless loser and dont even know what my existence is meant for other than ruining peoples moods and annoying them
1198,"I am so sick of this. MONTHS taking calls with insurance. Still no date for therapy, nothing.","My mom died in front of me 2 years on July 17th 2019. I have been searching and searching for someone anyone to take my insurance. I keep getting shifted around. Sure, I will go a couple weeks until a memory brings it up again and I realize how much therapy would benefit me and my fam. I am upset right now because I had taken tonight to get my therapy in order. A big NOPE. Not recognized by providers, then I was, but I didnt have a claim. All robot voices of course. It has been a year and a half and I really need to talk to someone.  United Health Care PLZ help with therapy."
1199,why do i have the need/want to be everyone’s favorite?,"Not sure if this is an actual thing or just normal but i want to be everyone’s favorite, ex: someone’s best friend, (even if we’re not close) or being the best at music, clothes, art, etc."
1200,Academia,"Hi there,

I've been wondering what people's thoughts were regarding mental health in academia and specifically if there's really a chance for it to improve. 

About myself: I study and teach mathematics and I struggle with bipolar II. I find this hard in two ways. As a student, I feel like having a personality or mood disorder is almost romanticized/glorified and that I should embrace who I am, when that can be really destructive. As a teacher, I feel like it's not okay to be unstable---like I have to make extra sure I present to my students someone who can and will be focused on their success, which just adds a terrible pressure on me to pretend.

But this is just me. But I know also that many people in academia who struggle with their mental health experience similar things or feel stuck in the way I do or in different ways, whatever and however, and I'd really appreciate it if anybody was willing to share their thoughts, opinions, experiences, references, hopes for the future of academia, etc. Do people see change to come? Are there forms of strengthening mental health in academia?"
1201,MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT CHAT,"Please upvote so this reaches more people..

I'm an 18 year old guy from London who's suffering with Anxiety and Depression and often feel like I wish I had more people to talk about this with so I thought it'd be nice to make a group chat on Snapchat for teens (14-20) to discuss mental health problems like Anxiety, Depression, Eating Disorders. It'll also just be a nice support network where we can help each other, make friends and be there for one another. Just thought it would be nice to have somewhere we can all talk, instead of having to post on this Reddit where replies can be a bit hit and miss. If you don't want to talk about your problems, it'd also be nice to have some members that just want to listen and talk to the others and help.

It'll be English speaking only for ease of conversation. Trolling/harmful jokes won't be tolerated.

Please DM me with some information about you (such as age, location, your MH issues) and your Snapchat and I'll begin making the group. 

If you're not comfortable being in the group but would like to talk about any issues, DM me and I'd love to talk."
1202,Do I have GAD ?,"Hi, first of all.. this is my first post on Reddit, I'm not sure if I have GAD or not , And the internet symptoms kinda generalised... I don't have sweat flashes , anger issues, or hand shaken ( except when I'm playing battle royal games 😄 ) , sometimes I have difficulty controlling my anxiety and I try to use logical thinking and it helps (most) of the time and I have insomnia but I'm on week two of sleeping schedule and I'm doing fine. I tend to worry about things. What worries me a LOT is whether if I'm going to sleep tonight easy or not , and health issues like my scoliosis or for ex when I stepped on barnacles and I checked the internet if its toxic or not and even that it not toxic , I was still worried.
Sometimes I worry -but not much- about the future since I'm not optimistic about it, will I'm going to find a lovely wife soon for example or financials issues mine is bad. Most of worries disappear when I'm busy working or playing video games. But every time I think what if I have GAD and I didn't know it? What I will do? How it will effects me? bla bla bla my anxiety increases and I have troubles enjoying life , so I want to settle this once and hopefully for all .... Can you please help me ?"
1203,Creative endeavors are riddled with difficulty,"&lt;rant&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know WHY it's like this; but, it seems creative endeavors are riddled with difficult days. I run a small YouTube [channel](http://amanbansil.com) (personal finance) and my videos don't usually do that well (so far)...but today's upload really got to me because I work on these videos pretty long (sometimes working through the night...); it takes a while to come up with ideas, to script them out, to record, edit...etc...and having it land on deaf ears (i.e. a very low play count) is hard sometimes.

I'm trying to think like Gary Vee who says ""publish and forget it"" - It's really really tough to do. Especially because part of the job is to go back and look at your videos and see where people are dropping off and make improvements.

&amp;#x200B;

I also make music and I've seen similar situations in that field where you'll spend so much time on a song and it lands but has almost no plays.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this is how it is and that there is a ton of content and exposure is difficult to get...but, it is hard as heck to deal with the struggle. Also, if you aren't a person who makes content like this - pls give your fav content creator a nice comment here and there. We can all use some more positivity

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;/rant&gt;"
1204,My (m35) partner (f32) has high function OCD but I'm not sure if it's something I should help her address,"My partner of 5+ years has lots of behavioral and mental idiosyncrasies. She hides them very well, and is able to suppress or ignore them for the most part around other people.

They rarely escalate beyond minor irritation - a discomfort I'd equate to ""finger nails on a chalkboard"" - but I can tell it's makes some every day situations exhausting.

For context - it's stuff like symmetry of touch, 'invisible threading' of movement around her, incomplete patterns or disruption of routine.

Again, almost never intrusive to be inhibiting. She'll need to spin back around the ""correct"" way, or need me to touch the other hand when I brush one on accident.

I don't know if it's being in lockdown with less time for her to reset and recharge - or if it's just me being in proximity with her that's made me notice - but it seems like it's an exhausting burden.

(FWIW She recent took a self admin YBOCS diagnostic because we've discussed it a bit and scored a 16.)

She has had mixed past experiences with therapy - should I be concerned? Or am I being overly concerned and defer to her to initiate seeking help if/when she feels she needs it?"
1205,I don't even want help but I know I need it.,"I'm a woman in my mid, almost late twenties. I've done literally nothing with my life. I know everyone says this but it actually would be easier for people after the inital sadness if I was gone. My parents have enough to worry about with my disabled brother. My partner wouldn't be stuck in a job he hates because he has to financially support me. I feel like he hates my guts. We rarely have good days anymore. He's so down that even he wants to die but if I was out of the picture all of his big stresses would go. He doesn't want to break up, I've already brought up that idea. I'm sure he just feels stuck and responsible for me because we've been together for almost 9 years.

I have very little friends and they all have people they consider best friends. The person I would consider mine doesn't even live in the same state as me, we've never met. So I mean her life really wouldn't change much. My dog would be sad. My dog is the biggest reason I'm still around. At the end of the day, it's a dog not a child though. It's really not going to notice after some time. I would go to friends or family about my thoughts but I'm tired of hearing the same things. Like it get's better or they're here for me. It does nothing, it means nothing. And no, my mental illnesses have gotten worse with age.
I guess I came here for the anonymity and I'm not sure what I'm asking for. Obviously no one is going to give me advice on ending my life, that would be ridiculous and I don't even have the energy for that anymore. I used to when I was younger but the nerve just isn't there I guess. I have been thinking about just leaving. Like walking out my door and just crossing my fingers something happens. Like maybe someone hits me with their car. But I kinda don't want to even be that burden. I'd rather have not existed.
I think I want to slowly ice people out. Make everyone forget about me and then just go away. Idk where or how. But I'm done. It doesn't get better. It's just not worth it anymore."
1206,Help a kid out.please?,"Hi, My name is L and I decided to hop on here since I don’t think anybody else will help. I am in fact a 12 year old who....isn’t entirely like most kids, I am mentally mature to the point I almost forget how old I am. Life is tough for most, and so is it for me. So why not vent, and get some advice in return.

The start.
I don’t remember much of when I was younger, I have some memories but all were bad, I don’t try to remember anymore, it’s not like I’ll know what happened months later. 
A lot of my mental problems are caused by my family, a lot of my family is racist and almost all are trump supporters. But that’s just extra info I guess. I love my parents but recently I just stopped thinking they do, all I do is waste their money. My mom is stressed and my dad is in debt. I’ve stopped feeling like I belong here. It’s not like what we do will change anything. I can feel sad a lot but I don’t ever tell anyone, I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. Every once in a while I’ll feel normal, basically every day. But then I just feel sad again, I feel paranoid and useless. I know I shouldn’t feel this way but I do, I’m a kid but I don’t really have much to do. I constantly feel guilt, like I mentioned before, my mother is stressed. But even if I feel such bad guilt for her, she cheated on my dad and acted like nothing was wrong, hell, I still see that guy since she’s still  dating him. But I know she probably doesn’t like me anyway, it’s hard to love someone when you feel like they caused the issues. I try to hug her and tell her that I love her but I feel this thought at the back of my mind telling me to just tell her how many problems she caused me. If I don’t text her back she’ll say that I don’t like her, and that I don’t wanna be with her. But I also have some problems with my dad too, not as much though since our bond has become stronger due to the divorce. A year ago when my mom told us it wasn’t going to work out I was supposed to be sad. But I just didn’t feel anything, I didn’t feel sad, I just felt normal. Like she was telling me the time of  day or something.

Anyway, on to the more personal mental problems, there’s been times where I’ve even thought of myself as a phsycopath, I don’t experience many emotions but when I do they last hours at most, I’ll feel sad at some point no matter what i do. Besides, I often like talking about killing people, it often makes me laugh or I often feel happy bringing other people’s emotions down, I am aware that I do things like that so I often force myself to feel what others to feel. But quite honestly, I don’t feel sad when I should, normally I would just find it funny. And sometimes I talk to myself, well, kinda... it’s more like I talk to a made up person in my mind, I think he has a British accent but it could be wrong, I call him Daniel. He’s like my rhyme and reason, kinda like my therapist almost. But rather than that, that’s pretty much as I want to share unless I HAVE to share more, but I kinda doubt it. 

Sorry if this makes no sense, I’ve been contemplating doing this for a while but I often times don’t know how to put my thoughts on paper, or write it down
Btw, I identify as a boy if that may help I guess..

Tl;dr: I am a 12 year old who needs help, I’m not going to therapy for a while and I have no one to talk to, I feel hopeless along with other mental issues that are odd."
1207,"I used to be happy, i'm still a child:( ¹","Hey there, I recently was on here for my twin sister who I was worried about. Well I wrote something in my Diary and thought I should put it on her as a way to vent.

WARNING: WILL MENTION ABUSE AND BRIEF MENTION OF BEING USED SEXUALLY!

   When I was younger my brother used me sexually. He was around 12...I was 5. He would play sex fantasies with me like house and doctor. He once made me dress in a pink skirt with no bottom so we could ""have a better time"". I have had a sex drive since the age of 7. I don't see him much anymore, when me and my sisters told our parents they said it sounded coached. I have also been abused by my twin sister. She would beat me with the broken end of a red broom and lock me in a dark closet until I promised not to tell. She is better now. I thought it was normal, as long as it made them happy, I was happy. We have moved a lot and I was being bullied more and more whether it was for my skin color (I am native), or my family's income, or cause I was different. Until the 3rd grade I wet the bed every night and was forced to wear pull-ups. My sister told everyone at school and my family picked on me for it. Sometimes I pretend to be younger than I actually am, I wrap myself up in blankets and pretend to be held and bottle fed. It brings me comfort.

   Lately, I have been feeling myself slip away. I think the worst in situations, I leave my body for a few seconds. One time I was outside and I froze in place, next thing I knew a man (sometimes when this happens the man has white face) shoots my dog and tries stabbing me, I screamed. I snapped out of it to see I was standing in the same spot, I hadn't screamed, there was no man, my dog was fine, no one even knew anything had happened to me. I recently have been having minor hallucinations, like faces watching me through windows. I have become paranoid, thunder and loud booming sounds scare me cause I think The world is ending. I am scared of the dark,small spaces,car rides, random dogs, new people, loud noises, going places, and some other stuff. Sometimes i feel numb, it's like I don't have emotions. Sometimes my dad might be mad at me and is giving me a lecture, suddenly everything except for him is black, it's like he has an outline, his voice sounds odd to me and I have this weird sensation in my body. 

   When I was 11 we were moving and my parents had left me with my older sister, her friend and my other sister. She was mad and I said something she didn't like, next thing I know I am slammed into a storage locker and I hit the door, she then hit me really hard. Afterwards she apologized and said she couldn't help it. I ended up forgiving her soon after, because she had an excuse...her mental health. Around a year ago my family was living with my grandparents, I tried on some boys clothes in a goodwill that matched my masculinity. She embarrassed me in front of everyone by saying I was a girl and that I looked like a boy, she screamed about how she refused to buy me boys clothes. When I went home she gave me another lecture. The next day I came back from my first day of school and to have my grandpa say to me and I quote ""if you ever think about wanting a dick between your legs, i will shoot you in the head, you understand?"" I lost my hope of them ever respecting me in that way.

   I am scared everyday, for me and my family's safety. My mom is just getting worse (chronic illnesses and cancer) and I am not ready to lose her. My sister just turned 18 and wants to start her own family now, she wants a lot of children with her husband. I don't want to have to get rid of my dog, or change the way I am. I am only 13 years old and still have a long road ahead of me. Maybe someday I will find closure, or maybe get better mental health resources like therapy. I am done for now, I might do this again another time, it feels nice to get this off my chest."
1208,It’ll be okay ❤️,"I see you fighting, powering through whatever’s going on in your life, and I’m proud, and things will get better as much as you don’t believe it right now, but keep fighting, your story isn’t over, and your issues don’t define you, your much more than this.

some of you might remember me as ghostedmashmellow [ my old username ].

anyways, I have to go soon, but if anyone needs to talk, dm me on reddit or my instagram [here](https://instagram.com/charlielives.x?igshid=1nxt0das62gx6)

IM PROUD OF YOU 💓"
1209,Self-hate,"To give some context, I'm a college student with a dual major in physics and mechanical engineering, this entire semester has been online for us and the absence of people around was crushing me, I tried to keep it out of my mind and focus on getting better grades, I tried really hard, I gave my best effort and yet I came up at just average and I have been led to understand that 85% of the class is cheating, yeah you heard me right 85%, they made a discord server to discuss the answers, it's a class of 212 and 185 of them are on the server. 

The admin decided that since they don't want students slacking off they'd increase our workload, the mechanical engineering department decided to take it one step further and put a test for each day of the week from Monday to Saturday. 

If it isn't obvious enough already this workload is over-whelming, I have trouble sleeping, I have trouble waking up. To at least stay at average I have to work my butt off, which means almost 14-16 hours of screen time a day. My parents aren't helpful, they want me to get 'full' marks in everything, typical Asian parent for you there, and since I don't get full very often they always end up disappointed in me, I was ok with their reactions when I was 600km away from them, since I had other people around me, but recently these comments are taking a toll on me, the same way it used to before I left for college. 

When I hear the same thing from them over and over again, it slowly starts to make me think that maybe it's true, maybe I'm not doing enough, and it kills me to think that way, I'm constantly tired no matter what day of the week it is and I can't even think straight anymore. I think I caught a fever about 3 times in the last 2 months, I didn't want to take rest or sleep early, so I got some paracetamol and kept going.

I have one other issue unrelated to all this, I struggle with my body-image, I hate how I look, I get fat so fast, I just have to eat 3 small meals a day and not exercise for at least an hour a day, I gain weight. My first semester on campus I starved myself for weeks with just one meal a day late at night, I was about 10 kgs overweight, and I lost 20 kgs by starving, I was horribly tired all day, my mental health deteriorated a lot but my parents thought I looked good when I came back. Since then I found a good friend who makes sure I don't harm my self this way, she kept me on track with a healthy diet and a healthy weight and was a proper friend to me, unfortunately the online semester is keeping us apart and the loneliness is making me hate myself a lot, I talk to her over a video call everyday but it doesn't help as much, rest assured I would've spiraled much faster if she wasn't there."
1210,I told my mom how I feel and she doesn't care,She doesn't care I told her I'd probably be dead by now but I'm scared of death she says I'm fakeing it and I need to stop being over dramatic she thinks just cause we're finachally stable I have no reason to be sad but I don't wanna tell her I feel this way because I feel alone and like nobody cares about me cause it's pretty much true and she keeps saying everything is her fault I mean sometimes it kind of is but I don't want to tell her cause it would probably make her more mad at me or something.and I literally keep telling her I want help and I wanna see a therapist and she won't take me like I don't like feeling this way and it comes and goes and I just want it to go and I've researched depression and anxiety and I have all the sighs of both I just want someone to tell me I'm not crazy or over dramatic.but I might just be over dramatic who knows
1211,Vivid auditory hallucination,"I’ll start this by saying I’ve dealt with hallucinations of all sorts in the past. I’ve had a visit with a psychiatrist and they said they’re related to my anxiety or something like that. But today I had one of the most vivid hallucinations I’ve had. I was just scrolling through memes on Instagram and I start hearing what sounds like a neighborhood barbecue. Like a lot of people talking, and pretty loud, it sounded as if they are outside of my house. I kept listening and I heard a distinct “I know right” followed by a laugh. The voice sounded like a drunk middle aged white lady. This went on for maybe 5 minutes. When it stopped I went to my window and saw nobody outside in the neighborhood, there’s no way they could have cleaned up in the mere seconds it took for me to get to the window. I’ve been freaking out about it because my hallucinations went away for months and I’m afraid they’re returning way worse."
1212,Constant Abuse,"So been living in same area for a large majority of my life and lately about 2-3 months ago it's been ongoing. Neighbors have been saying your going ""Mental"" &amp; ""Your going/need to go to 'Mental institution' "" have a couple diagnoses rather keep it short. It's from morning to late at night. How do you deal with ignorant persons and how to educate them?"
1213,"I want to be medicated,but I'm afraid of getting diagnosed.","My mom has threatened to have me committed for 6 years now (starting at 14) and now that I'm doing therapy and realizing I need medication to be balanced just because how opposite my mental state can go. I'll feel like scum,dirt, worthless ect for weeks, then for a few days I feel like a god that's invincible and can do anything and I want everything to be fast. When I dont have the ups I try to use food,conversation or sleep deprivation to get it because it's like a high and I can't.  I want stability so fucking bad, I deserve it ,my partner deserves it and so does my family. But I feel like a diagnosis will make me an outcast/ the family nutcase. Any advice?"
1214,I don't care anymore shut up you annoying ass,"Oh no you're not gonna graduate on time :(

Like ninja you think I care? Life is pointless as shit

Oh but you need a place to live

Uh well you're gonna have to welcome me in your house whether you like it or not

Everyone wants me to lose don't they? I mean it's cool, winning doesn't mean shit anyways"
1215,I Don’t See Myself Getting Better,"I’m genuinely convinced my mental health will never get better. I get so anxious about the most irrational and impossible things, yet I’m convinced that whatever I’m anxious about is going to happen. I do not view myself highly, and I obsess over the way I look/looked and am constantly criticizing myself. Lately I’ve been looking at pictures of myself from a year ago and crying because I look so fat and ugly and I’m mad nobody told me how ugly and fat I was and I’m ashamed of myself for even thinking I looked good at that time. That’s when my depression was at its lowest for me and it’s been still low since then. And I have to do things a certain way or I’m convinced I’ll die. For example, I have to lock my car three times. I have to pump the soap three times. I have to wiggle the locked door knob three times. And if I don’t then I’m genuinely convinced that I’ll either die or something bad will happen to me. I’m on medication and I talk to myself and try and calm myself down but it’s never enough, and I feel like I’m going crazy."
1216,What’s the point?,"I was just pretty deep in thought and I had a question that I wondered was even answerable. It’s clear to me that everybody on the planet has a purpose, and everybody can do something or be something great if they just try. Making your own name go down in history is something that can be achieved by anybody if they put the work and effort in. But that leads me to the question, what’s the point? No doubt there are people who will never be forgotten, but someday the human race will tear itself apart and nobody will be left to remember you. Nothing happens after you die, and most people who are on the brink feel peace because they know they made some sort of impact and will have people in their life to carry their story with them. But what does it matter to find peace in death this way if you will ultimately cease to exist in any way at some point. Working to make an impact in a world just seems pointless if that impact won’t have any permanent effect. So why even try?

Before anybody asks, I am not suicidal. I just feel really demotivated because I don’t feel like trying is going to amount to anything to anybody in the long run."
1217,Should i get tharapy,Ive been feeling sad emtpy and lonely for the past year or so im 13 years old and my parents dont really know about my mental wellness and im just thinking about me getting therapy and there being nothing wrong with me so then my parents would have just blown all that money on essentially nothing
1218,How do you crush your ego and give up on success?,"I have realise recently that when I feel like im doing ok for a bit my brain tells me that im worth something, that I should put myself out their and that I can succeed. This inevitably ends to me deluding my self,hurting other or hurting myself. 

Only once these reality checks happen do I come back to the truth that I am useless, disgusting and foolish. I want to learn how to exept these facts about myself truly as to not hurt those around me and not needlelsy damage myself. I want to learn to exept that I am fundamentally different from others, that I should be happy with that I have and not want or try for anything more and that my opinions,beliefs and experiences don't and never will mater. 

If anyone could point me in the correct directs I would appreciate it. Sorry for wasting your time"
1219,"I struggle to control emotions, would meds be a good way to go to help? Pros / cons?","I struggle everyday with emotions and anxiety/depression. For the last 2 years my emotions have been haywire.

1220,I’m at my limit,"TW: CSA &amp; chronic illness

Issues keep piling up and I can’t keep going on like this. I’m only eighteen and life has just been trauma after trauma after trauma. I know I’m being a brat and other people have it worse, but it sucks. It really sucks.

How do I even begin to start? I’m just gonna list some of what’s been going on. 

Chronic illness and all the issues that come with it, including being at home for two years, being isolated from my peers, losing years of memory, pain, doctors not taking me seriously, etc. Then there’s being trans, rocky relationship with parents (partially due to being sick), sexual harassment, repressed memories combining with facts about the past that paint the not so pretty picture that I might be a victim of CSA, the aftermath of being groomed by a trusted friend, having to drop out of high school because I’m so sick.... I just want to live a decent life. Please. Let me be a kid.

I don’t know where to go or what to do. I have a therapist, I’ve tried *multiple* therapists, but they haven’t been helpful. It’s hard to find a therapist who specializes in even three of my main issues, let alone all of them. I’ve tried coping mechanisms. Distraction techniques. Venting to friends. Expressing things through art. None of it has really helped, and I can’t go a single night without a horrifying nightmare that makes me wake up in a cold sweat. I’m at a loss. 

Please help."
1221,"Lack of sleep, not eating again, nightmares again, no support, emotional abuse, etc. May have another mental breakdown 😞","Not trusting myself that I won’t go back into a suicidal stage at this point. 

Starting to forget about people again because the pain is getting that bad again. This dark cloud that faded behind me is getting dark again and the end of the cliff that I can jump off of is getting more tempting again. 

Asking myself questions again if loved ones would be ok without me because I just can’t take it where I am. I can’t handle this pain"
1222,hysterical uncontrollable laugh issue,"Hi all! Hope everyone is doing well.  
As the title implies, I have hysterical laughter ""attacks"" from time to time. I've been having this issue for a long time, but it never was a big problem for me. I spend most of my time alone, I'm always muted when VC, and I don't attend any family/friends gatherings. So it's been pretty easy to deal with.  
I am planning on going unmuted to chat with one of my internet friends more easily though.  
I would like to keep the issue private and not to tell him, but I'm afraid of an sudden attack hitting me while we are in VC. We have already slightly covered the topic without me telling what the exact problem is, and it resulted in a heavy attack in the middle of the night. I'm worried it might happen again.  
My attacks are usually random and not triggered by anything (except for the time we talked about it a bit), uncontrollable and can last from 5 minutes to 40\~ at worse. After them I have trouble talking because of throat pain. I did a small research already, I have not had any brain trauma, I do not suffer from depression and overall I have no major issues that can be the cause of it.  
But I have an emotion surpression issue, especially when it comes to anger. Plus insomnia.   
Here where I live, an attempt to seek professional will raise eyebrows, plus covid is still a big problem. So, I would like to solve this issue myself if possible.  
Has anyone here had a familiar experience? What did you do to calm yourself down or prevent the attack?  
Thanks in advance, and please forgive my poor grammar."

I just want to hear what small things give ppl that little boost of serotonin, even if it’s for a brief moment. small things that are taken for granted, have sentimental value, seem like nothing to an outsider but means so much to you, could be something completely random too n doesn’t have much meaning or just anything really. anything that you like when you experience it or gives you that refreshing/slightly uplifting feeling"

I know that so many people are having a difficult time right now, and my situation isn't as dire or bleak as most peoples, I simply just don't know what to do with myself or my life anymore.

1227,I'm having bizarre ideations that my moment of death is near and I fear for my sanity,"After traumatic events it's normal to have nightmares and such. I've always had strange dreams, but lately they've been extremely bizarre and I feel genuine fear in them. Last night I had the most terrifying, confusing, and at once pleasant of them all. I started thinking about it as I do with most haunting dreams. 

I came to the conclusion that the reason why I feel such fear during my dreams is because they're visions of either my spirit, reality, and/or my last dying wishes. In reality I'm dying or already dead. What I see as reality is one of my past or future lifetimes, and my ""dream world"" is falling apart now because I'm coming to the end of the timeline. 

Perhaps it is ""reality"" the one crumbling and so I'm starting to see it for what it really is. Coming to terms with my death.

An unorthodox idea for sure, but one that if true would explain so many other bizarre instances in my life. I'm not sure how interested anyone would be in hearing out how I'd explain the logic behind such a thought.

And I'm scared, I'm so scared. My life has been threatened very recently. This could be the day I die. I hear steps outside right now what if that's someone coming to kill me. I don't know if I should call the police or this is insanity."

1230,"I [21,M] just feel kind of hopeless right now. More in description","I want to come out and say first that I believe all mental health problems deserve more recognition and that I am not coming to this subreddit looking to have an “excuse” or be self-diagnosed or something. I just do not know where else to post. Basically I am a straight, white, male, 21, third year of college, school is completely paid for by scholarships I earned, I have a 3.52 GPA, girlfriend of 5 years, have a set plan for the next few years. But as of right now it’s like 4 A.M. and I have a biochem quiz tomorrow and I am behind some 19 lectures across all my classes, and I have two chapters of homework, a midterm, and a big project due in less than 48 hours. And I’m sitting on tik tok and reddit. I just feel like I’m drowning this year, I don’t know if it’s the online only or what, but, I’ll get behind, wait until the absolute last minute to do something, get it done barely, but it gets a horrible grade and then the next week passes and I let all these assignments stack up and these lectures and do it to myself all again. I don’t know if it’s the online school with no one to check me, or if it is just me being a procrastinator and whiny and lazy, or what. Because I’m 99.9 percent sure I am not depressed or even have anxiety, it’s almost like I feel the anxiety and the weight of all these things and I like turn off like I am doing now and just let a future version of myself deal with this. I don’t know, I am rambling and I feel like kind of stupid because I am doing it too myself by procrastinating when there are actually people on this subreddit dealing with horrible circumstances and mental illnesses. Idk just needed some subreddit to talk about all this and see if other people feel this way, is this normal, do I just need to suck it up? Idk, thanks for reading!"

I got medicated and it made things worse I got off the medication but I still feel worse than I came in, I have these feelings it’s impossible to explain it just feels like something is wrong and I can’t explain why I feel that way or what exactly is happening. I just need to know I’m not alone or just someone to explain what is happening to me my anxiety has tripled and my OCD has become uncontrollable thank you for listening."
1233,Think everyone is out to get me,"I constantly think that everyone is being ingenuine to me, “pranking” me, or just having an ulterior motive when they talk to me. By ulterior motive I don’t mean they’re trying to get something from me or anything like that, but like they’re talking to me for their entertainment like as a joke? And I always feel like people are plotting against me and I never know what’s going on. Another thing is I wholeheartedly believe if I ever fell in love with and was in a relationship with someone it would end up that it was all fake and them wanting me to fall in love with them and then feel humiliated (and of course betrayed/heart broken etc) when I find out none of it was real. And I always feel like random people hate me? It’s not like the occasional bad experience with someone that I would completely understand people have bad days and it has nothing to do with me, it’s like specifically when people look at me it’s like they’re really disgusted or mad? Someone will make eye contact with me and I’m certain they hate me because they seem to be perfectly fine with everyone else. Keep in mind there are no logical reasons as to why this is which is what makes it extra frustrating because I feel like it’s completely out of my control."
1234,Going back to high school at 21 years old,"I finished middle school in 2015 and I started high school the following fall. However, my mental health had gone south the last couple of years and my anxiety and depression had gotten so bad that being around people felt impossible and I didn't know what else to do than to take a year off. I had so many bad experiences connected to school that the thought of going for at least 3 more years made me sick. I was working part time so I thought it would be good for me to focus on getting better with therapy while doing something I really loved doing. I worked in a pet store at the time so it was a lot of animal therapy. 

I don't know how much therapy helped me that year. I have the worst memory ever (probably due to depression tbh) and I honestly can't recall how my mental state changed. I applied to school again the following fall and managed to get through 6 months before I realised that I had so much absence that I wouldn't be able to graduate anyways, so I quit. I tried another year but circumstances again made me give up.

I honeslty gave up on ever getting further in my education after that. I always had pretty good grades in school, so it felt like such a punch in the gut, but I honestly didn't think I'd ever be in a mental state where I could handle it. 

Fast forward to this year, I've been home for 2 and a half years barely getting outside. I've been in and out of therapy seeing multiple different therapists, some more helpful than others. I've been working some part time, and doing some temp jobs just to have something to do, but it was all because someone else was telling me to. Mainly social workers. I never actually wanted to do anything. I just wanted to stay in bed all day where I felt safe.

I've been diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety. I've also been in a binge, restrict cycle for years, which therapists always just told me was a by-product of my anxiety. I had a mental breakdown 2 years ago which led me to be in a mental state where I didn't recognise anyone most of the time, including my parents and boyfriend who I live with and see every day. I was also completely apathic for about a year. Thinking about that still scares me so much.  

About 8-ish months ago I woke up and realised I wanted to study physics. It was like I had kept this thought buried deep in my subconsious for years and finally it surfaced. But first I had to finish high school.

I'm now in a class with a bunch of 16 year olds trying to remember all the shit I learned so long ago whilst also trying to not have constant panic attacks and also avoiding just bursting into tears. I dissociate a lot thanks to my anxiety and I never have the guts or energy to iniciate a conversation with anyone so I'm always on my own. I get really depressed whenever I feel overwhelmed and I rarely have energy to do homework as I'm usually so tired I just pass out as soon as I get home. So I fall even more behind and I get even more depressed and so on...

My depression has gotten worse since I started school again as I'm constantly reminded of the fact that I'm so far behind people of my own age, and also super rusty in every single subject. Group projects scare the living shit out of me and I had to have a counselor let all me teachers know that I couldn't do them or I'd be too scared to even show up. I've skipped a bunch of classes because I've had a panic attack and had to run away and wasn't able to go back into the class room or I just felt like I had to go home. 

I feel really lost and alone. This is something that everyone should be able to do and it's just so difficult. It's painful and draining and I don't want to do it. But I have to. 

I just needed to get it all off my chest

TL;DR: I went back to school and it's causing me a lot of mental strain"
1235,I hate myself,"I don’t wanna be here anymore I don’t wanna hear the same things everyday I don’t wanna see the same thing everyday I just wanna smile, go outside and look at the flowers and trees but my fear gets the best of me and keeps me Bedbound, I don’t want this anymore."
1236,Mentally exhausted,"Hello,

So I'm a mom who rarely gets any time for herself, I feel like a slave in all honesty. I haven't been to a salon in two years, as I dont have the time for upkeep so I just get the old box dye out and do it at home. I dont get to dress up and have a date night, it's been a year and a half and I could do with those little things to make me feel human again. If I even attempt making plans or a appointment I have to rearrange constantly so I tend to give up now.

I want something to look forward to on the weekend, my partner goes out every sunday all day while I'm always stuck in the house on my own. Saturday is his lazy day so no chance going out together or anything then either and even if hes not on a lazy day he will be in the garage doing bike stuff.

Thing is, his attention to his bike and car is becoming too much for me, I automatically switch off soon as he talks about these things as it's all the time. And our son is getting BIG TIME ANGRY when he has no time with his dad which means I handle the outbursts on my own, my son has asked to go the beach as his dad goes every weekend with his mates and it's making a bad effect on our son now as hes missing time with him. And it's making my mental health go through the roof as I dont get to do anything I enjoy at all. I dont want him to cut off his hobbie but to just consider maybe I would like to indulge in my hobbies aswell as they keep me sane!

I'm sort of the art/nature type, I'd honestly feel so much better if I could have a camping weekend and just do some hiking and have some real in life moments. My only social outlet is my phone, I see my one friend around the corner for coffee every so often as I can take the kids and feel SO much better after that! 

I also work with having two children and will do parts of education at home when I can as I know the career route I'd enjoy when my youngest child is full time in school. So I'm up from 5.30 and on the go until 7.30 odd at night, cleaning, cooking, doing DIY, working, trying to entertain the children, dealing with any Bill's or kids appointments, school run, food shops etc. 

I also get abit depressed near my birthday as I never get to enjoy it or anything.

I'm holding myself together with make up at this point :')"
1237,"i accept my misery and i’ve decided to live with it and use it to make art and whatnot but when the sun goes down and everyone else is asleep, the silence becomes deafening and i feel so fucking alone. i just want someone to hold me and not ever want to let me go and love me for all that i am.","what’s up fellow miserable bags of blood. i’ve recently found out i was prescribed a bunch of shitty meds for my brain that made me probably more depressed and scared of treatment. how i am feeling rn is probably the side effect of going cold turkey on meds i’ve been taking for at least 10 months consistently for like 2 weeks i think. broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a bit a couple days since i cut all that out that i still believe was the best to come for me.

he was understanding despite not being fucked up himself. and encouraging and genuine but i guess nothings enough for me. 

he was the only only one i completely opened up to. i overshare with a lot of people about how i hate myself and whatnot but even still nobody knows me. i try to open up in a non joking not validation seeking way but i feel pathetic and weak. i have a friend or two that i share quite a bit to but when i know no one can help i feel bad going to people because i know no matter how much people say i’m not a burden i know i let them down. they let me cry on their shoulder or just ramble on about how everything hurts and i’m still not ok. but i feel like i owe them a little bit of closure for being there for me so i act like i feel a little better and feel like too much when i need them again soon after. i was really able to see that i should continue to not be complete open because of this ex. he loved me. he knew everything that i was and he still loved me. but it hurt him that he couldn’t make me happy. he made me happier but he knew i’d never be.. ok. and a part of me felt like i was doing him a favour by letting him go and i know he sees that too.

i got tinder recently. not really to rebound or be all risky and fuck everything which would be smart cause now i have a fucking iud wasting away but mostly just cause i thought it would help my self esteem and it did. but i found this other dude. that seems like everything my ex was and more. a part of me knows this isn’t going to work and i want it to and not want it to at the same time. he seems like a great person but that’s speaking from talking to him for maybe three days. but even if i don’t let this spiral i know i’m so desperate for affection and attention that soon enough i’ll find another person to do that to.

people find me interesting, and likeable bu that’s because i only open up to a point where it’s relatable. nobody knows me. i want to be loved for all that i am but i don’t want anyone to have to know and deal with all that i am. there are people that want to be there for me. and i know i can text any of them right now and say i’m ok but i can’t. i always end up going online and find temporary solutions that will fade over time. 

i’m fine. but it just comes crashing to me when i catch myself wasting my life away with distractions that worked too well. i’ve accepted that person that i am. i will always be disappointing and people will always disappoint me. and that’s ok. 

i just want to be loved unconditionally but deep down i know that isn’t real. love isn’t real. unconditionally giving isn’t real. people say love yourself because nobody can love you like you need to be loved but i can’t and don’t want to.
i feel like a horrible person despite trying to constantly improving myself. i know how cruel people get when they stop trying to see they are flawed and try to live their life like they are the main character and no matter the shitty things they do they’ll always be good because that’s just who they are deep down. and as a person who’s been hurt by some one like that, that was made to seem like it’s my fault and i’m shitty for even suggesting that they did bad things for no reason o her than they’re kinda shitty, i don’t think i can knowingly change myself into someone that unconditionally loves themselves.

i don’t know what the point of this post was nor do i remember what i even typed so far. i write poems and essays to try to figure my shit out but i end having to have people to read it and hear what i have to say but at the same time not? i don’t really know what i’m going on about. i just needed to let some steam out and i don’t know how else."
1238,Why is remembering things weird?,"We always have to act like we don’t remember things exactly because apparently remembering stuff is weird. So we say thing like, “Oh I think he was doing so and so”, instead of “he did this” and “Yeah the xyz *or somethjng*” instead of “yeah that x”

Does anyone else notice this? Why do we have to add qualifiers to everything? It’s like having a good memory is a sign of intelligence which you can’t show or you’re not being humble or something. Idk if this makes sense to anyone. But anyone who shows an exact rundown of something that happened always gets weird energy thrown at them."
1239,I don't feel as mentally sharp as i was,"Hi there! i am an 20 Y/O male and as I have resumed my learning for Cost and Management Accountant i am starting to realize i am not as mentally sharp as I was when I passed from College with Fsc  ( Faculty of Science ) in Pre-Engineering.

1242,I've been food binging a lot worse lately and its jump starting me into my annual depression season worse than usual,"Lately I've been indulging in laxatives to combat how grossly I've been consuming food in the last few weeks. 

I routinely, year to year, gain 30 pounds from the fall all the way to spring due to stress of school, finding myself uncontrollably binging. (I then lose 30 pounds in the summer  just by sleeping in till noon and not really doing anything, and my appetite reduces substantially). 

Its that time of year again where I lose control and start gaining weight, except this time its way worse. 2 months ago I started eating healthy and keeping active, and I was losing weight in a healthy, well paced, controlled manner (something I had lacked my whole life) and that was due to the fact that I moved into my own apartment and could literally control what I have in the house. What I do. Etc. 

But when I'm home with family, I've noticed im completely out of control, and these past 2 months its been the worst. I will do well and not binge and eat whole foods, be full, ajd be satisfied. I'll walk after a meal. I'll have a sweet when I want it, but I'm not craving it 24/7. I'm balanced. But as soon as I get home (which is a pool of carbs and snacks ajd sweets) I just eat anything and everything in sight. Even if I'm not hungry, i'll still be eating.

My parents constantly want me home to keep them company, and so the last 2 weeks I've spent most of my time at home. And the last 2 weeks, I've gained 10 pounds from binging. 

I've literally felt sick these last couple of days with how much I eat. (I'm full, and yet still finding myself eating). Last night, I came home from work late at night, Still full from all the food  I had that day (which was a LOT) And my parents asked if I was hungry and for whatever reason, I said sure (despite my stomach bursting) and I ate 3 slices of chicken bacon pizza, feeling sick, and then ate half a container of edible cookie dough. Like. I was sick BEFORE the cookie dough and yet still could not resist eating all of it. 

I just got back to the apartment and still felt full, but still felt like I wanted to eat. I'm not even HUNGRY im just. I don't even know. Its been really bad lately.  

I've been taking laxatives because I dont know how else to curb it.  And yes, I already know laxatives don't magically get rid of excess food so your body doesn't absorb it. It just starts a bowel movement and most of what is excreted is liquid/water (which is why you become dehydrated) but God. Just a month ago I was almost flat stomached and starting to see abs, and now my stomach is bulging again like it has been for 10 years. I'm right back at where I started. 

Going home is decisively bad, but my family feels like I dont spend enough time with them. I find myself having to go home every week (and then staying half the week anyway because they want me home). I literally spent the last 5 days there, and today I went back to my apartment for the first time since and my family called and asked when I'll be coming home again next (ie, expectantly this week). 

I cant just flat out not go see them because of eating, but I also dont know how or why my binging worsens when I'm there. (I can control what foods are in my apartment so usually I won't crave something that I know isn't here). 

I just remembered when I was like 11, and I was overweight. And my parents freaking out about it and trying to make me watch my food intake. I was 11 and didn't know Jack shit about dieting. I remember one time we went to a restaurant when I was 12.  I ordered a fish sandwich. My dad told me I couldn't eat the bun, only the fish. The bun was too many excess calories. (I straight up love bread and wanted that fucking bun) and he said either bun or milkshake, not both. I went with milkshake

Then later we got home and he gave me laxatives because I ate too much to begin with. 

Which is why I always thought laxatives were for combating the guilt of an unnecessarily large meal, not for occasional  constipation. 
Oh well. (I've tried to make myself throw up once but honestly couldn't, it hurt my throat, and just couldn't do it. Plus, just doesn't sound appealing enough.)

I dont even want to look at the scale. I think I'm just going to admit defeat and relapse for my yearly weight gain. Except its going to be like 50 pounds this winter for sure. I'm already tired of crying and feeling guilt and hating myself for this and not knowing why I cant control it."
1243,How do I cope with a bout of Depression?,"So, just a heads up I have had clinical depression in the past which I moved away from with medication and counseling. Recently in the past week I noticed my mood has been quite poor, I feel depressed. Knowing that life happens and sometimes you can go through small bouts of depression how can I work through this? I exercise daily and keep active as well as socialise. So is it just a buck up until it's over scenario? When I had clinical depression I was fortunate enough to medicate my way out of it but this isn't an option for me since I'm only going through a small phase. Any ideas? I do see a psychologist every two weeks but due to a scheduling conflict I have to wait another two weeks to talk to her. 

P.S: I can't say if I'm falling back into depression so for now I'm just going to say that it's just a short term issue. If it is a bigger issue I'll deal with it then but for now I just want to deal with this as a temporary problem."
1244,I'm a virgin at 26 because of intense anxiety/fear. Any practical advice other than referring me to a psychologist?," I haven't been able to sustain relationships, or get more intimate because of this. What few opportunities I've had I've found ways to get out of. I guess I'm very afraid of intimacy."
1245,"Being told ""you need help"" is NOT helpful","I dont know if it is just me or if others feel this way, but whenever you disclose what's going on (and your thoughts, feelings, reactions to it that would indicate a mental illness) i often times hear 'you need help' and quite frankly, thats not very helpful. 

I've talked about my thoughts of suicide to ""friends"" and I often hear 'Jesus fucking Christ you need to get help. Seriously' and honestly, saying it like that is just gonna dissuade me even more.

I understand that listening to someone else talk about why killing themselves is a good idea is traumatizing in itself and overwhelming. (Nobody knows how to respond to that). But at the same time, if I'm telling you about it, its not because I'm looking for a solution, hoping you'll present it to me. 

If I'm telling you, its because I trust you, and I just want someone to understand what's going on in my mind. I dont want your advice, I dont want your solution, I just want someone to listen. And I think a lot of people become too alarmed by the concept of suicide or harm or just exceedingly harmful and pessimistic views on life that they want to push it off as something drastic and crazy, psychotic and toxic. 

Please, dont. Hearing ""Jesus fucking Christ you need help"" from someone I considered my close friend is heartbreaking, especially when I can't even recognize if I need help. For the longest period of time I thought these things I felt were normal, and I was annoyed when people told me to ""go get help"" what does that even mean? Did it occur to you that talking to you is help? That knowing you are here listening is help? Then I get hit with ""im not a therapist"" no, you're not. You're my friend, though. And yes, this is a topic that not even a great ""friend' should be expected to handle. 

But PLEASE don't tell me I need to get help and dismiss it as such just because you don't want to listen to it. It hurts to hear, I know. It hurts and its terrifying to listen to someone speak so calmly and so surely about killing themselves being a good thing. Nobody wants to listen to that and have it on their conscious. 

But if they are still here, and they are talking to you about it, listen. They might not be ready or even know where to begin to seek professional care, but its not your place to tell them. You are not the answer solver. Even if you tell them ""get help"" they aren't going to just ""get help"" the next day. You'll get frustrated over and over again and start building this wall of resentment. 

Being friends with someone who is struggling with mental illness is hard, but constantly telling them ""go get help"" might make it worse."
1246,I'm starting work in a few hours but i feel like i've lost,"I'ts my first day in work in a few hours, i was supposed to start university but i didnt get in where all my friends did, no big deal, i didnt really want to get in there, but i do want to win a scholarship im currently studying for, but rn i feel like ive already lost, the job will take 9 hours off of my day and while my friends are excited for their first day of school i dread my first day at a mediocre job, if i don't win that scholarship this will probably be the rest of my life, this feels like the first day of the rest of a life im not sure i'm willing to live"
1247,You have no idea how much I want to help,"I just really want to help people. As someone who hasn't been through anything severely depressing, I don't know what having depression or anxiety feels like but I know what it feels like to have nobody understand or nobody you feel like you can turn to.

Unfortunately, I don't have any social media sites in which you can contact me if you feel like you need to talk to someone. 

But I will just do my part now to tell you that I love you so much it not even funny and I care about you a lot and I don't even know you. But does that matter? Not at all. Have a good day and strive to be whatever you want to pursue in life. Don't do anything that can never be undone. 

I love you, and I care about you."
1248,What does this sound like?,"First time posting...I honestly don’t know where to start. I have worked with a psychiatrist and an online therapist before, but there was never a clear “diagnosis” for what I’ve been going through. Ideally I would like to find a therapist who is specialized in what I’m experiencing.

If you could even give me a nudge of things to explore, that would be helpful.

+ super conscious of what people think of me, even strangers
+ struggle with asking for directions
+ racing thoughts 
+ I catastrophize that I have harmed people in my job
+ my boss has told me that I’m too high strung
+ frequent violent dreams in which I’m being chased by people with guns
+ I keep checking with my husband if he likes me every day - seeking reassurance 
+ tense muscles 
+ I struggle with making decisions 
+ an embarrassing moment that happened years ago keeps replaying in my head every day
+ very insecure and feel easily threatened 
+ not sure if this is relevant anymore but I did struggle with anorexia in my college years and had an obsession with having things in fives (e.g. five pencils, five notebooks) in my elementary school years"
1249,Massive Animal Crossing OCD problem.,"Hey guys! So I have had a massive issue ever since I discovered Animal Crossing New Leaf. Whenever I start a game I have to do EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! If I, for example, walk into a tree or don't position myself just right in front of a mailbox or item to interact with it I get a horrible feeling and if other things go 'wrong' after that I have to restart my entire game. The worst is when I walk into a villager and 'push' them on accident. If I make a mistake the whole 'save data' is ruined and the only way to keep playing is to clean my switch, delete my save and all the pictures I took and restart. I have played New Leaf thousands of times but didn't manage to keep a town for longer than 2 weeks at most. I'm a huge AC fan and got New Horizons when it came out and have restarted 300 times at least. Im suffering extremely bad because of this. I don't have OCD in my normal day to day life but once I start a game of any kind I face this problem. I just don't know what to do, I just want to enjoy a town for more than a few hours/days.. I really hope some of you have any tips or maybe know why this happens to me. Please don't tell me to just enjoy it and don't worry about it, I know, I've tried. If I try to ignore the 'mistake' it gets worse in my head and eventually I have to restart because all the joy of playing vanishes. This really affects my mental health as well. If I manage to keep a town for 2 or 3 days Im ecstatic and can play for hours at a time, then when the inevitable happens I'm heartbroken.. Any tips are more than welcome !!! &lt;3"
1250,I never miss anyone except my bf,"Whenever my friends or family say they miss me, after not seeing them for months etc. I say it back but I don't ever mean it? I could not see my family for years and it wouldn't bother me, the same with friends. I could never see my best friend again and I don't think I would really care. When I get into arguments with friends, I'm not too bothered about making up, unless it will make things awkward (e.g I have to see them places, or in group settings) and could have an argument and not speak to them in months and not care. But I care about them, and I enjoy spending time with them and talking to them, it's not like those people mean nothing to me. 
I think if all my friends dropped off the face of the earth, I would miss having people, not having 'those' people. I would miss having people to chill with and spend all my time with and have fun with, but not necessarily them. They are important to me though, and if anything happened to them I would be there if they needed me straight away. 
I think I need my family just as a solid structure in my life, of people I'll always have. They can't be replaced, but if I didn't see them for years I don't think it would matter too much to me. 
However, with my bf, if I don't see him for a day I miss him, I can't see anyone ever replacing him. If we ever argue I want to sort it out straight away because I get so anxious about it. I didn't see him for 4 months during lockdown and it was hard, I missed him every day, but at the same time, not to the point where I couldn't do long distance. He is above everyone else in my life, but we have been together only nearly a year. 
I feel like a bit of a psycho because the way it feels in my head is that I don't care about my friends or family if I can just never see them and be fine with it. But I know I care for them and want them in my life. And I know im not a complete psycho because I love and miss my bf so much, but isn't it just so weird? Like one extreme to the other?
I'm just confused"

1252,Depression,"Hi! In January I have been diagnosed with depression and got some antidepressants to take in the morning. Since two months I have cut my dose by half (I take only half the pill in the morning, my doctor told me so). I am feeling terrible, depressed, I sleep 20h a day, I can fall asleep anytime and anywhere. Is this normal after cutting the antidepressants, does anyone have a similar experience?"
1253,Heavy work anxiety,So I work 3 days a week at a job I don’t necessarily enjoy but it’s ok I guess. Sometimes in the morning when I get up for work I get super anxious and on some days it’s enough to make me call off work. I don’t like the habit but I just feel awful. Does anyone else experience this?
1254,I can't spend a single moment with my own mind,"I'm getting to the absolute limit of what I can handle now. Today I made the stupid mistake of giving myself a few minutes to let my mind wander, again, and it ended the same way it always does. Doesn't matter what I TRY to think about, it'll never stay with that, because there's no telling what subject I'll touch on which will send me right back to the same place.

Every time I let myself think, I have to relive pieces of the same set of events over, and over, and over again and it's fucking torture. I refuse to let anyone know how much it all affected me, but he fucking ruined my life. All I have is puzzles on my phone, TV shows while I eat or try to sleep, games when I have the energy to play them. I cycle through the same things, day after day, making sure I don't spend a second without a distraction. I hate it. I hate all of it. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this."
1255,I am going to work until the day I die,"I am 27 with a well paying job that is far from difficult. I really shouldn't be complaining. The problem is, all I do is work and sleep. I have fallen into a mindset of that is all I will ever do. I don't get to hang out with friends or my family. I can't play games or do fun things. All I do is work and sleep.

This has worsened my depression but there is no way out. I feel trapped."

1257,Where can misanthropy (hatred of other people) come from?, Asking for myself. I’m very judgmental and fearful of people. I look down on people pretty easily if I see them doing something stupid. I don’t like small talk. I don’t like shallow conversations and shallower interests eg sports. I like thinking about bigger questions and more intimate friendships. I guess this holds me back because I jump on the hate train pretty fast.
1258,"Everyone says ""go to therapy"" but there are NO therapists remotely close to me accepting new patients","Its so frustrating to finally try to find help and get ""I'm sorry, there are currently no openings in my practice"" emails back over and over. Ive looked through Psychology Today, several other sites, and my health insurance provider, and have yet to receive anything helpful. Dozens of emails. It doesn't help that I have severe anxiety about using the phone (a reason why I'm seeking therapy) and half of the listings don't have an email listed. I've thought about going to an emergency room but I don't want to be a burden in the age of Covid- plus I cant afford it. I dont really know where else to look. :/"

1260,I think I have ADHD and I’m an adult now. How do I get a diagnosis?,"I am 99.99% sure that I have ADHD and have had it my entire life. My parents never got me treated for it, I think because I did not show any hyperactivity which is a distinct sign of ADHD in children. I have always been forgetful though, and have always had trouble concentrating all throughout my schooling years, among other symptoms.

Now, I have landed my first career in education. I am worried that my ADHD symptoms are going to affect my work ethic in a major way. I have poor time management skills, I am extremely forgetful and I have a lot of difficulty concentrating on arduous tasks and during meetings. I’m always fidgeting around after five minutes of having to sit still and I have to keep my body moving somehow. I always have to have my mind stimulated in some way or else I feel like I will explode. I am wondering how adults get a proper diagnosis for ADHD. Can I just go to my primary care doctor for this? Will they take me seriously? I feel like they will laugh at me or not believe me when I say that I think I have ADHD as an adult but I need help. These symptoms have always been a part of me and now I have a serious job under my belt and I want to be a great employee but my symptoms are making things a bit difficult and it’s giving me anxiety. Please, anyone who has been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, how did you get your diagnosis???"

1262,My life and why it may end soon,"Come to think of it the best years of my life that I can actually remember were from 2011-2015 when I was 8-11, when I had actual irl friends. Besides that being lonely for years without friends. Like literally… As a young kid I had a best friend and a few other friends in the neighborhood. My at the time best friend eventually moved away just like all the other kids in the neighborhood leaving me lonely. Infact, I had an opportunity like 2 years ago to see him again and I turned down the offer for video games. Like wth was I thinking. One of my many regrets. Before that when they're were still others kids in the neighborhood I couldn't actually be like the others. I wasn't trusted out of the fenced yard cause I was too young. I mean shit, I was 8-9 years old and could look out for myself yet wasn't trusted out of the yard. Had to talk to them tru a fence. Even had rock fights at times throwing rocks at each other above the fence. Luckily none of us were ever hit, that could have resulted in death due to the some of the sizes of the stones. Another regret. I wish I had disregard what my mom thought and just left the yard to play with the others. Then I moved with my mother to her boyfriend's house where I got new friends alongside my old ones back at my house during the time. But in 2014 I lost all my school/neighbor friends there as we moved back permanently to our house. Then what. School… I got a few new friends there and was soon expelled by a fucked up bully who till this day I want to beat the shit out of him. And I still swore to myself till this day if I ever see him again, he will pay hell. He got me to disciplinary school which after entering the point where you don't work and just break rules, I actually enjoyed it which I used not to. Because of that I stopped working and eventually was expelled from there as well which caused great shit between me and my mom (not like it hasn't happened like for the majority of my life) which fucked up my mental. Then what. I had no friends till 2019 when internet returned to the house. But I only have internet friends now. Which is good. But I feel it's not enough. At least I can vc with online friends, but no. My mom thinks I'm not ""normal"" or capable of having a conversation. Them what. Ah yes. I had the opportunity to go to school a few years ago where I could get actual friends. But no, I had to say no, but deep inside I wanted to. Now days I'm lonely just like I've always been. Despite having virtual friends I'm still lonely. My dad passed away when I was 3. Which is affecting me now days more than ever. I was going to get a job in March of 2020 but no. A fuckup virus had to take over the world and my only chance to get out. Yep, I have no reason to go out so stay isolated indoors which has made me extremely shy and have minor social anxiety. Infact maybe more than minor. Now days I'm just regretting my teenage years. I feel like I daydreamed away my teenage years living in a fantasy world to keep me company. I'm 17 and don't even have a girlfriend either. I'm afraid of the future and now developing a poor mentalhealth as the time pass. Now days I have depression, I cut to keep me stable. I have anxiety. I get panic attacks due to excessive pinging on Discord as it brings back raid memories on my server along side those I moderated. I even question if I have DID. I'm literally dead inside. Better yet. My phone service expires a few days before Halloween. And my mom can't refill it due to financial issues. Meaning I'll loose contact with all my friends which will totally kill my mental to the point I'll probably sucide a few days later. I nearly killed myself due to a Twitter post that took control of my mind on August 28. Then have sucidal thoughts and intentions constantly. I've had them a year ago during a depression wave as well. I've had depression waves for years due to loneliness and now I have long lasting depression. I get scared at times and feel so lonely when my internet goes off for a few minutes or my phone dies on me at 60%. WTF. EVEN MY DAMN PHONE IS DYING ON ME. There are just sometimes I wish I was dead. I feel so useless in this life 😭😭😭"
1263,Today I decided that I need a therapist for various reasons including self harm and multiple suicide attempts. I told this to my closest friend and he is suggesting to contact out school counselor. Is that a good option since? I can't have my parents knowing anything about this,I'm not questioning the counselor I'm sure they are incredibly good at what they do the problem is that I don't want my parents to know since they're mostly what's causing all these problems (they're quite abusive) and telling them would only make it worse and I've seen many cases where school counselors tell parents about their child even if it's about abuse from the parents and I really don't want any kind of contact between my therapist/counselor and my family since it'll only escalate the problems. My mom once found out about my self harm and she yelled at me and hit me so I don't want something like it to happen again that's why I'm considering not going to the school counselor since it's almost their job to tell the parents and it's also very easy for them to do so since they can get the contact information of my parents directly from the school. I also need advice on how to find a good therapist and where to look. I'd prefer an online therapist since I also have social anxiety.
1264,I feel so alone,"I have a lot of friends and I talk to many of them on a daily basis and hang out with them from time to time. I also met someone online who I talk to every day, who Ive gotten really close with and shared many feelings and things about my life that I havent talked about with anyone before. All this yet I still feel really lonely almost every day. I hate myself deeply and that sometimes makes me want to isolate myself from the people I love, likely because I dont want them to start hating me too. Although I suspect many of them probably dislike me or think of me as weird at this point anyway. Im extremely bitter towards the world and Im convinced that all the evil outweighs the good, to the point where Im starting to doubt whether or not the human race is even worth protecting. Lately Ive had an urge to self harm, which is pretty worrying I think. The only reason why I havent done it is because Im afraid Id get caught. I also promised someone that I wouldnt, and I dont want to break that promise. I dont want to die, it scares me, but life rarely feels worth living sometimes."
1265,*TW suicidal thoughts*(?),"Hi. I’m not entirely sure if I should ask this here or in the suicidal thoughts sub, because I am not suicidal nor am I depressed. Though, over the years I have been thinking about death a lot. I’d think about what would happen if I killed myself, if I just suddenly died or if I got sick and the doctors wouldn’t be able to help me anymore. I’d wonder if my family would’ve cared and if they would be sad about my passing or if they would just cry at my funeral and then forget about me a day after. Death does not fear me, because I know it’s part of the circle of life and that we all die at some point. This is not something I talk about with my friends or my household. I feel like they won’t take it seriously and just brush it off. Apart from this, I don’t want to look like a pitiful person (I despise it when I cry or vent to other people, I’d rather vent to myself). This is a recurring thought and I was wondering if I should seek help."
1266,What would you do?,"If you work with people who undermine you and your ideas.when they think you are weak and dont see that they are passive aggressive and covertly sabotaging your work.

Would you play dumb and continue letting them think that's what you are?

I cant remember if it was on a YouTube channel or in one of the books I read.It said something about concealing your ideas,play dumb or something. 

How do we just stop trying to prove that we actually know what we are doing and let it slide?

How do you validate your damn self in this world?"
1267,How can I find help for my mentally ill friend who is at the verge of homelessness when we're not in the same country?," I am seeking advice in behalf of a friend. She is an American young woman, from Ohio. She has several health and mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and she also takes antipsychotics), plus in the recent times she has been dabbling in drugs. She is at risk of becoming homeless, and she has no friends or family she can turn to. I feel like her mental health has been declining since the pandemy started, and it is also when she began taking drugs. She is feeling suicidal, and I don't know how I could help her as we don't live in the same country (I am from Europe).

With the imminent risk of homelessness and the fact that she hasn't been taking any meds recently, she feels unable to seek aid on her own and has no strength to inform herself, so she gave me permission to search for possible help in her stead. In the past I suggested her to go to a women's shelter, but truthfully I have little knowledge of where she could go seek help since I'm not American. She has little to no money, so ideally it should be a place that offered aid free of charge.

I'm asking to any Americans here, do you know what options are there for someone in her situation? Any organizations? I'm not sure if there are any social security/welfare programs that work around those issues. I am a first-timer on reddit and I don't know how to move on this site, so if I'm in the wrong place to ask or there have been similar posts before I'd be grateful to know as well!

All and any help and suggestions are welcome, as I am truly at a loss of where we could start..."
1268,Is what I'm feeling normal?,"For a long time I haven't been able to feel much. In the past, I used to be very sensitive (and I kinda still am), but now I can't ever cry or get sad. The only emotions I feel are anxiety and anger. I have this deep hatred for my parents and brother, which probably is due to how aggressive and dismissive of my feelings they were, but sometimes I think this hatred is excessive. I really, really, really, hate them. When I'm around them, I feel like killing them. I imagine myself beating them up with a metal vase, a knife - I have many different fantasies. I've never been aggressive in my entire life: I've actually always hated fights and did everything I could to avoid them. I'm not motivated or looking forward to anything. It's not like I hate myself, though I wouldn't say I love myself. I feel just plain nothing, I guess? Nah, I think I do feel something. This has been my normal for a long time (except my anger). I think I'd like to know how you guys feel day to day, so I know if what I'm feeling is normal. I don't feel like I'm depressed, even though I'm not being able to do anything related to school for 2 or 3 months. Yeah. Byeeee."

1270,a toxic friend has ruined my mental health,"To the point where i'm seriously considering self-medicating with st johns wort or something similar. She has her own issues as well due to ab*se in the household, betrayal etc but it's been rubbing off on me so much. She is so so sensitive and has invisible criteria that she upholds all of her friends to. You don't know when she will get mad and when she does it's not pretty. She will hurl the worse insults (she admits she does it in order to release the anger), the worse part is that her anger is often not justified. eg. she overthinks things to the point where my other friends and i all agree that it's ridiculously petty. She accuses us of being morally inferior because of extremely minuscule incidents. She will get mad if i text her and the message's length is not satisfactory. I have dreaded every day earlier this year because of her. It's strange, i feel guilt if i mistreat her or cut her off completely because her behaviour is due to her past. Plus i'm a student, and i cannot avoid her due to her being in my class. Anyway, i dread every interaction with her, and going to school/working on projects with her brings me an insurmountable amount of dread and anxiety. She has demonstrated other toxic behaviours as well, which makes her so fragile yet condescending. If she were to transfer out of my school, and if i just had her out of my life, i'd feel a deep sense of relief. Unfortunately that is not possible -- the only thing i can do now is to adapt and cope with her presence for at least another year. I'd really appreciate any advice, and how to stop feeling so responsible for her outbursts when i am really not as morally reprehensible as she makes me out to be."

1275,How do you keep yourself from telling others your problems.,"I believe my mental health problems don’t matter, but I keep having urges to express them or be sad around people. How do I keep my problems hidden better?"
1276,It just seems impossible to come out of this darkness,"Long Post Warning!

From the past 2 years, I don't think I have ever been 'happy' for more than 5 minutes. I have always been a very shy person and have severe complex when it comes to communicating with people. Hence I have lost all contact whatsoever with everyone whom I once used to consider close.

So I want to share my story but I am in no condition to formulate it properly. But I will try to do it and see how it goes.

Basically, I have always been a totally shy person and a total introvert. I had severe complex while talking to people. Like really bad. Hence I always had trouble understanding people, and thus I never figured out how to act in what situation and I could never connect closely with anyone. 

Due to this, somewhere along the way, I inculcated a habit of just avoiding people as much as possible. I used to lie all the time; and use any kind of ridiculous excuses just to avoid meeting someone. This increased so much that I never even tried bonding properly with people. I just made up some excuse all the time and stayed alone.  

This obviously created an image in head of everyone about me; that I just avoid people for some reason. And people maybe made up their own explanations on why I would do this. But I never cared what someone thinks of me. I just kept this going.

As a result, apart from 2-3 people, I cannot openly to anyone still. And on top of that everyone has a image of me being like just a rude person who doesn't want to talk to them, when actually it always was that I could never find the courage to start even the simplest of conversations, leave aside bonding with the person. Hence no one really got to ""know"" me and I did not get to really ""know"" anyone.

And also, I mentioned before that I developed this habit of constantly lying. It also increased and increased and it became like; I used to make up things just to continue conversations; or say something with certainty even if I am not so certain about it. 

All this also did not help me in my job as you would have guessed. I stayed at my first job for 2 years; and it was the most horrible time of my life. Basically, when I joined in 2017 in order to make a ""good first impression"" I just started to show excitement and enthusiasm all the time and just talk with everyone in the office. Of course this did not last long. And combine this with the usual office politics; and I literally ran away from this job after 2 years. I now work as a part time; as a freelancer. 

In between all this, I started drinking heavily. I used to socially drink before. But during my job; I just could not contain myself without drinking. So it led to heavier and heavier consumption. And it has only increased in the last year; especially after covid lockdown.

I consume a lot alcohol now than before. Everyday. Or at the max every other day. Because only when I am drunk I feel like I am ""happy"" ( Although I don't even know what happiness is any longer. ). This has not only taken a toll on my mental health, but also on my pocket! I have heavy credit card bills pending, and the lockdown has already limited my freelancing opportunities.

And worst part is; I can't talk to anyone about this! Therapy is out of question because it is just sooo expensive. I have one best friend; but he himself has so much tragedy in his personal life; I don't even want to burden him about this. And no one knows I am like this. Because first is no one really talks to me regularly, and second is whenever someone talks I just have this mask on just pretending to be okay. I was raised by a single parent, my mum. I can't talk to her about this; because consumption is such a frowned upon thing in our place; she will not ever recover if I tell her about my consumption habit.

Everything is so dark. It just seems impossible to come out of this darkness.

I am a believer in human life and I want to live my life to fullest. I don't want to give up and I never have thought of ending things because I think this can be fixed.   
But I just don't know how. And it seems more and more impossible with each passing day.

Please advice me fellow redditors on what I can do!!"
1277,Suggestions,I’m slowly starting to see my mental health get worse everyday and honestly I don’t know what to do it was bad already but atleast ide have a good day every once in awhile but now every day is just not good. I’m just looking for some genuine suggestions of things I can do to help before I’m too far gone. Thank you in advance!!!
1278,"I have unwanted strong feelings for a friend, and I need them to stop","Let’s just go right in, I have unwanted sexual feelings for somebody. No this isn’t a sexuality issue I’m comfortable with where I am, and it is with an adult of a similar age, just to clear that up. It stems more from how abrupt these thoughts occurred and how impossible and hopeless the whole thing is.
 
I’ve had a group of friends for a while and through them I met this person. Despite not knowing them for long we quickly became good friends, finding common ground in mental health issues, hobbies we share and a similar sense of humor. We both conceded in each other issues pertaining to our sexuality, and mental illness . Everything was fine until a few weeks ago, where I found myself having these sudden strong feelings.

The worst part of all of this is that this person isn’t even attracted to my gender identity. The possibility of a relationship is something that I not only don’t want at all but is entirely impossible. 

All I want is a good friend, and that I have, but I fear what these thoughts will do to me going forward. I would daydream of my future and in those I have a spouse of the same face as this person and I would be aroused at the thought of getting with them. I’m disgusted with myself more than I have ever been. This is putting not only my relationship with them on the line but all of my friends, and has been destroying my focus on my life as of late.

I’ve been in a few relationships in the past, I’ve always considered myself mentally stable. But these intrusive thoughts as of late are having me reconsider. 

And no, I will never confront them about it, or any other friend who knows them. This isn’t me asking for help getting with them, I want to keep my friends and make these thoughts stop, what should I do?"
1279,Does counselling work for everyone?,"TL;DR: I have had two not great experiences with counselling, does it actually work for everyone or do some people do better by just figuring out ways to cope on their own?


I (25f) have struggled with my mental health ever since puberty hit. Whenever I tried talk to my parents when I was younger, I was ignored or told to just get over it.

When I was a bit older and tried to bring it up my doc, it was basically the same. I admit I probably wasn't voicing my concerns properly, but one example was telling her that I was so stressed I wasn't sleeping properly, hair was falling out way more than usual, and stomach was in bits, and she told me ""a little bit of stress is good for everyone"".

Then when I got to college, (free counselling, whoo) I had some awful personal stuff going on and tried counselling for the first time. The college had an online CBT course that I worked through, and I had a few meetings with a counsellor. But gave up pretty quickly because I just ended up sobbing in every session and dreading the sessions.

Now I'm in grad school (different university), and I'm struggling. Again tried the online CBT course, but honestly CBT just does not work for me. I met up with a counsellor regularly there for about 6 months, and while bits of it were useful, I gave up when after I opened up about how anxious I get on public transport (this was before covid), he told me to, and I quote, ""grow up"".

I've had limited success with mindfulness, evening primrose oil tablets, and keeping on top of my fitness to keep my mental health in check, but it's just a constant struggle, it's something that I always have to fight against, like my default setting is to be down and stressed constantly.

So have I just been unlucky so far with my experiences in counselling, or is this feeling normal, or do I actually just need to ""grow up""?"
1280,"Adderall has given me perspective on how ""loud"" my brain really is, what do I do now?"," 28M, active lifestyle, moderately successful. For the first time in my life I had discussed focus and mental health issues with my doctor, and was prescribed adderall. The effects were mind blowing, similar to the movie ""Limitless"" as far as the clarity, focus, and successes I had. I was on it for 4 months until my job changed where I can no longer be on amphetamines. I'm able to function well enough without it, but what is most concerning is the perspective I now have of how loud and disorganized my brain normally is.

I have always struggled to focus at school, work, or with things I’m not particularly interested in, but though it was normal. The much bigger issue I see now is that my mind is constantly churning thoughts, every minute of every day. The best way I can describe my mind is a bunch of different TV's on at the same time, constantly flipping channels. Not so much pictures but sounds, monologues, music, and rabbit holes of thought played through a loudspeaker. Its constantly there, and I’ve come to consciously recognize it at an alarming magnitude. For example, the noise starts before my body even wakes up in the morning. Its anywhere from 30-minutes to an hour of being trapped before my eyes open and my brain and body actually wake up. I also find myself fiddling with something in my hand, humming/whistling, and walking around a bit.

I’m not distracted with time waiting things perse, but with like functional ideas. I don’t have any social media and don’t do much scrolling through online feeds. It’s more of just ideas or concepts like projects I could work on that I will just dive down the rabbit hole on researching or thinking about. The only time this doesn’t occur is if I’m actively and methodically engaged in an activity. Like working on my cars/motorcycles, doing yard work or any physical labor, or working through well organized workflow process at work. I’m also a pretty introverted and mellow person on the exterior, and have the skills and training as a leader to remain calm and execute in a stressful or demanding environment. I tend to do my best work when under the gun.

What I’m now looking for is the best method for understanding this issue, and coping with it to better perform at work. I believe this is more about turning the subconscious noise level down, than my ability to singularly focus on a task. I’ve tried a myriad of solutions, but the ritual I’ve developed is not sustainable. Passively, I’ve painted and designed my office with calming colors and natural textures. I use soft lighting with a beautiful view of the forest behind my house. Actively, I play focus-based music like beta waves, classical, low-fi, nature sounds. I’ll burn incents or smoke my pipe tobacco. I’ll exercise and make sure I’ve eaten well and healthy for the day. I use blue light glasses. I’ll have coffee or tea. If things are really bad, I’ll use my fisher wallace stimulator I have for treating depression, but it’s cumbersome and not practical if I have to go into work.

What is my best course of action for dealing with this issue or at least simplifying my routine to help mitigate the mind distractions. Second to that, it would be nice to just simply relax sometimes in my off time without anxiety kicking in to go do something. 

TLDR: I took Adderall for the first time and now struggle without it realizing how loud my brain is. How serious is my issue and is there a better way to deal with it without having to coordinate things like music, diet, exercise, and environment almost religiously?"
1281,6 quirky food behaviours which could be concealing disordered eating in men -&gt; I've done them all A LOT,"Hey folks, I've been reflecting on my own journey with binge eating and the quirky behaviours I've picked up. I've shared the top 6 which seem surprisingly common in men and could be indicative of something deeper.

Do you do any of them?

1. lots of zero calorie foods e.g. sugar-free jelly, celery, gum
2. extreme restriction e.g. keto, intense daily fasting
3. stealing food from others
4. eating from bins
5. hiding food wrapping
6. regular body checking e.g. pinching stomach

I talk about them in more detail here: [https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E](https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E)

I've done all 6 a lot 👀

These are obviously only potential quirky warning signs: they are not related to the clinical definition of any eating disorders.  
That said, they could be a flag to gently check-in with someone if you notice these behaviours.

Sending love &amp; support to you all 💪"
1282,Taking a break from social media,"I’ve had a rough weekend. I’m working two jobs and going to school which is exhausting. I’m quitting one of my jobs soon so I’ll have more time for myself. Over the past week, my friends were non-stop texting in our group chat about having a girls night this past weekend and it was honestly irritating the shit out of me. I guess I’m just overwhelmed with trying to manage 2 jobs and school that I can’t even think about anything else. Also, I’m kind of irritated with some of them just because some of them live off of their daddy’s money and don’t have to work so they have all the time in the world and I have to work all the time just to make ends meet. Anyway, every time my friends decided on a day/time to hang out, it always interfered with school or work, so I was always the bummer that couldn’t make it. Eventually we settled for Sunday night. Saturday night I texted them and lied and said that I couldn’t make it. I lied because I was just wanted a night to myself to relax. They didn’t really respond to me and the group chat kinda just went dead. I’m such a yes person so I feel bad for ruining the plans. It’s also just weird that no one really said anything about it too. It put me in an even worse mood and so I just deleted all of my social media apps. Watching everyone I followed on social media do fun things was making me feel more depressed because I don’t really have time or money to do fun things. I know that not everything on social media isn’t what it seems most of the time but it still does a great job at making me compare myself to the people I follow. None of my friends have really reached out to me so I just feel weird about it all. I just need a break from the pressure of going out and I need to focus on myself for a little while. Does anyone else feel this way sometimes?"
1283,Share your tools to self motivation while doen,"Hey,
Was wondering if anyone can share his tools to get out of a depressed low achieving mode into a more passionate , can do spirit

I’ve unfortunately experienced a total burn out in my previous work place were I was working 18hr days and surrounded with stress and unsupportive management, which followed some pretty negative events in my personal life (injured my face several times, got 25k and passport stolen, toxic relationships etc ) all while being in a foreign country and being stuck in lockdown for over 8m. 

I used to be so highly motivated, positive person with great work ethic , energy and passion for life and now I can’t really motivate myself to do anything or show up for stuff that matter, my future visa in uncertain and I’ve developed a total mental block

1284,POP!!,"Life it's strange one day your excited to wake up the next your afraid to go to bed. Anymore lately I've only known fear, come night time. I lie there in bed and fear death (due to the inevitable heart attack that will occur if my heart rate continues at its current) I fear any and every decision I've ever made past present and future. I miss my special person some days some days I feel like I don't deserve anything. I feel like thanos has a grip on the inside of my chest as if he were to grab my shirt and twist. I need a breath, but I need a reason to breath at the same time. I wanna be excited to live again. Some days I feel like I'm just a walking blood balloon on a floating rock in the stars. With the tap being turned on little by little until I finally POP.  One day I'll remember how to breath without feeling like I'm going to POP."
1285,"Movies, that help you see the beauty of life","Hello,

I don't really have friends I could talk to.
I feel the urge to end my pathetic life.
So I am looking for a movie to numb my brain and be distracted.

What movies do you like to watch, when you feel like this?
It should be a movie, that on the one hand acknowledges, that you feel like shit most of the time, but also let's you see why it can be rewarding to stay alive.
Thanks, friends."
1286,Why is this happening?,"I've had anxiety issues for a very long time but something is very strange about it.
I have been normal with no anxiety all this year and suddenly in autumn like a week ago I started getting anxiety, panic attacks, can't concentrate to games like genshin impact etc...
And was wondering what is causing that, could it be chronic sinusitis?"
1287,Non-Stop Rumination for weeks,"Hey guys, 

So let‘s start from the beginning.

About 6 weeks ago I had a full blown panic attack which sent me in an emotional dissociation for a couple of days where I just felt numb. Ever since then I can‘t stop thinking about if I feel something. I wake up in the morning, first thing that comes to my mind is the rumination and how shitty the past few weeks were and then I‘m back in the cycle. I don‘t even know how to explain it properly. I‘m not even ruminating on if I can feel but more about that I can‘t stop thinking about the topic. I‘m sure it sounds dumb. But it‘s making my life so unpleasant. I can‘t watch a movie because I can‘t concentrate on the storyline. I can‘t enjoy being with my friends because in my head there is this non-stop cycle of thinking about the emotional numbing I experienced. I just want to get out of this cycle and I would do anything to get out of my head. These thoughts are so pointless. I literally think the same thought all day. What should I do? I know it all probably sounds dumb if you never experienced it but it‘s really making my life a hell because no matter what I do, in my head it‘s the same all day. Is this OCD or just my brain being fucked? I‘m so sick of this. I just wanna move back in time and get my old head back, when I didn’t even realize that it’s possible to get lost in such a cycle and think about things that actually matter in my life. 

Please help. 

Do you think it would be a good idea to trip on magic mushrooms? I heard that they can kinda reset the brain, maybe this could get me out of this pointless thought spiral."
1288,Other's make it sound so easy...,"I've lost people in my life and witnessed a suicide, losing a child put a heavier weight in my grief times... I'm usually alone these days and starting to feel suicidal over how shitty people can be to their kids and loved ones. I was raped and tortured as a child for misbehaving or telling on other's, i was always silent and always had a good memory. Temporary moments with people i usually end up never seeing help me forget sometimes. It's just that I'm starting to love being alone, therapy and other fake care stuff never help... this developed because of missing parent figures and trauma from everything i tried to love, i want to ""move on"" but feeling alone and feeling like i have no friends puts me deeper into the thought of something that will always be Missing in my life. Idk how people can do it so easily, i get that they have actual loving friends and family... still. (I'm sorry sorry if this is confusing... )"
1289,Emotionally Exhausted,"I know really know how to share my thoughts and I feel like I'm on the verge of going insane so I can only thought of reddit. My sister is the only one who I can share some deep talk, but we are both super busy lately so we can't chat.
I'm studying Design in my university. I love to be in rhe creative field, or that so I thought, until lately I kinda having an existential crisis. Creating things, coming with new ideas, researching, etc. i used to love it so much that I almost pure my heart and soul into it. 
I devoted a lot of time and money for my projects despite hating the curriculum, the teaching methods and all stuff. However the unfair judging on my latest furniture project made me lose all of my interests in studying. I tried to get myself together and hope that this semester would be a bit better. The curriculum got me insane one more time and I realised that my long-waited ideas that I was to made it my graduation project was simply too complicated in the given time, and nobody would appreciate it or my time working for it .
Since then I got into the biggest slump ever. I can't come up with any decent ideas and I don't even want to. Everything just got so boring and I can't see the spark inside me anymore. No matter how I hard I tried, even when I know that there are tasks to do, there are deadlines to meet up with, I just don't want to do any thing. Things that used to cheer me up don't lift my mood the same ways they used to. And I did have to face my karma for not doing anything, then I battled with myself for being so lazy. My mood even gone down so bad that I secretly hating my best friends from time to time (which I extremly hate). God, I just in the state I dislike everything, my mind, my emotions, myself, the peer pressure, my uni, my teachers, ......
I really want to get out of this state, cause after an event happened today I even want to kill myself (which I used to hate even thinking of it, cause my motto is to be positive so I can live a happy life)"
1290,Ive just realized something that scared the f* out of me,"Im not doing anything with my life because whenever I accomplish something I feel both the weight of the responsibility that accomplishment implies and this weird feeling of ""Now I can die in Peace"" and I actually start thinking about dying. Am I broken or something? How doing something objectively good makes me feel like shit, even if it doesnt *is* a shitty thing to do? Is not that I cant feel good things anymore, is just those emotions drown in comparison with the others.

1291,Rate your Mental Health,How much would you rate your mental health for this month on a scale of 1-10?
1292,Just to talk,"My usual coping mechanisms for life are not available, at least the healthy ones like sport and fragging people online (: and I’m finding myself a bit overwhelmed by random ass drama, threats that have no basis and just bad luck with my family’s health. 
I’m ok, but I would appreciate talking to people just to focus some of the anxiety.
And no, therapy is not an option at the moment. Thanks to Covid and it’s mighty power of income disruptions 
I’m a photographer so if you have any photography questions or need some tips, I’m fashion orientated and film focused with extensive experience (10yrs or so). 
Thank you s 🙏"
1293,Crippling Fear of Death,"This might be kind of rambling since I don't know where to start so please bear with me. 

Ever since March of this year due to the illness that shall not be named I (28NB) have been increasingly conscious of my own mortality. Being overweight and very asthmatic, I'm very aware of how ""at risk"" I am and it hasn't gotten any better. I stay awake at night convincing myself I'm having a heart attack or that I can't breathe. If I'm left alone with my thoughts they race to images of me or my wife on a ventilator.

I started using cannabis back in January and at first it was GREAT for my regular anxieties and physical pains, but lately, like the last 2-3 weeks, every time I get high my paranoia shoots through the roof and I feel like my heart is going to beat out of my chest and sometimes I feel like I might die at any moment. 

I have depression, anxiety, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD when I was 16. My father is bipolar, my grandmother is schizophrenic. So my genetics are fucked in the mental health department. 

I'm unemployed right now. I don't have health insurance. I don't know where to go for help but it's starting to scare me. I can't tell what are legit health concerns anymore or what is my mind fucking with me.

What's worse: I get hit with waves of random existential dread. Even if I don't die soon I will die one day. And I don't want to. I know everyone does, and I know it's inevitable but I'm not ready for my narrative to end. I'm not ready for my consciousness to not exist anymore and not observe itself existing.

I think the heart of my issue is that outside of my mental health and financial problems my life is SO much better than I thought it would ever be right now. I grew up in an unstable, emotionally abusive environment and I attempted suicide for the first time at age 12.  I got married a little over 2 weeks ago to someone that means the world to me and that I know loves me as well, problems and all. Our relationship is healthy. I've built a family for myself out of my wife, our dog, and our friends. We have a lovely, clean apartment. We aren't rich or even that comfortable but our bills get paid and we have food. 

And the problem is that my mind frames this as me getting the life I never thought I'd have so, naturally, when the other shoe finally drops either I will die or my wife will die or our dog will die because I can't have this life. I should have died when I was 12 and I'm not supposed to be here now. 

Of course I know this isn't true, but it doesn't stop the feelings, or the anxiety. I've ran out of effective coping mechanisms. I feel like I'm spiraling further and my constant state of being wound up and anxious is making me irritable and distant and I just CANNOT STOP MYSELF. I'm so desperate for relief, I just want to cry or scream all the time."
1294,Feeling lost and confused. Struggling to care about most things...,"Hey all, hope you're doing well. 

For the last year I've been struggling with caring. Just to preface what I'm about to say... I won't act on this but I consistently get suicidal thoughts. I've struggled in the past with depression. I've had a few attempts but I don't want to go through that again. I struggle with social anxiety but am not opposed of social interaction. I've lost touch with my friends, as most of those relationships were meaningless and toxic, but not all. I don't really care about most things. I do care for my family and pets but that's about it. My past coping methods have been less than ideal. I've been sober for about 13 months, and am looking for some outlets to make life a bit more meaningful. Currently I spend my time with family, work, playing video games, the occasional workout and go to school. I'm currently in therapy but they aren't the best. I'm doing everything they're telling me to do like meditation and logs etc.

Just to sum up, I'd like to make a connection with someone outside of my family (not necessarily romantic). Would also love to hear some thoughts on fun things that you've all found that help. 

Thank you guys so much, I appreciate anything you have to say. I hope you have a great day!"
1295,I’m not good at socializing and I feel so unwanted and like a burden around everyone. Lonely introverted.,"I already didn’t know how to socialize but switching to online school and quarantine made it so much worse. I constantly feel like I’m not wanted in social settings and like I’m a burden and bother everyone. If two people are having a conversation, I won’t say hi because I don’t want to interrupt. I feel like if I talk too much (which isn’t much at all really but for me it is) that I’m annoying to them and they’re tired of me. I’m not wanted. They don’t want me around and wouldn’t care if I wasn’t there. It’s so lonely having everyone ask me how I’m doing just because that’s what you do when you greet someone but they don’t care. I’ve finally started to open up a little and say more than just “I’m good” or “I’m tired”. But I can tell by the way they react that they don’t care. I’m really quiet and soft spoken. I’m comfortable with it because I’ve accepted that it’s who I am. But it feels like a huge disadvantage being surrounded by people who are social and extroverted or not as introverted as I am. I try to make conversation but it doesn’t come naturally. It makes me feel so much lonelier than I already am."
1296,I push people away nowadays.,"I feel guilty for not talking as much as I used to with my brother and for pushing everyone away nowadays. I don't know why i'm doing this, I just don't feel like myself. I feel dreadful, and on top of that I constantly feel guilty. I'm not like this, i've never pushed people away like this and I don't know why i've been doing this lately even though I don't actually intend to. I can't even form a smile or respond to my brothers jokes in the way that I usually would. I don't feel like going up to my brother to poke his shoulder for fun anymore, I feel guilty, I don't mean to be like this. I don't say a word now, I never talked much in this family to begin with but now that I don't talk to my brother like usual, i'm just silent. 


I feel guilty, I don't know what's wrong with me, I just feel like crying."
1297,Don't Know,"Hey Guys, Since school started yesterday i've had so bad feelings, i have even cried yesterday and i'm constantly having a stomach ache and feeling like i need to cry the whooole time but i need tu suppress it while at school.
For the people that know more about stuff heres what i'm going through:
- Depersonalization/Derealization
- new school, all old homies are still in the same city but another school
- very fucking hard school stuff, everybody has had most of the topics and they know what to do but im completely new in every topic and just don't know how it works
(it's called gymnasium in switzerland idk if it's comparable to high school in america)
- Love or bettersaid that one girl: we are writing since beginning of september and never saw eachother, but i've opened myself to her and told her so many things and now im anxious that she won't want to go into a relationship because she thinks i'm mentally unstable which i never was but now it's something special and i never was insecure about shit but it came probably because of her

Yesterday my mom catched me crying over it and i told her it was because of school, today i'll tell her the whole story what's happening right now. 
i hate this constant stomach and headache and just overthinking the whole time and not concentrating on school, i mean even the teachers don't want to teach, it feels like they are getting forced to do this.

I just have the anxiety that this will never go away and i don't want to have this anymore (i'm not suicidal thank god)

could it be depression?


I hope y'all understand me and can help me."

1300,I opened up to my parents about my anxiety and depression and now they treat me like a lepre,"Remember when you were in primary school and someone was sick so all the other kids avoided him and treated him like dirt?

That's what my parents are doing to me.

I suffer from PTSD and came back to live at home because of this and COVID.

My anxiety became so extreme that I had a nervous breakdown and have been trying to recover ever since.

However the other night my anxiety was really bad and I could tell my parents were sort of getting annoyed that I not at ease, so I thought I would try and explain to them how I'm feeling.

I did and ever since then they have treated me like a loser. Walking out of the room when I come in, coughing when I talk,  excluding me, making me feel isolated, the list goes on.......

Some days when I try to talk they don't give.me eye contact and just give me one word answers, the only time they talk is when they want something done.

What do I do?"
1301,Covid Lockdown has restarted in my country. FUCK THIS SHIT!,"Hi guys, hope you're all keeping as well as you can out there. 

I've always suffered with my mental health throughout the years. I'm a relatively young guy. Usually I am able to push through my depression by constantly keeping the mantra of ""there has to be something better than this"". But right now, I'm seriously being pushed over the edge. I'm not suicidal by any means. But, I'm in a continuous loop of feeling sadness, rage and nothingness. I feel like I've nothing to be happy about anymore, I can't even accurately describe how I'm feeling, I think if I could find a word it'd have to be ""hollow"" I'm usually a very outgoing person. I'm a passionate person.

Usually I adore life and all that it may offer but right now, I just feel this overwhelming sense of emptiness. I've never had been to counsellors because I've always had that aforementioned mantra in my head but right now I feel like there's a huge weight on my chest that needs to be lifted because I'm being crippled by my own demons. My parents don't really understand and even if they did, they don't know how to help. The Lockdown has restarted in my country at its highest level and that is only worsening things for me. All I feel now is emptiness and hatred, towards anything and everything. I hate myself cause I feel like I should be doing more, I should be more successful in life, I should have more friends etc. If I see somebody else with those things, I feel like punching them in the mouth in a ""fuck you, be miserable"" kind of way. Although I know, in my heart that they wouldn't deserve it, I don't know what to do guys. Thanks for hearing me out anyway, peace."

1303,Is there a name for this kind of thinking?,"Ever since I was almost beaten up for no reason by a random stranger, I regulatory go to bed scaring myself into thinking how awful it would be to be beaten, attacked, run over by car , lose mobility either by accident or other.then I think about how mentally traumatized I would be by it . 
This usually happens when I go to bed and it stops me from falling asleep. 
Google suggest the word instrusive thoughts is the best terminology, but the example I see online don’t really match.

While this may not completely affect my day , it definitely affects my falling asleep."
1304,Insecurity is destroying my creativity,"Im surrounded by people who make beautiful art. I just started learning how to draw again after almost 7 years of not practising. How do I stop myself from comparing myself from other people who actually practise everyday of their life.

I know that this behaviour is so toxic as it stops me from moving forward because I continously tell myself that I’m not good enough. My art is shit. Im not worth it. How am i going to sell something this hideous..

I dont’t have a job currently as I’ve decided to pursue my passion in art. I’m constantly looking for room to improve &amp; pracising everyday, looking at tutorials, videos to get better. But literally what’s stopping me is my mind.

I don’t know how much of a push I need to stop thinking that I’m not good enough. My Friends, Fiance has been telling me that they would buy my art and they are very encouraging but I can’t seem to appreciate my art enough to love it like they did.

I also have creative hobbies that I still enjoy.
 To be fair I don't have much of a social life at the moment but that's because a) quarantine and b) being extremely introverted and c) being in a phase if social change due to new career situations."

1309,Depression is creating anger,"Its funny how depression works. One minute I feel that I can take on the world, the next I am having a mini panic attack because I missed one assignment for college. And now I got so angry that I punched a wall. 

I feel that I have been depressed for so long that my feelings are started to turn for the worse. I feel more angry now, I don't like to talk to my animals, I am short to violence, I kicked a wall and what's worse is that I don't feel happiness. There is no one around me to help and I don't have the money for thereby. 

I can't have anger on me. I just can't, being depressed is one thing, but anger is actually worse and I feel that anger is dangerous. Is there pills I can take or maybe a watch something to calm me down? I can't have anger right now, I just cant."

I have some issues with anxiety which I'm managing with medication and therapy. I've not mentioned to my therapist yet.

1312,I've lost myself.,"TW; Cussing, suicidal.

I give up. I truly do not deserve anything. My mental health is fucked once again. Everything is numb.

I ran out of fucks I have for my well being.

It feels like no one genuinely cares anymore, and my mental health worsens each day. It's almost like a downward spiral and all I can do is sit and watch while saying some people still have it worse.

The second I actually end myself, I can guarantee that the last thought going through my fragile mind will be 'I'm fine', something I will claim until it's far too late, way beyond the point of fine.

Anxiety sucks. Whatever I have sucks. I don't want to self diagnose until I do more research but I don't think I need to label how badly I'm falling apart.

I'm fragile. Every time someone touches me, I just crumble more and more.

I'm at the point where I've tried everything and it doesn't help. Therapy? Check. Pills? Just made it worse. Checking myself into a hospital? I still attempted to take my life. I don't know what's wrong with me. My head always feels like it's drowning. I'm getting addicted to alcohol. 

The hotlines I've called in Canada are just jokes to me. ""Drink some tea and take a warm bath!"" Or just immediately hanging up. Very helpful.

It's just a bunch of personality disorders mixed with mommy and daddy issues also mixing with ADHD and my autism. Along with extremely bad anxiety and other things I don't know about yet. It's like a really bad fruit punch. 

No one understands how much pain I really am in. How the fuck can I be so numb but in so much pain. How does that bloody work?

I want to die, I really do. I'm not sure if I'm going to make it. I want to, but fuck man, nothing is helping me.

I don't know anymore. I can't even cry. My head always hurts and I've tried to overdose twice last week, and I'm just... tired. Tired of people, myself, this world itself. I have never found anything good in it.

Why does nothing work. Am I just that broken? Will I ever be fixed? I don't know."

If medication and therapy doesn't help, what will make me happy then?"
1314,Does anyone have any tips for pulling yourself out of a depressive rut?,I just don’t really know what I’m doing with my life and this has caused my mental health to slowly become worse.

1315,Help please,"My partner (29F) is going through alot, she has a huge history of mental health problems (BDP, depression, anxiety) and recently has been struggling eating, and when she does she makes herself sick. She has 3 kids by 3 different dads(12,7,3) the youngest goes to nursery for 5 hours 3 times a week and thats the only alone time she gets, she's the most amazing person ive ever met, so kind caring and loving it inspires me, but she suffers massively it pains me. Her last partner father to the youngest child was with her for 7 years and is a dad to all 3 children, I dont have a relationship with the kids, he still does, goes to hers and has alot of time with them, which I think is great. He knows about me but she is worried about upsetting him so we won't progress on that front, he constantly messages her saying he loves her and needs her and she constantly says its over, she shows me all the messages and does spend alot of time with me given the circumstances. She is the most amazing mother I've ever met, but with the covid, and the rough year we've had im finding it hard to help her? 

She says lately she feels numb, feels nothing. Can't eat and is making herself sick when she does, I say we will get help but she says there isn't any? She takes 150mg of sertaline everyday and I'm trying to work out how I can help her without pushing her, please help me"
1316,What should I do?,"So just to clarify so you can understand the situation, while we were going home from SM, me and my family were talking about how the pandemic was affecting everyone and I mentioned how even normal people online are going through that ""doomer"" belief that ""what's the point in doing anything if it's all meaningless in the end?""

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago, so my sister thought I was under that doomer mindset as well so she started to worry, she started taking how I shouldn't think that way because our actions are meaningful, and I don't know why but the why she says it seems so condescending to me and then she asked me that have I taken my meds and when's the last time I went to the doctor, and so I tried to explain I don't feel that way. and then my mom cuts me and says ""then u shouldn't have brought up something pointless!""

(That was in reference to what I did two days ago when I asked my mom why we haven't tried the red rice since she gave one to my aunt then after they left she was pissed at me for saying it in public).

Then I tried shutting up, they started to say like how I believe I don't have to be told about sh*t and that I can stand up for myself when in reality I can't, That's when I started to get hurt, and I felt that I'm constricted by them so first thing I did after I went out to feel better was too run away.

They caught me and now they believe that I don't appreciate what they're doing for me since our father died, my sister is thinking of bringing me with her and leaving our Mother behind. She said its because I need fresh air and responsibilities but I do have them here, and our mother needs someone with her, she retorts back and says I'm just gonna be a burden to our mother. What should I do?"

1318,I have a strong urge to hurt small animals,"Earlier this year i was admitted into to a psych hospital for writing about and attempting to stab my mothers boyfriend in his sleep(failed). I was transferred from school to a psych hospital once school police found my journal with a knife in my bag after searching for drugs.(I had accidentally left journal and knife in my bag after coming back from the trip to my mom’s) I was released from the hospital about a week and a half later. My stay there wasn’t half as bad as i expected, i felt at home there in a fucked up way, i got into few fights and had overall good behavior there, i was good to staff and the doctor agreed to let me out earlier than expected. 


My main concern is that i’ve been getting this strong urge to hurt animals lately. it’s like i just wanna squeeze a cat till it’s eyes pop out of its head, or just feel its skull crush and shatter in my hand, maybe stomp it out or just bite it’s neck and feel the warm blood drip from my teeth. it’s this thing in me and its hard to resist this bloodlust. 

i can’t help but think about the things i would do if i was alone with that animal, but it gets bad some times like really bad and i start really thinking about it. I’m scared of myself, I feel like these urges have been getting worse and worse and i don’t know if i should get help. Am i the only one? i’m starting to have these urges towards people, and i can’t help but fantasize. Is this normal?(I’m a 14 y/o male) I have not always felt these urges but since around 7 or 8 i can remember these thoughts starting.
 

Any Suggestions or thoughts on what i should do?"
1319,Tips on dealing with a Bipolar parent?,"Hi, I'm a teenage girl and my father is bipolar. When he told me and my siblings earlier this year everything in my childhood started to make a lot more sense. His mental illness  usually leads to extreme outburst of anger from him at unpredictable times. I just had to deal with one of his outbursts this morning, a bad one on my scale. Screaming, gaslighting, anger at my tears. I just don't know how to handle any of this anymore, I myself am mental ill, (anxiety, depression) and my own mental illnesses make him mad. I've always been told if your struggling with your mental health to talk to a trusted adult. And I do, I talk to my mother- but then my mother shares whatever I told her with him. And well, he'll get very very angry at me. I wish I could give more insight on to why he's even angry, or what he's rage induced rants entail. But I just can't, they're usually nonsense. Any help? I'm going off to college soon and I think if I leave I'll never come back. So to stop that I thought maybe I could find some coping skills to deal with my father so we can continue a relationship in my adulthood. 

TLDR: dad's bipolar and has rage induced outbursts and rants. Need advice/coping skills"
1320,Piece of clothing makes me feel like im having bad flashbacks,"

Trigger warning.

This is going to sound insane, weird and just downright crazy. But I can not stop thinking about it and I just need help.

Why on earth do I(23m) feel so dreadful when I see women lingerie? Or just remember them?

When I first broke up with my ex(19f), I gave up to the guilt and her attempts to bring me back. She told me we should take things slow but soon after things got sexual.

During that time I was extremely anxious and scared of loosing her, she said things like I am afraid of coming back to you and I can't handle the feelings I have when I am with you, but soon after she starts flirting and sexting till things got intense.

I don’t remember what started it or why we brought it up. But we had a sexting session where she was sending me her underwear.

I don’t know why, I don’t know if I was supposed to say no, I don’t know how it started. But this happened WAY BEFORE. In the first month of getting back together in an 8 month relationship. During the rest of the time with her I didn’t even think about. But for some reason I’m remembering it today, 20 days after the breakup like it was something that happened yesterday yet I still can’t remember why it happened...

I fucking hate this, I hate it, I hate it I hate it. It feels like shit and I don’t know why the fuck I’m feeling this way.

TL;DR: a piece of underwear makes me feel like im having very bad flashbacks and memories of a sexual encounter I had during a very stressful time"

Do you feel like you? 
As in you put your clothes on, eat, play games. Look in the mirror and see your reflection. Live your daily day to day things. And know that this is you. That your comfortable with who you are, and what you do. There's no doubt in your head. 

Because I'm not. Or at least I'm not sure I am. There's *something* off. And I just can't tell what. I could get ready to eat something and I suddenly not fussed. I just can't eat it. 
Get ready to watch or do something, and all want has just gone. And then the thoughts of ""Is this right? Am I meant to be doing this?"" ""Am I meant to be living here?"" ""What am I doing?"" Etc, Start flooding. And it becomes all I hear. Eventually it calms down. But the overall feeling of something isn't right lingers.  And I'm not sure what to do. Or even where to start to address it. I get it everywhere. When I wake up, walk around the house, drive to work etc.

I'm often questioning if I'm even worthy of the activities or food I'm about to have or do. Weather I'm worth the house I'm living in, the possessions I have. Weather the job I've been in for 10 years is all a lie. The partner I'm with is a lie. And that tomorrow, I'll wake up and this will all just just vanish. And I'll be back at some other house in a different life or lifestyle."

1331,Some of my thoughts written down in time of misery.,"Hey you guys. Hope you're all doing well!

I finally got the courage to share this. This is thoughts and feelings have had as I've written them.

(apologize for possible bad grammar and such)

A veil of darkness has fallen upon. Only revealing the guilt and pain beneath. What's hidden under the veil is forever submerged within. Even when the sun shines the beams of light will never touch the shadows of sorrow the vail provides. If by any chance the veil would be lifted, the life it once contained would be just skin and bones. An empty shell to roam the world. Hopelessly lost in a vast landscape of emotions that cannot be named. Because the guilt and the pain, sorrow and grief if draining all life, and will do so for all eternity.

Sometimes there are explosions inside the mind. Thoughts and feelings collide and fight to submerge. Who will reveal itself is only up to the owner of the mind. If the owner is stronger or weaker than his or her natural instincts. If the weak one gives in for the war within the war will come out and bring chaos to the open. If the strong one manages to control what comes out and suppresses the other soldiers roaming inside, sooner or later the stronger owner of set mind will decline into a weaker version of the weak owner of a mind. It's not about what's submerged but how much at any given time. The steam that builds up within will increase the pressure at all times. Without proper venting the strongest of all will in the end end up weaker than the weak.

The light that shines in darkness is nothing more but a light that shines in darkness. It's lonely. It doesn't know how alone it is in a landscape of dust and eternal shadow. Even if the light is so bright it shoves the shadows away, there will be darkness left behind. Without darkness there is no light. 
The light only shines because it's lack of darkness in its spot. 
Men and women have fought the war for light and good, only to experience the driving pain of the knowledge that without the darkness the fight would never occur in the first place. As said without darkness there cannot be light. This also goes for the mind. You are only able to feel happiness because it's a lack of sadness at that given time. 
To force good upon someone who is struggling an internal war against the emptiness that sadness provides, is cruelty at its worst even if not intended so. When the struggle is real the mind always cries out for help, in different ways, but it cries out.


The wisdom learned in childhood, to not bother with what others say, is just loose words. The mind is built to listen to others, and act upon the information you have. The constant struggle of always living up to others expectations and ideals is exhausting mentally and physically. Some minds are able to filtre out useless information, but others are absorbing it like fresh oxygen. To absorb that information in those quantities is just as toxic as oxygen, too much will give you a slow and painful death, the right amount will keep you alive. 


Dark and light clouds hanging above, casting shadows as you walk. Invisible to others, blinding to you. Even shadows can be blinding for the one who doesn't know real light, or has forgotten how it is to stand in light for only a moment. Shadows follow wherever you walk, whether you are awake or dreaming. How to make the shadows smaller or disappear completely is only up to you, but without any light at all the task would be impossible. Said light does not have to be of your origin, but rather from love by someone else. Just a tiny glimpse of light might be enough to keep the shadows at bay for just long enough to let you sleep, rest and be ready to fight. Light brings life no matter how much it is. But shadows and darkness will devour your mind and destroy what makes you you if you don't stand up against it before it grows too big. Sometimes it sneaks up behind you, while you keep looking at the light. When everything behind you is embraced by darkness, it snatches the light right out of your sight and you're left alone for all eternity. Unless. 


Within the mind there are steep cliffs and tall grounds. Sometimes you find yourself falling down into the deepest canyon. It feels like you're never going to hit the bottom. But then, you land upon the tallest mountain, and the sky is clear and blue. It doesn't take more than a minute for you to slip and fall so hard and so fast that you want to crash land the bottom like a bag of flour. And it's at this point you should try and grab the branches pointing out from the walls of the cliff from where you are falling. By grabbing a branch the fall slows down and you are able to grab more and more branches until you just float in the air, not falling, not ascending. 


Death. Death is nothing to fear. The things that are feared about death aren't the death itself, but rather the consequences of death. The pain that follows, not for yourself, but for the ones you love. If you're religious you might fear going to hell or not. 
In torture its not the pain that breaks you, but the fear of it, or the fear of more pain.
I see death as an ending of suffering and pain. A final closing of my eyes. Death is only painful for those left behind. 
Before we're born we don't exist, then we're born only to struggle not to exist again. Humans are strange. We build huge holes in the ground and fill it with liquid we cannot survive in, and spend long periods of time in it trying not to drown. 
Even though it's hard to find joy and happiness in daily life, I'd try to make others feel it. When I die, I'm donating my organs so that maybe a stranger can enjoy life. I'm not going to take up space in a cemetery that potentially could be a field used for growing food. I'm going to be burned, put in an urn, misplaced and forgotten. Because 99% of all those who have ever existed will never be remembered after their death. So it is with me. 
I do not fear death. I can't see why I should be afraid as I see it as a relief. 

Throughout history, probably from the very beginning of what we call society man and women has fought over themselves. Fought an inner battle. To look the best in front of others. Putting on masks. Those masks have over this long period of time started to destroy us as a mentally stable race. With each masl we put on, we stray further away from our real selves. 
You have different masks for different settings. You behave differently in front of a neighbor or your own child, your coworkers or your parents the list goes on. In so many settings there is impossible to show the real you, taking off all the masks at once, revealing you! I truly wish it would be acceptable to do so. But i'm afraid society has gone too far. We no longer accept each other for who we are, we don't accept ourselves. This is a self-destructive weapon we most likely cannot stop. 
Some people manage to release themselves from this masked slavery, but then again they often are looked down upon for being different. 
Some masks we need, many we do not really need. The fact that we use all these masks to hide ourselves is ruining us mentally. We become so insecure on ourselves, so afraid of others feelings or meanings we totally forget who we really are. 
If we go so far as never taking off our masks we will eventually forget everything thats important to us. 
When you get home you take off your jacket, take off your shoes and your masks, all of them. That's how it should be. You should be able to be yourself when you get home. The sad story is that many cannot do so in the fear of being judged at home, by someone they love. And being judged by someone you love is possibly much worse than beings judged by people you don't know and probably never will meet or see again. 
The masks need to be filtered down to an absolute minimum for us to thrive once again. 


I feel worthless. I feel like i dont matter, I know I matter to some people. But i still feel worthless. 
I want to feel wanted, I crave to feel loved. I'm so tired of being alone. I'm not alone, but i feel so lonely. 
Some days, weeks, I can't seem to find joy in any place. I find things I know I find funny, but it doesn't hit me at all. 
Is there any point of continuing? Why should there be, there is no light at the end of my path. This is a short note, because i can't find the right words to express my feelings but simple words, like worthless, sad, angry etc. Nothing more to describe my feelings. Certain times I just wish I was brave enough to do the final jump.

1332,Struggling and need advice,"For some background, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Deppressive Disorder about 4 years ago. I've been in and out of therapy since and was put on an SSRI 2 years ago, which has helped some.

Across the last 6 months I've been declining. My thoughts and emotions feel completely out of my control and can change from hour to hour. At first I thought maby it was just stress related, but it has gotten to the point were I'm unable to manage normal life. The smallest things can see me off, and in the moment I feel like there is no other option, but later on I regret how I acted. 

I'm seeing a therapist but she has told me to just wait and see if this passes and keep taking my meds. I feel like something is really wrong with me, but I want her to be right.  Should I get a second opinion from a different doctor? Am I over reacting and just need to wait things out? Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

 I sent her a horrible message to her about how she was narcissistic (she may have a good few traits but its more of an esteem issue with her) and that she needed help... i then proceeded to get extremely drunk later that night and facebook messaged her freind to tell her to stay away from her. What i was thinking i dont really know because I'm generally a kind and compassionate person. 

Ive been absolutely devastated with myself about it all. Im crying my eyes out now as i write this. Ive done everthing I can to apologise to her and wish her well... probably too much now to the point she's accused me of stalking her. Thats not my intention but i completely understand why she doesnt want to speak to me so ive left her be.

The last message i sent explaining I understood about why she ended the relationship. I just wanted to cultivate understanding with her but again.. shes mad and understandably so. 

She passed her phone to her freind to message back, dont know who... but it read along the lines of... 

this xxxxxx freind. Can you not get a hint etc youre stalking her, if you come anywhere close to xxxxx im going to punch you in your mouth. What youve been doing is beyond weird. You dont treat a woman like that.. have some self respect. 

Again, i can understand why she doesnt want to talk to me and that her freind is trying to protect her. It just fucking hurts to the point that its making me have suicidal thoughts. Im constantly playing that message back in my head. On top of the pain of losing her... its eating me alive. 

It hurst that bad to think that she believes im of some kind of real threat to her.... i would of thought she knew me better despite my ridiculous drunken behaviour. 

Sorry its long winded but I just cant get my head around all of this. I feel like im in a dream 24 hours of the day."
1335,My life. Or parts of it.,"It's hard for me to talk about it, but I think I need the resonance of strangers, because through friends I always get the feeling that they are just saying it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Phew, where do I start? 

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my life I have to suppress and repress my emotions, my wishes and needs.

&amp;#x200B;

In my childhood, I only noticed how my parents fought. There was never any affection between them and there was always a tense atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

It was not unusual for them to yell at each other. One experience has left a strong impression.

&amp;#x200B;

They argued again and my father pushed my mother against the door frame and choked her. My sister was standing next to me crying and I rushed at my father and hit him to make him stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Every holiday usually ends in a fight and I actually always noticed that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was a lively child and I went out a lot, rode my bike and did other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I often had the thought of having an accident and seeing who would go to the hospital. Somehow I longed for someone to visit me. And once I was in the hospital, I was alone.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point I started to think about my life more intensely, I think it was when I was 18. I met a girl who had a hard time in her life and was sexually abused by her father, so I realized that I was not doing well and that the family I live in was not normal. Although I felt it to be normal.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, my father is always profiling himself in public and presents himself as Samarita. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I should mention that my sister has a disability. She has a cleft palate that was not diagnosed until she was 6 years old, which made it difficult or impossible for her to speak until then. And has missed a significant part of her development, which has caused her to regress. She was bullied at school and is actually even lonelier than I am, which is a burden to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made my mother move in 2011 with my sister and me. Now we are since then in an apartment that is ok, but not really great either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I have to take care of my sister all my life and be there for her because there is no one else who would do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

This burden is so overwhelming because I know that I can't do what I might want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been easiest for me the whole time not to think about it, to gamble and to repress everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

But still all this burden weighs on me and lurks behind me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a relationship for almost 5 years. When I am with her, I feel wonderful and forget all this burden. I love her. In the beginning we worked really well as a unit because we had some courses together during our studies and I went to her place afterwards. Unfortunately I live a bit further away ( 30 km ). 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning I hardly felt at home, and when I did I was working. 

With the time I noticed that I hardly have time for myself and then it developed that we saw each other less and less.  During the semester break she usually went to her parents' house, which is about 300 km away. This was okay, I could handle it. It just couldn't be any other way. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we met, she had already made friends with someone in her department. She used to spend time with him, but since this year he lives a few streets away from her and I have the feeling that he spends more time with her here than she does with me. Since we currently only see each other Friday to Saturday. I think that other things have triggered me without me realizing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to tell her that, but the first text was more than a flop, because my emotions probably made me say more things as a reproach than I wanted or than I really see. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly didn't know what I expected to hear on it. But what I heard first was perfectly ok. It was a lot and she talked to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I went for a walk and when I came back, she wrote something again and referred to her boyfriend and said that she was not with him so often and that he was always with her and that he now just lives closer.

&amp;#x200B;

That hurt, that was not at all what I wanted to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I try to say more what I think and feel, because I am not good at that and I never do. But somehow what she writes to me does not calm me down as I would like it to.  Sometimes I don't know if she understands me and it feels like she doesn't care even though I know it's not the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Logically, I can understand everything (Logical me is what leads my life most of the time, at least lately), but emotionally it feels like she doesn't want to spend time with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I somehow emotionally feel like she should want to spend every second with me. I currently feel like I long for her more than she long for me. But that is probably primarily because of the emotional journey of my feelings.  I do not know how to deal with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides my girlfriend I actually don't meet with anyone else. Because the people I could meet all live far away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe Corona is an additional problem for me and the 3 months working in my room was not the best.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more and I do not know how to deal with it. Yes I have talked to others about it. But that doesn't help at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that she has enough time for herself and that she needs time for herself. When she is with her parents she is not alone and surrounded by people all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it hurts me to hear that she needs time for herself, but then spends time with someone else just because it is more comfortable because he lives nearby?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told more times than I've been told that I should stop the relationship if it harms me. But that's just it. In principle it doesn't harm me and my girlfriend has her problems, but she only shares some of them because she thinks it's nobody's business. ( Probably she doesn't want to be vulnerable, which she would be if she talks about it)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to throw away 5 years in which I also had my faults, that I didn't talk and never said anything that might bother me. I have tried and still try to please everybody and everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

A good example:

I am thirsty when I am a guest of someone, this person offers me something to drink and I refuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

This applies to everything and is deeply rooted in me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm someone who is also very rule-bound and I sometimes make rules and pretend to do what's right and what's wrong, and I stick to them excessively. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example when it comes to sex. An ex-girlfriend once gave me the feeling that oral intercourse is not an accomplishment for the woman and more of an imposed abomination that only benefits the man. Since then I find oral sex with me very difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels good, but I have the feeling that I'm forcing the other person. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes feel that I feel ashamed to do something sexually. It feels very tense on my side and very difficult. I could also not really name what I would like and what I would not like.

&amp;#x200B;

It's these inner blockages that are there, that can't be named and that determine my life. I usually don't feel that I have any real control over my life, it feels like blinking and another 5 months are over.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I don't really know myself and that scares me because if I don't know myself, how can my girlfriend know me and if I find myself then she will still want me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to lose this person, because despite the fact that she unintentionally hurts me, she does me a lot of good and gives me exactly that, because the time I spend with her is really wonderful and makes me feel that everything else is not important. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mhh.... Maybe I should also mention that I am afraid that my mother has a tumor or ulcer on her spine. And she does not want to operate on it because it is on the spine. But now I see it again and again and it scares me. And it weighs on me because I know how much will weigh on me once she is no longer there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the feeling not to be able to lead my life the way I want to. 

I think to compensate for this I have overcharged my credit card so much that I am 5000€ in debt, that is not the world. A lot of money. But nothing that one could not manage. It still gnaws at me, especially because I had already paid it down to less than 1000€ and then I don't know what I bought that it is gone. Something to distract me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

vllt. it is also simple that I am despite the fact that I surround myself with people virtually, in the end alone and it hurts me."
1336,I seem to have a lot of “negative symptoms”,"Lack of motivation, confidence, self esteem, being quiet, isolating myself, discipline, not much emotion, apathy.

Why is this?

I have bipolar because of previous manic episodes but I was never told I had depression or anything. I’m always questioning myself and I don’t know if I have anything to worry about. Despite this I am high functioning and I have a lot going for me. Still I feel this constant need to improve. I beat myself up about the things I listed. Any help would be appreciated"
1337,How do I stop depression from ruining my friendships?,"So I've had a lot going on in the past that has left me with lots of mental health issues and a few chronic illnesses. I dont really want to go into the details, but let's just say that when I turned 18 I collapsed and got really ill as a result of years worth of mental trauma. Over the next few months I kind of lost parts of myself and eventually lost touch with my friends because I wasnt the same person anymore and had spent so much time bedbound that I missed out. I dont blame them but also I expected them to stand by me and when they didnt it really made me lose faith in friendships pretty much. 

Anyway, fast forward a few years and I'm now in a committed relationship and have a new life of my own. I'm slowly learning to deal with my illnesses and little by little I am starting to become a whole person again. This is very much my partner's influence, and I am eternally grateful. 

After lockdown lifted, I made friends with a lovely girl who lives across the road, and we get on really well. We are like peas in a pod and I know she has also had a rough past so we kind of get each other, if you know what I mean. Anyway, this last few weeks my mental health has taken a massive dip, and I'm back to being stuck in my head again. I still see my friend most evenings and we will hang out for a few hours with our partners and smoke a spliff or two, but im really struggling to keep a conversation going and I'm worried she will think I'm boring or annoying like my old friends did. 

Basically what I want to know is what do I say when I am stuck in my head thinking of something to say but I literally cant think of anything because I'm boring and dull and I've spent all day in bed? What do normal friends say to each other? How do you start a conversation?  It's like my mind just goes blank and all I can think about is how I'm a shit friend. 

Sorry for starting to ramble, my head is all over the place. This post probably doesnt make much sense to be honest but yeah. I could do with some advice. Thanks for reading my shitshow :)"
1338,I have mental illness because of my narcissistic/racist father,"I'm currently in treatment for my mental illness after year of family abuse from my racist father who terrorize my family

I'm also been a victim of crime and robbery and the criminal were black and brown people and when i saw the legal system give these people a slap on the wrist 'is infuriated me"" and is just creates a issue within my personality and is got worst and worst and one day i just snap over a dispute return and is was not pretty 

I beraid this black woman manager and say every single word in the book from attack her ethnicity to just tearing her down to meaningless and once is was over i gather my thing and just left ""like nothing happened"" 

after that incident i felt joy and accomplishment of what happen and is got more worst after that whenever i see a black or brown people i will say under my breath what i truly think of them in public however at home i will act normal however if something snap in me i will become very vocal

so far I been diagnosed with ptsd,family trauma,mood swing and psychotic disorders and this is my 3 mental health assistance"
1339,Is there a way to stop crying in school?,"My therapist last week Tuesday believes I have depression and ADHD, this Thursday I will get diagnosed. For the past few weeks I have cried almost every day in class. Luckily I am in online school and I can mute and turn off my camera. I am scared to go back to school in this state and I want to know of a way to not cry at least during school."
1340,Inpatient psychiatric care during Covid?,"For the past couple of months I've been in a headspace where I am seriously considering going to the ER for my mental illness. My symptoms and life circumstances are becoming so overwhelming that I don't want to reach a point where I do anything rash. My problem becomes that because of Covid and my own health condition that puts me at risk, I'm terrified to be admitted due to being in a hospital environment. I don't want to risk catching it and I also don't want to potentially bring it back to my family. The uncertainty makes it hard to make the right decision. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place...   


Has anyone that has been treated inpatient for psychiatric care willing to share what the process was like? Either before or during the pandemic? I'm in the United States."
1341,I walk away from most human interaction dissatisfied.,"(27M) This feeling has really been on the rise lately, but it has always been there in some form. I'm rarely satisfied with how I interact with people on a daily basis. I usually walk away from a conversation feeling deflated and like my stock with that person just went down.

The majority of these situations come from the work place, where it just seems like no one likes me. I feel like a total black sheep. It seems like a chore for people to tell me good morning. This feeling has really been spiraling lately and is creeping into depression.

I wouldn't consider myself shy, but I am certainly reserved and introverted. Even when I attempt to join in on a conversation it seems like someone speaks over me or everyone is waiting for the miserable words to dribble out of my mouth so they can continue their conversation.

The most frustrating part is not knowing if these observations are valid or if I am projecting them or some combination. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and i know i can over think things, but it seems impossible to see it from the outside.

I'm really just venting, but any advice is welcome. Other than feeling completely incompetent in social situations I have a pretty great life, a loving fiance &amp; family, a good group of friends. This feeling has really just intensified the last 6 months or so and been a real storm cloud over my head."
1342,Why do I keep having epiphanies all the time?,"I don't know but I always wanted to know why all of a sudden I start to have a crisis for a minute or two like my world's about to end? At times things seem normal but if they are not, I feel like _ending it all_. Is that normal?

Talking about epiphanies, it's more like ""Heyy, you didn't do what you were supposed to do, now feel the pain cuz time's running out or just end your life."" Is this a gentle reminder for what is needed to be done or is it just a normal thing?"
1343,I don’t know what to do,I’m 18 years old and I just don’t enjoy being awake anymore. I can’t do any work in school(diagnosed with ADHD less than a week ago) and I’m terrified that I’ll never be able to be a functioning member of society. I have crazy mood swings and don’t know if I’ll ever be able to sustain a relationship outside of my family. I’ve been having crazy panic/anxiety attacks over the future and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel like I’m a worthless disappointment and  make everything harder. I feel like everyone would be better off without me.
1344,How do I tell my parents I want therapy?,"So I'm not entirely sure what's wrong with me and I can't really pinpoint the way I feel, but I'm pretty sure my mental state isn't good and hasn't been good for a long time. I mean, diagnosing myself wouldnt be a good idea anyways. I recently graduated and am going to Univerisity soon but at the moment I still live at home and will continue to do so for a couple of months probably. The cost wouldn't be much of a problem because where I live it's covered under our insurance. The problem I have is that I don't want them to get involved. I don't want to talk to them about my problems in depth because they would start treating me like a sick child and probably give me even less independence. Also they'd likely try to help me in some way, but as I know them, that ""way"" would be very suffocating. At the same time they wouldn't accept me rejecting their help because to them it would be a sign that I'm doing even worse. I don't want them to treat me any different. I'm a liner and I need my space and independence. I know that I probably sound very ungrateful so I just want to say: I love my parents. They just have a tendency to be too invasive.
Currently I'm considering to wait with getting therapy until I finally move out, but that will probably take longer than expected due to covid. 
What can I do."
1345,Dealing with Depression,"I have been dealing with depression for a while now and it doesn't feel like anything is getting better.I just feel like a hollow body with no soul. Nothing feels good or entertaining or fulfilling. It's just a constant state of nothingness. Everything I do, speak or feel,seems superficial. Due to other medical problems I can't take anti-depressants and I have tried almost everything I can to get over this. Everything is so draining and I feel like I am just  pretending to 'live' everyday. I am not suicidal, just really really tired and frustrated. I want this to end and have my life back. Any help is really appreciated."
1346,Group therapy,"Hi, I was hoping if someone could help me. I'm trying to find group therapy/support for anxiety/depression in the UK. Apparently the NHS do this but I can't find anything online. Could anyone direct me to a verified website who do group ones? Thanks."

FREE 4 day Master Class Healing from sexual trauma.

Healing from sexual abuse is one of the most empowering and freeing things I’ve dedicated my time and energy to. I know that ass women we want to be honoured, we want to feel beautiful, empowered, supported, celebrated and whole. What I want is to help you find your way back to that version of yourself.

I used to be SO afraid, and sometimes I still am, to speak up about my childhood abuse, to share openly about the confusion and complex emotional landscape I had to navigate because of the experience.

This fear kept me small. It kept me hidden. It kept me from sharing the depth of knowledge and wisdom I have about healing from trauma, coming to terms with wrongs done to us, forgiveness, trust, boundaries, security, love... So I want to say it out loud for all to hear:

📣 YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE DEFINED BY THIS EXPERIENCE 📣

But today I am. I’ve got things to say and teach. I’ve got a message of hope to deliver. I’ve got encouragement, support, kindness and generosity and I need to spread it.

For most of us who’ve had this experience we’ve been too ashamed to even open our mouths and say, it happened to me too. We don’t believe our pain and fear is valid. We believe that on some level we must have been unworthy and lesser than for something like this to have happened to us. We believe we have no right to want more from life because we’ve been stained. We believe a lie. We are destined for more. We can rise. We can heal. We can love and trust and have JOY again.

We are whole and beautiful. We are strong and courageous and wonderful and we deserve to be celebrated.

I’ve created something incredibly beautiful and wonderful to support us all (yes myself included) to heal and reconnect with our wonderful selves.

The Generous Space.

https://www.insideoutleaders.org/thegenerousspace

What I’ve found along my healing journey is that I needed a space to process my pain and fear. I needed people I could talk to. I needed people who understood what was going on, people who could help me find the language to describe my experience and then come to terms with it.

I didn’t not want to be so afraid of what this meant about me that I never did anything about it. I wanted to take my power back. To reclaim my joy, self-trust and empowerment. And I wanted a space that felt generous. I wanted a space felt like receiving a warm hug and a cup of tea and a break from the world and fresh air and a gorgeous view all at the same time. I wanted to feel that it was ok to say that I was both angry and grateful. Angry because “why?!?” And grateful because I’ve been able to learn things about the depth of courage and strength that have given me such a boost in other areas of my life.

I’d love to invite any and all women who have had sexual abuse experiences of their own, who want what I want, a generous space. I’m hosting a FREE 4 day Master Class Series 26-29 Oct with all the goods described above. I’d love for you to join me and other incredible women as we gather to support and heal and celebrate ourselves.

1348,I need help,"Everytime I talk about it I feel like a burden. Something is not right and I can’t focus on anything. I lie to everyone because I know if I say something it will hurt them. I don’t want to put that stress on anyone, but it is so hard to do this. I want to tell someone so bad. I just don’t want them to be hurt. I’m sorry for ranting/posting a lot. I can’t go to theraby. I’m still covered under my parents and I don’t want them to know. I am several hundred miles away in college and I can’t do that to them. It hurts so much and I just want it to stop. I am so trapped. I am empty and want to cry, but I have no one to cry to. I’m sorry I ramble to much. I post to much. Everyone must be sick of this. I’m sorry."
1349,My brain is paralyzing me and I don't know what to do,"I feel depressed, anxious, and paralyzed to my couch. The idea of literally doing anything makes my body feel like it's made out of lead. Even getting up to get more water seems like the biggest challenge, right now, and I'm thirsty. I know thirst will win eventually, but I know that's just bare minimum living. I feel so ashamed and shitty about myself. People are actually just out there doing things, and I'm stuck on the couch hoping I don't have to pee any time soon. 

What do I do? I feel so useless and worthless and the more I sit here, the worse I feel about myself.. and then I feel like an asshole for feeling bad about myself when I'm just feeling bad that I can't do normal human things... but getting up and doing anything doesn't seem like a real option or I feel like I'll be bad at it... I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself properly here... 

Is there a simpler explanation to this? What do I do when this happens?"

 You are loved. You are precious. You are well kept. Loving yourself more this time doesn’t mean that you are selfish. You are just more aware. Self awareness is so much different from selfishness. Please don’t feel guilty. It’s okay that this time you are more aware of your worth as a woman. You understand better the kind of love you deserve. That’s why you don’t settle. That’s why you stop chasing other people’s approval and stop begging other people’s attention. You are just beautiful for who you are.

1352,"As a counseling student, I have learned a lot about self-limiting beliefs. I wanted to share some strategies to stop them in their tracks!","Hey everyone! Ive run into this problem of limiting my progress in life just by the voice in my head. Now as a clinical counseling student, I have the resources to learn more about this. I just wanted to share some of the strategies that Ive learned about overcoming self-limiting beliefs. 

1. Develop positive, healthy, and uncomfortable habits to be done as soon as the voice starts speaking. Use these habits to contribute to your goals! This teaches you to discredit that voice and constantly choose the right thing to do.
2. Start stating things you are grateful for. Gratitude literally forces the mind to think positively. It switches off a lot of stress hormonal centers. 
3. Acknowledge the emotion behind the voice. Emotions are a sign! If you read the sign and move forward more effectively, the voice will have no feeling to use against you!

Is this what anxiety is? It feels more physical than mental unlike depression. I’ve just been so stressed and it’s a similar feeling to having been awake for 30 hours(my record) except when I do that it’s my brain and my eyes at ache and feel toxicity.

1355,"Acceptable to pursue a career in mental health, while having mental health issues","Curious if people have any thoughts on this. 

I have always had a strong interest in psychology, training, and helping people. I've never really studied it other than reading books about self-help ranging from pop psychology to some written by real psychologists. I also once took one of those free online psychology classes.

I'm currently in a bit of a rut in my career. I don't feel fulfilled or connected to a purpose with what I'm doing and thinking of things I could be doing instead.

I am currently also working through my own issues with depression and self esteem. Researching current methods of CBT and how different therapists approach working with clients has made me consider whether I should become a counselor. I know it would require going back to grad school and would be multiple years of commitment.

Since I do have some issues of my own that I'm dealing with, is it advised against to pursue this? 

Are there smaller steps I could take to validate that this is a path I should follow, before committing a lot of time and money?"
1356,"I have a very hard time concentrating, and often go on autopilot. Do you know what it is?","So I very often stop paying attention to things, while my mind thinks about something else.

Sometimes I am mildly aware of what's happening around me, some other times i literally dissociate. Every time this happens though, my mind goes as if on autopilot, and so whether it be me nodding as someone talks to me or even doing an action on autopilot, it happens. I really don't know what this is. Is this ADD, autism, a dissociative disorder or something else?"

1359,i think i’ve made it to a low point,"yeah i don’t really know what to do 

i think the last time i felt this insecure, sad, and anxious was freshman year of high school, and even then it wasn’t this bad 

i just hate myself"
1360,Depressed and on edge,"I’ve been dealing with a few chronic diseases for the last few years that went undiagnosed/misdiagnosed for majority of that that time, which left me no choice but to try to figure things out for myself, I tried everything, intermittent fasting, diet changes, exercise, praying, meditation, lost 25 pounds, cut out negative influences and habits out of my life yet I’m still dealing with multiple health problems. While this is going on, I feel the pressure of getting my work life rolling and more in order and thoughts of what I could be or how successful I could be without having to deal with my illness make things extremely heavy on me at times. I’m also living with a family member who, throughout my life has been a profoundly negative influence on my life. My strategy was to avoid this person and try to distance myself to avoid having to deal with unnecessary problems, which led this person to other more subtle forms of attack, i.e talking about me and what I’ve accomplished while I’m somewhere close by (without mentioning my name), never acknowledging the illness I’ve been dealing with on my own etc. For the last year or so I’ve dealt with it, even got to a good place but lately this depressive feeling has come back and has been really heavy on me, to the point where for the first time in my life I Googled suicide hotline, but never went through with the call. I don’t know who to talk to, I don’t want anyone to pity me because I’m aware many people are dealing with things but are able to move forward with their lives. I’m just writing this to get it out of my system, even if no one reads this. But if you read everything I wrote thank you. Don’t really know what else to say."
1361,Nothing feels fun anymore and I don't know what to do.,"**Tl;dr (but I definitely recommend you read this post in its entirety): Nothing feels fun anymore. Probably because of stress, but even when I am done with obligations, I don't enjoy doing anything that makes me relaxed and I still feel stressed out.**

Absolutely nothing is fun anymore. I used to play a couple of games, but they've become completely obsolete. I can't even sit at my computer and just relax, watching YouTube and whatnot. Nothing is fun and nothing gives me leisure. Writing is another hobby I have little to no motivation left to do. Zero motivation to go the gym like I normally do.

It coincided with me getting busier and busier with university and struggling immensely to find an internship (mandatory for my university programme), finding out my grandpa had a blood cloth in his brain (he's fine now), stressing to get my driver's license (required for the internship in march), on top of dealing with an obnoxious teacher this evening as the nail in the coffin.

I have plenty of friends so loneliness is definitely not the problem. I have no clue what's wrong."
1362,How do I cope with health anxiety and the covid crisis?,"I used to have huge health anxiety, it‘s been a lot better for a while now, but I‘m really starting to feel the psychological effects of this pandemic..

I commute by train for a total of 3 hours daily, knowing  how unsafe oublic transportation is right now and I cannot escape this is hitting me hard. We already had 2 positive cases at my workplace, too.

Ever since I was quarantined last week (tested negative, fortunately), I have constant anxiety and worries, just had a panic attack (didnt have one for months). This situation isn‘t going away for a long time, not knowing when it will hit me or the ones I love is eating me alive.. How do you guys cope?"
1363,Is it paranoia?,"Hello im 14 id like to get someone else's opinion on this I have not told my parents nor any other people in my life, I think I have social anxiety I get ""symptoms"" like sweating, my head starts itching idk if that's like a nervous tick but thats not the main point of this I told my parents about social anxiety but not the rest, id like to know if the things I list are Social anxiety or some sort of paranoia or anything else that I may not know of

1. When I think of something I have to do something about it, like when I'm going to sleep ill think of some random thing and it will be on my mind till I search it up.

2. I think I only have friends because they pity me, I'm not some cool person im fat, lazy, unmotivated to do pretty much anything, self conscious, when I do do things like trying something new ill give up easy, but back to the main point, I have some online friends I play with, but one day for some unknown reason I started to wonder if they were only friends with me out of pity, idk why I just was thinking about it, I almost cut all ties with them deleating my socials that they new me on luckly I didn't.


Thats all I can really think of, if I can get someone else's opinion that would be great, if you want to know anything else just ask."
1364,Why do I feel like I'm not good at anything? (16m),"I feel like I'm not good at anything, everything I've tried to get good at just didn't work, it doesn't matter how hard I try, how passionate I am, I am not good at it. It feels like everyone I know has something they are good at and I don't"
1365,Should I get checked?,"I am in a current journey of learning how to deal with mental health in general. I was part of the generation who used OCD, anxiety, and depression with no care as to what it entails. Growing up and getting more education, I am more cautious and aware when describing feelings (it is a journey, so forgive me if I sound a little misinformed with what I’m about to say). With that comes learning signs that could be related to mental health issues.

Professionals are quite expensive where I live and I often think that what I’m going through might just be phases. I do have the tendency to hold things in and brush it off; rationalizing to the best of my abilities. But, a part of me is wondering, off the bat, if these things are normal to feel or if I should be taking things more seriously and consult a professional:

• I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety but I do know that I get breathy and sweaty when certain situations happen; I tend to think worst case scenario before even dealing with the situation
• Feeling like everyone is testing me (i.e. in a somewhat normal setting, I’ll suddenly think, “what if this is a test”)
• Prideful to the point that when things don’t go my way, I’d feel so ashamed to verbalize what happened or just drop it 
• Thinking everyone hates for small mistakes that might not have even mattered to other people
• Feeling judged and watched, but then I also love being the center of attention— wouldn’t be spiteful though if it wasn’t on me
• Easily being put-off by what people say and how they say it— if I feel a slight change of tone, I get uneasy

I know I can’t really rely on what I’ll get here but I’d love to know if these are just normal things or symptoms that should be addressed with a professional. I don’t feel these everyday but when I do, I feel really down and I tend to disocciate."
1366,Sertraline question,"I dont know if anyone can help, i usually take 200mg of Sertraline daily. I went on holiday and forgot to pack it, my doctors is terrible at getting back to me and i dont know what to do. I have been off my antidepressants for 2 weeks now, should i go straight back to 200mg? Any advice would be appreciated."
1367,Always over-analyzing things in my mind!,Im always over-analyzing things and overthinking. My mind is continuously on a run. It just never stops making scenarios or I should say worst scenarios of a comdition which makes me anxious. I dont wanna do anything at that time. It drains my energy completely. Earlier I might be over thinking but these days Im over thinking and over analyzing everything. It never happened before like this. I just wanna lay down on bed and do nothing. I have to study for my upcoming exams. But this anxiety wont let me do anything. It will be there till that condition is solved. I have tried everything to distract my mind. But nothing seems to help. Anyone who can help me woth getting around this anxiety. It will be of great great help. Im just tired of this thing now!
1368,"Feeling numb, depressed, with no joy","I feel I don't have a life purpose anymore, I feel most of the times numb, with no real joy. Feeling I'm faking a lot when I smile, I'm trying to make my husband happy, but I feel I don't have energy, feeling I just want to be let down doing nothing. I have had experience depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a kid. And it comes and goes, I just need a bit of support or any advice if you have had experience this before and how did you manage to get through it. Thanks you"
1369,"I(13F) cry multiple times a day, is this a sign of a mental illness or am I worrying too much and its a normal thing?","I cry at least 5 times per day, I cry if someone insults me, criticises me, if I mess up in any way, and if I make any mistake. I don't know if it's normal to cry this often.

google told me that crying once a day was a sign of depression but I still want to do activities, and I'm not constantly exhausted which makes me think that I don't have depression but I have no clue about anything to do with mental illness. I've never spoken about it with anybody in fear that they worry about me, the last thing I want is for people to worry about me, and my entire family cares so I cant show signs of extreme sadness in front of them otherwise they will get extremely overprotective

Thanks for reading!"
1371,am i too available for people?,"Writing this because i need to know it from someone else's perspective and i don't really have anyone i can share things like this with.
things like these happen a lot with me and I always been either ""push people away because no one cares"" or ""let them use me or manipulate me because I'm probably thinking too much""

I'll share what happened just right now to try to explain a bit:
there's this friend i talk with sometime and we vibe good, our interests match and all, but just three days back, i told her I'm having a lot of anxiety and I'm not doing well, and i have also cut off from social media because I'm just not feeling right to deal with anything or talk with anyone but i did want to talk it out with someone but I didn't show, to her or anyone.. but it was something i do when they tell me they're upset, i try to talk with them or help them in any way i can.. but she just said it's ok, she understands.. and after a while she sent me an audio that she'll talk with me the next day she was busy at the time. i was okay with it, we're all busy in our lives, i get that. 

3-4 days passed but i didn't receive anything from her, except today i saw another audio text, i thought it's because she forgot again, but it was because she needed me to speak with her. it was about a guy friend. she was mad at him and was hurt. i spoke with her and calmed her down. 
but later it got me thinking, if I'm being too much available for everyone? it's not about me being there for her while she was not. it's about why do i leave everything I'm doing, and forget about my own mental health and I'm ready to give my time to anyone who needs me? I'm having bad anxiety lately about stuff and I've cut off from everything, my mind's shutting down and I'm having panic attacks again lately, i used to have them before in last dec-Jan because of some serious stuff going on, it got better and now it's coming again.

I should mention that, me being there for people is not dependent on them being there for me. I don't think that way. The only thing that's bothering me is the possibility of me being wrong here? Or Am i taking my own health and peace lightly? 

I just need to know when to draw a line, should we take it as a sign when people don't care about how we're doing emotionally?"
1372,I just need someone to talk too,Ky lifes just going downhill
1373,Being honest to myself,"I’m at a point in life where I don’t trust my thoughts anymore. Nothing feels real to me anymore and I just feel stuck in an endless loop of nothingness. 

My whole life I’ve never been able to find an identity for myself. I mold how I act around people based on how they act. When peers are talking about a musician I’ve never heard of or movie, I’ll lie and say I know about it. I keep doing this because I don’t know what i have in common with the rest of the world. 

I have zero sense of self worth, I feel my words and actions are so insignificant. I ask myself what’s the point in trying? I literally don’t know who I am. I don’t know what I actually like. I watch news and follow politics but no one my age is doing that (in high school). I just don’t know. 

I’ve never felt accomplished in my life. I’ve felt like everything I have earned has just been some sort of mistake or error. Even my grades in school years before the pandemic, I would not trust them. 
My self esteem is zero. If you presented me with a difficult task that I could do I’d say no because I don’t trust I’d do the best job. 

I’ve always had these issues where I become hyper-aware of basic bodily functions where I suddenly gain control whether it’s my blinking or breathing or swallowing. 
I can end up in a state where I’m only focusing on my tongue and where to put it in my mouth. It’s horrible. Or I’ll become extremely obsessed with one specific game or topic and it’ll become the only thing I care about. 

I feel like I can’t communicate with my peers, and that my style of English is something completely different compared to most in my generation (gen z). I just feel disconnected from everyone and everything. 

Ik people have it worse than me. I’m sorry for posting"
1374,I don’t want to go to therapy,"I have a personality disorder, and it affects me greatly every day but I don’t want to go to therapy.
Why do I want to go to therapy to deal with same issue I’m struggling with? The therapist won’t care about me, only making money off of how vulnerable I am. Even if they saw I was on my last straw and I cancelled therapy, they’re not going to reach out again anyways. I get they have to make money, but it feels like I’m paying for a fake listener. It would make me more upset just being there."
1375,i think i’ve made it to a low point,"yeah i don’t really know what to do 

the last time i felt this insecure, sad, and anxious was freshman year of high school, and even then it wasn’t this bad 

i just hate myself. i hate the way i look, i hate how awkward i am and how i panic when talking to people, i hate how unmotivated i’ve become, i hate how intensely i overthink every single little detail and make myself panic over a problem that doesn’t even exist or has existed in the past, i hate how i don’t look like her, and ugh

i don’t want to deal with any of this anymore - i’m done fighting anxiety and depression and eating disorders and it’s so overwhelming

i’ve just begun hating everyone and everything"
1376,A little vent.,"Sometimes my parents make me feel like I am over exaggerating the problem in my head. I (20F) Still live at home and I work 5 days a week,minimum wage. Today before work I wanted to get a good amount of sleep because I knew I had things to do before I went in and knowing I get off at 10:30pm I knew I needed the energy but my mom was yelling at me to clean and my dad was too saying that I’d have to find my own way to work because I wasn’t awake at 7am cleaning.

Yes my parents take me to work.when I first got my job I told them I would need to learn how to drive and my mom laughed at me. 

Anyways my mom doesn’t care if I am working a 8hr shift and get off at 10:30 I can still come home and she will be yelling at me to clean because “I don’t do anything in this house” honestly I am always at work I come home take some time to myself shower eat relax and sleep for work the next day. 

My mom is a nurse who is on unemployment right now because she doesn’t want to work during coronavirus 
So she stays home all day. She often makes fun of me for working where I do and says things like “why do you need sleep you don’t need your brain for your job” or “you’ll never make as much money as I do” 
It can get really tiring hearing these things constantly or trying to sleep everyday just to be yelled at in the morning for sleeping too much for work. She also tells me to move out a lot “if you’re not doing anything move out or pay rent” “you’re lucky I let you live here rent free” I understand I am lucky to live here rent free but it is so mentally exhausting living here and honestly these are the bare minimum of things they have said to me. 

It’s such a mentally exhausting thing being around these people being cussed at told I’m never doing enough called a bitch for speaking my mind and made fun of for things I think I’m doing okay in life. Sometimes my mom gets mad and says “THEN DONT EAT OUR FOOD” and tbh I have even started to feel bad or embarrassed when I go in the kitchen to eat so I have been ordering myself food :/ 

I guess I just had to vent I know this seems like somethings minor I shouldn’t be upset about because I am an adult and need to take control of my own life but man life is hard I am trying my best."
1377,"Is there anyway to combat BPD, PTSD and Split personality disorders without medication?","27f. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Depression, PTSD and split personality disorder (borderline) over the years. These things dont flair up super often, in my own biased opinion, but often enough for me to seek help.

Now, my doctors have told me that my PTSD and split personality/disassociation(?) is directly linked to eachother. Which would make a lot of sense. My sister, my 2 bestfriends and my cousin all passed away in horrible circumstances within 2 years of eachother. I now cant get behind the wheel of a car without immediately going into a panic attack and having tunnel vision and I also suffer from pretty severe panic attacks around bed time as well (thinking my kids are going to die in their sleep). So, I barely sleep as a result because I'm up all hours of the night worrying and checking on them. My oldest is 9 so this has been going on for soooo long.

I've had the BPD long before any of these people passed and long before I had my own kids. This is stemmed from an abusive step father when I was around 6 years old till I was 11. I was sexually abused and my brother was physically abused. My mom didnt help either because she witnessed both and still claims she doesnt remember it ever happening or tells us we are lying about it. My brother has turned to drugs as a result. I'm creeping slowly up on being borderline alcoholic, if I'm being honest with myself here.

Now apparently the only reason my doctor thinks I have some form of disassociation is because for a good majority of the time, I dont recognize what I went through as a problem, per say. Like, I can overlook it a lot and it holds no affect on me at all until all of the sudden it does. If that makes sense. Almost like I'm slapped in the face with a reality check every so often but the rest of the time I lack the ability to actually feel it. 

Now, the reason I ask if I can combat these without meds is because I have kidney disease. My body rejects 90% of the medications I have been given over the years. Whether it's an antibiotic or anything else. Morphine doesnt even really have an affect on me, just to give you an idea. I need some way to combat these issues, obviously because I have kids of my own and being angry or out of sorts all the time is so unhealthy and I simply cant be like this anymore. 

Any tips?"
1378,How do I support...?,"Hi I'm hoping for some help on how I can support some colleagues and a few friends who've opened up to me about mental health problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I find quite often people at work or friends open up to me about their mental health and difficulties, not entirely sure why because I'm quite a private person myself and don't discuss anything really about myself unless they're very close.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem for me is I'm not really good with feelings ect. (maybe a bit autistic) and I just get a bit uncomfortable when people open up about these topics and don't know what to say and often feel useless . 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to help, but I have no idea what to say and I kind of just stand there like a rabbit in headlights. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S

There problems revolve around feeling really down in dumps (but not quite depression), anxiety and depression"
1379,"I’m lost, how do I find myself again?","Or did I ever have myself ( if you get what I’m saying.) I’m up to 436 pounds, I’m literally killing myself, and today I just went in to redeem this free coupon for some eggs at this grocery store and I ended up buying some friend chicken. Idk why, well I was hungry, but I knew that wasn’t the healthiest choice for me to consume. Idk what’s wrong with me, why I’m this way, already on meds battling depression, this therapist I was seeing at this doctors office on a low income plan was no help imo, so I stopped going over a month ago. I want to stick to 1700 calories a day so I can begin to lose weight but I can’t seem to adjust to that. I pray and pray in my head hoping to meet someone who’s willing to help or assist me one my dieting, but no luck, everyone wants a dollar, and I’m out of work during this pandemic, lower back pain, can barely walk now tbh. I don’t want to die, not like this."
1380,Does anyone else feel like their childhood is being taken away,Does anyone else feel like they are losing their childhood to mental illness and find it so frustrating that you will never know what it is like to have a happy childhood that you can talk about the way your friends and parents do. I just find it so hard that I look around and see so many of my friends leading healthy happy childhoods and teenage years which are supposed to be the best times of their lives while I'm here hating every second of the same part of my life. I hate knowing that I will never get this time back and part of my childhood is being taken away by something that doesn't even feel like it's real (I of course know that it is but sometimes I feel like it's all in my head).
1381,Why do I[16m] hear a voice(sometimes voices) that constantly insult and degrade me 24/7?,I've already been diagnosed with bipoar1 so I'm prone to crazy ass manic episodes. My main problem is these fucked up voices I got. They never say anything nice or positive it's always negative. They almost drove me to suicide a few years ago by jumping off a cliff but passer-by spotted me and it was like I snapped out of whatever trance I was in. It's really freaky sometimes I hear someone calling my name even when I'm home alone. Mostly it's just one voice but when I'm nervous or in a manic episode they it turns into 3 or 4 of them. Is it possible I have some sort of schizophrenia?
1382,My first post on my anxiety attacks,"Few years ago, I had no idea that I was a constant victim of anxiety and panic attacks. I never once thought of associating myself to these terms, mostly due to the stigma which surrounded them back then. But I was aware, I needed a therapist. 

I have had countless anxiety attacks. And they literally take the living day light out of you. I forget the surrounding that I am in, feel numb and shaky. And have very difficult time taking breaths. And I cry profusely. Previously, I never recognized them, and so I let go. But recently, I broke down at work. And that was a complete no-no. I couldn't stand on my two feet. Luckily my senior was a kind human being and brought me a glass of water and told me so many encouraging words who I would later find out from my therapist as the real saviour. He didn't need to do it. But he did it anyways. And ever since then, I have been so aware of these attacks, and I have a feeling they started showing up less after that.

All those who are suffering from anxiety, you are not alone. Hang it there buddy! Always ask for help."
1383,"I've been hearing these voices inside my head, I think I've always heard them I dont know, I dissociate a lot. But lately they have been very loud and very angry","I dont wanna go into too many details, I'm very self conscious. At the start of this year I was diagnosed with bpd ocd and cptsd. I like in the UK and im on a waiting list for therapy but other than that I receive no help bar meds I dont take, so I dont know if maybe this is just just syptoms of them, but from what I've read I dont think it is. 

I hear voices internally, they're inside my head not outside. But its not my voice and its not just me. Some of the voices even have names, faces, bodies ect. I never mentioned this to the psychiatrist or doctor with fear of judgement. And i still kind of thought maybe it was normal and everyone was the same. But with the worry it wasn't I've never mentioned it to anyone. 

Lately they've been causing me more distress than anything though, sometimes we have a conversation about normal things, if im doing something sometimes they might egg me on, compliment me, sometimes they'll put me down, I'll argue back with them, sometimes I agree. I dont know its always been the same and what I thought was normal so I've never thought to much about it, but lately I've veen very stressed and the the voices have been very nasty every 10 minutes of the day one of them tells me to just kill myself. I dont see or hear the nicer ones anymore, I find myself wishing they would come back and the other voices basically laugh and tell me how they aint coming back.

Has anyone else with borderline every experienced something similar?
Is this something else that I should contact my doctor about. I feel like im going mad. I always thought I was a very logical smart, and although hurt, sane person. Lately I feel the exact opposite, I'm scared I dont know what to do"
1384,I just fell and almost had a panic attack,I have those moments often currently. I get irrationally anxious and almost cry. I feel like my life could fall apart any moment. At work I'm that bubbly overly nice person and the costumers like me. Sleep isn't relaxing because I'm constantly working in my dreams or I'm having nightmares. Exhausting dreams. Idk why I'm posting honestly.  Maybe someone can tell me how to fix this.
1385,Therapy work books recommendations,"Hey guys! My best friend lives in a toxic home environment with helicopter parents who control every aspect of her life. She’s 17, and after years and years of this combined with a breakup that her parents forced, she’s on the verge of a breakdown. I am not a doctor by any means, but these last two months my best friend has entered what I think is a bit of a depression. I tried to get her to do therapy, and she asked her mom, but her mom said “she doesn’t need therapy, she’s just upset over the breakup.” 

My best friend does not have access to the internet, and all of her texts are monitored by her parents. She’s a good kid who doesn’t party or do drugs or any of that, her parents are just extremely controlling. The only way I know how to help her is to give her tangible resources, since her parents won’t do anything about it. When I was in therapy, I remember sometimes seeing work books that help with things like self esteem and depression. 

So long story short, what books or tangible resources would you guys recommend?"
1386,I’m so I suffer from mental health?,"31m from California. I grew up pretty old school with 1st generation immigrant family. As far as I can remember, I’ve always been the “cranky old man” and having extremely little tolerance for people (socially) and lack of common sense. I always have to make a little comment when I see someone or even myself is doing something I would consider dumb, due to “lack of common sense”. I.e forgetting my keys or someone driving down the wrong side of the parking lot with a clear sign posted “wrong way”.

I lack empathy even when it’s clearly no ones fault. I feel that it’s difficult to keep conversations going after a simple, “hello”. Now that mental health has become less of a stigma. I have been considering going to see a therapist but growing up, this was always a sign of weakness or for people really messed up in the head. 

I don’t mind being the old lonely man living down the corner, yelling at kids to get off my lawn. But at the same time, I don’t want to be just another angry asshole.

Idk if I’m even wording this correctly but I’d like to hear what possible options I can go about to be less of an asshole. What exactly does therapy entail? I really don’t like people so I would feel it’s best to avoid group sessions. Do I have to be forced to take medication?"
1387,I feel... So out of it,"I'm a disabled college student. I want to go to graduate school one day and become a professor for CS... but all the motivation I've had for dealing with this isolation shit and still getting work done is just gone

Every time I sit down to work on something I just don't feel that spark of interest anymore. It feels like a chore. The clubs I'm a part of and help run feel like. Hired as well. Same for gaming

The only thing I have any motivation for is helping other students with concepts related to my major as I am an assistant for a class I previously took

I don't know... I just don't want to do anything. I sleep in, have trouble waking up, have trouble not justifying taking naps instead of working

The chilling part is I'm paying to take these courses. I'm the one suffering here. And yet, even though I'm really far into my major (much further than other students in my grade) the motivation is all gone

That pretty much applies to everything I do. I feel like the only reason I do anything is because others expect me to but if no one expected me to do anything... I just wouldn't do it

I'm in a loop. For a second I'll think of everything I'm giving up, everything I'll lose if I don't ALL my classes this semester, the future I'll lose... and like that, all of that motivation I just built up is completely gone and I feel so empty and pointless. And like I just don't care but internally, I know that I do"
1388,Anxious,"I have dealt with anxiety all throughout my life. (I’m 21) But after the death of my best friend, the anxiety is unbearable. My days feel so cloudy and I can’t explain it but I just feel hyper aware of every emotion I’m feeling. The anxiety is gut wrenching.

1390,Figuring out who you are?,"Hey all! I’m 26 and still figuring out who I am outside of others and my mental illness. I’m looking for tips/tricks/journal prompts/ etc. 

For most of my memorable life, I’ve cared about what others thought and would often bow down to my peers interests instead of mine. I was all about what people thought about me, and doing whatever I could to make sure they liked me, even if I wasn’t really interested. It became difficult to know what was me and what was my friends. 

It’s also hard to not self identify with my severe anxiety. Do I like or dislike something only because I’m anxious/scared?

Even now, I’m in a relationship for the first time in my life. And I think I’ve come a long ways in self discovery and growth, but sometimes I get paranoid that I’m still just being a follower of those around me. With my partner, my friends, my family, everything.

1395,Watching a best friend slip away.,"**TW: brief mentioning about suicide. mental health/depression**

Long post.

Hi there, i guess this is mostly a vent but if you want to give your two cents feel free. (i'll be using they/them pronouns to further conceal their identity)

I had a best friend since i was very young. we've had a rocky friendship in the past, which i know i can now attribute to their wavering mental health over the years. 

They've been in and out of a hospital a few times now in the past year or so. I did my best to be there for them (moreso last year than this year as my free time has grown very thin between my job, online class, and generally trying to move my life forward). 

In this time, i've made new friends, and my best friend resents me for it. my best friend actually made a suicide attempt over the summer and i drove all around the area trying to look for them. although i didn't expect a thanks, i never got one anyway. i understand at this point in time of our friendship, i cannot expect a full reciprocation of caring -- their issues arent allowing them to be a typical 'best friend' therefore our friendship has grown very one-sided. I've pulled back a lot from this friendship, i'll admit.  and they aren't afraid to tell me about how jealous they are that i'm spending time with my new friends rather than them, and when they do tell me this, i just ignore the conversation until we move on to something else like a stupid meme or something.

i've tried to invite my best friend to hangout with my new friends, but my best friend only sees this as a pity invite despite my reassurances. Its not, and never was a pity invite--i just genuinely felt that they would get along with my new friends. it confuses me as they'll sometimes make remarks like ""i wish i had friends"" meanwhile i've made attempts to try and help but i'm met with a ""thanks but no thanks"" each time. so i've stopped. 

They currently do not work as their job was too demanding on them. i don't think they make ANY income, and they live with their parents and siblings. both siblings have mental disorders of some sort and can be taxing to deal with. 

My best friend wants to see me, but i asked them to let ME know when THEY'D like to do something. i got sick of trying to make the plans and having my best friend cancelling every single time. I used to frequent their home, but, their home is quite....disgusting. nobody cleans up. there's junk everywhere. the house smells like dog  / cat pee, unknown substances in the bathroom...mold, etc. and I just feel so dirty being there. it feels somewhat of a health hazard (i'm probably being a bit dramatic about this point, but who knows). Not only that, but their one sibling is a horrible person and since he lives there i'd have to interact with him too although he makes me very uncomfortable. 

 I feel bad because at this point in time,  probably the only way I can give my friend attention is if i go to their house.... but I just don't feel comfortable being there. 

I know my best friend's head is barely above water right now. i'm doing what I can, but I know I can't dedicate too much time to helping or else i'll risk suffering in areas of my life that i'm currently content with (including my own mental health). It feels selfish to say this but i can't let them hold me back. 

All i can do is be attentive to their behavior because i'd hate to see them try and severely hurt themselves again. it sucks to see someone who was once so close to you become so distant by their own doing and theres not a lot you can do about it. (and yes they are going to therapy regularly and are on medication... but most meds have failed to treat their depression unfortunately)."
1396,Life is hard and hurts.,"  It's hard for me to talk about it, but I think I need the resonance of strangers because through friends I always get the feeling that they are just saying it.  
   
Phew, where do I start? 

For most of my life, I have to suppress and repress my emotions, my wishes, and my needs.   
 

In my childhood, I only noticed how my parents fought. There was never any affection between them and there was always a tense atmosphere.

 

It was not unusual for them to yell at each other. One experience has left a strong impression.

   
They argued again and my father pushed my mother against the door frame and choked her. My sister was standing next to me crying and I rushed at my father and hit him to make him stop.

   
 

Every holiday usually ends in a fight and I actually always noticed that.

  

I was a lively child and I went out a lot, rode my bike and did other things.

 

I often had the thought of having an accident and seeing who would go to the hospital. Somehow I longed for someone to visit me. And once I was in the hospital, I was alone.

   
 At some point I started to think about my life more intensely, I think it was when I was 18. I met a girl who had a hard time in her life and was sexually abused by her father, so I realized that I was not doing well and that the family I live in was not normal. Although I felt it to be normal.

  

In addition, my father is always profiling himself in public and presents himself as Samarita.

   
 And I should mention that my sister has a disability. She has a cleft palate that was not diagnosed until she was 6 years old, which made it difficult or impossible for her to speak until then. And has missed a significant part of her development, which has caused her to regress. She was bullied at school and is actually even lonelier than I am, which is a burden to me.

   
 I made my mother move in 2011 with my sister and me. Now we are since then in an apartment that is ok, but not really great either.

 I know that I have to take care of my sister all my life and be there for her because there is no one else who would do this.

 This burden is so overwhelming because I know that I can't do what I might want to do.

   
 It has been easiest for me the whole time not to think about it, to gamble and to repress everything.

   
 

But still, all this burden weighs on me and lurks behind me.

   
 

I have been in a relationship for almost 5 years. When I am with her, I feel wonderful and forget all this burden. I love her. In the beginning, we worked really well as a unit because we had some courses together during our studies and I went to her place afterward. Unfortunately, I live a bit further away ( 30 km ).

With time I noticed that I hardly have time for myself and then it developed that we saw each other less and less. During the semester break, she usually went to her parents' house, which is about 300 km away. This was okay, I could handle it. It just couldn't be any other way.

  

When we met, she had already made friends with someone in her department. She used to spend time with him, which is fine for me. But since this year he lives a few streets away from her and I have the feeling that he spends more time with her here than she does with me. Might only be a feeling I never explicitly asked because I'm afraid to.    
I tried to tell her that, but the first text was more than a flop because my emotions probably made me say more things and in a wrong way. And to much.   
   
I honestly didn't know what I expected to hear on it. But what I heard first was ok. It was a lot which I wrote to her and maybe not always in a good manner.  
 

Then I went for a walk and when I came back, she wrote something again and referred to her boyfriend and said that she was not with him so often and that he was always with her and that he now just lives closer.  
 

That hurt, that was not at all what I wanted to hear. 

I try to say more what I think and feel, because I am not good at that and I never do. But somehow what she writes to me does not calm me down as I would like it to. Sometimes I don't know if she understands me and it feels like she doesn't care even though I know it's not the case.

  

Logically, I can understand everything (Logical me is what leads my life most of the time, at least lately), but emotionally it feels like she doesn't want to spend time with me.

   
 

I somehow emotionally feel like she should want to spend every second with me. But at the moment it doesn't feel like that.   


I currently feel like I feel more for her than I for her. But that is probably primarily because of the emotional journey of my feelings. I do not know how to deal with this. And what's real and what's just emotional chaos caused the issue.  
 

Besides my girlfriend, I actually don't meet with anyone else. Because the people I could meet all life far away.  
 

Maybe Corona is an additional problem for me and the 3 months working in my room was not the best.

   
 

There is so much more and I do not know how to deal with it. Yes I have talked to others about it. But that doesn't help at all.

   
 

I understand that she needs enough time for herself. Because when she is with her parents she is not alone and surrounded by people all the time.

   
But it hurts me to hear that she needs time for herself, but then spends time with someone else just because it is more comfortable? because he lives nearby? or is it just me imagine the worst-case scenario? I don't even know how much time would be okay and how much don´t.

 

Maybe its just the fact that I would love to hear, that I shall come over without me saying something. I understand that corona makes it hard for her to come to me without a car and that I don't live alone and for her its hard to be here because I don't live alone.   
 

I've been told more times than I've been told that I should stop the relationship if it harms me. But that's just it. In principle it doesn't harm me and my girlfriend has her problems, but she only shares some of them because she thinks it's nobody's business. ( Probably she doesn't want to be vulnerable, which she would be if she talks about it) I think a relationship means that you keep fighting for the other person, as long it seems there is some hope.    
 

I don't want to throw away 5 years in which I also had my faults, that I didn't talk and never said anything that might bother me. I have tried and still try to please everybody and everything.

  

A good example:

I am thirsty when I am a guest of someone, this person offers me something to drink and I refuse.

   
 This applies to everything and is deeply rooted in me.

  

I'm someone who is also very rule-bound and I sometimes make rules and pretend to do what's right and what's wrong, and I stick to them excessively.

  

For example when it comes to sex. An ex-girlfriend once gave me the feeling that oral intercourse is not an accomplishment for the woman and more of an imposed abomination that only benefits the man. Since then I find oral sex with me very difficult.

  

It feels good, but I have the feeling that I'm forcing the other person, even if the person tells me its okay and she likes it.  
 

I sometimes feel that I feel ashamed to do something sexually. It feels very tense on my side and very difficult. I could also not really name what I would like and what I would not like.

  

It's these inner blockages that are there, that can't be named and that determines my life. I usually don't feel that I have any real control over my life, it feels like blinking and another 5 months are over.

 I feel like I don't really know myself and that scares me because if I don't know myself, how can my girlfriend know me, and if I find myself then she will still want me?   


And there is this thought that says maybe she just don't break up because I'm currently hurt.

   
 I really don't want to lose this person, because, despite the fact that she unintentionally hurts me or maybe I just get hurt by something she does which is ok,, she does me a lot of good and gives me exactly that, because the time I spend with her is really wonderful and makes me feel that everything else is not important.

  

Mhh.... Maybe I should also mention that I am afraid that my mother has a tumor or ulcer on her spine. And she does not want to operate on it because it is on the spine. But now I see it again and again and it scares me. And it weighs on me because I know how much will weigh on me once she is no longer there.

  

I have the feeling of not to be able to lead my life the way I want to.

I think to compensate for this I have overcharged my credit card so much that I am 5000€ in debt, that is not the world. A lot of money. But nothing that one could not manage. It still gnaws at me, especially because I had already paid it down to less than 1000€ and then I don't know what I bought that it is gone. Something to distract me.

   
 Maybe it is also simple that I am despite the fact that I surround myself with people virtually, in the end alone and it hurts me.

I feel alone. And this hurts. It's so hard to say this. I'm fucking alone and everything is so much. I have the feeling to have no control over my life."
1397,I(23F) had a mental breakdown and was emotionally harassed by few seniors. I am struggling to trust and make friends since then.,"It was the last day of college. And I had my tickets booked already. But I suddenly got this panic attack. I was afraid to go out or travel as I believed I would be killed in between. I was even afraid if anyone looked at me. It was normal for them to look and smile at me but it was not the same for me!
I was behaving very weird. I talked with seniors because I thought he would help me but both of them just made fun of me and tried to manipulate me. I went to 2 girl seniors and experienced almost similar thing. They tried to manipulate me and even behaved in a bad way. I was a total mess that night. When my mom called me, I said her I won't come. I was scolded by everyone. No one was actually understanding my condition. When I went to my room, I couldn't sleep. I was getting up every 5 minutes and walking in the corridor and again sitting on my bed. Both of the seniors came to my room and tried to talk. Their facial expressions were very judgemental. They insulted me. They said I am being illogical and irresponsible. Told me repeatedly that I am weak. When I resisted that, she took a pen and wrote ""Be a bit strong"" on my hand. When my mom called me again one of them took my phone and told  mom that may be I am pregnant and that's why I don't want to come home. 
They must have told to some of my other friends too because I received a few calls the next day who told me not to be dramatic. I felt really disgusting. I was a kind of person who would help someone even if I am not doing the best. I would share even if I had less. I never knew why and how to be mean. I just used to love people so hard. May be I was naive or innocent. 
But after this incident, I changed a lot. I learnt a lot, but I become sad about why I learnt this things so late. People made fun of me, they laughed at me. I understood everything but stayed calm. I was completely lost. I can't trust people now. I just stay silent. I have difficulty in getting close to people. They say I have attitude. They behaved bad with me, harassed me, disrespected me, insulted me and still expect that I must talk with them or be friends with them! God! How is that possible?  I made just 1 good friend all through my college life.
I am worried about my life hereafter. How will I be able to survive with all this insecurities? I need some way out! Please let me know if u have any suggestion in ur mind."
1398,"I’m doubting if my mental illness symptoms need treatment or recognition, again.","I have a good few days or a week, or my anxiety symptoms change, and suddenly I think I should no longer be trying to get help. 

Turns out I’ve been faking it for attention this whole time, or I’ve been manipulated to think of my feelings a certain way. Sometimes I think: “it used to be much worse” and I think back to a time where I already was thinking to myself “it used to be much worse.” I say things like “at least I don’t throw up anymore” or “at least I don’t cry myself to sleep anymore.”

This has caused me to give up before and then I’ll feel like garbage a week later and regret it all. I don’t even know what to really think. Yeah, I don’t throw up and cry anymore but now I harm myself and think of death, is that really any better?

I’ve tried going to doctors and therapists, most don’t believe me, and I don’t believe myself a lot of the time. They don’t help me at all. Every time my symptoms change or become mild I doubt myself and they see it. 

It makes me think I should just continue living on my seesaw of wanting to be dead and thinking I might be able to get something from this life. I’m tired. There’s no in between. If I don’t feel terrible all of the time, or if my symptoms come and go, it feels invalid."
1399,Not able to talk about worries without getting depressed,"Dear all, not sure if this topic is allowed here but I will give it a try. 
My wife is suffering from small periods of extreme depression (like a few hours) as a result of certain thoughts/worries. She isn't very talkative about her feelings. Sometimes she worries about everyday things but because she can't speak out, it stays in her mind and leads to a depressive mood. During this depressive mood she can't identify the thought she is worried about but afterwards (once the bad mood is over) she can. We have talked about this a lot and it's probably the result of a childhood in which she couldn't open up to her parents so she has learned to keep everything within. 

She absolutely won't go to a psychologist because of the stigma and I don't want to force her. But at the same time I can't stand to see her like that and I really want to help her. Right now I encourage her to talk each time after a depressive mood so she can identify the thought that was bothering her. 

I also read up on cognitive behavioural therapy and we hope to implement this as well. Any tips are welcome; like the name of this 'condition' or possible therapies."
1400,Violent thoughts?,"If find if I don’t stay busy my mind starts to wonder and goes into a very dark place ..I’m 25 years old but I’ve had my past I grew up in a rough area and started getting into trouble with the law since 14 until 20 years old I’ve been charged over 12 times been to jail, Juvi I’ve done and seen my fair share of violence I decided to turn my life around and move to another city at 20 I’m 25 now and I haven’t been in any trouble with the law Nd haven’t even had a verbal argument with anyone in the past 5 years I make an honest living Nd I left everything I used to do behind but even tho still I would never act upon doing anything I get really violent thoughts a lot mostly images of my past enemies of me getting payback or whatever people that probably don’t even know if I exist anymore and it really messes me up Nd ruins my day I feel like days when I’m like that people can kinda feel my energy Nd they get sketchy idk what do you guys think this can be? I was just a lost kid I would never entertain actions that would harm me or others again but still there is the thoughts, WHY?"
1401,I’ve lost all will to keep going,"After many months trying to find a way at through or around my depression - I can’t find the energy anymore I just want to sleep and not wake up.

I wake up and I loathe having to wait til I am tired enough to be unconscious again. I’ve been trying and failing to find purpose, I’ve lost all passion for the art I spent much of my life doing. 

I can’t find work, charity work has kept my hands busy but hasn’t changed how I feel drastically. My own government reminds me daily that my artistic pursuits are pointless and it only reaffirms that I have no place in this world. I don’t have anything to offer."
1402,I get stuck in a loop when i think about death,"So ever since i was about 9 i started having this issue when i would cry a lot in private when i thought about death. Knowing my parents,  friends and family woukd die one day made me very sad. And at the time my dad was overseas in the military so most of thoughts were just me crying thinking about if he potentially died that day. He never died luckily but it nevers gotten better. Now that when i was 15 I tried not to think about death. Everyday im doing school work or doing something productive i tend to listen to music because if i work in silence i tend to fall in this loop. The loop is i think about death i cry , get suicidal, sometimes I'd cut my arms and legs or chest and i lose all interest in every.  I have this weird mindset where i would rather lose my own life than have to experience the death of a love one. Now that im sixteen its getting really bad I really don't see the point of doing anything in life if all imma do is die in the end. Sometimes i think that i might as well die now. Today it got really bad because i was watching a old etika clip and he used to be one of my favorite YouTubers when i was 5th through 7th grade. Idk it hit me that he died and he will no longer be able to make new videos. then it led to me looking at photos and videos of my gf because she is grounded so the only way i can really see her is by looking at her photos. And then its hit me my girlfriend wont be alive forever. And then it hit me all my friends and family and favorite youtubers wont either. Than i got hit with the loop i stopped my self from crying because family was near but idky when i stop myself from crying my chest, neck and head hurt a lot. I got suicidal thinking to myself that I'd rather be dead than have to lose people close to me. I used to start cutting to ig numb the pain inside but i didnt. I know its bad for me but I've moved somewhat moved my addiction of cutting myself when i feel bad to watching porn. So i snuck into my room to watch it. It helps takes my mind off death for a good while and now im addicted to it. Sorry if my story seems out of place and but all of this just happened like an hour ago i don't think i take this loop im stuck it.  Im slowly losing interest in everything and not really even close to being happy anymore. Does anyone else know why i feel this way??? I would really like if i could find a way to be happy and enjoy things again without thinking to myself its not worth it because you'll die anyways mindset.( This happens multiple times a day but today it was the worst mentally)"

1404,Does everyone suddenly get panic?,So idk but for a few months I‘ve been getting sudden and random panic and when I panic I feel like I can‘t breathe anymore and my heart races like sonic. It just lasts a few seconds and the longest I‘ve felt this panic it lasted for a few minutes (it felt like minutes). After that intense panic and heart racing I sometimes cry but only if it was really intense like catching an expensive glass plate when it‘s about to fall. I don‘t know if this sudden panic is a panic attack because I‘m kinda confused about this so yea. I think everyone sometimes panics for no reasons but I‘m nut sure. I think it started when school started again. Does this even fit in this subreddit? Idk. So does everyone suddenly panic for no reasons?

1406,Why is it when I wake up in the morning and I go through my day it feels great but around the afternoon I feel like I want to kill myself and that I’m an ugly piece of crap?,"This has been happening for too long to remember and idk why, is there such a thing as depression that shows itself around certain times?"
1407,So my Sister and Husband are convincing me to see a therapist.," Hey so I’m new to the whole mental health thing, and when my insurance kicks in next month I will be going to a therapist. I’ve never actually been to one, (unless you consider the guidance consoler I had once at an old military instillation one) so I don’t really know what to expect.  
 

So I’ve been having long term problems with concentrating, racing thoughts (not like panic inducing, but just a lot all at once), I’m incredibly forgetful, I have trouble starting and finishing projects unless I put the fear of ruining my life as the motivation, extremely self-critical behavior, and just an overall negative outlook about things. As a kid many teachers and other adults have insisted, I should be checked for ADD/ADHD, but my parents assumed it was a catch all for bad parenting and never did anything about it. As a teenager I withdrew, my grades dropped to the point where I almost flunked out of high school, and I wasn’t a particularly pleasant or social person to be around. I ended up flunking out of Community college and enlisting in the Military. I served for 7 years, but struggle with many aspects of military life. I was often deemed to sensitive, unmasculine, and ‘god awful at my job’ despite performing above average. I felt hopeless and just did the bare minimum, until my enlistment was up. I just finished my Associates and got into a decent school where I am doing very grade wise well.  
 

However, I do not know how to bring up my issues when I see a therapist. I don’t want to waste someone’s time if my issues are just being lazy and entitled. I do want help in certain regards, because I always feel like I’m treading water.  
 

I used to draw a lot as it was a huge passion of mine, but I stopped while I was in the military and can’t seem to improve to where I want to be. I can barely motivate myself to draw for more than 10-15 minutes without getting bored, twitchy, or feeling like I will never improve. It sucks because that’s something I used to completely engross myself in. Now I just sort of rot away on the computer if I’m not doing schoolwork or household chores.  
 

I am so self-critical, that I can’t permit myself to celebrate any achievement. I received my A.A. degree and feel like its nothing to celebrate. Education is expected, why should I celebrate for doing something that is now a basic requirement to contribute? Anything I achieve or do feels hollow, as if I should have done it sooner or better.   
 

I am incredibly forgetful to the point where I need things repeated to me like I am an idiot. I forget minor and major things constantly, to the point where I have to check myself two or three times just to make sure I’m not driving without my wallet or if I have anything due. Its gotten to the point where if my husband has something important to say, he has to grab my attention and say ‘\_Name Redacted\_ Listen to what I am saying’ and I still only get bits and pieces.   
 

I am also such a negative person; I get legitimately angry if people try to compliment things I’ve done or show me any form of praise. I hate seeing feel-good positivity, it makes me feel sick. I feel like people are fake when they act positively towards me, like perhaps they view me as too incapable to handle rejection or negativity.   
 

I guess I just want to know what’s wrong with me, so I can fix it and get on with my life. How should I approach a therapist with all this? Should I even go to one, or am I wasting a precious resource for someone who needs it more than I?"

Its really been bothering me the fact that she breaks up with him, says she wants a divorce for a week and gets back with him after he makes false promises only to break those promises and the cycle continues. 4 times this year already and I've had enough because each time it happens he will shout at me and make me cry while saying its all my fault.

A week ago, me and my you get sister were talking about how we know they will get back together and how it keeps happening because its upsetting her too.
My mum walks in and asks us what we are talking about because we Immediately stopped talking when she comes in and we stayed silent so she asked again and I started of just saying that they will get back together and I really don't want to deal with this anymore and its upsetting me too much then I started crying then EVERYTHING I've been holding back these past few months just came out and I told her how I feel about him, why I'm so scared, why it's not fair that I've never had a dad, and how I never want him in this house again. I was crying so hard I was making some ugly sobbing noises, and when I remember how I felt in that moment I begin to cry again just like I am now. That was the first time I've ever cried to anyone or even broke down in emotions so hard in my life. I sat there for about 2 hours still in shock and I just kept thinking.
What shocked me the most was that she didn't hug me, or comfort me so tell me its okay or anything that would help me. She just kept asking questions like why was I feeling like that and so on. It really disappointed me that in such a moment she couldn't show the slightest of emotional support when I needed it the most. When ever I see someone get hugged i get really emotional and sad and slightly jealous. I never get hugged or get comforted by anyone and i really need it right now. I cried 4
30 minutes ago at netflix when a girl hugged her mum while she was upset and i cried for at least 10 minutes.

 I really need someone to tell me its going to be okay:("
1410,It's getting bad again,"My depression was finally going better, but my roommate kicked me out so now I'm at my boyfriend ppace until the 7th of November. Hopefully I can get a job and an apartment before that date.

My depression is coming back stronger than ever and I once again feel like ending it all..."
1411,cant sleep again because of my thoughts,"I was called ""rude"" by a my professor today. I agree with what she said, I have been in a gloomy and overall just shitty mood for the past week, so it makes sense that I went overboard. 

Ofc Imma learn from it and try not to be so rude next time. It's just I'm thinking about everything I've done to this point in my life again. Am i a toxic person? Do I come off as rude a lot? 

I'm not a hateful person. Or at least I try to not be one. I'm not straightforward either, so that doesn't explain why I come off as rude. I've done things in the past that hurt others, I've said things that is hurtful. 

It's keeping me up at night these days knowing how much of a shitty person I am without even realizing it. Maybe it's punishment."
1412,Questions about sleep deprivation,"How much can sleep deprivation affect mental health? I've had bad sleep these past couple months. Since August or so, I'll get 7 hours on a good night, and more often 4-5 or so. I'll sometime nap in the day, although they dont seem to do much. Ill miss sleep for two reasons: I say ""fuck it, why not stay up later?"" or I just toss and turn and cant get to sleep. Consequently, I constantly feel tired, and dont really remember the last time I didnt.

Now these past couple of days I have been extremely anxious, the most ive ever been. I've always been a pretty anxious person, but never this constantly. Its very much feels like its happening for no reason, because Im literally not worrying about anything in the future or anything, I just have a sinking feeling in my chest and a choky feeling when i breathe in. My question is basically this, could it be at all possible that my lack of sleep is causing, or at least facilitating, this rise in anxiety? I've already made a sleep schedule and committed to not using screens one hour before bed. Besides the anxiety, Ive also had a harder time concentrating or recalling thinsg. Do you guys think that getting good sleep could significantly better my mental health? 
Sorry for the rambly post, any advice or observations about either my anxiety or sleep deprivation will be greatly appreciated. Also, I live in america."
1413,Do any of y'all have a hard time identifying emotions behind thoughts?,Sometimes I'll have a thought or impulse (the worrying ones are SI or SH respectively) and I can't seem to figure out what my emotions are behind those thoughts (e.g. do I mean them or are they pop-ups/intrusive thoughts). It also happens with other thoughts like when I think I want something but I don't know if I actually want it because I can't figure out if there is any emotion connected to the thought. Is this a problem any of y'all have?
1414,Sleep deprivation and anxiety.,"I've never seen a therapist, but I've always been an anxious person, and the last couple of weeks, and especially the last couple of days, Ive had a really, really bad bout of anxiety. Unlike some other times ive had bad anxiety, however, im not thinking about anything in particular, but i constantly have a sinking feeling in my chest and a choky feeling when i breathe in. Ive also had a hard time remembering stuff, and a hard time concentrating.

To back up a little, since August ive gotten pretty abhorrent sleep. I drink too much caffiene, have a hard time getting to sleep in general, and sometimes just say ""fuck it"" and stay up way too late.  Ill get 7 hours a good night, 5.5-6 on an average night, and 4 on a bad night. 8 hours or more is somewhat unheard of for me. Ive already made plans to correct this sleeping pattern; i made a sleeping schedule, know not to use screens an hour before bed, etc. Basically what im wondering is if this lack of sleep could have facilitated or even caused this anxiety and general poor mental health. Secondly, Im curious if correcting this sleep schedule will significantly help my mental health, or if I should look into getting a therapist.

Any thoughts, observations, or pieces of advice will be greatly appreciated. I live in America btw."
1415,I finally asked my parents if I could got to a psychologist,"It was not even as difficult as I expected I just asked and they said yea sure you can see him.
I’m so happy that I finally got the courage to ask."
1416,Am I supposed to feel empathetic?,"TW: Suicide  
My online friend of about a year recently told me that he was planning to commit suicide in the next couple of months. I asked him why and how he was going to do it. He told me that there was a gun in his house although he couldn't find any rounds. I told him pills would be less dramatic, so he made his mind up on pills. I told him that I would be bored if he died. I feel like I didn't react the way I was supposed to."
1417,Why do I have the need for constant reassurance even though I have no reason for it,"Long story short their girl (18F) and I (19M) were hooking up, nothing serious until I caught feelings, let her know where she told me that she just started talking to someone a bit more seriously. I spent the next month winning her over and last week we had made each other exclusive and plan on dating soon once we have a bit more time to really make sure this is what we want. Things are going amazing, hanging out all the time, we kiss, hook up, cuddle, all of the things you would expect from a soon to be couple. She is giving me 0 reason to be worried to think she doesn't like me. Tells me all the time how I am the absolute best and so special and how she can't wait to date do couple things etc. Has invited me over we have slept over each others places a few times even. So why do I still get sad/worry she doesn't like me/worry that things won't work out and we won't date. It calms me down when I am with her or she texts me saying affectionate things but when I am not with her or the conversation is not on something affectionate, my brain tells me that she doesn't like me. I know it is some type of mental barrier and it leads to me asking a lot of reinforcing questions like ""are you sure you like me, do you think we will date soon, do you think things are working out"" which I know can be seen as clingy and push her away so I don't say it often even though I want to. Why is this an issue and how can I fix it. Will it be gone when we actually start dating? I've been in 1 long term (2 year) relationship before we broke up 7 months ago and I do not recall this happening to this extent before."
1418,I don’t feel save at home.,I don’t feel mental save home my parents are divorced and I have bad old memories from home.. idk what to do.. pleas help me? I am so scared I told my therapist this.
1419,I don't want to feel like this anymore.,"So I've never made a post reaching out for ""help"", I always sort of dealt with it alone and I'm okay with that for the most part. Lately though I've just been really down and everything feels heavy. There's people around me who care, like my family but they wouldn't understand plus I'm pretty sure they get tired of my anxiety. If anyone is willing to stick around for a while that would be nice for once. Just someone who understands and can help me, who cares. I'm just tired. It's to the point where it's normal for me, it's like comfort. Anybody?"
1420,What are your personal ways that help you to relax when especially stressed?,When I am stressed my throat starts to feel tight and very uncomfortable so I usually resort to sleep aid to make me feel more relaxed. It definitely helps ease that tension but I would like to stop relying on them so much.
1421,Why did i just try to choke myself?,"So yea like the title says... i was thinking about how i messed up things today and will tomorrow.
I wrapped my hands around my neck and i pressed and squeezed. First i didn’t apply much pressure (i could still breath) . After a few seconds i stopped. Then after a rest I continued thinking i was weak and applied more pressure. Again i stopped... i did this like 7 time before stopping entirely. This was like 4 minutes ago. Now i just feel nothing, i think nothing, i feel like nothing.

With the squeeze with the most pressure i could still breath a little bit. (Im a 15 y/o girl and im quite weak, and having small hands makes it worse) i wanted to not breath. But i was to weak to press harder. I don’t regret what i did. It felt quite good honestly. The feeling of not breathing. I didn’t really do it because i wanted to die right then and there, i just did it? Idk it felt right. I wanted to not go to school tomorrow. Im so tired. Of studying. Of people. I can barely write with a pen. Im so god damn tired all the time. 

Btw. If this is important, my mom gives me like these energy pills or something idk. But they make me hyper and feel like screeming, singing, dancing (This happends usually in the evening). but when i went to bed today i was just so tired.

Ya so that. Does someone know why i just tried to choke myself?"
1422,I realy want to do it,"Hey Reddit, i made an account just for this.
For the last 10 years i have been wanting to die every single day, and i fear i'm finally going to do it today.
Just for context, i'm a male (17 years old), im south american, so my english is terrible.
So, i have had suicidal tendencies for ten years now and i think i will do It today.
Im really drunk.
I'm tired of life"
1423,I really dont know whats wrong with me but I dont like the feeling. Can you help me figure out what it is?,"I am genuinely a happy person but I have my days.
On some mornings i just want to wake up and exercise by myself, but when my mom also wakes up and in the same room as me i feel so agitated and angry like i feel like punching a wall. It happens a lot. My parents fight and sometimes its like my mom provokes my father especially when I am there, cause if i stand in between my father wont hit her. I hate it like really hate it, i have to always be on the lookout when i am with my father to make sure my mom is not in the same room. Now i think its developed to a stage where I can get very annoyed quickly like my brother can drop his phone or just bump me and i would be so angry. One time my mom got me so mad i started punching myself and its like i wasn't forcing it but allowing it. But its like these things only happen at home when my family only when im not with them im okay. Sorry for the going to that to this, but try and get a general idea. Do you think you might know whats the problem? It would be very kind of you, so I can find the right help."
1424,It's kinda sad how the meds we take and for some they do nothing for. That the monthly cost alone of antidepressants is more than the practical approach of therapy....,"All our doctors are doing is blindly giving meds that take 6-8 weeks to ""maybe"" work and when they don't they toss either more pills at it or increase it or add something... 

All of those methods alone would pay for professional therapy for numerous people

Because sleeping through your depression because of medication, isn't fixing the main problem...

You don't put a fire out with pills....."

I feel like im constantly trapped and overstimulated and I just can't relax because of my apartment. there's too much stuff, too much clutter, the furniture doesn't match, it's just so busy that it just feels like the walls and the furniture and everything is just screaming. ive tried de cluttering, reorganizing, purging items, ive done all I can but I live with 2 other people so I can't do anything about things that aren't mine, and if I get rid of any more of my stuff I won't have anything left and it'll just be a horrible apartment full of things that aren't mine. there's basically no storage space either, so there's no room to store things and I can't even get all of our kitchen this to fit nicely in the space we have. 

nobody else has said it's bad, people keep telling me that the apartment isn't the problem,  so it seems that I just have to learn to deal with it, but I don't know how. I'm not diagnosed, but my therapist (and some friends) have said they suspect OCD, im unsure because I dont perfectly fit the criteria, but that kinda proves that they're right lol. I also have other diagnosed mental issues, most relevant to this are anxiety and adhd. 

please help me, I'm so tired of feeling like this."

1428,"GF has Seasonal Depression, what can I do to help?","My gf of almost 3 years has suffered with Seasonal Depression since before we were together. Her last relationship ended horribly, with her getting horribly bullied at school and eventual became suicidal, although we went to the same school, I was unaware of the bullying since our relationship then only extended to classmates. Around Fall time, which she says is her favourite season unsarcastically. Before we started talking, she ""got over"" ( she isn't suicidal anymore Thank God) her suicidal thoughts but her seasonal depression has been a constant. since about 4/5 years ago.  

I tell her to see a professional but she refuses to get one, since her previous experiences with a professional didn't do much to cure her, instead they made her feel like her struggles could just be chalked up to chemical imbalances, as opposed to real emotional problems that needed addressing. I've been telling her for years to get a good one, but she also says she doesn't want to worry her parents or but that financial pressure on them like the previous time. 

What can I do, to make her seasonal depression less taxing to her? I wish she would see a professional but she constantly says she's ""fine"" and ""I'm not suicidal, so its okay"". What can I to help her? I would appreciate any advice at all"
1429,Patience with your feelings. (Please read),"Patience is a beautiful thing. The feeling you are having? It is a real feeling that you feel, for some actual reason. When you have patience with yourself for the negative thoughts you have about yourself instead of giving up on yourself, you can forgive yourself for feeling these bad feelings. You can feel your feelings then not be trapped by guilt for feeling the bad things about yourself. It’s okay to feel your hurt. With patience, you can feel the negative feelings and then accept that you have them. While being patient, you can then continue to experience the good things that life has to offer, simply by accepting yourself as you are. You can also continue to be patient with allowing your feelings to become more clear to you. Then maybe you can make progress in what is causing your negative feelings."
1430,Why do I cry so easily?,"I always been really emotional, but ever since some years ago, it really bothers and get in the way of my life. If my mood changes even a bit, if I laugh a bit too much I cry, if I’m even a bit mad or frustrated. I can’t help but the tears just start flowing. I can’t talk to people sometimes when I’m mad or frustrated bcs I can’t hold a conversation without busting into tears. I try to hold it the best I can when I’m outside but it’s happening a lot more frequently nowadays. I don’t know if anxiety or depression is cooperating with it, I’m pretty sure I have anxiety, (when I’m a bit stressed I bit my inter lip until it bleeds, not consciously) but never been to a therapist, I’m living in a new country and don’t speak the language fluently yet, don’t have any money and don’t wanna worry my family. Just wanted to know if anyone has some tips to stop a bit of it. Thanks"
1431,I'm not sure what's wrong,"So since June, which is around 3 months into when quarantine really began, my mental health has really deteriorated. It got better after like a month but really started getting worse around 2 weeks ago. Basically, whenever I think about myself having a mental illness or whenever I even think about a mental illness, I start panicking about whether or not I have that mental illness. Obviously you shouldn't self-diagnose, which is why I came to reddit to see whether or not this is because of the quarantine and the stress (everybody's talking about mental and physical health and all) or if this is something I should really look into. if you want some more detail, often when I am doing something, say eating, and then I go and get a glass of water, my brain tells me ""you should go wash your hands so you don't get the cups dirty"" but then almost immediately after my brain says, ""Wait. What if you have OCD?"" and then the list continues. for the past week it's been mostly things about derealization/depersonalization. the weird thing is, i feel like i wouldn't have felt any of this anxiety if i had never nkown about the disorder in the first place. its almost as if knowing about the illness is the reason why its happening. a more recent example is today and yesterday, when i randomly started thinking about my breathing, and now i can't get myself to stop thinking about it. i went to the internet to find some possible causes, and the most common search result was a form of OCD, so obviosuly i start panicking about having OCD. it'd be appreciated if anybody could give me some advice or insight into what i may be going through."
1432,How do I overcome the overwhelming sense of dread I feel when I try to go to sleep?,Some days it’s difficult to sleep cause my mind is racing.
1433,"Depression and anxiety, or normal teenage angst?","Have no idea how to start this so here goes. I’m totally new to this subreddit by the way.

As a teenager I was very sad, lonely, and high-strung. I didn’t label myself with anything, I just knew I was miserable (and didn’t even realize HOW miserable until I came out on the other side). I was very lonely with few friends and had a really bad temper. I remember often stewing in anger for no reason, thinking no one wanted to be around me, having thoughts of (but never, that I remember, seriously considering) suicide. I know everyone has an awful time of being a teenager but from talking with my mom in retrospect I know it was bad for me, at least compared with my three siblings. I felt bad all the time for no good reason. This all sounds vague and I don’t even know how depression is defined, but all I can say is that I know I was really, really unhappy. Like, really.
Also I would get extremely stressed about certain things. One of the worst was if I watched a neighbor’s pet while they were away; the whole time I lived in constant fear of forgetting something and the animal suffering because of it (I totally loved animals). Even a year after I stopped watching pets altogether, I was still having nightmares about forgetting to feed them or something like that. I got similarly unreasonable stressed about lots of other things, like school, and even typing this my heart starts to beat faster and I remember the constant tension and misery.

These days I’m doing a lot better with help from God, family, friends, and some really helpful life experiences and really tough lessons. I’m balanced, but I still see in myself the same things that were ruining my life as a teenager:

1. I often feel sad, sometimes to the point of my chest hurting, for no reason whatsoever. I am finally learning at 24 to just not listen to it. To keep living my life even when the sadness goes on four days or weeks, and to believe what I know to be true (I have every reason to be happy, and it’s all going to be okay) rather than what my heart is saying (I’m in pain, I need to just go somewhere quiet and feel this until it’s run its course).
2. I get unreasonably stressed and controlling when things don’t go the way I thought they would. I feel the old anxiousness coming back and just need to force myself to deal with the situation calmly instead of spiraling down into hair-pulling, heart-pounding, hitting-random-things-including-myself stress, which still occasionally happens but isn’t the norm.
3. I have tendencies toward extremely negative self-talk and need to constantly guard against it.

Now I know this nothing compared to what some people go through and I’m really grateful to be a mentally healthy person today. But I don’t want to invalidate experiences by comparison, including my own, so here are my honest questions that I’ve been wondering for a while:

1. Could I have/have had clinical depression and anxiety? Or maybe there’s another name and I’m misnaming what I experienced? Or maybe I just went through a normal level of angst for a teenager?
2. I can relate, at least on some level, to people who experience these mental health issues, among whom are some of my friends. Is there any way to bring up things that I’ve learned that helped me, without sounding like, “I conquered this so you can too” (obviously a huge oversimplification)?

Thanks for your help and for your patience with any noob mistakes/oversimplifications I’ve made."
1434,How do I stop hating myself and being so insecure?,"This is gonna be a long lost so grab your liquor of choice as we dissect a ton my insecurities.


Relevant background:
19M just moved into college dorm
River purity score of 91

So, growing up I was always the outcast. I had a serious mental health problem in 4th grade which resulted in me being bullied and such. The problem was extremely severe and led to multiple confrontations with the police, professional help, multiple suicide attempts, and medication. I don't want to regale you with details but it was bad. This experience really messed me up. I knew I was different and abnormal compared to everyone else. My schoolmates certainly treated me better after I solved the issue, but I always knew I was second tier. If someone had to leave the lunch table it was always me. As a result of feeling like an outcast I never really got involved in a lot of stuff other kids did. So, my best friend dated the girl I had a crush on and I was fine with that cause I didn't intend to date. This sorta mentality embedded itself in me. It resulted in me being reclusive in high school. As a result I never did a lot of stuff other kids did. For reference, my high school famously had a drug problem yet I was never even offered anything. Lots of kids hooked up, but I never did. I'm 19 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss. I googled it. You know how many college freshman have lost virginity? 70%. You know when most people have their first kids? 13-15. I'm in the minority in both of those figures. I am once again abnormal. How can I be interesting to people when everyone else has done more interesting stuff with their lives? Why would anyone want to talk to me when they can talk to someone who has interesting stories about how the cops busted their alcohol infused high school party or whatever. I'm just fundamentally less interesting. Lemme give you an example. You know that girl my best friend dated? Well all three of us went to the same high school. I fell out of contact with both but recently got back in contact with the girl. Apparently in high school she used a fake id to get into bars and stuff. I didn't even find that out from her, I found it out from a mutual friend. We've been texting since we go to different universities. Normally it's one of two texts a day with several hour  long gaps in between messages. Do you honestly think she actually wants to talk to me or is she just replying out of politeness? I mean I always text first. I'm sure she's met people who are waayy more interesting than me. Hell she's waaayy more interesting than me. Now to be clear, I know I said I had a crush on her in middle school. I am not currently trying to ask her out or anything, I just want her to be a friend. I just wonder if I am actually being a friend or a nuisance to her.

Now, you may say: ""this is easy, if you feel too innocent compared to everyone else go do something not innocent"". Not that simple. I have an annoyingly strong conciouss which won't allow me to purchase drugs or anything like that because I don't want my money to fuel cartel violence. And it's kinda difficult to discreetly grow weed in a dorm room. So that isn't an option.

I also have a very strong tendency to beat myself up over the slighest mistake. I beat myself up because I haven't done drugs but it i did do them I'd Bea myself up cause I funded cartel violence. If I ask out a girl I'll beat myself cause I'll accuse myself of just doing it cause you felt like you should've done it by age 19 and don't actually want to be in a relationship. If I don't do it I beat myself up because I haven't done it by age 19. Then add onto thks the convene that a lot of what I'm insecure about reads like an incel wrote it so I'm worried that I'm misogynistic and bigoted at my core. This goes against all my values and so on top of all of this I'm worried I'm secretly a terrible person. There's no winning. I feel abnormal, different, and weird compared to everyone else and honestly I really hate myself for it. I haven't talked about these problems with people close to me because I would look weird and that's not what I want. At the same time, I worry that by not talking about it I am being unhealthy. And of course, all this worrying makes me anxious that I'm being too sensitive and not manly. Hell I beat myself up for a week cause I listened to a taylor swift song. I know that's stupid, but I still did it. So I came to you all. How do I stop hating myself and how do I stop being so insecure?"
1435,I was approved!!,I was supposed to have a hearing tomorrow for social security for my disabilities and I don't have to do it now. They approved me!!!!! I could cry
1436,Can someone help explain to me what’s going on,"I’m 19, female, I take antidepressants and have for a while now, I take 100mg of pristiq daily and have been for about a month now. I was on 50mg for about 2.5 years. I’ve been depressed pretty bad for about a year now. I started college fall 2019, and I was lonely, but it started to get bad after October. It’s progressively gotten worse since then. 

I didn’t do any work for any of my classes besides my 2-D design art class and I’ve had to withdraw from those. I’m usually very studious and pretty on top of things.

But that’s not the end. I’m forgetting to do normal things, like showering, brushing my teeth, going to the bathroom. I fidget all the time, I have a hard time focusing on easy projects, I forget commonly used words, I can’t hold relationships anymore or make friends, I don’t ever dress up like I used to, I’ve definitely gained weight, the list just keeps going. I can’t concentrate long enough to sit down and start a schedule. I feel terrible, and I just sleep all the time. 

Can someone give me a name or term and explain what’s going on? I know I’ve been severely depressed before, but it’s never been this bad. Especially with the forgetfulness."

1439,Autistic boyfriend says his “brain won’t let him speak his mind”. Help?,"My boyfriend is autistic (I hate using this term, but he’s “high functioning”) and he has a dilemma. There have been a few times he’s disrespected me unintentionally due to his wording choices, and forgotten a few very important things* to say in conversations. Each time this happens he starts crying saying “I didn’t mean it, I hate when I do that, I hate when I forget” and explains that his “brain doesn’t let him say things” and “it’s not that I actually forget, they just only process after I have the conversation” ...
* Example being he had a discussion with his mother the other day and was meant to her views on Judaism as a Russian lady so we can decide if it’s safe or not to tell her that he’s in the process of converting. Instead, he asked “What is it like for Jews in Russia” as a way to lead into the conversation, but didn’t ever pitch in his thoughts. He came home crying and repeated “my brain didn’t let me say it”

I’ve interpreted this as he doesn’t think before he speaks, but not out of ignorance and more that he doesn’t have the cognitive ability to. (Not being ableist, I’m autistic too and have this exact problem myself, just a little different.)

He keeps freaking out, so I made this throwaway account to ask. Is this an autism thing? Or is there some type of disorder where your brain prevents you from thinking before you speak and makes you specifically forget important details? Is this a symptom of something?"

1441,I just want to be alone.,"I just want to be alone all the time. When I was a kid all I wanted was my parents attention, for someone to play games with. This happened rarely. My parents would say they are too tried because they have to work on medical problems and work. Which they still do.

I was told to make my own fun, and I did, and I still do. I will be 14 in a few months and try to be alone but its kinda hard to do when your home with your parents 24/7.  My parents say I do it too much, and I should interact with them. Whats the point. Why is it when I wanted to hang out, they said they were to busy. But now that they want it, I should give it. My mom cried a few days ago, because I try to not be with them. I felt guilty.

Every time I make a effort, they take about the medical issues or the news, things that I don't want to talk about. I have been hearing of this for years. We don't have much in common anyway. They are much much older than me, and when I try to explain my point of view on something they like to show me why I am wrong. I feel bad for not giving them any attention. But when I do I just want to leave the room because we can never do anything we both want to do. In the worst case, most likely, end up arguing. 

I'm not allowed to go out on my own, only if I have friends. Which I don't, because I do online school. I can't even go take a walk on my own, without my parents following me. Why, because they say theres predators. I even have a tracking app on my phone.

I managed to fake my location a week ago. So when they went to the doctor, I went for a walk. I did one today as well, when they went again. That is the most freedom I have ever had. 

I worked ahead on school yesterday, just so I could take a walk today. Being fully alone, just felt amazing. No one was wondering what I was doing 24/7, or following me while I walked. I felt like I was 18, but I'm sadly not."
1442,Is it all society?,"I'm increasingly believing that the exceedingly high numbers of mental health issues, me included, are brought on by none other than the big machine itself. 

It's like we're actors in this play and society is the director and tells us what to do, what to say, who to fight, how to think, who to love, who to hate, and what to buy.  Then we all go home at night and not only do we not forget that we were actors and now is the time to be the real us, but we actually indulge in the play some more. The big machine has sucked us all in so deep that we never escape anymore. 

We all know we're unhappy but we don't know why. We blame it on this or that, but those things won't actually fix us. Because those aren't really the things we need. They're only what society told us we need. What we need is to get in touch with our true selves. Stop attending that play, detach from the world, start to listen and understand yourself better. 

Start seriously thinking for yourself. It's like following a trail of breadcrumbs back to the point before society had fully corrupted you. It feels weird to go backwards but you have to. Then you can start to think clearly. You couldn't see the machine before..... because you were inside of it! You were powering it like everyone else was. Once you see that machine you'll realize that you are an amazing person, one way better than society ever could have defined!"
1443,Time off work for psychiatric help.,"How would I go about taking time off work for a possible stay in a psychiatric hospital? I'm 20 years old and I've had a very rough breakup that might end in a change of residence and possible a change in career. I feel crushed, I'm using BetterHelp as well as being on antidepressants but it seems like my whole world has fallen apart and nothing is helping, some days I just can't even function. I dont know if a psychiatric stay is even an option or something I should even be considering, but I would prefer not to lose my job, its a good job but I just don't know if I can deal with it right now."

but she said i wasnt on my phone but after she poked me, that made me conscious and asked me if im alright cause she said i was crying. after that i look myself in the mirror and holy i did cry. my eyes were red and tears almost dried up. i cant remember if that really happened to me- the crying and laughing thing.. and i think that was REALLY weird. but i remember the things that possibly triggered it again. so.. wtf? is that possible? am i on the process of being crazy now?

p.s. i am not professionally diagnosed but i had my first experience of panic and anxiety attacks so it explains my reasons im assuming it's ptsd. and now that it's ""reawakened"", it's scaring me that i would end up hurting someone over not knowing what i actually did- unconsciously."

How do I nicely tell her to back off because I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts, trying to keep myself out of the hospital and alive, and haven’t had the energy to do much school work let alone eat, shower, or get out of bed. The last couple days have been excruciating and i am doing my best but school is not a priority right now."

1448,A long-term view of happiness,"It is very sad to me that some people can be so unhappy in the short term. Starting at the basic level of humanity, you should always be content if you have water, food, and a roof. Leaving standard of living out of this, if you hold a longer-term view of your happiness you will overall be happier. To me, this means having a future destination for myself that I am always working to reach. I want a farm, a family, to get a world record in powerlifting, and to someday play a key role in unifying society. As long as I am currently thinking and working towards my goals, my baseline for short-term happiness is higher, especially because my future isn’t uncertain. 

The same principle can be applied over a small chunk of time like a week. If instead of only thinking about how happy you are in each moment, think about how happy you could be. If you think for 15 minutes, you can plan your week to enable a much greater degree of total happiness. This may mean sacrificing some happiness in some moments for a larger increase to happiness in others, giving you a net happiness profit. For me, this means getting all of my work done as soon as possible with zero procrastination. I have found that if I condense my misery into as small a chunk of time as possible, it doesn’t make each moment of misery worse. With all of the misery out of the way, I can relax knowing there is nothing left to do, which gives me much more total happiness than relaxing while procrastinating and getting things done at the last minute.

If you feel unhappy in the day to day moments of your life, take a more long-term approach to your happiness and it will pay off."
1449,"(TW VIOLENCE AND MENTIONS OF SUICIDE) My Sister. I'm sorry, I just need to vent. Please please feel free to ignore. I don't know where else to post this. We are safe now but I am dealing with trauma. I apologize.","Has anyone else had someone in their familiy who gets triggered by another family member when they do anything (move, talk, sniffle, cough, breathe, chew, swallow) and go into a violent episode that lasts for hours on end? Would they throw things and threaten to hurt that parent and lash out at everyone in the family and trash the house and scream bloody fucking murder for hours on end? Would they force that person to go outside while they prepared for school and if that person touched them they would act like their leg or arm is now slimy and gross and infected?? Would that parent say that they just wanted to shoot themselves in the head? Would the child scream that she wanted to kill that parent? Have they ever had to go to the hospital 4 times and you had to stay there until 6am and you slept until 5pm but she kept coming back home and back home and the doctors didnt do shit until the police had to be called for the second fucking time??? Why??"
1450,Having a hard time....,"I really don’t know what’s going on. This past week has been shit. I have not gotten good quality sleep. I fall asleep fine, but then I wake up two hours later stay up for four hours then sleep again until noon. Last night was the first night I slept all the way through, but it was only for five hours. I began this week depressed then I went to numb, hyper, depressed, irritated, hyper, depressed, irritated, depressed, hyper, irritated, numb, then hyper and irritated where I started hitting myself. Today I woke up hyper and could not stop moving then I got irritated and started hitting myself again and now I’m irritated and depressed. This is too many emotions at once. I understand I have Bipolar, but my moods should not be changing this fast. The other day, I was doing fine and then my grandmother said something that I took the wrong way and I balled my eyes out. I would stop get energized for a few minutes then start crying again and that happened four times! I feel like my brain is broken. On top of all this I’ve been paranoid, and at night I hear glass breaking like someone is breaking into the house. I’ve been paranoid about someone coming to murder me. I say anything bad and I’m compelled to knock on wood. One day this week my grandmother and I were driving down the road. I thought of us getting into an accident. I freaked out and started yelling ‘wood! Wood! I need wood! You have a pencil or something?’. I knocked on it and felt better. I also felt like nothing this week. I realized I have no sense of me. I don’t know who I am. I have no real personality of my own I just adopt others. 

I realize no one will probably read this, but I cannot afford a therapist at the moment and I just needed to get this out in the open. I have no one I trust this information to. So if you did read this...thank you for reading. Enjoy the rest of your day."
1451,Telling people how i feel is hard ???,"Imo the worst part of having a mental illness is not being able to put into words specifically what/how you feel. When i became depressed my mom would ask me if i was okay, i would say yes and be crying the next minute. Seeing her look at me as confused as she ever been would break my heart, but i couldnt explain to her why i was crying,  why i was depressed or simply how much i didnt want to be depressed... she couldnt understand either.

I find it hard to go to my psychiatrist because i have to force myself to talk about my feelings, its not like i dont like to talk about them, i just simply can't describe them perfectly which gives me anxiety.

 How can a doctor prescribe me medication or change my current medication based on words that come out of my mouth? What if while im describing how i feel i end up giving more importance to x thing and that makes the doctor change the meds? What if by changing the meds my depression and anxiety get worse?

 I hope you understand what im trying to say, hope someone relates to this."
1452,"Finally diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and Generalized Anxiety. I have questions.","So obviously I’ve had these problems for quite sometime and I’m about to be 20. Something happened when I was a kid, yadayadayada, that’s besides the point. I used drugs from a young age and it really started getting bad 9th grade. I’ve done most drugs there are, way to many to name sadly. This includes meth everyday for over a year and that really fucked with my mental health. So I finally took the biggest step forward and got off most substances. I’m 1 year or more clean from meth and over a month clean from drinking. I currently only take Kratom, smoke weed, and vape (which I told my psychiatrist and she is fine with it.

My question is to all of you guys is what should I expect being out on Prozac and Hydroxyzine? My mom takes Prozac and has been on it for 10+ years and has said she has had good results.

1453,I feel guilty,"I have been talking to someone for awhile now, I have never felt comfortable enough to share my feelings with anyone until I met them. They also share their feelings with me. The problem is when I am feeling like ending my life or hurting myself they always manage to talk me out of it and keep me safe. The issue is when they tell me I want to do something but they say they don't want my help, I understand that they don't have to take any help, but because of what they do for me I feel really guilty like I'm not doing anything for them. When I find out that they have harmed themselve, I feel so guilty and like such a failure. They are the most important person in my life and I just want to help them get through there tough time. I would do anything for them. 
What should I do?"
1454,My biggest fear is getting everything I want and still being unhappy,"i’m 21 and i think i’ve had a pretty good life. i have a great, understanding family, i’ve travelled the world and visited all the places i’ve dreamed about, i get good grades, my living conditions are good, i have nice friends and i own a lot of things that i like. i’ve even experienced love and though it came to an end i have no bad feelings about it. it’s not a perfect life, i’m not rich, there are so many things that could be improved - but it’s all enough for me. 

i have absolutely nothing to complain about, i know better than anyone else that i am lucky, that so many have it worse. yet i am depressed. i don’t feel happy at all. i make a goal, i achieve it, yet i don’t feel anything from it. i’ve accomplished everything i’ve set out for myself at a young age yet i feel nothing. i realise that i sound ungrateful and i feel extremely guilty. but i hate this life and i don’t wish for a ‘better’ one because isn’t this already good?? i think about killing myself a lot and if that’s what i need to do to be satisfied

since i’m still young i keep telling myself to power through it, that perhaps growing up and getting a good job and buying house is what i need to do to be happy. if i become rich i’ll donate to charities and help people out. i feel like i’d be doing it for the wrong reason but at least i wouldn’t be wasting anything.

but i’m terrified that even after all of that i still won’t be happy. i’m scared that i might just be living this monotous life for a longer time than i need to 

what should i do"
1455,Feeling crap tonight! I wrote down whatever came into my mind. Any advice or perspective would help.,"I am really stressed and as per usual I am struggling to pin point the cause. Is it feeling like a failure at work, feeling ovewhelmed at the responsbilites of taking care of a household without support, do I just have PMT, is my depression creeping back in, is this whole situation to overwhelming. Maybe I just need to eat healthier and getting some exercise would surely do me good. The gym is still closed but I could join another if I really felt it would help.  It would be good to see my friends just to talk things through a bit and then forget about it, and be uplifted by the positive energy they always bring.  Am I taking my antidepressants regularly? I am not really sure, thing seem a bit foggy.  I am being careless, or is it wilfully ignorant, its hard to know whats real. My packets are looking empty and I've had to order a repeat prescription but there is no order to when I am taking them. Sometimes morning and sometimes night. Daily or intermittently I am not sure. My child gets the medicine he needs every day, I know this for certain!  But with my medication, I cant seem to hold the importance in my mind. I dont feel like I really matter. I have these ups and downs. I shut off, I sleep more, I struggle for motivation, my chest feels tight and lots of things make me scared. I get so angry inside at my partner for not supporting me but I never say word and act like things are normal. Then I wonder if I am really angry at that, and are things really as bad as they feel in this given moment, or is my mood triggering a pattern of though processes from which I cant escape. Would I be happier if I left or happier if I stayed.  Why cant I express what I am feeling. Is is a fear that none of it is valid, that I will be misunderstood  or that I am more likely to be met with defensiveness and anger than understand. 

There is noone to reach out to that truely understands the depths of my anguish and the only person who ever did understand made me feel worse rather than better. Its a horrible isolating existence. I feel disconnected from all the people around me. There is a fear stopping me from truly embracing anyone in my life. A need to keep people at arms length. Anyone I've let in close has not wanted to know once they've seen the darkness underneath. Or maybe thats not even true, I've pushed away people I've been closed to.  Or maybe its a bit of both to be honest. I have friends in my life now but after 10 years I still dont feel right with them. I feel like they would rather I went away.  I dont feel like I know any of them on genuine human level. Or maybe for some people, knowing others is less about vulnerability and these friendships are in the normal range. 

There is so much I dont understand, is there something wrong with me, or was I just not taught right. Did I not have enough guidance along the way, or is learning supposed to be such a painful process. Is life filled with lots of unhappiness or is there another way to be.  I feel so inhibited all the time and like I am not being my true self. 

The only thing thats good and true is my love for the children. Its so real and so strong. My shining light in the darkness. My pride, my joy, my heart. I am not relgious but I pray they still love me when they are grown and that the pattern of dysyfunction and estrangement in my family does not continue.  I've put everything I have into making a good childhood for my kids. I know how much it hurts not to have that. I've not been a perfect parent but my love has been fierce and I always have my children's needs at the front if my mind. 

I am sure I should feel that my relationship is another good things in my life. And I do recognise that having a stable and morally decent partner with a relatively even temper is good for me. My nerves can settle after years of fight or flight. Someone who cares about the children and calls them his own is what I want for them. I would never want them to deal with the rejection of a dimissive or uncaring stepparent. They were only 6 when I met my partner so that was a huge factor.   We used to have a lot of fun together and he made me feel attractive but over time we have both become become unhappy in our own bodies and lacking enough self esteem to have sex. The antidepressants probably dont help to in terms of my libido. We are both quite different people and I am not sure if his personality compliments or tramples on mine. Sometimes I think I am not attacted to my partner as I play a mothering role in his life. I am not sure if my perception of this is correct but I do feel as though I have full responsibility for everything i.e finances, working, all household chores, pets, childcare.  There are probably ways to get my partner to do these things but I am not able to communicate them to him in away that he understands fully. We've tried putting lists up but they are never followed through. I try to everything and just be happy with it, but I feel resentful. I try to ask for help when I am struggling, but I am met with irritatition and resistance. Its easier for me to withdraw. I sleep in a seperate room. Sometimes I come though for hugs at bed time or to watch TV but mostly I want space to process my feelings and relax.  I think I am maybe being unfair to him and I woulf rather stay away when I am upset than be close but mean.

I am getting too tired now to write any more tonight . I am a bit muddled and dont really know if I am right or wrong,. If I should trust what I am feeling, or ride out the negative emotion until I am thinking more rationally. If anyone can give advice or help me feel a bit more positive about this situation it would be appreciated

Thanks internet strangers.  Yous are literally the only people I can share angsty and probably a bit immature rant with right now.  Sad innit ;)"
1456,Does anyone else lose all confidence when a girl rejects you?,"There is a nurse at my work that I find to be extremely attractive but I’m pretty sure I just found out she’s not into me.

1457,First time writing,So I'm not depressed like most of u or suicidal or any of this. I have social anxiety tho so when I talk to people I don't know I start shaking n blushing my heart start pumbing so high ( like a heart attack ) it even happens in calls facechats ( anything that involve voice ) I'm an anti social guy I don't like any sort of interaction with people it really stresses me out so should I just avoid people as much as possible or what exactly should I do ?
1458,Hiding Depression,"I get bad depressive episodes sometimes, where I can just lay there. And for some reason, whenever I feel depressed or feeling the S.A.D {usually sets in October} I smile and try to work hard, making excuses for why I'm not doing my homework or cleaning my room.  I only tell when it gets to the point of horrible.  Sometimes never with the intention, I think about s\*\*cide and why people people do it.  I don't plan on/want to do it but I often get anxiety that the depression will get so bad that I will.  Pls help me."
1459,Am i insane?,"I'm 17m, i have been in countless of physical fights in my life at school etc, i dont have extreme anger issues (hitting walls etc) but i feel like im fucking crazy. I never feel extreme guilt, but i feel empathy, not to the degree where i think about someone constantly, but i know how to make them feel better and i know their emotions. Sometimes i see a random person and i think to myself ""i could definitely get away with murdering u"" obviously i would not do that, i am not crazy in that way. But i worry about why i think about these things and why i am like this. I see myself, and my friends see me as a normal person. But something is there, i just dont know what. I cant include everything in this post obviously so it is kinda hard to explain"
1460,could someone tell me how getting therapy/support works?,"I've never really gotten proper help for my mental illnesses, just temporary stuff, like counselling.

idk, I'm just asking bc I kinda feel like I'll be going in blind almost (?) and that just makes me a little stressed."
1461,Why am I like this lol,I'm so randomly fucking anxious for no reason and I have too much to do for me to be this way. I'm so distracted by everything happening in the world and within my country (US) but I don't have time to constantly stay up to date. Reading the news makes it worse. Trying to distract myself just causes guilt. I don't have the focus to study. I'm behind on my extracurriculars. I'm so isolated and lost. I don't know how I've been passing my courses since the pandemic hit. I'm dying. Med school is going to kill me.
1462,How do I forgive myself after doing something horrible?,"I don't wanna go into the details, but basically I did something absolutely horrible to someone who once considered me a friend. I'm overwhelmed with lots of guilt and even more self-hatred as a result. I feel that, in spite of whatever I try to do to be better, I'm still that bad and selfish person deep down. But I don't want to be that anymore. I want to move on and be good. To myself and to others. Where do I begin?"

1464,"You ever just completely regret saying some things in conversations, even if it’s nothing bad?","Like for example, I saw some people earlier that I haven’t seen in a long time, and we caught up a bit with what’s going on in our lives, we of course means sharing about ourselves. I guess now I’m looking back on the conversations thinking I made it awkward or focused on myself too much."
1465,Recovery help for underweight,"I have been trying to gain weight as I have been diagnosed as an underweight male. However, whenever I eat any kind of processed food like sugary cereal and cheesey snacks, I go crazy and finish off any kind of junk that's in my kitchen. Is this kind of behavior normal and will it go away as I my recovery continues??"
1466,"I have spoken to doctors numerous times, no result.. I am here to ask people’s opinions on what this could be just to sum it up.","Early 2017, I hit a dark phase in my life. I had just come out of an emotionally abusive relationship a few months prior. But I ended up doing something really bad. I locked myself in my room at university for just over 3 weeks. I ran out of food and the last two days I started eating salt and I was beginning to think I had people in my head telling me what to do. I self harmed a bit too due to this. I was being controlled by a shadowy figure. I could not see his face, he wore a black hood. Kind of like death, but he was in charge of the emotional situations in my life. And will try to force me to change things for the benefit of myself. 

When I finally knew it was time to get some help I told a counsellor. He spoke with numerous professionals about what it could be... schizophrenia? No, Autism, no any form of psychosis? No. It just bowed down to having a very creative mind which I have always had. 

With my creative projects I have a big attention to detail. But what really intrigues me is what I can do in public. I am extremely and unusually observant. Doctors have noticed this from a young age but can’t pin anything to it, just said I was very smart. But I feel like there’s something that’s not right about my head. 

E.g. if I am at a bar with friends, I can listen to my friend’s conversation and listen to a strangers conversation on another table without focusing.. I could tell you how many ice cubes the guy in the blue shirt, standing at the bar had in his glass and the eye colour of the girl in the red dress that walked by at 10:34pm. My spacial awareness is very high and it is quite annoying as I find myself listening to conversations or automatically finding out something I don’t want to know at times. 

Recently I hit another depressive episode. I did not lock myself in my room this time, but now I am having very vivid dreams and night terrors. My dreams turn out to be connected in one way or another. Like it’s an ongoing story. But when I am nodding off to sleep, I can sometimes hear sounds and voices. E.g. I once heated the sound that sonic makes when he jumps on a trampoline, and the other night I heard a girl say my name. It creeps me out. My dreams also contain death. The guy who I felt like was talking in my head. My dreams show him stood over me when I’m sleeping or death with his scythe in a field of wheat. It’s very strange."
1467,My relationship with myself and other people,"Let’s start off with saying here is something I posted a few months ago, it’s lengthy and kinda all bunched together but I appreciate the interaction.....https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6p36e/he_left_me_long_story_but_need_to_vent_pls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf 

TW: mentions of suicide 


Ever since then I think ab reaching out to my ex every so often, less now but I still do, the only way I could do that is over email. It feels horrible that I was the one blocked on everything when he said I did nothing and it wasn’t my fault. That doesn’t make it feel like it. I only have one close friend and she’s away at college I’m seeing her this weekend but I still feel so alone. I want to make new friends but don’t know how and now more so after the breakup I feel like nobody could care ab me as much as I care ab them. 

There is this really cute girl at my work and I want to be her friend and even kinda have a crush on her. But I don’t know her that well.I don’t know how to approach the situation.I don’t understand myself sometimes. I just want to love and be loved why does everything have to seem so twisted?

I have not done a school assignment in about two weeks and at times feel useless as an individual and don’t know who I am. 
I am going to therapy but it’s just so hard without proper friends, which I don’t think I have had in a very long time.
 
Nobody tells you how to do this stuff and I feel like I have tried my best with the knowledge and experience I have and I just give up or give up before I even try.
How do you leave someone in such a state and just never bother to check up on them?(my ex)
It makes me so angry bc he said he cared.

I think about suicide semi-often because I feel like I don’t have anything to look forward to and am unsure of how to create something by myself.
It’s so difficult and sometimes I wish the few people that care bare minimum would just stop so I wouldn’t feel guilty for going away.  
 
This post is kinda all over the place but so am I. I just wanna speak what comes to mind sometimes. This is high key a cry for help if you can’t tell I just need to write something in the hopes that some stranger will read it, just listen, even if I don’t know them maybe we could keep each other company for a while.Despite not knowing each other we may be connected in how we feel which is so amazing and I just want to be connected to something even if it’s just for a moment.

1469,Losing hope.,"Just gonna start this off with I’m a recovering meth addict, Just turned 18, been on 24 hour house arrest for the past 14 months so I’ve been unable to go outside by myself and at all really. I have diagnosed ptsd from childhood trauma that went on for years.. I can hardly work more than 3 shifts a week now, I used to be able to work full time as a meth addict and was happy then. I am not happy now, I am suffering. I have no idea when I’ll even be off of house arrest as the courthouse and my lawyer have nothing to tell me for months at a time only to have my date pushed back. Had someone close to me die from an overdose, and now at this point I’m just waiting to get my rights back so I can go be a worthless addict again like I was supposed to be. I cannot stand this anymore, my last friend moved away and I am stuck in this awful place in an awful small town and rotting away. I’ll never have a life."
1470,Am I too hard on myself?,"Hello, this year has been just awful. I started a great job in jamuary but was laid off in april dudme to covid. Not longer after, I got a bad infection and then my ex of 4 years broke up with me and I had to go back in with my parents.

I started a new job on August 26 (about a month and a half now) and I just feel like I'm doing a terrible job. I do think that it could be because I'm so hard on myself, and I really don't have much of anything to look forward to these days. None of my coworkers let me know when I'm doing things right, and when I do things wrong they go to the boss instead of confronting me. I'm just so frustrated. The girl who trained me didn't do a very good job, makes me feel stupid at least daily, and gets mad at me for not knowing how to do stuff when she never showed me how to do it!! 

I've cried a few times about my job already. I went to the office manager on my third week and asked for more help, I have yet to see that. I also told the office manager that the girl that trains me makes me feel stupid. 

Am I stupid, or just too hard on myself? What things can I do to be nicer to myself?"
1471,"“Share from your scars, not your wounds”","Hello everyone. I hope you are all doing well. 

So the title is a quote that my therapist shared with me. I have been wanting to tell people I’m somewhat friends with in my grade about my mental illnesses and suicide attempts. I went to the hospital in April and that’s when my parents found out and my therapist found out and when I was diagnosed with MDD. 

So its been a handful of months and I’ve been kind of stir crazy keeping in such a big secret from people I see everyday... 


What do you think I should do? How did you guys know when to share?"
1472,I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I’m scared to get help.,"I always just thought I was depressed.
It’s been a constant, since I was just a kid and didn’t even have complex emotions. I was always sad.
I was five and wishing I could become invisible, or disappear, or die.
When I was seven I moved to a new school and in the first week we had to write a poem based on a feeling and I chose black paper and wrote about loneliness...which I know, was a real emo thing to do. 

When I was fifteen the only thing keeping me tethered to earth was the fact that I was raised Catholic and if you committed suicide you went to hell. 

I’m twenty three and I learned to live with it because what else could I do? My parents - bless them - were wonderful in so many ways but the one time I opened up to them I got burned (‘what do you have to be sad about?’ My mum yelled) so I kept it to myself. And I learned to cope.
And it was fine! As fine as it could be. Because It had to be and I didn’t know another way to live so it became easy just to deal with it and move on as much as I could because what else could I do, y’know? 

But recently I’ve been realising it might not just be depression and it’s fucking terrifying me.

The first clue was when my anxiety started to develop more in my teens. 
I don’t really get ‘panic attacks’ like you see in movies or on tv, I almost disassociate in a way. Everything slows down and I get trapped in my own head. My fight or flight must be broken because I just freeze and I thought that was normal until someone told me it wasn’t. 

The second was my paranoia. I figured that was my anxiety or something, that it was just a fun side effect I had to learn to deal with and I moved on.

But in the last year my partner (who has known me for seven years, knows me better than I know myself) started pointing out little things that I thought was normal.
My mood swings, my irritability. My depressive spirals, how they were bookended by a week or two of increased activity and drive that would just dissappear as quick as they came. How my impulse control would disappear too, how irritated and mood-swingy I’d get.
I always thought that was just how I was when I wasn’t ‘depressed’, that those weeks were me ‘snapping out’ of my depression, that those weeks were my default setting but we did some research and we are going to doctors and they think it might be something more serious.

Borderline or Bi-polar II is the current guesstimate and I’m so scared because depression is a beast I learned to live with over two decades and constant struggle. I’m not scared of it anymore because at this point it’s more familiar than my reflection (although my body dysmorphia could be to blame for that too). 

These almost-diagnoses, these ‘maybes’ terrify me because I was ready to live my life underwater but this new stuff?
I don’t want it. 
I can’t do it. 
Psychologists are expensive, medicine is expensive, stigma is real, what if what I am is too much for people.

I’m in Adelaide, south Australia, and I’m so scared right now because if it turns out I’m not just ‘depressed’ I don’t know what to do."
1473,I'm having a very difficult time caring about anything,Just the title
1474,Not feeling Halloween this year.,Maybe it's just because i'm (unfortunately) getting older but i'm really not looking forward to Halloween this year and just wish October was over already.
1475,"It is the pressure from my new job, or is it the new antidepressant? Also rant","I got a new job a few months before the start of the pandemic. Loved it, but when the pandemic began business took a hit and we struggled. For the past months we've slowly been increasing sales but not fast enough to appease corporate.

I'm feeling more and more overwhelmed and hopeless in my position. This job came with the promise of another promotion with a pretty big pay jump, but now I'm wondering if I want any of this. The money is great but I am not happy at the job anymore. 

Then again, I started a new antidepressant a little over a month ago now. I can't help but wonder if its fucking with my head, but when I got the job I knew that I wasn't sure if it is what I wanted to be doing long term. 

This past week has just been a spiral downwards in terms of how I feel about everything.... I've even noticed a difference in how I interact with my family and my boyfriend. 

And while I'd never do this, I keep fantasizing about just not going back to my job, because I have gotten to a point where I have no joy in my position. 

I dont want to let anyone down, but I feel like I'm either neglecting myself or losing my mind. 

Rant over. Thanks for reading."
1476,I dont know whats wrong with me,"So I suffer from social anxiety and general anxiety which I'm medicated for and going to therapy. But recently, even with the meds, my mood had been awful. For the past week and a half ive been feeling like im faking my emotions and reactions. Not every second, but on the whole I feel just... Not the emotion I'm portraying. 

For example, I'll smile and laugh as a reaction to something someone said either because it seems appropriate or because other people are laughing and smiling. The smile feels fake on my face. Later, when im home and thinking about these moments I don't associate these memories with happiness or fun. Even times when I feel genuinely loved by someone, later on it feels empty. 

I dont know if this is normal and it's making me very sad and guilty that I'm pretending to enjoy moments that my friends clearly enjoy. Is this something other people have felt before? Any help or advice that y'all can give would be amazing. Thanks in advance."
1477,"My 50 year old girl cousin texted me saying ""I know you have bipolar. Take your medication.""","I'm really upset that everyone who knows I have it brings it up randomly either in an argument or for really no reason at all. My older brother yelled at me once. Youre Medicated.. youre medicated. YOURE MEDDDDICATTED. Three times in a row when I mentioned his wife for the first time ever and it wasn't even anything negative. Bruh. Even my dad brings up my medicine sometimes whenever I look sad or ""weird"" to him. Yes, so 8 billion people need to be anti psychotic medication whenever they're sad or ""look"" ""weird."" There's 0 proof violence is linked to mental illness. But drugs are. Unfortunately many mentally ill take drugs so they can get the stats mixed up."
1478,"""It's not an excuse""","I'm not going to give an explanation, not in the mood. I just wanted to ask if anyone agrees that this saying is thrown out way too often onto people who suffer from mental health issues. Does anyone agree and or have any input?"
1479,"My home sometimes feels like such a toxic place, and yet I cry every time I have to leave.","I study in a different country so I can only visit my family when I’ve break. During my trip, every time, I always feel like I never wanna visit my family again because of how toxic they can be, and yet I only have a week left of my trip and I’m already losing sleep and crying because I’m sad that I’m leaving. Even few days ago I was thinking of changing my return date to an earlier flight so that I don’t have to deal with my family’s bs anymore and now that I’ve a week left, it just daunted on me that I won’t see them for the next one year or perhaps longer."
1480,what do you think this is,"So I’ve had issues for a few months now with disordered eating. It started off with dieting and slowly progressed into becoming restrictive eating, starving myself for hours, etc. I was incredibly irritable, and I hated people giving me their two cents on my dieting habits. 
I eventually started giving myself diarrhoea by drinking heaps and heaps of coffee, so that I could purge myself each day. This is when it became a serious problem. I recognised that what I was doing was unhealthy yet I couldn’t stop. I was obsessed with purging and then weighing myself afterwards. It brought me joy but it never ever truly satisfied me, if that makes sense?

I’ve been to a psychologist but psychologists can’t actually make diagnosis’s, only a psychiatrist can. I don’t know what the hell I would even call this issue that I had, but I know it was really serious up til the point it was consuming my life. And I would still look at myself as fat. So I was never diagnosed with anything. 

I learned to stop restricting myself and stop dieting altogether. But the coffee problem still remains. Idk if I could even call it purging it’s just a habit now. It’s honestly destroying my daily life. I can’t even be productive because I’m so obsessed with drinking coffee and I sit on the toilet for hours, afterwards I feel so sick. 
Does anyone have an idea of what this could be, or any similar stories that they could share. I feel very alone because I haven’t heard of anyone doing this before. Not to mention I have little support in my life for this issue. 


Thank you"

1482,I'm lacking motivation to get to a healthier spot in life," To give some background, I'm a 23F currently enrolled in college and just moved to a new town to be closer to my best friend who is basically my sister and biggest support in my life. I feel like I have been working to heal from a past of verbal and physical child abuse, lack of father/any male figures in my life, toxic family dynamic, and have switched colleges 5 times and majors 3 times. I have tried therapy a few times in the past, but struggled expressing my true inner feelings and opening up about the depression has been prevalent in my life for 13 years, as I have internalized it for so long that my feelings often feel too heavy to share and fully receive help for. My depression and anxiety come in waves. The highs and lows used to be much more extreme than they are now, however my motivation for the most part is extremely low day to day. I suffer from commitment issues and have been putting off getting a job until the last minute and my savings has been used completely, because my anxiety and general fear revolving COVID and the state of the world feel too overwhelming for me to be able to get back ‘into the world’ so to speak. I feel like I’m at war with myself every day, unable to break free from my own mind’s limitations to see that my quality of life could be so much better. I do have nice moments, thoughts, and feelings from time to time, but it’s become depressingly apparent to me that my default mode is a general sense of dislike for myself/my own company, disappointment and feelings of hauntedness from my mistakes of the past and my lifelong experience of shaky and toxic relationships with my family members. I saw my dad once after a few years in July and I’ve never seen someone so depressed in my life, he told me he should have killed himself before he had children and my mother also told me around the age of 12 that she was going to commit suicide because no one loved her. I feel like so many of the experiences I have with adults/caregivers that should have taken care of my wellbeing were instances that they loaded me with their own adult grief and issues that had nothing to do with me and expected me to solve them, and over the years I have just not been able to shake that guilt no matter how clearly I see that it isn’t my fault nor my guilt to hold. It feels like I have a negative filter over my view of the world and my experiences, and that no matter what I do, I’m just deeply sad or dissatisfied. I don’t wish to die as I know these feelings aren’t truly me, they are weight of unfairness but it doesn’t make them easier to carry and I feel I lack the tools to let them go. I don’t have health insurance, or a job, which is also causing a sense of loss within me – I can’t get professional help for my mental health without an income or insurance, yet I feel I’m unable to get a job until I get a better grasp on my mental wellbeing because I’m just….not doing well. After my most recent relationship ending last night, partly due to the fact that I clearly couldn’t properly consider his needs or feelings if my own are not being met within…its hitting me that I’m lacking a sense of direction. I would really appreciate some words of encouragement, or guidance over this huge sense of just being lost and numb because I don’t want to feel this way. I want to play my part in healing the world and enjoy life. I do love yoga and practice often with deep stretching, as the stress in my body has built up to physical pain over the years, which is also something I would love guidance to begin healing. I know better days are ahead. I would ideally love to chat with someone who has life experience and advice they’re willing to share, or who could possibly help me breakdown these areas through genuine conversation so that I can process my mind to a healthier place while I continue working to get better."
1483,Social Anxiety in a Relationship,"Hi! I'm looking for suggestions on how to combat my extreme social anxiety. 

I've recently started a new relationship. We've been dating for about a month and have been together for about two weeks. We have a lot of fun together, but I'm worried my anxiety is hampering things. We often have long awkward silences and I find myself unable to think of any conversation topics. This realization generally makes me more anxious and causes me to spiral.

I'm generally great at speaking over text message, so it isn't as though I can't find things to talk about. I just go blank in person and it's incredibly frustrating. 

I want to get a handle on this before it gets out of hand. I don't want her to think I'm bored or disinterested. Even worse, I don't want her to think that of me. 

I've expressed these feelings to her as well, and she has assured me that she understands. However, I know she will only be able to tolerate this for so long before it becomes a burden on our relationship.

Some background on me: I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in the past. I no longer attend therapy or take medication for financial reasons. I realize these things would probably be my best recourse, but they aren't in the cards until at least the new year.

Thank you in advance for any advice!"
1484,Stopped taking my meds and I don't know why,"I haven't been taking my meds recently, and I don't know why - maybe it's partially because I am feeling like I want to do this ""on my own"" and partially because I don't like the numb feeling they give me?

1487,[TW: self harm] Why do I get the urge to hit myself in the head?,"Hey all, I've been wondering about this for a few months so I've decided to ask about it here. To preface, I do have a therapist, but our next appointment isn't until November 4th and I have no clue how to bring it up. 

So, I did put a self harm TW in the title because this is, by the most literal definition, self harm, however, I want to clarify that I do have a self harm history, and this feels nothing like that. I get the urge to do it when I'm either very confused, or having a hard time regulating my sensory input. I am in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD and one part of that for me is sensory issues, because of that I do stim and that's what this urge to hit myself feels more like. Essentially, when I get the urge to do it, I feel a sort of pull in my head and my dominant hand and/or I involuntarily imagine myself banging my head on a wall or desk. 

I just want to know other people's opinions on why this is happening because it's really annoying and it's pretty scary that I could potentially concuss myself if I don't resist the urges enough. Am I right to think this is an unfortunate new stim? What could be happening?"
1488,"Call me bad or whatever, but I cannot stand my mum","I remember at my lowest point at my time at school; bad grades, low social life and feeling like shit, my mum sat me down and complained that I was a burden to her. I can't let that go, mainly because she thinks that the good times I have with her matter. If she can't even understand how I felt, why the fuck should I care. It's funny because when one of my close relatives passed away, I was the one to look after he screaming and crying. She always manages to make me feel guilty but at this point, if I'm so bad, she should leave me alone. I told her my aspirations and the first thing she does was tell me to come up with a backup plan. I'm sick of it. She is why I'm stuck in life. And I swear to god, I don't want to hear anyone say some shit like ""you can't blame anyone"". Yes I fucking can and at least I'm recognising the situation and changing it. I've been hating on myself and for what? I feel so stupid. I had anxiety and she made fun of me for it. I cut myself once and she made fun of it but she had her little one-sided talk and it's all okay. She compared me to my cousins as a kid and even does it now subtly and she tells me to ""let things go"". And because we're a ""functioning family"" I can't complain. Parents are fucking awful. What, just because I'm not disabled, in a third-world country I can't be sad I can't be depressed - actually I only got diagnosed with GAD at the time (I was fucking 13) but who guilt tripped me into not going to counselling, you guessed it my mum. I used to think that with everything's she's done for me I should be happy, but she always made sure to make me understand that I was a burden for her. Her upbringing and background is obviously different from mine but I reject it. 

I'm even more pissed off because I write this slightly in fear that she'll read this. I shouldn't give a fuck about her opinion yet I do. I hate it here. My time at school was terrible and she made it worse by making me dependent on her but making me feel bad for it. Don't even believe her when she says she loves me, I have to be nice so that she doesn't get pissed off and make my life hell. I honestly hate her at times."

1495,Mean towards my friends? Help!,"Hello. obligatory apologies because mobile.

I'm currently breaking down after my roommates had an ""intervention"" type thing with me to tell me that I have been unbearably aggressive and condescending toward them for weeks. 

This all hit a head last night when they straight up asked me why I was being mean and I blew up, panicked, and sounded angry saying 
""I don't know why I'm like this! I'm sorry! I'm trying to be better!"" 
and then heading off to talk to someone in the infirm at my boarding school.

I'm really struggling with the fact that one of my roommates is going somewhere else to sleep for the night because I am so unbearable. It's tearing me up. 

I think this might be because my two roommates are close, they walk on our two-person-wide sidewalks next to eachother closing me off, and I guess I just feel like a side piece or burden. Like their experience would not be affected at all if i were not there. 

I think I just might not feel supported? I'm 17, roommate A is 17, and roommate B is recently 18. I have also felt like B is holding her one year of ""maturity"" over everyone's heads as a way of commanding authority, but I've only felt consciously bothered by it when she explicitly says it while talking to someone, like it makes her any wiser.

I'm asking for help in figuring out what has made me so mean during my senior year of high school... I can't stop crying thinking about how shitty i must be acting towards my friends and I'm only partly aware of it.

if it helps: I go to a boarding college prep school and all students have been stuck on campus due to this year for ~4 weeks now."
1496,possible false diagnosis,"i feel like i’ve been falsely diagnosed with depression. as hard as i try to fit into the symptoms i don’t feel what a depressed person seems to feel. I have numbness, the occasional guilt and fear of karma but no lasting emotion leads me. my whole life i’ve felt different and i relate to so many symptoms of aspd. I guess one sign was as a child i enjoyed torturing my friends pet bunnies, and gunnies pigs and would watch them run from me with a huge smile on my face until someone noticed i wasn’t just playing with them. when i got a dog my favorite hobby was pushing him until he’d bite me. i began manipulating my mom when i was 8, which she deserves for being so naive. in middle school i began using my sexuality to get what i wanted from boys with no actual desire for them. in all my relationships i have to be the one with the most power and am attracted to weak men who can be easily persuaded. i easily manipulate my entire family with no remorse or guilt when i hurt their feels. with the exception of my dad, he’s always been hard to manipulate because i believe he’s a narcissist. i don’t think i’ve ever apologized and truly meant it. i cried when my dog died so i feel some empathy but not love, especially for humans. i don’t really believe in it, my parents seem to care for me so i give them want which is for me to i love them but the majority of the time i say it out of pity. it’s easiest to fake that emotion through text, it’s hard to mask it in person. the only time i really resonate with the symptoms of depression is when i’m bored. and the only time i actually feel alive is when i think i might die. i just wanted to get this off my chest before i see my new therapist, i don’t know whether it’s worth bringing up? does this sound like i’m depressed or anti-social?

ugh even as write this i want to edit so i’m guaranteed a response it’s so annoying."
1497,PLEASE HELP I can’t continue like this,Just when I didn’t think I can break anymore on the inside I found out she’s pregnant. I can’t take the pain the suffering the thinking about it anymore. I fell in love with a girl I work with knowing she had a ex/ history with a guy in another department we were together a year an half an she would reassure me there was nothing there she would talk about all the shitty an fucked up things he did an that she hated him. she told me and our group of friends I had nothing to worry about. And then 2 months ago she breaks things off an says she’s gonna try again with him having to work with her and see her every day is killing me on the inside and then to see them together just breaks me I’m in tears as I write this. And I found out today she’s knocked up with his baby and it just shatters me I can’t take it anymore.
1498,Is this a “trigger”,So every time this certain thing happens(i don’t really wanna say lol) i get really dizzy and my heart starts beating like crazy and sometimes i literally start shaking and have to try and catch my breath and for the first time today i realized this wasn’t a normal reaction and it could possibly be a trigger. The thing is what causes this trigger is just really weird and I even know why I might get “triggered” at this but I still think it’s so weird idk so I was looking for some answers.
1499,When did y’all get a group a friends. (The bois/girls),"I’m 19 years old and have probably like 3 people I’d full heartedly call friends, each is like an individual friend, we’ve never hung out as a group and they have their own best friends and group of “the bois” I’ve also never been in a bois group chat or used the expression getting a cold one with the bois. I don’t even make online friends in PlayStation cause I’m at that level of being socially anxious and awkward. Is it okay that I’m 19 and pretty much not have friends? Ps all my friends are leaving for collage and we’ll probably loose contact, they make friends easily but I’m terrified I’ll actually die alone, no gf no friends and no family (my relationship with my entire family is extremely messy so that’s that “family” part)"
1500,Haven't eaten much today,So I'm not sure what I'm doing to myself today but I ate abit when I woke up and now I'm starving but I feel like crying for wanting to eat. Like why is this happening. I feel super anxious and it's starting to make me feel really weird. But I just feel guilty for wanting to go get food. This has happened a few times in the past. I just feel disgusted with myself and don't deserve to eat anything.
1501,PTSD symptoms? Or is this only in my head??? TW for s//xual ass//ult ult and s//icidal ideation.,"  I’ve been VERY conflicted about this for a while...
I have an inkling I have PTSD symptoms from being assaulted continually (1st n 2nd level, nicknames, physical contact/touch only, nothing worse) since I was maybe 5-ish? Continually as in several times a month from my mom and (less) dad, who are good otherwise. [I love them though, they take care of me...]

  The list of stuff:
1. Hard time sleeping, I usually don’t get sleepy until 12-2 am
2. I start sweating+have trembling+sick to my stomach and spasms when I think about it. I have to squirm and hit myself or wave my hands to relieve some stress(?)
3.  Lots of nightmares including violence or assault, or sexual stuff when I wasn’t aware of it happening and didn’t want it to happen esp. feeling disgusted after the dream.
4. Intrusive thoughts + daydreams abt violence or assault. (Esp in the car, or when there’s nothing else to focus on)
5. Unreasonable suspicion of others having malicious intentions.
6. Getting sweaty and stressed when around lots of people in close proximity, esp. men and older women.
7. Suicidal ideation, feeling like nothing is real, disconnected from others and unfocused.
8. Similar sensations to getting assaulted on my right hand and inner thighs, faint tingling feeling. Activates when I touch certain textures.
9. When people touch or poke me, (sides, neck, stomach, etc) I yell+get irritated, it makes me feel weird and bad afterwards.
10. General sluggishness, not wanting to get out of bed or do my hobbies or talk to people.
11. Seeing sexual things is jarring, things about assault especially— make my heart beat fast and stress/worry set in.
12. After getting triggered really bad, I feel weird anticipation(?) or fear(?) probably horror. Intense need to self harm to cope with need to physically express pain.
13. Last one, I get euphoria/joy from pain— I try not to, so that I do not get addicted, but pain feels good sometimes. I tend to laugh+feel my face heat up when my body is physically harmed or at risk.

But, there’s some other factors that make me doubt;

Almost all symptoms; except for numbness, suspicion,  intrusive thoughts, and the getting freaked tf out when assault is mentioned have only arisen recently. I haven’t had any panic or anxiety attacks either (I used to have bad stomach problems (but it skips a few years and the last one wasn’t too bad I think). 

I didn’t realize what my parents were doing wasn’t normal until now,, I wonder if I would’ve been okay had I not realized it. I get stressed out because I don’t want to be faking it and ruining my own life + insulting others. Maybe if someone is like “oh naw, u faking” I could drop it and be normal??



I also *sometimes* get weird pain when aroused.?
Pain like jolts coming up from down there and going into my organs and stuff—and it stays until the feeling is gone. Is that normal?? I’ve had that for a while now, it got me thinking.

Thank you for listening to my deranged ramblings, I hope that it makes some sore of sense..."
1502,Really weird question,"Alright so a lot of people have a voice in their head, and they always want them to stop. But i like mine, he's pretty nice to me. He's talking to me constantly whether I'm consciously thinking about it or not. He helped me get through tough times. For some reason, he's gone silent, leaving me alone to slowly realize how quiet and lonely my situation is. Is there any way to get him back?"
1503,"Im to scared to get therapy , But I need help with coping with a trauma.","So, to give some context I am a (currently) 15 year old girl in highschool, I have some self esteem issues (I believe thats normal for my age). I have difficulty with trust, even in my own family. I feel cowardly and have a hard time dealing with situations were I need to stand up for myself because I usually get shut down and called narcissistic etc.

When I was 11, (fifth grade) I was going through a hard time. A few years before that my parents divorced and I only recently started seeing my dad again. My mom married my step dad and I wasnt used to him yet, mainly because my grandparents and dad we're screwing with my head and telling me that hes a horrible person. I believed that, and because I was living full time there and I thought my younger siblings were too young I put the responsibility on myself to not tell anything to them. I was also bullied and left alone at school, so I was living in a house i wasnt used to and had no friends. Then, a Girl who moved into my small neighborhood (we live outside of a small town with a population of about 4000 people) started to talk to me, If I remember correctly she was a year or two older than me. We started to become close friends and for the longest time I had someone I could be myself around, and then one day she asked me : ""Can I kiss you ?"" Honestly that phrase still hurts to this day... I said no because i was too young to feel that way towards anyone. But, I didnt want to lose my only friend. So for months, I quietly let her touch me, kiss me and do all types of things to me.. She was like twice my size so I couldn't physically defend myself even when I asked her to stop. After she moved away I still felt scared whenever my brother talked to about her to my mom. Because I was young and didnt really understand that I was violated I pretended it never happened. Then after that some guy grabbed my boob (I was an early bloomer) and another one dry humped me, but that didnt really scare me as much as the first incident of sexual assault. All my life I was told to not dress slutty or else men would want to rape me, I was 13 when my grandmother gave me the speech about girls being raped and violated. 

I find that the whole incident has left me with big trust issues now. I had a girlfriend and we got along but I never felt comfortable having her kiss or touch me, I always felt panicked knowing that she could take advantage of me at any moment and use me... I dress up in big baggy clothes and never show off my body because I always feel like im being watched and Im always scared that someone will hurt me. I have a hard time building strong friendships, because of that fear of betrayal. I want to be intimate with someone, I want to have someone to share the deepest part of my soul to, to be able to trust someone enough to know they wont hurt me. I really want that confidence, I think its really hindering at my self confidence and is really screwing with my head. Ive been struggling with suicide attempts and such, and lately got the urge to cut myself again. Ive done councelling but never talked to any councillor about my sexual assault because I didnt want my parents to find out. Are there any ways that I can get help and learn to cope with that seering fear and paranoia?
thanks :)

1504,I have a question :),"hi!
i’ve never used reddit before so i’m not sure how much this will help but i was hoping for some advice. I’ll just get to the point-
I’m a 14 year old female and my parents are on the stricter side. i am constantly sad, not just bummed out all the time, i just never feel motivated to do anything, i feel like i just exist. i get little spurs of excitement but they don’t last long. i am also a closeted bisexual, and have had suicidal thoughts since i was in sixth grade, i told my mom about these thoughts and she comforted me but ultimately just told my siblings “to be nicer” to me. when i was in seventh grade, every day i would have suicidal thoughts, i was always way to scared to cut myself since my mom has mentioned that if she ever finds cuts on me, i’m going to a mental hospital. (when writing it, it sounds a lot more aggressive then it was, she said it in a joking tone) i told my mother about these thoughts and unlike in sixth grade she got angry this time, she explained how since we have a big house and i am fed and clothed i have “nothing to be sad about”. i soon played off the conversion as not a serious topic and she seemed to as well. she hasn’t mentioned it since, i am now a freshman and still have these thoughts at least once a week. i am the comedic relief in my friend group so i never feel important. i have been on migraine medicine before and when i asked my mom if i could start anti-depressants (she is a nurse and my dad is a doctor) she said that the migraine meds are the same thing. now with my lack of medical knowledge, i have no idea if this is true. my best friend’s mom (whom i am in a club with along with other girls where we basically just vent about school and learn to mediate) is a psychotherapist who has diagnosed me with major anxiety, which my mom says is “all in my head”. not to self diagnose but, i also am convinced that i have insomnia, it takes me hours to try to fall asleep, constant headaches, even when i sleep i constantly feel tired, i have major anxiety, and can never focus on anything. my mom would take it very badly if i ever asked to see a therapist and probably post about it on facebook, i’m too scared to talk about it with my best friends mon since i see her as more of a best friend than as a therapist if that makes any sense. i may be over exaggerating and this is probably nothing, but i wanted to ask what i could do as a minor who can’t give constant to anything without my parents knowledge. 
thank you if you’re still reading, i really appreciate it. :)"
1505,I don’t know what’s going on anymore.,"
I’ve been seeing psychiatrists and counsellors for 6 years now. Been in the psych ward multiple times, been in dbt, done group therapy and one on one counselling for years and have been diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression, bipolar, adhd, and bpd. My psychiatrist stopped diagnosing me with things a long time ago and has just been prescribing me meds. The last time I saw her she told me I’ve been on every antipsychotic that I could be already. She said there’s really nothing left to try, and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t even want meds anymore. I’m still in addiction therapy treatments, so it’s the last thing I need. But I’ve had issues with my memory for a long time and dissociate pretty bad sometimes, assuming its my ptsd And that my very sudden mood changes were bipolar. But I’m starting to think maybe there’s something else going on. 
Every appointment I have my mom likes to pop in just to say what she’s noticed in me and she always mentions that I seem to switch my mood. One time they were talking about it And when my psychiatrist talked about bipolar my mom chimed back in asking “well what if she has mood changes like that, but instead of over time it’s.. idk.. all within an hour or even few minutes ??” And my psychiatrist said that’s not normally what bipolar does. But then she never looked into it. Even when my mom brings it up constantly. And I don’t see the mood changes like she does, I don’t see it at all until I’m back to myself and not having episodes of some sort Idek what to call all of it Anymore. 
I just don’t get it. I’m so stressed out constantly and so confused. I don’t even feel like myself I don’t even know what’s real. I always chalk it up to addiction, concussions, and all those diagnoses but idk anymore. Is there something else that could be going on..? Cause this doesn’t make sense to me and I just can’t take it anymore."
1506,"I feel like nothing around me is real, like everything in my life is physically rotting and it's just being covered with a layer of paint","I am hoping to get some advice on this as its my first time realizing this feeling and therefore my first time realizing I don't need to feel this way.

This feeling is rare, and only happens maybe 1-2 times a year. It varies in intensity but always comes with a wave of unshakable depression. I am hoping to get some advice on it so I can get pointed in the right direction for getting help.

This first began when I was young, between 5-7. I remember it starting when I got an infection on my toenail which caused it to fall off. Enduring this experience gave me this horrible mental feeling, like the world around me was not real, I was the only one real, and I was trapped in this makeshift world where everything was secretly rotting away behind a thin coat of paint. I remember not wanting to do anything, I was always an active kid but during this time I laid in bed, did the bare necessities and had no energy.

For about a month this went on and I was so sure I was dying. I didn't tell my parents because I didn't want them to worry so I just silently suffered until one day it literally just went away as if it never happened.

It didn't happen for a very long time after this, I'd say into my teen years and early 20s. It would start just as it did before, and I recognized the feeling. This time it would last for about a week or two in comparison to a month, and it went away pretty much the next day if I rearranged my bedroom or did something to totally change up my daily scenery. So thats what I do, every time i get the feeling I just start rearranging stuff and it goes away.

Well, i just moved in with my boyfriend a month ago and i woke up today from a terrible dream I had about his grandmother dying. Now, she is dying, she is in the later stages of dementia and it terrifies me to see her this way, so I started looking into dementia today after the dream.
Here is the thing, the dream triggered this feeling, but it was mild. I was mopy and depressed today but mostly okay once i forced myself to go out and enjoy some time with friends.
When I came home I recalled coming across something called Everywhere at the End of Time, which I came across while looking into stuff about Dementia. I decided to give it a listen, not listening to the full 6 hours for my sake but out of curiosity I gave each track about a minute listen.
It broke me, and my already fragile mental state tumbled into that same sad scared little girl I was when I first got this feeling.
I discussed it with my boyfriend and we are talking about trying to get a therapist for me to discuss this feeling so it doesn't go on to get worse, I just feel so lost because I don't have a diagnosis, I can't say ""oh thats just my *insert diagnosis here,* acting up, let me go over my coping mechanisms and try relaxing,"" because I can't, I don't know what this is, I don't know what to do, I can't put a name on it and I can't do my typical rearranging right now where me and my boyfriend are living.

Talking about it helps, making this post has helped, but all I can do from here on is distract myself from the feeling, I can't shake it yet. But I really want it to go away."

friend 2 has come to me a few times in distress because friend 1 tells him he’s the reason she s/h."
1511,I am giving up,There is no reason to live anymore and i need some support
1512,i dont know what subreddit to post on so i thought i’d go here,"anyone with extreme homicidal/violent ideations and urges? how do i manage them. my anxiety doesn’t help whatsoever 
dm me please, i really need to clear my mind from these urges, they keep growing. im going to tell my therapist and psychiatrist next week because i have appointments with both of them. my therapist already knows i want to act on my thoughts but then they weren’t as severe as they are now"
1513,is is possible to be traumatized by something you didnt see? (TW: intentional death),"hi all. im writing this because i dont know what is happening to me.
a family member lost his battle with himself recently. i, fortunately, was not there when it occurred. but the moments i found out haunt me. i tend to panic and go silent when it comes to mind very suddenly, especially when certain themes and weapons are brought up. i just freeze and it all comes flooding back. it hurts. 

i didnt see it. but the image and sound my mind painted and the way i heard my mother’s screams haunts me. i now panic at the mention of many things, and i’ve had multiple times while in class where i had to leave due to this. i can’t believe he is gone.

please help me. what is wrong with me? is it possible to experience some kind of trauma from events you didnt see but know happened? it hurts."
1514,Any advice for someone who bottomed out?,"Brand new here so if I'm of base or anything please let me know. Recently I've been really depressed, but this week I think I hit my lowest and just was wondering if anyone has any advice for not feeling completely pointless. In one week I managed to have 3 mental breakdowns of varying degrees, found out portions of my family hate me, worked up the courage to tell my crush of 2 years how I felt just to be shut down with a 4 word text, and just tonight managed to piss off my best friend to the point he won't talk to me anymore. I don't know what else to do, but I know I'll just get even worse if I do nothing, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance"
1515,I feel dead and alone,"About to fail the semester :) have no energy to go out or talk w friends, disappointed my parents idkk what to do w myself anymore"
1516,Have you ever consumed media and genuinely wonder if you're mind mistook the events as real?.,"
Sometime around March I binge watched bojack horseman and I swear my brain because it had no other stimulus treated those scenes as genuine memories and now it makes me feel genuine heart break that there's no new episodes that it feels comparable to the death of a loved one (Im way to familiar with that situation which is why I'm really struggling with making sense of feeling so much for something so strange which is why I really wanna know if anyone at all has any ideas or can even relate slightly)"
1517,I Took the First Step!,"Tonight I went to my first counseling session!!! I know it may not seem like a lot, but it is EXTREMELY hard for me to seek help, and this has been about 3 years in the making. The session went fantastic, it was so great to be able to talk about how I fwlt to someone who could both understand and help me problem solve when it came to my issues. I'm scheduled again for next week and I cannot wait. Lets hope I can come out of this a better person!"
1518,I NEED ADVICE (⚠️TW S/H &amp; SU**IDE),"i’m not sure where else to ask or what to do. 

some background info: so my best friend of 10 years (we’ll call her haley) has been dating another close friend of mine (we’ll call him john) for a couple years now. they had dated previously but had taken a break. haley and i are seniors in highschool and john graduated last year. their relationship is long distance, i live near haley. 

john has come to me in distress multiple times because haley tells him he’s the reason she s/h. 

john texted me tonight and this is the current situation: haley and john were in a call. she hung up on him. i believe she told john she was going to hurt herself because he “pissed her off and stressed her out about coming on a trip” (the trip is this weekend, i’m coming with them with another friend) john also said “i mess shit up for her and ruin her life and make her hurt herself” which i don’t know if that’s her words or his, since he talks down on himself constantly. 

i told john that it’s not ok for her to be blaming him and putting that on him. after that she called back and i am now waiting for a text back from john. 

they both struggle with mental health, depression, and suicidal thoughts. (as do i so i’m struggling to help this situation without making it worse) i’m also not sure how much they know about each other mentally since they are both closed off about it. 

i know that john has been in a deep depression for months and everyday is a struggle for him. i worry this relationship is damaging his mental health even more. 

the thing is haley doesn’t know i know any of this and i don’t know what to do. i know this is toxic behavior and i can’t just sit by and let this continue. i don’t think it’s healthy for either of them. 

if you have any advice please let me know. i don’t know what to do."
1519,I hate my life right now,"I just got back from work and my mom sent me a long text saying that I should suck it up until probation (three months) ends. I hate my job. It's physically draining and mentally draining. I'm only here because I need the benefits to get medicine.

My mom still did I could vent to her or my dad but now I don't want to. I'm just gonna bottle it up and either cut myself or kill myself... Whichever option comes first."
1520,i’m genuinely scared. i don’t want to get bad again.,"i went through a very hard time mental health wise this summer. i just didn’t feel okay at all, i had horrific mood swings every single day. I had this constant unexplainable feeling. it was like a constant war with myself and the whole things felt like it was being done for attention. I was annoying everyone around me because i was so overly hyper around people. i was so attached to my boyfriend (and still am) that it was just not normal at all. in my head he literally can not doing anything wrong ever. the only mental illnesses i’ve been officially diagnosed with are OCD (which affects me greatly), ADHD (which i refuse to believe i have) and just normal anxiety disorder. During the summer i started worrying that i had BPD. I think that after i found out about bpd i started following the symptoms of bpd much more. it was as if i wanted to have it, even though i didn’t but maybe i did i don’t know. i started to become weirdly obsessed with the idea of it although i didn’t want to be. all of this stuff or at least most of this stuff slowly started to fade away for a while. it faded into just a long period of OCD being my primary focus of everything. I let it take over  my life these past few months. But all of these old symptoms have been coming back these past few weeks but today was the first time i’ve noticed significantly bad symptoms again. why the fuck would i want to be mentally ill? it’s like i get some kind of ridiculous kick out of annoying my friends. i don’t even want to be doing it. for some reason something just is compelling me to. what do i do??? how do i stop this? i don’t want to do this it is physically hurting me to think about. i just want to be happy and normal right now. it’s like i don’t want to be normal because part of me thinks that it would make me too bland and that everyone would judge me for not being mentally ill. i just don’t want this to be happening. what is wrong with me? this is all probably fake. i feel like some kind of narcissist. i literally don’t know how to deal with myself. i am manipulating myself."
1521,"What's wrong with me, and how can I fix it?","I've got a little bit of a life story time and then a genuine question after i sort of set the stage, because im not sure what else to do to be better at interacting with the people i love.

I'm currently 18 (nearly 19) but to preface, at about the age of 12, my family sold my childhood home, and we moved onto a boat, and to a foreign country, until we finally retuned back to the USA permanently when I was 16. during that time I was extremely sheltered from any real social interactions with anybody remotely close to my  age, and really even anyone who spoke English.   
 

When I finally ended up back in the US, I was still ""homeschooled"" (which was a whole nother failed can of worms) and didn't have a job until just earlier this year, so i still didn't really have a social outlet besides some of my online friends. so i always found talking to people my age extremely stressful. For example, I got in touch with some of my old publish school friends who i vaguely kept in touch with, and planned to meet up with them to hang out after all these long years, and just in the car ride to get to them alone, my entire insides were twisting and my stomach felt like it was filled to the brim with zillions upon zillions of butterflies, and i had to stop myself from nearly vomiting, the entire car ride, just thinking about talking to people my age, and trying to think of what the heck i would say to anyone. once i got there it wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be, although still very awkward and i definitely had no idea what to say and relied 100% on others carrying a conversation. but the feeling i experienced in the car ride was enough for me to dread ever doing that again.   
 

 Time went by and i VERY slowly got better at not feeling that horrible feeling, although i only saw my friends maybe once every other month, but i ended up not seeing them anymore since they lived 2 hours away, and i didn't drive so m y parents always had to bring me, so it faded away within a year. The big change came when my parents basically forced me to get a job (which I'm now incredibly grateful they did) and the feelings all came back at the thought of an interview. To save everybody reading this some time, i stressed about it BIG time, but ended up  taking it like a champ and got the job (Target!).   
 

I've worked there for 6 months now and have met so many wonderful people and made some really amazing friends that I honestly think are going to last a life time, I even met my now boyfriend there. Target has seriously made up for my complete drought of social interaction that i missed out on. I'm not nervous to hang out with my friends in the slightest, and i feel genuinely comfortable with the people i consider my friends, and that AWFUL feeling hasn't come back and I'm positive it's gone for good.  


 So We're now currently at present date, and while i no longer get the immense stressful feeling of what i think used to be social anxiety, i still have a really obnoxious issue that i really can't figure out how to improve on or get rid of. When it comes to talking to people, usually about more serious stuff, i lock up really badly. Whenever anyone talks to me about something serious i almost completely physically freeze up, and I'm pretty sure you can see the cogs in my head sparking and smoking. most of the time i can blur tout a generic response that does nothing but let the person know I'm still awake and listening, but it's always the same, I can never think of anything even almost meaningful to say. And my worry now is that it happens a lot with my boyfriend, i love him to DEATH, i truly do, and the last thing i want is for him to ever think i don't care about something he's telling me about, or god forbid, that i don't care about HIM, because i SUCK at saying helpful and meaningful things that show i care. Because i do truly care so much, I'm just SO bad at being able to show it when it comes to words. And sometimes ill even say something borderline stupid when i freeze up and panic and start realizing I'm taking WAY too long to think of a response, and later on i cringe so hard and want to scratch my eyes out while thinking about what i said.  


 Another tiny thing that i don't even care about compared to my previous issue but i figured i'd mention it in case it may be linked. I started winking at my boyfriend with my left eye to be cute, and now i can't stop. If I'm talking to mainly him, but it's also happened with other people, about something that makes me nervous, i almost compulsively start obnoxiously winking really hard. i can usually stop it, but only after i catch myself doing it at least once by accident. I don't have any other weird spasms or anything like that, that's the only one.  


 So what the heck is wrong with me, why can't i properly speak to people and why do i just freeze on the spot. Am i just a lost cause and i have to deal with this forever, or is there actually some way i can fix this and get better? Even if it's some sort of therapy or counseling, i don't care, i just want to be normal. And what the heck is up with the winking lol"
1522,Not secured in masculinity and being unfulfilled.,"I have been feeling not secured in my masculinity lately. Like I know I have some aspects of my perspectives of what I believe a man should be, but I feel like as if I’m not seen as a real man. Like I am very responsible, and I would say I’m a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the attractiveness scale, I know I’m not ugly. I just don’t feel like a man, I really don’t know why, I’m 17, I am taking 9 ap classes right now, I am a manager at a place, as well as being in EMT night classes. I feel like I’m not fulfilled and I am not a man. I am usually very lonely and I really am a very outgoing person and very extroverted, I have lots of friends and love people, I think my masculinity and fulfillment would come back if I could find a girlfriend but after I caught my girlfriend having sex with multiple men it has just been hard for me. I also understand that I never-really had a male role model in my life with my parents being divorced, but it just is kinda hard and it’s annoying. Maybe I’m just lonely and being a lil B but I might as well talk about it on here rather then irl bc in here I’m atleast somewhat anonymous lmao"
1523,Intrusive thoughts mainly around sticking cigarettes or knives in my eyes,"This is a throwaway, but recently I’ve had thoughts about just destroying my eyes anytime I handle something that could harm them from a cigarette to a toothpick, knives, running a tape gun across them and they feel extremely real. It’s come to a point where I won’t go near a part of a room if it has one of those mentioned items or if I absolutely have to I’ll take something long and push it to where I can’t get it anymore. Is there anyway to just make sure I don’t destroy one of my eyes before I can make it to my scheduled doctors app. I don’t care much about the thoughts I’m just naturally afraid of  scars so this is making my anxiety maybe the worst it’s ever been"
1524,Social anxiety is like chronic stage fright.,"I just read something for school that talked about a medication that reduces stage fright, among other things, and I got an ah-ha moment: my social anxiety feels like stage fright. The anticipation of a social event is just as awful as being in it (for me). My mind goes blank and I feel like everyone's watching me and it will be a make or break life-changing performance every time, regardless of how casual or ""fun"" the event is supposed to be! This analogy resonated with me :) Hope other find the same!"
1525,Struggle to change mind set,"Morning, this is my first post, my son advised me to reach out on here.  I am 52 yrs and have spent most of my life struggling with relationships/ friendships. I grew up knowing that my mum felt differently towards me and favoured my sisters. A few years ago she finally admitted that she struggled to have the same feelings for me as she did my sisters. I lived the first 6 months of my life in an incubator, back then she was unable to hold me at all. 

I have spent my life trying so hard to be liked and over compensating, however, when I start getting close to someone I start with drawing as I fear I will not be liked when they get to know me properly. I end relationships as I assume they will walk away eventually. 

I do not socialise and live on my own, which I do not mind but I also know I should try and socialise some more, but how can I change my mind set and feelings that I have had all my life ?

Any advice would be appreciated as I would like to like myself a lot more and no longer afraid to let people get close, I have built a large brick wall in my head and I would like to start knocking it down."
1526,"Dating this amazing guy, and I'm so pissed at myself.","(25f) started dating this guy (27) over two months ago. We started talking on a dating app about a month before meeting (he was out of town for a bit) and two weeks after I broke up with my ex, who minimized my feelings, had crazy double standards, and was dishonest with me multiple times. I had gone through the grieving process of ending that relationship before i actually ended it, since my ex was the only person I could socialize with in person for a while since I work in healthcare and my friends parents or SOs are all at risk for getting super sick from covid. Call me a user. My ex came from a very patriarchal and proud culture and I knew would not have talked to me anymore if i broke up with him, despite the circumstances where I was one of the only people he could see in person. Not that I would have blamed him.

Fast forward to now. My now bf (we'll call him James) is honestly what I didn't know I needed. He is kind, understanding, crazy intelligent but very humble, honest, sweet and makes me laugh. We clicked instantly and I'm honestly happy, for the first time in a while. He is a lot like me, kind of different but uses his quirks to his benefit. He is in almost finished with a doctoral degree with an awesome job lined up and is super supportive of me in my grad school endeavors. He is also positive, very open and is a good listener. I feel like I can trust him, which is an awesome feeling!

I honestly feel like I don't deserve him sometimes and already feel like I'm a huge disappointment and am just waiting for him to politely say that we aren't compatible or that he can't feel a connection anymore. He has not given any reason for me to think this would happen anytime soon. It's all in my head. 

I have OCD, anxiety and depression and was finally diagnosed with ADHD which was an additional cause situational anxiety and depression. I am getting a counselor, got my anti anxiety/depression meds increased and am going to try focusing on taking better care of my mental health. I grew up constantly being talked down to and abused by my parents and helped raise my younger siblings, esp. when my mom went off the deep end, so between my mental health issues and growing up being told how shitty I am by my (truly) borderline parents and looking out for my siblings, this feeling of healthy emotional nourishment is like drinking cool water after hiking for 5 hours in a desert. With my neurotransmitter imbalance I can't help but get very anxious and start preparing myself for when this happy period is over. 

I know I sound crazy, probably for a couple reasons:

1. James and I have only talked each other since mid July and have been dating irl over two months. The thing is that I have dated a lot (often dated just to date and learn about myself and men, and have had serious relationships) and I haven't felt this in sync with really anyone like I have with James, even with those I've dated for months or even over a year.

2. Between the stress of work, grad school, having a nutjob family, a traumatic work experience (that I and multiple others fled a couple months ago) and covid changing so many things, how could I think my thoughts about myself hold enough truth for me to fear what they are telling me is true? I KNOW they aren't based in rationality.

I know how my neurotransmitter imbalances affect me and WHY I feel the way I do, on a scientific level. Why am I so afraid of fucking up my future and ruining any chance of a happy future I've always hoped for to the point where I am already depressed over it? How screwed up is that? I'm so pissed at myself.

Tl;dr:

My boyfriend is incredible, truly unlike anyone I've ever met, let alone dated. Why am I letting my mental health issues get me so down when I know these negative thoughts don't hold truth? Why can't I just be happy?"
1527,Going downhill,"I’ve handled worse, I’ve done so much more...

I’m 25M, I’ve worked 4 jobs all while juggling university, exercising, and maintaining good health. 

During university, I worked as a bank teller, a research assistant job at university, I did Uber/UberEats and tutored math virtually and in person for high-school students. 

On top of all this I suffer from depression along with ADHD. 

Yet i still fought through all of that, and today I’m proud to be working in my field (even though I hate the particular location I’m at) 

Additionally I have planned to study for the CFA exam.. but nowadays I can’t do anything.

My mental health has literally just gone down the drain, I’ve started smoking an intense amount of weed on a daily basis, my ADHD meds don’t seem to be doing much, my room is a mess.. my washroom is even worse. (In terms of tidiness and clutter)

I’m having horrible mood swings, my sleeping pattern is ridiculous, the way I’ve been eating is disgusting... and I’m constantly hit with a wave of depression that pretty much takes up my entire day until I light up a joint which will numb that pain for a short period until my body starts to crave more.

I don’t talk about my feelings to anyone, I’ve tried multiple times and it’s never done me any good. 

I am not a fan of therapy for both the economic cost and as well as the fact that I don’t feel it would provide me any benefit. 

I want to tether off of medication because I feel as if it’s just making everything worse. 

I’m in a family of 6, and I’m the only one working with a stable income and I really want to make sure I can get myself together because if something were to happen to me then this family would shit the bed.

I’ve been feeling a little suicidal, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with every thing, I can’t focus at work, I can’t focus at home to study, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep... Every day just seems like a dreadful chore. 

Why can’t I just feel normal?"
1528,Why can’t I find answers within myself?,"I know I have answers within myself but I can’t listen, understand, or figure out what I’m feeling or thinking. How am I so disconnected from myself?is my soul too shattered? Am I too far gone to be fixed? Or is it something else? What do I do to do her things out? How do I get myself out of a trap? How do I become less confused and move on?"
1529,I have been depressed for 6 months,"It is the worst I have ever felt, there are so many different factors I don’t even feel like explaining. There is nothing left for me right now. Every single day and night I struggle with the same exact feeling. I just want a break so bad I really don’t have that much left

And I think about suicide twice or more a day. Honestly I'm not on here to get attention I just wanna share my true feelings in hopes someone relates. But I'm so tired of fighting the fucking feeling of driving into upcoming traffic. My wife is from Korea so it makes it hard to share feelings. I know she doesn't love me,, which I understand.

1533,Scared and don’t know what to do,"so 3 weeks ago I was at a party with my girlfriend and i got drunk and smoked some dudes dab pen where I hit it 4 times and went into an insane panic attack where I thought I was going to die I went nuts and she calmed me down. The next day I woke up feeling really derealized and started questioning reality. I got over it in a day and felt fine. A week and a half later I took a couple hits of a blunt and felt the panic attack symptoms when I went back to my dorm. This time I could hear my thoughts. I almost had a panic attack but realized I was feeling the same as last time which calmed me down. After that day I would become very anxious and feel very derealized. The day after I only had two shots and of alchohol with my girlfriend and that’s when my derealization straight kicked in. Ever since that day I feel very anxious anywhere I go,  im starting to question my existence and whether what I’m seeing is real, and I’ve been depressed. Is there any way I could go back to normal. I was never a drinker or smoker before college and this is my first time and I am freshman. I am scared whether I will get schizophrenia or get a psychosis or some type of mental illness.will this ever go away?"

1535,3 nights ago our neighbor (paranoid schizophrenic) suffered an episode and tried to shoulder our door down after pounding and angrily telling my boyfriend to “step outside” while concealing something behind his back. It was terrifying. We’re not sure if it’s safe to return.,
1536,Ello. Does anyone feel like they can access their dream-state before the onset of an anxiety attack?,"Anxiety is not my primary issue. It's definitely depression. But I've been told it can be a bit of a horseshoe (people with severe anxiety can peak with an experience of severe depression and visa versa). My anxiety attack ""moments"" have gotten more and more regular. I call them ""moments"" because at these points I feel as though I am balancing on an edge. If I ask someone to hold my hand and tell me about their day I almost always come out of it. It's awkward, but way less awkward than the alternative. About 25% of the time I vomit a minute or two before the point of no return.

However, the moments leading up to it have become increasingly similar and increasingly intense. My vision seems to split, with a portion leaning towards gray-scale. Then I can remember my dreams (those that would've been otherwise completely forgotten or lost) in excruciating detail. It even tastes like I am dreaming. If I continue to attempt to remember or accept that state of dreaming an anxiety attack is most certainly imminent.

Has anyone ever felt anything like this? Where the dream-state and lucid reality's borders have seemingly dissolved?"

1539,"I don’t remember the last time I felt normal, and I’m scared it’s going to cost me my job.","So, I have been on a bout with bad medications for a while. I have pretty severe depression and anxiety. I have an appointment next week to get this fixed, but it’s causing me to have no interest in anything - especially my job. I can FEEL myself being bad at my job, but I just can’t gather the energy to try. And that makes me more depressed and so on.

I feel so empty and hollow all the time. I feel like I’m in a fog and my meds have numbed all emotion. But if I skip a day, I become the most irritable person ever. Any little thing causes me annoyance. So I stay on them. 

I just don’t really know what to do. My boss knows I have health issues (just because I go to doctors a lot - she doesn’t know they’re therapists), so I would hope she’d talk to me about it before firing me out of the blue.

But this could also be my anxiety. I get decent marks (above average) on performance reviews, so really I have no reason to believe I’d be fired.

I think I’m just asking for advice/support. Does anyone else deal with this?"
1540,How do I get my ex-GF out of my mind?,"Hello everyone, I have broken up a month or two ago with my ex-GF. In terms of emotion, I would say I have much improved in finding a new balance, which is great news. The thing is that I still have flashbacks of us cuddling and staying together, that I don't manage to just cancel off my mind. The thing that most frustrates me about it is that she got rid of me in her head with no effort like I didn't mean anything to her. How did she do that???

I finally emailed the counselor today but I don’t think she’ll do much. I’ve also been getting these “episodes” where I feel really panicky and I just start crying but I don’t think they’re panic attacks but I just don’t know what to call them.
1543,please give me advice on what to do right now.,"I'm in a college dorm, alone, and I just had the biggest wave of anxiety, I'm currently in a state of panic.

Life is passing me by, and Im not living it."
1546,"Someone else, somewhere else","I hope this is appropriate for this subreddit. I read through the rules and looked at some other posts and it doesn’t seem too out of place, so hopefully this is alright.

Does anyone else’s imagination... for lack of better description, take away from their real life? Like, constantly going, never stopping, and not in a good way?

I’m in my early twenties and I know well what my reality is. This isn’t some imaginary friend shit. It’s something else. Constantly, when I’m falling asleep, waking up, in class, at work, or even in the midst of a conversation, my mind is constantly dreaming up these alternative scenarios. Like, I’m someone else, somewhere else, in this whole different reality and a different personality. As I’m having a conversation or listening to another person talk, I can always hear what this other me would say and eventually I’ll have a whole different “conversation” or set of events carrying out in the back of my head while reality goes on.

It is so frustrating. Part of this is because “other me” and “other world” is usually some kind of reflection of all the things I hate about myself, my body, my life, and so on. Like, this other person is openly themself, or they already have top surgery, or they’re just... I don’t know. Cooler? More likeable? I guess that sounds juvenile but the point is that this has been going on for literal years at every waking moment, and I can’t for the life of me make it stop.

Has anyone else experienced this? I almost feel like this has to be a mental health concern at this point. I’m just so tired and I don’t know what to think about it anymore."

There was a lot of work to be done that I now have to do in a very short amount of time. It's been straining to say the least. I've been feeling really bad and crying and breaking down a lot when confront with the massive amount of work that is piling up around me. Is this normal? I'm afraid that if I fail or get low grades in my classes It will destroy my prospects for college. It feels hopeless and I've been having thoughts which I never ever thought I'd ever have. Life just seems to have lost anything I enjoyed about it. I'm not even sure if I feel happy anymore at all. Any advice is welcome, I guess I'm just looking for a outlet of sorts."

1552,Battleship: My Mental Health Victories and Successes.,"My mental health has been bad for a long time. Since My freshman year (I’m straight out of senior year starting university right now), I have struggled with OCD symptoms; intolerance for uncertainty, attachment issues, and excessive guilt. And Quarantine, starting university, and a personal matter hasn’t made it any easier. 

I still feel like absolute shit every day. However, I have been fighting like a battleship lately to be proactive about my mental health and I am proud of some of my victories in all areas of my life. 

1. Academics / Studies. Starting university was a bumpy road definitely. I would occassionally miss a deadline or be too drained and anxious to study for tests, and got 50s or failed on them. However, it is getting better; I have been doing my best to study and have also gotten my fair share of 80s and above. Over the last week I aced a math test, a biology test, a lab report, and caught up completely in my studies. My average isn’t very good as of now, but I’m definitely on the fast track to turning it around. 

2. Health. I have not been taking the best care of my health. I still have trouble sleeping a lot, forget to stay hydrated and stuff. However, recently I started playing Just Dance every single day and it really helped me mentally and physically. I really love dancing to the screen and learning how to be better at dancing. Even mastered a few dances like 7 rings and thatpower extreme. Still have lots of bad health habits, but now I have one more good health habit so, that’s a breakthrough. P.S. I’m trying to master circus extreme by Britney Spears but the floor moves are WAY too hard so if any of you seen the just dance routine for that give me pointers lol. 

3. Writing extracurriculars. I took the initiative to join 2 writing organizations, where I write about mental health and sometimes other social issues like poverty and addiction. It is helping my mental health knowing my words have an impact. 

4. Found a performance opportunity for a musical talent. I’ve played piano for 6-7 years since I was little and gotten really good (can play liebestraum no 3) and I have very recently found a volunteer opportunity to play for elderly folks and people who are in sickness. I am glad to be able to use my talent to make their days brighter. It is something I look forward to pursuing and  it will intensely boost my mental health. 

Like I said I still feel absolutely tired, anxious, and shitty every day. But even though I’m not truly happy yet, I am living my life with purpose and that makes life so much more fuller."
1553,Not real TW mentions of self harm and panic,"last night i had a really bad episode in the shower where i completely went numb both physically and mentally. i generally never feel real and always feel as though i’m in some sort of simulation and like a brain in a jar. but this was worse. the tiles on the floor have patterns and they began to swirl around and move, the walls were doing the same (they have the same tiles). i became scared of the shampoo bottles and felt as though i couldn’t look at them but i was also scared of the shower curtain so all i could do was look at the moving floor and hold on to the hand rails (my dad is disabled so the shower is a wet room with disabled aids). i then began to panic because slowly i lost all feeling, i could no longer feel the heat of the water on me or even just the drips it was just nothingness. it ended up in quite an awful bout of self harm just trying to feel but i couldn’t actually feel it for a while. i did eventually regain all of it but then a weird voice in my head told me that everyone will hurt me if they realise i’ve worked out the simulation is real so i then had to act completely normal in front of everyone in my house even though i was panicking so so much. 

i suffer from agoraphobia and panic attacks but this was different. the moving thing has happened a few times before along with peoples faces distorting but never like this. i do have an appointment with a mental health team next week which im terrified about as it’s the first time i’ve reached out in 2-3 years. does anyone know what this was? am i completely overthinking it?"

1555,How to handle bad mental breakdowns,"Hi. I'm new to this subreddit and so I guess I should share what's been going one these last few years and especially these last few days.

So I'm not really sure what depression is but everything I've experienced has been described as depression to me by others. Constant mood swings, thoughts of suicide, tremors, not having a appeitie, ect. Usually I'm able to control it for the most part and put on a persade to fool people at work and home but these last few days its been harder and harder to do that and today I had a really bad mental breakdown. 

I know not to commit suicide. I'm able to control myself enough to find alternatives to that like putting my head down on a desk and not letting myself up from the seat until I don't have thoughts anymore and others things but I was wondering if anyone else has any ways to help calm very bad mental breakdowns?"
1556,Something silly I wrote for a volunteer writing position that might be comforting to read.,"In grade 11, I once made up an imaginary character. And she has inspired me to stand for mental health and to embrace all the awesome parts about myself. 

Let me tell you all about her. Her name is Mercy. She is a professional dancer by career and performs in a variety of locations. Her skills are incredible. She knows how to perform dances for all of today’s popular songs and can perform amazing lyrical solos too. Her costume is all red (she usually wears it most of the time), with the glistening word “Mercy” engraved on it in pink. The red symbolizes her strength and resilience, and the pink symbolizes her kindness. 

Her personality is something that I’ve always admired and aspired to be like. She is an incredibly kind and loving person to everyone she meets. She is understanding, comforting, and her presence can soothe the pain of her friends. 

If she sees someone who is depressed, she goes and comforts them. Asks them what is bothering them. She tells them what they need to hear, whether it’s an “I’m here for you” or an “I believe in you” or that “It’s okay to feel how you’re feeling.” 

If she sees her friend botch a performance, she will comfort them and remind them that she knows that they are a skilled dancer despite messing the performance up. “You are an amazing dancer and messing up the performance doesn’t change that fact. I am proud of how far you’ve come.” This goes the same for every other endeavour, whether it’s coursework, careers, or overcoming addictions. 

If she sees someone who is under immense pressure from the mounting deadlines in university or high school, she won’t add an ounce of pressure to their already overloaded and exhausted minds. She won’t tell you that you “just need to get over it and suck it up and deal with it.” She will comfort you. She will help you study. She will encourage you and tell you to keep trying if you fail. She will always believe in you no matter what mark you get. 

If she sees someone who constantly has to face the stigma of mental illness within society, she won’t contribute to it. She won’t tell you that you’re “weak” or you’re “dangerous” or that you “aren’t good enough”, all of which is a bunch of nonsense anyways. She will remind you of all the reasons you are a badass. All the reasons to believe in yourself. Everything you’ve accomplished. Every struggle you’ve overcome. She’ll tell you that she has always believed in your strength. Your awesomeness. Your power. You. 

Yesterday, I was feeling awful about myself. And I could just hear her voice tell me everything that is wonderful about me. How I treat my friends. How I am resilient. How I never give up. How I am funny. How I am a talented piano player. How I always want to be the best I can be. 

Embrace your awesomeness. Be proud of all the reason to be proud of yourself. 

She has taught me that it’s okay to be proud of who we are. It’s good for our mental health to see ourselves for our strengths and all the wonderful aspects. We need to love ourselves more and my friends agree. 

She has taught me that kindness is not weakness. You can be strong and be kind at the same time. Mercy is incredibly strong. She always keeps trying, always practicing, always not giving up on what means a lot to her. She’s not afraid to give everything her best. She gets hurt sometimes from the pressure and refuses to let it stop her. I will say it again: You can be strong and be kind at the same time. They’re not mutually exclusive. 

She has taught me what it truly means to love someone, to be there for them in their darkest times, with their darkest demons. Give them a non-judgemental, comforting friend. Encouraging them, reminding them of all the strength that is within them. Helping them find ways to feel better and cope instead of just dismissing their struggles. 

She has saved lives. LIVES. By being who she is. By being the amazing, compassionate human being she is. 

I want to be like Mercy. (Yes, I named this account after her because I wanted to be exactly like her in the way I talk to people). I want to follow her example. To be strong in the face of struggle. To persevere in what matters to me. Most importantly, to be kind and understanding to others who are struggling with mental health issues. Encouraging people. Making their day. Being there for them when they need it the most. 

In today’s climate, with all of the pressures of university, jobs, and society, we need more kindness in this world. We need more understanding. We need more encouragement. We need more empowerment. We need more cheering on each other. 

She is incredibly powerful, strong, and kind. That is why I want to be like her. And I am fiercely proud for wanting to be like her."
1557,Need advice for a friend,So I have this friend that has been struggling with her mental health for years now. But I want to specifically ask advice on how to help her sleep. I believe that she needs to begin with making small steps to improve. She does not sleep at all because of her negative thoughts and because shes afriad to sleep and get nightmares. She always has nightmares whenever she ends up sleeping. Is there a way to get rid of these nightmares or a way to help her sleep? She tried therapy and it ended up poorly so she completelt shut off that option.
1558,How old were you when you began to understand something was wrong?,"I’m very curious on ages people became aware of their mental struggles. My youngest was at four years old, when I would try to force spoons down my throat (OCD with intrusive thoughts caused this one) but it wasn’t until three years ago I actually went to get help. Like as a kid I knew something was wrong, but as everything when you are a kid, you just brush it off as being ‘weird’. What about y’all?"
1559,It’s 3 am and my depression is eating me alive.,I got up to go to the bathroom and my thoughts starting getting to me. It’s now been an hour of me bawling my eyes out during a depressive episode and I have no idea how to beat it. I can’t take my meds for another few hours and I’m so lost on what to do. I feel so alone. I have to be up for work in a few hours and I can’t breathe and I feel like I’m suffocating
1560,Do I rely too much on my therapist?,"I see my therapist once a week or every two weeks. It’s the only thing I look forward to. I feel the stress accumulating till the day I see her. I don’t know if I’m too much depending on therapy. My goal is to one day be able to not go to therapy and live my life on my own. But right now therapy is the only place where I feel completely safe. not that I am not safe at home, it’s just that I feel truly comfortable only with her, and I don’t talk about any of my problems to anyone else so it gets heavy when I don’t see her for a while. I don’t know if this is stupid or I really do rely too much on therapy."
1561,Best tips for dealing with lockdown?,"Hey guys, just writing here as Ireland is just about to go into a second lockdown.   


If you could share some of the tips which you took during the first lockdown to maintain positive and good mental health. That would be greatly appreciated. I was just using CBD and trying to get a few workouts during the week but any other tips will be welcomed. Thank you in advance."
1562,What's the point in talking about it when everyone is opposed to suicide?,"I think at some point I got so pissed that I said, fine, I won't do it, if that makes you happy. BUT I have the right to hate myself for being mentally ill and having gender dysphoria. I'm not going to apologize for that self-hate. I have not chosen to be born like this, or born at all, so I don't have to accept my own broken existence. But if I hate myself anyway, then there is no rational reason not to live to make others happy, right? Fifty more years of daily breakdowns? I mean fine whatever. It's not like it matters. It didn't matter the last 30 years. Why not just put on happy music while crying and plan the next projects? I just have to endure it from day to day until the last day. It's not that hard. It's very simple actually."
1563,lost - I didn’t kill myself tonight.,"hi reddit, I’ve never made a post nor have I ever thought that I would do something like this... but scrolling through the mental health community has really I guess uplifted me? To share.. I actually don’t use reddit much, (partly because I don’t understand how to use it lol..) 

I’ve been feeling so lost the past couple of months. I fight with the thoughts of suicide and being not good enough everyday. When my life was chaos, I was just so tired of it all. now my life is still and I still struggle to want to live.

I have a beautiful life, loving family, loving friends group, loving boyfriend, shelter etc... I know I am not ugly too. But I can’t help but to feel how much better my loved ones lives would be without me. I have came clean to my trusted loved ones about fighting suicide because my therapist said it would help. While it did help... I also felt so horrible to trouble them with my issues, and that I would worry them.

I used to be very obnoxious and social and extremely confident. Somewhere this year it I slowly started to cripple away into this quiet, isolated human being. I almost don’t even know who I am anymore. I don’t recognize the person in front of me. 

I got help 5 months ago, talked to my doctor, saw a psychiatrist, I have a therapist as well that I see regularly. And I’m on meds. 

I feel like I’m doing everything right. Keeping my boyfriend in the loop (as we live together) and he is so loving and understanding but I feel so awful when he gets off work and comes home to an absolute mess. Today I cried for 2 hours in his arms because I just couldn’t bare with the pain anymore. 


I have a wonderful supportive boyfriend. We have had our hiccups and worked so hard to make this work, and he’s really come through. But I feel like I’m holding him back from his life before me aka being a bachelor, blazing and having lots of girlfriends (he distanced himself from them because they started to bully me, coming to my work and making a fool out of me... the one who came to my work is also his ex, and bestfriend when we met) I want him to live life to the fullest and not feel like he is restricted. I want him to do the things he wants to do. We might just different people and that’s okay. I have trouble believing the life we have made together is what he wants. I want him to come home and not feel obligated to comfort me or take me out and just kick back and relax. I feel legitimately awful when he has a long day at work and comforts me for hours in the evening. 

I’m kind of at a point where it’s like what’s the point of all of this? I’m in an intense and vicious cycle of not knowing my worth but also knowing I’m pretty cool too.  It’s pretty vicious because on one hand I feel beautiful and I feel confident and the other hand I feel like I’m not enough. 

I just want to disappear and come back when I am better. Time can’t stop for me to just repair. 

Tonight I thought of suicide. I think I have truly made my peace with the thought of killing my self. I don’t think I can live life the way I am feeling everyday. Putting on a smile and being the best I can be. I don’t want my boyfriend to come home to a mess everyday, I don’t want to trouble my friends, I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to be at peace. I know that putting them through my passing will be sad but I think they’ll also just get over it with time. I have thought to make a video to ensure that it was nobody’s fault and that nothing could have prevented it because I just want to rest. And I would be doing it on my own terms. I have a beautiful life, I feel beautiful, and I just think this is it, this is good, I can just rest. I’ve done my best, I did everything I could. I tried. And I’m tired. This is just a battle I don’t want to fight anymore and I’m happy with the thought of suicide. It doesn’t scare me anymore. I know it sounds fucked up, but I am genuinely grateful for everything in my life and everyone. I know I am loved, but my thoughts make it out that I am not supposed to be loved or that I don’t deserve it. I live with this intense guilt and I just don’t want to live life this way anymore. I just want to end my own suffering. I say this with a light heart, and I truly believe killing my self will help me be content. 

I’ve thought of it all. If I kill my self in my boyfriends apartment he won’t be able to sell the apartment for good value. I would need to go somewhere else. I would take a razor and cut myself deep vertically on my fore arm from wrist to elbow on both arms and then slit it horizontally at the wrist with a bottle of tequila in my best outfit and my makeup done right. I want to hang with my loved ones one last time and just make sure they know how much I love them. And then just let myself rest and be free of this chaotic world. 

If you’re reading this, I want to say thank you because it was super long, but also that I didn’t kill myself tonight. It was just the thoughts I had in my head or what runs through my head when these thoughts come up. Part of why I did not act on suicide tonight is because it is too cold and I would like to do it when the weather is nice and beautiful. I would like my last moments to be, peaceful... not out of fear and darkness. The other part of me is because my partner held me for 2 hours while I couldn’t stop crying and telling him that I loved him and that I was sorry. He knows it is difficult to ask for me to promise anything, but I can work with him and atleast take it one night at a time. 

I self harmed today and I know I shouldn’t. But hey atleast I didn’t kill my self haha 

And if you’re still reading, if you’re feeling the same way I do.. just know atleast now that you’re not alone. I looked all over reddit and couldn’t find a post where someone thought the way I did with suicide, in the sense that it doesn’t scare me anymore and that I’ve made my peace. We can fight it together."

I want to talk to someone but am hesitant about doing it over zoom for the first time. For those that have done it remotely, how has it been? And has anyone been able to see their therapist in person?"
1569,"Kinda scared, if I'm being honest.","I think it's getting harder for me to know if something is real or not.

I mean, I feel like I can hear fictional people talking. Even what they look like is so vivid in my mind, I have to think if i'ts just in my head.

But I know it is. They aren't real I've made them up and I know that, but my mind says they are. I'm kind of scared of the fact that it's getting harder for me to separete what is real and what is not. 

I stayed up whole last night, because I heard this music. It was quiet, but it was there. I thought it came from my computer, which isn't possible it was closed and the sound didn't come from the speakers when I putted my ear on them. There was nothing. Just in case I took my computer out of my room, but I still heard it, just as loudly as before. 

Now I feel like I just imagined the music, but I can swear I heard it. There is nothing else that it could have come from than my computer though. So was it just my imagination? It felt so real. 

I'm scared. 

And I feel like I can't talk about this with my therapist since I feel like she always calls my mom and tells her everything. I don't want her to spread it to the whole family.

I also feel like I've wrote this text before, but I know I haven't, but I remember writing this exactly the same before so goddamn vividly."

I feel like I’m faking it and I’m just super lazy and antisocial. Maybe I’m just tired because of college? I feel like I’m faking having no motivation too. I can’t work out what I’m really feeling and it’s so confusing.

1573,Is this what everyone experiences?,"Hi please excuse me if I am not making much sense. I need to rant.

When I was little and used to play outside near my house, my parents wouldn't allow me to go anywhere they cannot see. I mean they always watched what I was doing and if I went to one of my friend's house or just walked a little too far, they would scold me. They always asked what we were talking, why we were laughing ,etc.. My father always insists that he watches me whenever I go cycling and I'm only allowed to cycle rounds only near the house even now (I'm 16). 

Sometimes my father randomly walks into my room and asks what exactly I'm watching/listening. He once showed me that he knew all the songs that I listen to and he played them on the tv. I mean it's not a big deal but I just hate sharing anything with them.

My parents are weird... I don't know how to say this...they never listened to my feelings. Once I told them that I did not like how I am right now and they told me that I do not know anything that they are going through and that I have no reason to feel sad. My mother genuinely thinks that I am making unnecessary drama and she says that when I say that I have problems, I am emotionally.... I don't know what to say here... her. 

I do not like who I am. I do not want perfect grades. I just want things to end. I am crying now while writing this.

I want to experiment different things and find my purpose but my parents are telling me to become something useful. They want me to become this ""perfect"" person.

I tried to write a diary once but soon after I found my father flipping through that book a few days later and he seemed pissed out about me finding out.

I stopped attending violin classes because my parents wouldn't let me go there by myself and insisted on taking me and then complained about how difficult it was for them. They also used to tell me that I should be aware of the fact how much they were spending on those classes and that taking classes should be worthwhile. My father would show me people on the internet playing the violin and ask me to play like them.

They don't allow me to have any social media account when I asked them and they said that I wouldn't need it. I just created this reddit account today because I felt a little bit of courage today. I might end up deleting this.

I use my parents' WhatsApp to text my friends and later they read every single message that I send. Once my father found a candy wrapper in my room and asked how it came there as he did not buy me that candy.

Sometimes my parents do not tell me if any of my friends texted my parents' phone. They always ask every detail of every one who I talk to.

I have so many things to rant about but I became really uncomfortable just by even typing this out. Am I disrespectful for hating my parents?

Please give me some advice. I feel helpless."
1574,i feel absoloutely terrible and keep crying for no reason,"im so done with everything, i dont want do to anything nor do i have the energy motovation to do anything besides my art. The start of the term was last week, ever since every atom in my body doesnt want to go, even if i get to be with my friends. heck, im lucky. im lucky because im actually going to school face to face, heaps of people cant at the moment. i have it good, great in fact. i dont get bullied, no detentions and im an A-B student, even with the bad teacher and boring period every noun and then, i should be greatful. i should be happy but im not, everything feels so tiering and for most school days i come home and just cry for no reason. ive felt a lesser more numb version of this for this year up until now. this is really strange and i dont know what to do."
1575,Why am I so nervous about my psychiatry appt?,"I have an appointment today with my psychiatrist who I've seen a few times so far. We have to change my SSRI because we think it was causing dizzy spells and falls 

I'm pretty sure she's going to get angry with me because I didn't actually tell her about the side effects. I only told my therapist who I agreed to allow to share that info with my doctor.

I get really scared around doctors. So I'm absolutely dreading the appointment. 

My therapist also said maybe I should just take a break from trying medication, which I kinda want (the side effects are miserable and it's very discouraging) but it's even more discouraging to hear as a suggestion from someone else. It feels like maybe I'm too ill to help or something

any advice? my appointment's not for 6 hours, but I'm so anxious with anticipation"

1577,You can overcome your thoughts! OCD,"Right.. back when i were 8-12 i had to do the same thing over and over sometimes it even took a hour to get unstuck.. i were going crazy, imagine being stuck in your own mind?

Now i’m 18 and still has somethings but much better than when i were younger you know.
Thinking back at it.. Well.. it’s a nightmare.
Now i started taking sertraline and feel much better but OCD will never fully go away but it helps indeed... So i recommend if you do such things search help asap or try fighting your own mind (Not Recommended) OCD is a hard thing to deal with it’s like being normal but your brain fights constant... what a thing to have."
1578,Strange Event,"Some back story: I have been diagnosed with PTSD recently and prior to this strange event I have been going through a vicious cycle of anxiety/depression after being triggered pretty severely. About 20 minutes ago I was in the restroom and I caught a glance of myself, but I didn't feel like I recognized who I was seeing. I looked deep into my eye's and they felt dark and cold like no one was home. This began to throw me into a panic and I become frightened at what I was seeing almost as if it were a different person in the mirror and they wanted to hurt me. I looked away in fear and kept my eye's away from the mirror and sped to get out of there. Has anyone been through anything like this?"

But I've learned through my current relationship that being unable to relate to peoples feelings proves to be a problem. 

  
I'm in therapy for 2 years now already but its something that i feel like i need to work on myself too because its putting too much strain on my relationship.

My question is now as follows, how can i work myself on it, without outside help.

Should i make lists, charts, a diary ? i really don't know how and where to start.

Every help is much appreciated. :)"
1581,One year ago I asked this subreddit “How do I find joy in life?”,"One year ago I came to this subreddit asking for assistance on how to find the joy in life again. I had given up, didn’t even think I’d make it through the rest of the year. 2020 may have been complete hell for a lot of people but for me, it changed my life. I got sick of feeling awful every day, I got sick of not being happy, sick of not wanting to wake up every day and sick of feeling lower than bedrock. I don’t know how I did it, maybe mental fortitude, I’m not completely sure. But one day I turned that “switch” in my mind off and haven’t looked back since. Now I haven’t done a full 180, more like a 145 but honestly I have never been happier. Yes, happy. For the first time in over 7 years I can finally say I am happy. My rescue dog Loki has been a huge help for that. Now I know my journey is far from over but right now I am maneuvering all the mental obstacles that get in my way, and I’m not done yet. I am going to make 2021 my bitch and make that 145 and full 180. Yeah only one person has told me they are proud of my progress and yeah he wasn’t even family, hadn’t even talked to the kid in over two years but that was one of the first things he said to me after we caught up. But I’m proud of myself. Now I want those of you struggling right now to see you this and know you can make it through whatever it is you are going through right now. You are going to be and always will be your strongest ally, but I believe in you all. I believe in the strength you all have because you are enough, you do mean something to each of those people you don’t think you do. Your life matters more than you could ever imagine. Last thing, I am proud of each of you reading this for making it this far, because you had the strength to fight every single damn day and you are all inspirations to me and all those around you. Now go out there and make life yours. I applaud you all."
1582,After some advice to help my baby mama,"Me and my now ex-girlfriend have been together on and off for 4 years. Unfortunately very early on in the relationship she got pregnant and after a few months the reality of becoming a new mum manifested into depression and anxiety. This lead to a break up around the 4 month pregnancy milestone. We semi lost contact for the remaining pregnancy for her to focus on her new reality 

Fast forward to just before the birth of our child and we start talking and making arrangements, one of which is me making sure she has all the baby supplies she needs. Our child is born and we see each other weekly for a few hours a time for me to see my child. After 6 months the negative mental healthy comes down enough for us to try us again and for the following 2 years we have a cycle of getting better and making progress but when the ""next step"" in our relationship comes things fall apart and she doubt everything about me. This has manifested into: why is she with me, does she love me, is she just with me because I'm the only one who will, and who am I (her) now. 

We make it through though even dodging her leaving me for someone else because she wants to be with me and our family is what she wants. This was a year ago now. We go from strength to strength and when lock down hit in March (as well as me missing out on a promotion) it feels like we turn a corner. We start talking about moving location together for me to further my career and her to live with me in a fresh location and she is strongly asking me to propose already. 3 months ago I apply for a job 6 hours move away from my current location (somewhere she loves) and I get it. I sell my place, leave my job, and start buying a new place for the 3 of us. 

It's at this point we have another flare up of anxiety (which is obviously always in the background no matter what) and shes asking the question am I just with him for the family, do I love him, who am I and what do it want. 3 weeks ago she breaks up with me and a week ago she asks me not to wait for her because she doesnt like the pressure, she also does all she can to push me away.  At this point she is saying she hasn't been happy for a while but throughout the last 4 years she has steadily isolated her self from her friends, she has no job, and doesnt give herself self help and I cant help but feel these factors play more of a part into that unhappiness then our relationship where we laugh, love, support each other and have a healthy family vibe.

I know that the relationship was good and I have tried endless to support her. The old you cant help someone that doesnt help themselves. Thankfully she has now gotten in contact with old good friends, is getting out more, and taking care of herself. She is really overwhelmed so is taking it one day at a time, not thinking about us...which I appreciate and despite her being my world trying to respect as much as I can. 

My question is how should i proceed? Shes asked me to not wait for her and she has support from her friends, she knows I'm there for her but I'm the last person she wants to talk to about this now I guess. All I want to do is wait for her, i love her to bits. My female friends who have supported me for the last 3 years have told me to see other people and just see what happens one day but dont count on it but all I want to do is wait and be there for the mother of my child. At the same time I love her and want to give her what she needs. I dont want to be the ex that doesnt listen but with her history I dont want to just abandon her and this crisis. I want to be there with a hammer and nails to rebuild our relationship stronger than before so next time it doesnt fall down.

Thanks"
1583,I'm stuck in the vicious cycle of hurting my boyfriend! How do I get out of this?!,"hey guys need some advice,
um I (18F) made a post about breaking up with my bf(19) because he was too supportive. I ended up not going through with it, well right now if I had to describe my life I would say its a mess and I'm really struggling with my mental health, at such times he is like a beacon for me, and in order to be able to help me he wants to know everything I am thinking, but I know this is gonna affect him adversely because he has been really affected from what I have told him until know. this causes me to hide my struggles from him which only hurts him more when he finds out later as he feels betrayed, I am stuck I a vicious loop, also it makes me feel like I am being needy and just doing it for attention, he has also stated calling me a synonym for kid lovingly or telling me that he will take care of everything, this only makes me feel more helpless and immature along with feeling like being treated like a kid which is a bit of a trigger for me not for anxiety but otherwise. I cannot go to therapy for some while due to other circumstances.
please can anyone advice me what to do?
i seriously could use some"
1584,The feeling of not being understood.,[removed]
1585,Why I'm afraid of therapy,"I don't feel comfortable talking about my life, or about myself in particular, because I think I'm making it all up - what I feel, what I \*think\* happened. Stuff like that. I'd feel better if they heard about me from someone else than me, I just don't trust myself enough. I feel like a fake."
1586,is it weird that i have no interests at all,"i don’t care about what i’m studying tbh. i don’t have any hobbies or interests outside college. i’m not artistic, not great in writing. i used to read a lot, but i just can’t anymore. i also don’t have any motivation to pursue anything, because i just feel nothing inside. i feel like i’m barely living, but i just can’t help it. i really can’t find it in me to care about anything, and i hate it."
1587,Is this normal ?,"I'm 15 ,  throughout my life I've encountered many people , friends , classmates and all kinds of poeple from poeple I like , people I despise and people I'm okay with , but everytime I meet spmeone it feels like I ""adapt"" my personality with them so I go along with them and match their energy and also not to seem weird so I don't attract attention . So today I realised that I don't know my personality , like at all . I've faked so many personalities that I don't even know my own , it feels like theres 17 versions of me each designed to please a certain type of poeple and some contradict each other . Then I also realised that my real ""personality"" that I think I have is just based on zodiac signs and mbti tests so I just force myself to think that I am what a quiz tells me to be , I don't think it's that big of a deal compared to what other people have and go through but just wanted to see if theres other people like me .

1588,I'm jealous of my brothers life.,"I constantly find myself thinking about my life and comparing it to my brother's life. He has his own house, a great job, is able to afford things that he wants, and has an all round good life. I on the other hand am 23, still living with a parent, unable to afford the things I need from time to time let alone the things I want, and have social anxiety which makes ot hard to talk to people about things that I have problems with. I've never had a serious girlfriend, he has had a wife. I find that this makes me start to hate myself. I am constantly having to borrow money from him and others and i hate myself for it. He always lends me a hand when I need it,, and he always says he is fine helping but I still get mad at myself when I ask.. He is my brother and I love him and am glad he is doing well for himself, but I just start to think, ""why am I the way I am?"". I don't know if I'm caught in a loop of self destructive thinking and that I won't allow myself to improve my life. I just struggle sometimes and have no idea where to start improving myself and that also plays in to my thoughts of self hatred. I badly want to talk to others in person about my struggles, but its like I don't let myself. Talking online is different and its easy for me and I dont know why. I don't know where to go from here."
1589,"For those of you here that got a professional diagnosis, did it help?","Title says it all I guess. I've been considering seeking a diagnosis for what I think might be PTSD because I'm personally not comfortable self-diagnosing. I also don't even know for sure if that's what it is. Like the voice in my head tells me that it's not even that bad, so it can't be PTSD and I'm just look for a way to feel ""special"" by having a diagnosis. Cause I can't stand people like that, who flaunt a mental illness like it makes them super deep and interesting, I don't want to be like that.


And let's say it was ptsd, I don't want to be medicated again and I don't think I could handle therapy, so what's the point? Other than knowing what's wrong and being able to explain it in a way that makes sense to other people."
1590,I feel like guys think I'm damaged goods.,"So for the first time in my life, a guy told me they liked me. We started talking more and I started to be more authentic.

When I brought it up he didn't really even bother about it, which I can't tell if it's a good or bad thing. I feel like when I told him, he became more hesitant of me like I was some sort of weirdo or something. This is why I'm always afraid to tell people. Every time I talk to him, it's awkward and I don't know what I should do."
1591,new therapist!,"hi all!! i finally found a therapist, after 4 years of struggling alone. here’s to hoping it’s a good fit."
1592,I accidentally almost killed myself and I think it ruined my life,"A week ago I accidentally almost killed myself. I was taking anti anxiety medication, and was out drinking with my boyfriend. I drank till i started puking and blacking out. Obviously taking meds and using alcohol was really really irresponsible of me. It's no excuse, but I wasn't exactly in the best mindset to begin with. I've had a bad week, and was trying to drink my sorrows away.

My boyfriend knew of everything. he knew that I took pills, and what they were for. When I started blacking out he dropped me off at his apartment and continued on with his evening.

Something triggered me, I'm not sure what, but I remember grabbing the closest thing to me and slicing at my arm. I know I didn't want to kill myself, because I'm not suicidal. There was blood everywhere. My boyfriend's friend (Jay) heard me scream and rushed me to the ER. He called my bf At first, my bf didn't want to believe Jay. He said that they're over reacting or something. This reasoning makes sense Because I've self harmed before, although not to this extent. When bf got to his apartment, and saw all the blood, he grasped the severity of the situation. Apparently he got really mad.

They stiched me up and I woke up sober. I remember only bits of my visit to the ER. I don't remember how I got to the ER or who found me or what. Apparently my bf was acting like a jerk and him and Jay almost had a physical altercation.

At home, everything was okay at first. But when I was alone with my bf he refused to talk to me. Rightfully so. He said that I embarrased him infront of his friends and that I trashed the place with blood, blood that him and jay had to clean up on their own.

I understood his points and apologized. I offered no protest, and I feel awful for my behaviour. I apologized the next day to everyone involved. Including Jay. At least no one was too upset at me, although I made a mistake they said it's important that I move forward from here and not to let something like this happen again.

I went back to my own apartment. Then my boyfriend called me and said that we're better off apart and that he'd like to take a break. I know this is going to sound sad, but I don't have a support system. I don't really have friends either. All my friends moved away. That's why I'm writing to strangers online. I only had him and now he was leaving me and it was all my fault. I don't have a relationship with my parents either. My mother shunned me from the family a long time ago because I'm not in the same religious group than her. She believes that God's forsaken me a long time ago, and that not even prayer can save me.

So when he left me, i felt done. Like I've lost everything in the span of two days and I had no one to talk to about what happened. I couldn't call my mother and cry to her about how my boyfriend dumped me, and I couldn't go to one of my friends and cry over coffee. Because i don't have friends like that. Oh and my health insurance stopped paying for my therapist the following day aswell.

That evening bf called me up and said that he spoke to his mother about what happened. he said that he understands where he was wrong, that he was a jerk and that he'd like to support me and be there for me. He said that we need to focus on getting me help and getting me better first, and then focus on our relationship second. Which I appreciated. He said that if I'd like to talk or something,that he'll be there. He also said that he knows our relationship will be okay. He apologized for not being there for me, and he said that he thought leaving me would be best for me. But he realises that leaving me after such an incident isn't the best thing for me, unless it's what I truly want. Of course I didn't want that. So i took his offer.

But during this week I feel like he changed his mind or something. Or Maybe it's just my uncertainty, I'm not sure. I'm trying not to be too pushy or clingy. I understand that it's a difficult time for him too. 

I had to get my stitches removed today, and tried talking to him about it yesterday. I was concerned, scared and unsure. Obviously I've never been in a situation like this before. I thought that we could see each other, we live close by and I haven't spoken to anyone about what happened since. But I couldn't because he said that he's feeling weird seeing me. So I complied, gave him space and backed off.

Today was, as anticipated, extremely difficult for me. I went to have my stitches removed. But the cut isn't healing as it should. The skin is growing over each other and it's not even completely closed yet. I also found out that I've got permanent nerve damage. Like an entire section of my arm doesn't have any feeling in it whatsoever. I actually thought it was a pain blocker, but it was just me that cut through my nerves. The doctor said, unfortunately, I shouldn't expect it to ever be back to normal again Because nerves grow back really really slow and rarely completely . The nerve damage is so bad that my thumb is affected as well. I can't extend it to the fullest without feeling electricity. Also, my arm feels hard around the cut. It's all very foreign. The fact that this is self inflicted is literally gnawing at my sanity.

I've tried texting him but he's ignoring me. So I'm not going to push him to talk to me or anything. Maybe he's in shock. I can't imagine what effect this must've had on him.

Alternatively, I've tried downloading 7cups, then you can connect to a listener or a therapist. I can't afford a therapist so I went for the listener. But the first two listeners assigned to me almost immediately tried taking advantage of my situation when they heard I'm going through a ""breakup"" situation. So I uninstalled the app. 

That's why I decided to write to reddit. I can't keep this to myself and had to talk to someone, even if it is to random people online.  Sorry for the long read. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I want to be happy again. But I'm so mad at myself, I wish I've never done what I did. My academic work is suffering as well and this scar is a permanent reminder."
1593,How do I make things get better and help my sister?,"
few days ago my sister got back from a trip with her friends. the moment i saw her i knew something was wrong and so I tried to talk to her; apparently she took marijuana and got into a bad trip that triggered a lot of the thoughts she was trying to suppress for years. Including how abusive my father was (there was this incident where he touched her down there when she was a kid at the pool) and when i tried to get her to get these things off her chest she told me that when she was a kid there was this girl who used to sexually assault her in the schools bathroom. 
All of this is deeply heavy and I booked an appointment with a therapist for her yesterday and the therapist recommended a psychiatrist because she told me she might end up needing an anti-psychotics.

my sister is cannot confront herself and so she creates this image in her head about herself. She also suffers from these delusions and beliefs that people are conspiring against her and often times she might say mean things and the next second she would completely forget about. Her therapist told me to keep away any sharp objects and keep a close eye on her; since she is suicidal.

My point is; what do I do? I’m trying my best to be there for her. I’m currently a senior and working on getting my bachelor. But I do not know what do I do? how do we survive this? 


summary td;lr : do not know what to do after a few revelations regarding my sister’s mental wellbeing"
1594,I’m breaking down because of my GF’s mental issues.,"My girlfriend and I recently got a corgi puppy together, we had considered all the issues that may come and responsibilities and we were okay with it. Fast forward, she moves into an apartment with a random roomate who didn’t like me and only allowed me around for 3/7 days. This made it hard for my gf to take care of the dog and her mental state started breaking down. (PS. She was already suffering from depression, strong anxiety issues and mental breakdowns way before the dog) She started crying every night about how stressful it is and how she never has fun anymore or even free time. This is untrue as we still spend 4-5 hours a day watching movies, playing games or just laying together. However her saying that makes me absolutely crushed because I feel useless and no matter what I say to her , she gets frustrated at me and pushes me away when I’m just trying to help. I feel like I’m both  losing control and helpless in this situation. What do I do anymore? Do I keep repeating the same old things I keep saying to her to cheer her up or am I the problem? I’m so lost and my mind has never been this broken"
1595,Thank you,"Though I’m not completely fine and my mental state is in shambles 

I do want to take time and thank each and everyone of you for reaching out and offering me advice on how to cope with my condition.

I’ve taken everything into consideration and it has changed my outlook on many things. 

Not having anyone to speak to or open up to is very difficult, and obviously COVID hasn’t done anything to make things easier.

Nonetheless, thank you for creating a channel for me to express the way I feel, every comment has brought a sense of relief for me. 

It goes without saying, if anyone of you need someone to speak to on just about any topic, you may reach out me personally.

As someone whose suffered from mental illness from a young age, the component of genuine empathy is available if required... or if you simply just want to take things off your chest, that is also available. 

Thank you."
1596,I have no one,"Sorry for getting so depp but I'm just fucking tired of everything. I had to move 4 years ago and since then everything went downhill. I've been bullied for two years, including beating up and sexual harrassment. I never told anyone about it and when I tried to open up to my mother she started to blame me for the things that happened to me and that I should just get over it. My situation at home has been a constant shitshow. After school I couldn't find a job, I couldn't even get my high school dyploma so I've been staying with my mother and step father at home for over a year now. My mother can be a caring person if she wants to, but most of the time she's just a textbook BPD person. My step father on the other hand is just a straight up asshole, he has no respect for me and just wants to get rid of me. I've been applying for jobs every month like crazy but no one fucking wants me. I can't even move out cause I'm broke. I have no one with whom I could talk. Everytime I tried to open up to someone they started to blame me for everything or talk about themselves. I don't even know what to belive anymore. Am I the bad one? Maybe it really is all my fault. I feel like I'm going fucking insane. I can't sleep at night, get paranoid in social situations and constantly feel like someone is watching or following me. I tried to seek help but I'm too scared that my mother and step father would find out. They would get mad and scream at me since they don't belive in mental health. I'm only 19 but nothing really makes sense man."
1597,Why does everybody need you alive but nobody wants to spend time with you?,"It's pretty egoistic. I feel like people need everyone alive to somehow feel better about themselves. Ignoring others pain to feel like a better person. Preaching mental awareness and self-love but consciously or subconsciously not actually giving a fuck. And then when your gone they cry for some days. Until your whole existence becomes a short anecdote which one-day will be shared to teach kids how to not do it. I stopped writing once I noticed that I'm drifting off topic, sorry."
1598,I just want to feel pure happiness again,"Ever since i recovered back at 2019 and came back to depression again after a few weeks, I've been extremely desperate to grasp the same old feeling of that sweet warmth of happiness and self love that i was only able to enjoy in less than a month. I don't even the remember the feeling when my emotions weren't numb and i can express them easily, I remember how crying wasn't difficult to express cuz no matter how much i wanna scream and cry, i just can't... No tears would fall out and all i could do is stare at my ceiling wondering what emotions were like. 
Everything is going wrong and starting to question if i really have a future. I feel like having a mental breakdown but it feels like i don't feel anything at all. Im jumping from hobby to hobby and nothing satisfies me now, I was slowly recovering and healing a month ago but idk what happened now. It's all going downhill again and im stuck in this loop. My loved ones are slowly hating me and im my mind is slowly gravitating to self harm. Im proud to say I haven't cut myself for 3 years now but idk if i can maintain it when my mind thinks of going back to grabbing my pair of sharp scissors and feel satisfied as it cuts my wrist up to my arms. I really need help, Im saving money for therapy but my brothers keep stealing money from me. I just wanna escape from all this"
1599,My sister (28F) had a breakdown and was sent to a ward. What do I (20M) do?,"TLDR: My sister had an increase in an anti anxiety medication, was manic and not herself, and then finally went into the hospital and is now in a psych ward. Now she has access to a phone and laptop and is threatening my family and I just want her to get better.

My sister has always had anxiety issues and as a family we always supported whatever we could do. She was on sertraline for a while and it seemed to work. Last week her dose got increased and with that increase she changed. She started writing crazy and barely understandable Facebook posts, leaving us all messages, posting family secrets, and finally she kept changing moods and scaring her husband. This happened over the course of the last 3 days with increasing intensity. She said very hurtful things to and about me about how she didn't care about my feelings and that there would be consequences after I tried telling her that I was getting worried and that she needed to see someone. 

Yesterday she finally got to a hospital thanks to her husband calling her doctor. I thought this would finally cease, but it didn't. They put her in a psych ward where  She got access to a phone and a whole ass laptop and is calling my family, threatening to release more secrets, made a new Facebook, quit her job, and now is still in her manic phase. I haven't responded to her voice-mails, snapchats, messenger requests, or even her emails to my personal business email. My brother in law asked them to get rid of her phone and laptop as she shouldn't have access to it if she's in a psych ward and its an emotional trigger. 

 I just want her to get better but I can't visit her due to me just moving away from my home area and COVID making it so you can't see people in a hospital. I don't want to speak with her and possibly lose any progress she might get. So far all I know is that she wants out but her messages are insane and barely comprehensible. I just want my sister back. My family is pretty stupid in opinions sometimes but this is legitimately making us all worried and now we're just ignoring her."
1600,Constantly Craving Attention,"This is both in general and with specific people, usually people I feel platonically attracted to. It’s gotten to the point when if I don’t get attention from certain people and/or those people pay attention to people other than me it will throw me into a state of serious anger and then depression. The anger is usually not more than an hour or two, but the depression can last days depending on the circumstances. Growing up, I was always the one being pushed over and ignored, and I think that’s why I am the way I am, but I want to be content with not being the most important person in the room at all times. I know it is a very toxic trait of mine and it will drive people away from me and I don’t want that."
1601,Simple questions before seeking professional help for my anger management issues,"Hello good folks of reddit,  
TL;DR at the bottom. 

I-am a 25 years old guy who is still an academically unsuccessful university student. I suffer from anger management issues since my puberty. I will put a list of my observations on myself and my family below.

First of all a summary of my anger issue; I may enrage on pretty much anything and lose control; political discussions, constant but random sizzle of a device (such as a fan), a slowed down computer, sometimes people misunderstanding me, even high-pitched voice of an elderly women...or thought of an event that made my angry before makes me angry equally as if it happened again.  


Yet I prefer to punch inanimate objects than people, never ever hurt someone with that way but someday I might also I have cracked my hands several times already. Recently my girlfriend broke up with me and I think she feared my anger and sadly she is right about fearing... I did-not even think of harming her -ever, but of course she doesn't know my mind. I started losing people I love from my life and I suppose it’s time to get help before its too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have started talking round 4.5 years old, when I was 4 my family contacted with a psychologist and run a test, psychologist said ""There is no mental deficiency also he has a great memory, he's      not talking because he doesn't see as necessity"", My mother rejects when I have asked her but my sister says ""You have Asperger’s syndrome"" not sure about it since my sister likes to make things seem dramatic,
* I've have been beaten by my sister (9 years older) until my puberty -until she wasn't able to, I suppose she had a horrible impact in my personality and confidence, she supressed me whenever      possible,
* I mostly get angry, lose control seriously quick (within seconds), start punching things or shouting and I either gain control and leave the place to get calm, if I will be forced to stay in the ground things might get ugly -that is the thing that makes me afraid most,
* I have contacted with a psychologist before for depression and anger management issue, after talking for a while she immediately handed me *the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory* after      solving it she said ""We will return to your problem but before there is something more important here, we need to solve it first"" never knew what was it since she rejected telling me and after a little while I left the city for the semester,
* My anger might be hereditary; Since my father also has anger issues, all of my paternal uncles (2) and male cousins also my grandfather. I also have 2 maternal uncles 1 has anger issues but it is      probably because of his diagnosed diabetes and other is pretty normal and calm,
* My anger might be learned behaviour; Since most of the  males I have seen in my early life was highly aggressive,
* I have some obsessive-compulsive tendencies; When I start a project or got an idea in my mind I cannot talk or think about anything else for a while, I have mild-to-moderate trichotillomania      (hair-pulling disorder) when I’m thinking on something I compulsively seek and pick out of shape beard hairs till render certain areas hairless,

**TL;DR:** I get angry over simple things extremely quick, lose control, harming myself or objects to avoid harming others, this made me start to lose people I love. All my paternal male relatives have same issue. 

Shall I contact with a psychologist or psychiatrist? Also, in my country psychiatry clinics are mostly free but even a decent psychologist charges a fortune per session so if it is a psychological problem, I have to find another way since I can barely afford my living. I will even accept using antidepressants that I won’t normally accept until I graduate and able to afford proper treatment."
1602,what are the ethics of a realistic portrayal of mental health and madness in media?,"i apologise if this isn't the write place to post this:

i'm a final year film student considering writing a film portraying a character going through a mental breakdown. 

my mental health has been rocky before but never been worrying, so i am interested in what this community has to say about respectful and disrespectful portrayals of mental health in film and TV. is it voyeuristic at all to make a film about something so personal and upsetting and claim it to be entertainment?"
1603,Comedy is a remedy!!!,
1604,"Moms of Reddit who had postpartum depression, how did you cope with post-childbirth body image issues?","I gained a healthy amount of weight during the course of my pregnancy, but after birth I was still at least 10kg above my pre-pregnancy weight. 

I've never liked my body much to begin with, and this weight gain as a result of pregnancy is messing with my body image issues even more. My postpartum depression complicates things much further.

It hits harder when nothing I owned can fit anymore. It sucks to see a whole wardrobe of clothes just become completely inaccessible to you.

I know its part of the process of pregnancy and childbirth, and I love my child to death. I've also been starting to swim every week since I like swimming, and walk about more daily for exercise. But whenever I look in the mirror I just want to give up. 

I want to find ways to cope with the body image issues that are being exacerbated. No doubt because I'm probably being impatient with myself as well, wanting to quickly shed the weight. It doesn't help that people around me (like my father in law) keep commenting that I've gained weight to my face. I feel especially stung when it's a guy that makes that comment too. 

Any advice? I really want to stop feeling like absolute shit and worse whenever I look in the mirror."
1605,"Without release, there is no renewal...","Every time we hinder ourselves from releasing negative emotions, we are locking doors for possible happiness coming our way."
1606,"People with social anxiety, have you felt like you missed out on life/opportunities?","Back in high school, there were many times where people have asked me to hang out but I just end up turning them down because I’m afraid that I would just end up shaking or over analysing situations/conversations in social gatherings. Looking back, it made realise that I missed out on developing new friendships with those whom I was interested in getting to know more and could see myself being great friends with - since we had the same interests.

On one occasion, someone called me to “speak up” in a group setting but I couldn’t because there were so many anxious thoughts racing in my head. In the past, there was also this loud person in my class who pointed out to everyone of how “awkward” I was and it has since took a huge toll on my confidence. It made cry and view myself negatively. Now, I am afraid whenever I meet new people. I always have this irrational fear that the other person will judge me for the way I speak/act or see me as an “awkward” person like how the loud kid saw me. As such, I don’t speak as much as how I’d like to and I think it somehow comes across to other person that I’m a cold person. Does anyone with social anxiety feel this way too? 

I wish I knew how to get over my social anxiety. I’m tired of having anxious thoughts in every social setting and I desire to meet new people. Those with social anxiety, do you also feel like you missed out on friendships and opportunities? How do you cope with social anxiety and what did you do to improve your situation?"
1607,"I am permadepressed, even though I know I can improve, I am too impatient to do what is required","Hi I am a 21 years old Male, I have been strugling with mental health issues all life long. After years of deep depression and costant panic attacks, I have decided last year to work proactively to understand myself more and try to understand why I do what I do and what makes me do it. I found an ongoing pattern, that is being inceedibily impatient and to be really hard on myself. I constantly undermine my efforts and my progresses and the more I try  the more inadequate I fell, the more inadequate I fell the more depressed I become. I feel blocked in a LImbo fron where I am unable to get out. What should I do?"
1608,Bipolar Disorder vs. Dissociative Identity Disorder. Does DID even exist?,"I am currently being treated for Bipolar 1. I have been doing EMDR therapy off and on for a little over a year. I have had a few discoative episodes. My psychiatrist gave gave me a test on dissociative experiences. With childhood experiences, abuse (it is what it is); they discussed a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder. I am very, very skeptical. 1) I don't believe I have ever had a different personalities. How abstract is the idea of personality? I will admit intermittent amnesia during some episodes. 2) The idea  that my self awareness would be so low, so low, it would scare me. 3) I have been in treatment for bipolar Disorder for years, and I feel like I more than meet the criteria for the DSM definition. 4) Even though I had moments of very intense physical and psychological abuse; to my knowledge, I  was never sexually abused (this is where I question my own memories and experiences) From my understanding, sexual abuse is the main type of trauma that causes this. 
I guess in short, what is the general consensus of the validity of Dissociative Identity Disorder? I have seen many criticisms, and many advocates. Maybe I misunderstand the general concept l, or maybe there is overlap, or even subjective.
I do take exception that my personal beliefs would by some be interpreted as delusional. I don't believe that, for example, that the general concept of ""reality"", is subjective. Religious experiences are valid. Extraterrestrial lifeforms are a real possibility. So whatever. I just want to know, what the concensus, articles, studies, whatever that proves/disproves this idea of ""multiple personalities"". I  don't expect or desire in any of you playing armchair shrink. Honestly, I could care less if you think I am a little...odd...or nutty. Trust me, we agree.
I just want to know what the academic community thinks of such a seemingly audacious Disorder."
1609,Is this trait a sign of mental illness?,"I go through long periods of complete apathy only to be interrupted by intense hyperfixations. 

Examples being; 

thinking I might enjoy painting by numbers to fill spare hours, leads to buying 6 different sets and spending every spare waking minute completing them for months straight and then putting them down and never picking them up again. 

I might like to get my ears pierced, within a month I've got 4 new piercings. 

Reading up on new sports and having to consume every piece of media/games/interviews/history etc in existence 

Not spending money on 'luxury items' for months at a time then in one setting spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

I feel like I lurch between 0mph and 100mph back and forth between new interests, with very few that I actually continue at a reasonable pace. 

No idea if thei is just a personality trait or something relating to mental illness. Any ideas are helpful, thanks"
1610,Do they really hate me? Just venting,"For last couple of months I've been in very dark place, nothing seems to go my way, and if something can go wrong it will go wrong. I'm in my mid 20's I have always been single (probably because I look like a piece of shit) and only people I could  talk to were a group of my mates or my mother. I don't want to burden my mother with anything because she is pretty old and she has a fair share of problems on her plate herself, so that option is out. When I try to talk about how I feel to my friends I can see they get visibly uncomfortable, and I feel that they started to despise me and try to avoid me. Because of that I started to resent them too and decided I won't speak to them any more, since they are better off without me. Only solace I had was my job there I was happy and when I felt sad I just focused on my work even more, but for about a month this method stopped working too, and my job no longer offers me protection from my own toughs, because of that I started to fall behind and I'm afraid they will let me go sometime soon. When I get home I have nothing to do, none to talk to. I thought maybe I should adopt a dog (I really love dogs) for some company, but the local shelter rejected my adoption application, and I was even denied a freaking dog that needed home (guess they found someone better I hope the dog is happy). I tried seeking help but where I live there is not much mental care provided by the state, only option is a private counselling, but I don't think the doctor would want me to get better because that would mean I would stop paying him money, also I can't really afford that. I feel I wasted my entire life so far.   
Sorry for self loathing I just wanted to say (write) it all out loud. 

If someone is even reading this I wish you all the best."
1611,GodI hate myself,"I’m literally having a panic attack over being late to school once. I don’t know why I’m like this, I hate myself. I shouldn’t want to die from being late but I do. I just want this life to be over already, I hate my anxiety so much."
1612,Depression,"Hi all,
The past few years have been hell. Hospitlized several times due to suicidal ideation, and diagnosed with Bipolar and Anxiety disorder. 
The past weeks however I have noticed I have gotten continuously depressed. I argue with my boyfriend all the time, I fight with my family, and any minor inconvenience puts me in my car hoping to wreck.  
I haven't showered in days, haven't eaten anything in 2 days, and generally been living very poorly. 
I have no friends except for my boyfriend. (I had to get rid of my closest friends due to them being extremely toxic) 
Life just sucks right now. They say it gets better but everything is just hopeless. 
I just wanted to vent. I need this to get out. To whoever reads this, thank you for taking your time."
1613,I really dont want to eat anything.,"I'm 5'9"" with a thinner athletic hourglass figure. It seems like no matter how little/healthy I eat, I always have some sort of small gut and I hate it. At most, I eat 1 or 1 1/2 small meals with maybe a snack or two a day. I get so anxious and paranoid. But the thing is, I've always liked to eat, whether I'm hungry or not so much. So I havent been eating for the pleasure of it for the past couple weeks and I've been going for walks and doing some other exercises. But my mind and body has been getting super confused. Cause when you're hungry, you think of how good the food is going to taste.

So while I'm trying not to eat as much, especially not just out of boredom, I'm starting to not be able to tell the difference between feeling hungry and wanting to eat for the pleasure of it. I panic with eating too much of anything, but I'm conflicted because with the feeling of wanting to eat, I cant tell whether it's because I need it or I WANT it. I just hate looking at myself in the mirror or when I bend to one side and see a roll or two, even tho rolls are natural, but I still cant stand it. And with me being low on money, I cant afford to be too picky when it comes to good either.

I'm trying to grasp onto reality but it's so difficult. If it wasnt getting so cold out, I'd be out running my heart out. I still might try anyways. And my period is coming around and I can feel it starting to act up more and more and I'm starting to feel a little bloated from it which is making me even more anxious.

Is this some kind of eating disorder? Or am I just weird or messed up? I'm hoping this is just a phase, even tho this is the worst it's been. I remember being self conscious bout wat I've eaten before that lasted for as long as I can remember, but around that time, i just didnt care to eat much. It's worse now with these thoughts in my head. I guess I just needed to get this out there. I'm sick of always keeping everything to myself. It definitely feels like something's off in my head."

1616,Was going to make this a comment on my last posts but I believe everyone needs to see this. Mad love to you all.,"Everyone who keeps thanking me for my last post. I appreciate it but no, the thanks goes to all of you for pushing through every single day. For waking up that next day even though we all know you didn’t want to. Each and every single one of you are more inspiring to me than I believe I could be for anyone. But I do see that my semi-success gives you hope. Good.

I wish I was never born"
1618,Depression,"This year has been hell, likely for us all here. 

I have some seizure meds for my epilepsy and holy hell my relationships have gone to shit!! I stay in the house with my kids, not allowed to drive. My fiancé does loves me- he puts up with so much but I can’t drink anymore. His family is alcoholics. I am profoundly sad- like all the time. My anxiety shot through the roof. Depression the very same. 
And here’s the kicker- we become different people when I got diagnosed. 
I constantly think or feel he actually wants that party life again. We’re over 30, me being 35. I have intense guilt and shame for my illnesses. I don’t know how to be happy. 

What do I do where do I go? 

I’m on so many meds, my brain is deteriorating every day. I have a traumatic brain injury, as well as strokes. Cant get disability. I feel a million things at once. I truly believe no one gets it unless they are in it ya know? He’s like not affected with this 2020 at all. Still has a job, no mask required. I sacrificed my life, my job to stay with the kids to monitor my seizures and teach the small kids we have... nothing makes sense. 

I’m SAD. Like drowning. Is anyone else feeling this?"
1619,Not able to help care for my grandma...,"Hi all, this is my first post in this subreddit. I've had depression for nearly 20 years now, since my early teens, and it's taken almost as long to finally receive ongoing support from secondary care services. In addition to my depression and self harm I have trouble with coping, anxiety, comfort, taking care of myself, things like that.

On Monday my grandma fell in her own home and was injured. A carer has started coming in to help, but she really does need someone to stay over, which my dad has been doing. 

I initially offered to take over from my dad for a few days but became increasingly anxious and doubtful about it and, as soon as I talked to my therapist about it, she felt like it would be a huge push for me at this stage.

Both my mother and my brother are unwell too, which leaves my dad to do anything that needs doing. I feel awful about it in addition to genuinely wanting to help and spend time with my grandma.

I guess this is partially an ""am I a butthole?"" post as well - it isn't fair on my dad and I don't want to leave my grandma feeling like I just don't care to help. It's not really appropriate to tell her how bad things are for me so, from her perspective, it must be a bit funny that I'm just sat at home and yet I can't even come stay over for a few days to be helpful..."
1620,I want to die.,I take so many antidepressants and I get ketamine infusions for depression but I still want to die. I don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm posting this... just lost. I need help.
1621,Im drowning.,So I'm posting here cause I need to vent or get advice or something. Lately things have been soo fucked up. So it all started with me getting jumped about a week ago. Then a few days later my gf's little sister admitted she wants to fuck my best friend. She has her own mental health issues. She has thrill-seeking behavior as well. My girlfriend has serious depression as well. I'm pretending that I'm okay cause my gf and her little sister come to me to talk. I love them both so I want to help. But here the thing. I have some many voices in my head screaming at me. I don't think id be better off dead but I have thought about dying many times just fo get my brain to shut off. I just need some fucking peace and quite.
1622,maybe I’m just lucky but I’ve had more good experiences than negative with therapists/ the mental health system.,"I see a lot of people talk about bad experiences with therapists,fear of disclosing suicidal thoughts, and being involuntarily hospitalized. The mental health professionals I have worked with have never once hospitalized me for having suicidal thoughts, plus they’re supposed to explain to you in the beginning that they break confidentiality if you have a specific plan to hurt yourself or someone else. I’ve seen a lot of people shit on the suicide hotlines as well, I personally have never called them but my friend has and she had a really good experience! My concern is that there is A LOT of misinformation that may cause fear in people who are on the fence about disclosing suicidal thoughts, or reaching out to suicide hotlines and etc. these resources are very good resources!!! please do not let one bad story turn you off from getting the help you deserve."
1623,Help Ne Understand This Behavior,"Burner account. I have a long history of depression, decently managed with medication and occasional talk therapy. Still, even at my best I deal with pretty constant suicidal ideation. No attempts, no plans, and no real desire to kill myself. Just that consistent passive voice that says do it.

I talk to myself a lot and don’t realize I’m doing it. No one is talking to me, I’m not hearing voices. It’s just this repetitive monologue of suicidal ideation, saying I want to go to sleep, or saying I want to go home. 

When it’s fairly low intensity it’s easy to talk myself down and focus on other things. Sometimes it’s harder to control though, I’ll feel intense negative emotion and I’ll call out “I hate my life!” Or “I want to die!” It almost feels like a tick that comes out whether or not I want to. My biggest fear is it will come out in public and I’ll make a scene. It gets worse when I use cannabis.

At this point I don’t know what to do. Obviously I have some work to do on my emotional well-being but I’ve also been working crazy hard on that this past year. I got to a pretty good place for a while and then got my heart broken by an unrequited love. On top of that I lost my insurance and my new plan doesn’t cover nearly as much for mental health services. 

I just need some perspective, I’m not sure how to get these outbursts under control and keep my emotions more positive for longer periods of time."

1625,what can I do to help myself deal with with anxiety while nearing my birthday?,"my birthday is almost here, and I'm just so anxious. I know that my friends are planning something for me online. I just want to switch my phone off, but it will be rude since they're taking such strains for me. I'm so grateful for my friends, and I love them, but I don't want them to do this. I don't deserve this. I haven't done anything in the past year to deserve this appreciation. I'm afraid I'll break down in front of them. what do I do?"
1626,im suffering from pathological procratination,"Guys, please write some motivational advice to stop fucking procrastinating. I have so many things things at uni but words like: ""if you want to do it, you simply do it"" dont help me.

1627,I don't know what I am feeling,"I feel down during these few past days due to online class. I really feel emotionally tired and it got worse when I got a low score on a botany quiz. After that, I felt down and can't seem to move on from it. I know it wasn't a big deal, but I couldn't stop myself from feeling this way. I always aim for a higher grade, but when I got a low grade which is under my expectations, I feel really bad. :((((((((((((((((("
1628,How to be you?Why do you think you want to be anyone else?,"How to be you?

Firstly, why do you think you want to be anyone else?

1. You are unhappy with your life

2. You feel others have a better or say perfect life

3. You envy others

4. You idealize others

5. You find it an easier way to escape your problems

6. You want to escape the reality

Whatever might be your case, you can never be someone else

Best you do is Pick good from others, neglecting their Negativity

What is your reason, why do you want to be someone else?"
1629,Worried that I'm crazy after breakup,"I'll start by saying that I've always been a been a very chill, level-headed guy. I always been complimented on how I never yell or have anger issues. I did have a moderate case of OCD that was treated with CBT a few years back, but that's it.

I dated my ex on and off for 5 years before breaking up for good. My ex was constantly breaking up with me during our relationship, and then would come within a week or two. The first breakups would hurt, but I'd pick my chin up and respect her decision and try to move on. After what seemed like the 10th or so breakup, I seemed to be hooked. I don't know if it was intermittent reinforcement, or I had just got more attached, but I started to take the break ups a bit harder. At one point during a break up, I was so fed up with her breaking up with me, I slept with an escort out of revenge for what she put through. Of course, she came back a few days later, and I felt incredibly guilty for what I did and confessed.

We were fine for a good while at this point, but of course the pattern continued, and she broke up with me again. This time seemed different, she seem committed to the break up. I was devastated and begged and cried for her to come back, but she was would not budge. However, this is where she was a bit selfish. Even though she broke up with me, she claimed to still love and miss me, but we just couldn't be together due to religious differences. She would call/text me every few days saying that she misses me, and wanted to hear me say it back. I would say it, and it would relieve her for a few days before she would call again. At this point I put my foot down, and blocked her. She started showing up to my house, and would beg me to see her. We started hooking up again, but she would not want to get back together. My mental health at this point was at it's absolute worst. I was crying all day long and could not function. I was just hoping for another breadcrumb, another invite from her to hook up again.

This is where I started thinking crazy. I thought if I get her pregnant, she can't leave again. So the next time she invited me, I went through with it. I immediately felt regretful for what I did, and we both cried, and we agreed for her to take the Plan B pill to be safe. Even though she took the pill, a small part of me still wanted her to be pregnant.

Thankfully she did not get pregnant. We did end up getting back together for 2 more years (on and off of course). But I think back to these two occasions of the escort and pregnancy trap, and can't help but think how crazy I was.

Since the final breakup, I've gotten obsessed with personality disorders, and I often get worried about having one.

I'm seeing a therapist now, and she doesn't think I'm crazy. She says that I was in a very toxic relationship, and that it how I was coping with the roller coaster of the relationship."
1630,Starting to get worried about my behavior,"Hey guys, I (M 20yo) have fallen back into depression for a week now and it's weird. 

I've had a few destructive behaviors since I was a teen, but it's usually under control (I drink too much alcohol at certain periods, have way too much coffee, smoke too much during depressive episodes and I've had a bit of bad eating habits from time to time) but these are usually specific periods of time that don't last too long and only happen in certain contexts. I always recover really fast from it and go back to my pretty fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.

 Except it's all happening at the same time right now. I'm drinking at least a bottle of red wine every day (only at dinner, not during the day), I'm smoking a lot during the day, I don't leave the house (partly because I caught covid but mostly because I'm severely depressed) and most importantly I don't eat. I only eat at dinner, way less than I usually do, and kinda only eat so I can drink wine (I have dinner with my parents, we're French, to them a bottle of wine a day is pretty normal).

I'm very athletic usually but I got injured last week so I can't exercise in any way. I feel that this is getting out of hand. I don't feel like talking with anyone, the sole idea makes me tired, I can't talk to my best friends because talking to me recently ""made them sad"" (Their actual words).

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm not hungry, I just feel like getting high on coffee all day to write and draw, and then drink and smoke until my smile isn't fake. I can't keep going like this."
1631,Can't eat? [question/ a vent],"sorry if this is long if you don't want to read my summarised life story you can skip to the end and help me with my actual question thanks lol---&gt;

I'll start with I do have extremely bad OCD and anxiety that began when I was about 5 but got diagnosed by my doctor and a therapist at 12. I never wanted to go to school, I got bullied a lot.I've been 5'1 since I was 13 (thanks dad) and I'm a female. When I turned 13 my anxiety and OCD got even worse.I was very depressed and honestly hoped and prayed I wouldn't wake up when I went to sleep. I just ate my problems away and by the time I turned 16-17 I weighed 13 stone (82kg/182lbs) at 5""1.I decided I wanted to do something about it as I knew I was morbidly obese, but my idea was not to eat, and I ended up losing around 3 1/2 stone (22kg/49lbs) but I didnt feel any happier in fact, I felt worse, as my uncles, who actually were the ones who bought me a takeaway 3 days a week, and got mad when I didnt go with them, then made fun of me then for eating so much, started saying how better I looked, when I was starving myself( I dont talk to them anymore, my mam stopped too when she found out what they were saying). Then last year I finally decided to go back to my doctor and get prescribed medicine to help me. I weigh a bit under 9 stone at a healthy weight as of this moment and have began working out the last month and have been eating healthy for 2 years now. A takeaway maybe every 2 months and no sodas/fizzy drinks at all, just water. I can say I'm SO much happier. 7 months ago I was getting an electric guitar as I have acoustic and wanted to play electric because music has helped me at lot in my life and calms me down. The night before I was getting it, I was actually scared to go to sleep in case I didn't wake up. I cried, not at the fear of not waking up but I was happy I wanted to live. 


[QUESTION] so that brings me to my title I do feel happier now but I mainly still struggle with my weight. Some days I do eat less than I should but when I eat I feel like getting sick, Sometimes I actually start heaving and my mouth starts watering, I run and lean over the toilet but I can stop myself from actually throwing it back up.I was wondering if there is anyway I could get over this fear of eating/ I guess gaining weight? I'm getting prescribed prozac from my doctor instead of the sertraline bluefish tablets I've been taking for about a bit over a year now because I used to take the tablets in my food, now like I said I almost throw up the food expecially with the tablet in it. Will the prozac help this or is there anything else I can try? Thank you!"
1632,Should I still feel bad to the point of suicidal thoughts for bad stuff I did at 11 years old?," from the ages of about 8 to 11 I was the worst human being conceivable, I was expelled from multiple schools for many kinds of bad behaviour (I was diagnosed with autism at about 7 so that probably played a factor into why I was like that) I used to punch and kick people, I said very racist things before i even knew what they meant or understood how bad what I said was, I stabbed a teacher and student with a pencil and other stuff, and even though I'm a lot older now and I know the changed and I'm nothing like that anymore, I still look back at myself with disgust and regret for what I did, and every day I wake up hating myself sometimes to the point of feeling suicidal, and I'm not sure if I should still feel like this, should I?"
1633,Don’t Identify With Emotions,"You can’t BE sad and still be yourself, but you can FEEL sadness and still be yourself.

1635,"My mind is a terrible place, where I don't want to go","Disclaimer- Off my chest rant... disturbing.

I have been having horrible time from past 2 years and it has worsened over time. I have been suffering from stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness. I stay in a constant state of fear and anxiety, the moment I get up from my bed in morning till the time I fall asleep at night. 

-  Procrastination: My thoughts don't let me focus on my work and I have ""n"" number of things to do, but I end up procrastinating.

- Messed up Mind: I find it tough to frame my thoughts and it is messed up out there. 

- Failure: Many a times I have tried to overcome this feeling, but I've failed miserably. Every time I fall deeper in the pit of depression. Literally I don't have any respect for myself in my eyes. I have tagged myself as a failure.

- Sadness: I feel sad, almost everyday. 

- Anxiety : It f*cks with me every second, everyday.

- Low key suicidal thoughts: As in I am won't be sad if I don't wake up next morning. Sometimes I really wish that I could either turn back time or never born at all.

I've had therapy sessions too, but it hasn't helped me much. I try hard to get out of this shit, but get sucked back into this everytime. This is just something off my chest."
1636,I don't even know anymore,"Hi guys. I'm not entirely sure really how to start this, but oh well. I made a post on this sub many months ago, and the support was overwhelming, and all advice was good. There was one part I over looked I guess. Myself. 

I'm helping my girlfriend, I myself feel.... Fractured? My mind just feels kinda broken down, if I'm being honest. I should've paid attention, but I was so focused on her I just ignored myself. Thought I was invincible. Thought I could be resilient. But.... I guess not. I know I can, and will, bounce back just fine, but right now my mind feels broken down, my moods at a constant low. I feel irritated and snappy constantly at this point rn. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. My motivation for life in general has gone down. I'm not suicidal, or harmful in any means, but I just don't chase after what makes life good anymore. I don't exercise as much as I use to, don't really go out. As I said, mind's just fractured. 

Thanks for anyone who read this. This was kinda just a way to get my thoughts of my chest."
1637,Please think about this,"It has been long since we've been hearing to health advisories from superstars, doctors, friends, neighbours and family members regarding keeping calm, taking care of ourselves and not falling prey to depression and stress. We've also read multiple articles during this lockdown regarding the preventive methods we can adopt against stress and anxiety to develop positivity around us. 

But the questions that arise in the end are: **Have we been able to really conquer stress using these verbal and written advices? Have these general public health advisories been successful in rightfully impacting the instinct of humans towards their mental health?** There are a few more to follow but for sure it won't be comfortable for many of us to answer these two; given the amount of dire straits we've seen people get into in the near past or probably ever since the ramifications of the lockdown came into existence.

It's always said that **prevention is better than cure but have we ever noticed that it never meant that we shouldn't make efforts to find the cure**. The problem which the whole humanity faces today is modern and requires modern solutions. It's not easy to avoid one's mind from getting the thoughts anxiety and stress but definitely it is comparably easier to revive a disturbed mind back to normal, if aid is provided at the right moment and in the right manner.

Today, it has become a necessity for us to understand that mere advices and 'feel-good messages' won't do the job for us. We need to stand strong with the victim like family and provide him/her the commiseration he/she needs at that time. We need to sow the seed of togetherness in their barren minds of loneliness. Once this is done, we will definitely see the expected results. 

We at [cowin.live/freedom](https://cowin.live/freedom) are doing our bit in fighting this gruesome battle and would love to support anybody who feels the need of a company or a guidance even. Friends, we reiterate: **simple messages and routine updates won't be of any use for the sufferers' health amelioration. We need to connect with them closely, understand their problems and then guide them the right way forward.**"
1638,My old friends are messaging me and it makes me happy,"I'm in year 11, I went to a school for 1 year and had to leave because my brother was facing threats, 4 years later my year 7 friends are messaging me, I thought people would forget me, makes me happy to know I'm not forgettable lol"
1639,"My best friend just had his first kiss, and it’s crushing me","I feel very lonely most of the time but I’ve always had this one friend that I depend on. The thing is, I like him, more than a friend. I know it sounds too “teenagery”. But I really do think we have a special bond. We’ve both liked other people and talked about it with each other, and it was fine because we would be entertained and gossip about it. I was on a call with him a minute ago, he told me that he kissed another girl. We’re not dating, so it should be fine. But he always hints that he likes me, or maybe it’s just my emotions blinding me. I told him I had homework and immediately hung up. I literally have no one else to talk to. He’s my closest friend. We’ve been helping each other work through depression. Now I’m going to end up alone. He completely caught me off guard. I feel so helpless. I have no friends or someone to talk to. I have no one."
1640,I'm in the middle of a breakdown and I don't know if its hospital worthy.,"To make a long story short: Today I almost died, no exaggeration, and its triggered a huge breakdown. 

I am not in danger of hurting myself or others, I have my 5 year old with me and I've been caring for her as best I currently can (she is fed, clothed, finished her schooling, and begging to go outside), I have tried contacting my counselor but she is on vacation, I tried my Mom but she said she had no time for this, and I'm wondering if I truly need to go to the hospital or if theres another option? 

Thank you so much for your time!"
1641,I don’t trust myself anymore,"I’ve had depression for a few years now and I spend a large amount of my time thinking of killing myself but it was only ever just thoughts. I never wanted to go through with it, I didn’t have the motivation. 

However, today was a really bad day. I started uni last month and it’s just so much work and it’s all really hard and I’m barely keeping up. All my friends are moving away, the only one who hasn’t I’ve been in love with for years but I’m not willing to risk losing her so I haven’t told her.

I met her last night and it was the best evening I’ve had in years. But now I’m really fucking missing her, more than usual. She’s the only thing that makes me genuinely happy.

I just got so overwhelmed this afternoon that I just got up from my desk and drove to this hill near my city with a massive cliff and no fencing. 

After a few minutes walking it started to rain and I didn’t even care. I spent a good 25 minutes standing at the edge of that cliff. Just thinking. 

I took a step closer to the edge and then my mind flashed to last night and her smile. And that was enough to make me realise what I’d been about to do.

I walked away from the cliff and drove home. I just really scared myself cause I’ve never come that close before and now I don’t trust myself. Also I don’t know how to tell my friend that she’s the only reason I’m still alive.

Sorry that ended up being longer than I’d planned but I just needed to get it all out."
1642,Does this sound like I have Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar 2)?,"I have had depression for many years prior to being diagnosed with it but I never considered to be bipolar until an hour ago.  I should also mention that I have anxiety and I do identify as asexual (low libido, masturbate but no sex).

My usual self is very quiet and don't like to socialise (especially with my coworkers on my break), no libido and rarely masturbate, sleep about 6-7 hours on average, and try to avoid going on spending sprees because I don't have much money.

In the last year I have had severe depressive episodes lasting about 1-2 months each and one of those episodes also had self-harm and suicidal thoughts.  However I have noticed that I have had periods afterwards where I was different in terms of my mood.  I was talking more with my coworkers and actively making conversation on my breaks (felt like I was trying to force myself to talk while I was this energetic??), had crazy strong libido and masturbating way more, sleeping a lot less but wasn't tired or was saying up for over 24 hours without issues, buying more things online, becoming really fixated on things (just recently had about a week of thinking I wanted to become a single mum and was researching everything and how much it would cost and looking at everything possibly related to it).  I also had a lot of thoughts going in my head, especially about being a single parent but I'm not sure if that's relevent or if I was panicking on how stressful it is...

The times where I am I would guess hypomania might not be as ""severe"" but compared to my usual self, it is noticable.

If anyone can help me in determining if I may have Bipolar, TYIA.  *I am looking for a new psychologist but I'm broke AF right now.*"
1643,How are mental health hospital..?,I'm scared
1644,I can't cut back on my screen time even though I know it's bad for me.,"I'm a law student, and I spend about 10-12 hours a day using my computer for class and work. It's gotten worse since everything went virtual (plus I am still strictly quarantining, so I really only spend time with my partner, who works a lot too). After work, I usually go on my phone on tiktok or twitter for literally hours. I also look at my phone for a while first thing in the morning. Most days I'm looking at a screen from the moment I wake to the moment I fall asleep.

I have other hobbies that I'd rather do, such as paint, cook, exercise, etc. But after a long day of work I just want to stare blankly at my phone. I know the amount of time I spend on my screens is detrimental for my mental health. But I can't seem to cut back.

I guess I'm partially asking if anyone has any advice for me to break my phone addiction, and I'm partially just talking into the void to see if anyone else has dealt with similar issues."
1645,Trouble trusting girls,"I'm a guy and I'm just having so much trouble trusting any girl with anything. When I had a girlfriend it was miserable because all I could think about is ""I wonder if she's talking to other guys"" or ""I bet she doesn't like me"" and I feel like that's what pushed her away. Even having friends who are girls is hard too. I acussed a friend of mine of using me only as a ride when she needs to get somewhere and I dont know if I was in the wrong or in the right. Its just hard to trust ig. And then I see videos online about how most girls talk to like 5 guys at a time while guys usually talk to one. Like if I start talking to a girl, how do I know she isn't using me for something? How can I keep up with other guys? Sorry for the formatting, im on mobile."
1646,How do you completely change how you see yourself?,"Hello,

I'm 27F with a very average life for Western standards. My upbringing and family circumstances weren't perfect, but whose are nowadays? 

I've been living ignorantly happy lately. Due to Covid my workplace is only letting us work part-time, but where I live we are getting government aid so I'm getting by.

Anyway, I have way too much free-time now, and my boyfriend keeps encouraging me to discover new hobbies and he has been teaching me about online businesses that I could try. 
I have actually started looking into some things, but quickly gave up on all of them. And it got me thinking why.

I get extremely overwhelmed when hearing about all the things I could do and opportunities. Like I don't even know where to start. And then I start getting pessimistic: Why even bother, whatever I do there are already millions or people who are doing the same thing, with more experience, skills, better looks, whatever.

He has been challenging my life views a lot lately, for example by talking about property we could save up to buy in the future. Property? Me? Until now, I barely had enough money to pay my rent and car. I was always living in the moment, because thinking about the future was depressing me too much.

Btw I'd love to build a business with him together, I have always been more of a supporter than a leader. But he is already in the middle of building a business and out and about working 12+hours a day... makes me feel extra lazy and stupid for chilling my days away at home.

He has never been mean to me about it or anything, but he sometimes acts a little confused how I can be ""wasting"" time like that. 
I like it, because I am actually not happy with sitting on my sofa most days either. But I just cant focus and get myself to really start something...

Because I have no confidence that I could build anything at all...
How can I start believing in myself? Is changing your self-esteem even possible as an adult?
My whole self view is that I'm average at everything and uninteresting. I find joy in uplifting others, rather than draw attention to myself."
1647,Reached out and got an ‘oh shit’,"reached out to someone today after having like a month long depressive episode.. i was literally crying in the shower and told this person i wasn’t doing so good, all they said was “oh shit” and then aired me. so much crap has happened and i’m not entirely sure what to do now :/"
1648,How do I become a person of high value?,"Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble, but I would like to convey the major events of my life and how I’m feeling right now. It all really started in fourth grade when I got bullied by my classmates after moving to a new school. At first, I tried to counter it by acting weird on purpose which caused me to deserve more bullying, and eventually gave me permeant anxiety I still have to this day. Later on, in middle school and early years of high school I developed depression and was suicidal almost every day, but my one and only attempt was fucking pathetic and eventually I figured out that I was too much of a pussy to ever go through it. After being forced to go through therapy which didn’t help COVID happened and I utilized the time given to improve my situation and now I feel mostly nothing most of the time and am either mellow or have (surprisingly developed) extreme anger at everyone that I hold back and just let rot in the back of my head. I have since been reflecting on my life and have realized how pathetic I am. I’m insecure about my voice due to being called gay because of the way it sounds and hate how high pitch it is and that I can do nothing about it, and people either find me annoying or forget about me over the years. I have ruined most of my friendships by being weird. I can’t keep on living like this. I want to be seen as a person of high value by the people around me instead of just some skinny faggoty ugly loser, but don’t know how to. I have fleeting aspirations of being a comedian, but every time I try to crack a joke to make the people around me laugh and feel good it gets called too offensive or weird or I can’t even complete it because I have a severe stutter. I have genuine trouble understanding people and it feels like I’m different from everyone else. I’m beginning to contemplate suicide again but am fighting it off by saying in my mind that I need to accomplish things in my life, but as the day turns ‘round I feel more and more horrible about myself. My question to whoever reading this I guess is, how can I become a person of high social value? I want to be admired by people for being funny and not looked down upon, but I can never get it right."
1649,I struggle being honest with my psychiatrist...,"Now the title pretty much says it all, I've been having a wide array of mental issues for years at this point, recently decided to finally stop with the denial and look for some help, and eventually got to talk to a psychiatrist so he can find out what's my major malfunction

Long story short, i am not telling him just how deep the suicidal thoughts go... im too scared to, I dont want to worry him, and i dont even want to know how he'll react if i tell him that i basically have a new plan each week

He says its very likely i have bpd and, well, i guess if his theory is right then it wouldn't be that out of the ordinary 

Nevertheless though i want to remedy this... im just terrified to

Any tips? How do i open up about something like this, i know i need to, just how???"
1650,My Mom Doesn't Want Me To Do The Diagnosis Test For Psychopathy and Empathy Deficit,"So I've been trying to be more aware of myself and my behaviors and I noticed throughout my entire life I always have a distinct lack of empathy for people and their feelings. I myself can feel emotions so I know i'm not a psychopath but when it comes to understanding peoples emotional reactions I have absolutely no clue why people act the way they do and how to respond to others. For examples when my sister overdosed and my aunt died within 2 weeks of each other I never cried out of sadness or had fits of depression but I only cried one time in each situation because I felt like I was supposed to at the scene of the incident and at the funeral. Everyone also tells me that I speak incredibly blunt and mistake me for being aggressive because I don't sugar coat (i'm never being aggressive). I don't care about recieving attention from others, being liked, or being understood so I don't think i'm a narcissist. And I don't have any emotional instability or impulsivity like with borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. So besides being potentially a borderline psychopath or having empathy deficit disorder I really don't know what it could be so I want to go through the official test because it's always frustrating not being able to understand others, especially since i'm a female and women are expected to be more considerate of other peoples feelings. 
However, I mentioned taking these test to my mother and she doesn't want me to take them. She believes that i'm just trying to add an extra ""label"" to myself. I'm going to do the test anyway but how do I explain to her that I should still get an official diagnosis for whatever I may have."
1651,I’m really struggling again and I don’t know where to turn.,"Basically, around last October-March I went through a strange time. I lost friends, my friends lost friends and everything changed. I was in a new school and things were up in the air. During this time, I felt really down and had very little motivation. I couldn’t sleep, I had no appetite, and I was easily irritable. I was in a constant state for worry but I didn’t always know what that worry was. Lockdown started and that managed to give me some time to work on myself. I wasn’t bombarded with pressure to socialise, I could just improve me. I did that. Since then and up until recently, I’ve been so much better and was even telling myself how proud I was. 

Yesterday it all changed. It’s like a switch was flicked and I felt the exact same way as I did last year. It’s so unexplainable. I hate it so much, I started crying about it today because I thought this time round it would be different. My friendship group isn’t what it used to be, but I have good friends. We don’t go out and socialise very often, and socialisation suddenly became very scary for me to the point of me just giving up on it. I feel like I’m not a very good friend because of that. However, I didn’t think I would feel like this at all, I was looking forward to moving on and through new year and everything... I hate how I’m feeling so much. It’s so hard to describe but it’s like the worst feeling ever. I just want to shut my eyes and make everything go away. I’m overwhelmed and I just need some help."
1652,Why does everybody need me alive but nobody wants to spend time with me?,It's pretty egoistic. I feel like people need everyone alive to somehow feel better about themselves. Ignoring others pain to feel like a better person. Preaching mental awareness and self-love but consciously or subconsciously not actually giving a fuck. And then when your gone they cry for some days. Until your whole existence becomes a short anecdote which one-day will be shared to teach kids how to not do it.
1653,I don’t want to be alive anymore,.
1654,I feel like I am stuck and I don’t know what to do.,I don’t want to die but I also don’t want to wake up every day to go to bed crying. I go to school every weekday from 8:25 until 15:30 study until 18:00 to then eat and go to bed and still fail the test the next day. My weekends are me mostly resting and trying to draw to then just get upset about my drawing not looking like I want it to and feeling disappointed. I can clearly remember the last time I was happy at and it felt so overwhelmingly good I want that feeling back so bad but I don’t know how. I just don’t know what to do.
1655,Stress,"Ok, so this is my first post. Sorry if I don’t do this correctly. Anyways....
I’m wondering if I’m pulling myself into too many directions. I know I’m really the only one that knows how to gauge that but I want to see if you guys/gals believe I am doing too much. 

Here’s my regular schedule:
* I have 5 college classes that I generally study 3-4 hour a week each.

* Since what I want to do after college is software development/something techy I spend 1-2hours over the weekend learning extra things outside of my classes.

* I am trying to learn Japanese because I really want a new and fresh perspective in life. Currently I’m studying Japanese for 1-2 hours on the weekend. Possibly planning to do it 1 hour every weekday. (Depending on how you guys react to my schedule)

* I workout on every other weekday for about 1-2 hours

* I really love drawing so I try to draw whenever I have time.

* I have a dog that I have to care for. (I won’t stop that)

* I clean religiously (I won’t stop that)

* I try to read when I have time (I won’t stop that)

* I really want to learn the piano

* I don’t really have a social life but I might start trying to do things with people (after this whole COVID thing of course)

* And I love video games (I might have to stop playing them so much)

*And then like every other human I have about a thousand appointments a month.

(I’m 19 about to turn 20. I do all of these things because I am constantly focused on bettering myself. I plan on constantly working all of my 20’s and I don’t really see a need for a girlfriend)

Again sorry if I did this post thing wrong."
1656,I’m not sure what I should do. I don’t want to lose someone I love,"So my ex (27M) and I (20F) broke up months ago after dating for about 2 years. He has very severe Borderline Personality Disorder and doesn’t have health insurance so he doesn’t get the help that he needs to manage his incredibly intense emotions. We have remained very close friends since he broke up with me and we still love each other very much, but he has repeatedly encouraged me to move on and find someone new—he just says that he doesn’t want to know anything about it because he knows he would be jealous. So like I said it’s been months since we broke up and I haven’t attempted to talk to other guys up until now. I’ve hung out with this guy I used to work with a couple times over the past few weeks and of course not mentioned anything to my ex. This past Saturday the guy and I had planned for him to come pick me up so we could go get takeout. About 30 mins before he’s supposed to pick me up, my ex texts me and says he’s on a walk near my house and asks if he can come say Hi to me and my roommate that he’s also friends with. He does this regularly and usually only stays for like 5 minutes. I tell him that he can stop by but that I have a friend coming to pick me up in a little bit. For some reason this time in particular, my ex stays longer than usual and he’s still there by the time the guy shows up to pick me up. I tell him that my friend is here and we’re going to pick up food. He stays inside because he’s still talking to my roommate. I go out and get in the guys car and I see my ex run up to the window to see who I’m getting in the car with. My roommate told me that he asked who it was I was getting in the car with and she told him that it was just a friend I used to work with and he left without saying anything else. So the night goes on and the guy and I are just hanging out at my house and around 8 I start getting texts from my ex that are like “WHAT THE FCK IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY WOULD YOU HAVE ME OVER WHILE YOU GOT READY FOR A FCKING DATE YOU SICK FUCK.” I respond with something like “Don’t be ridiculous I wasn’t trying to make you jealous,, you know I would do anything for you.” He continues to berate me telling me I did it on purpose to hurt him. I don’t respond. Around midnight we here this violent banging on my front door and it scares the shit out of me because I live in a kinda sketchy neighborhood so I literally grab my taser and try to discreetly peak out the blinds to see who it is. It’s my ex at the door and he sees me peaking out the window and he screams at me to open the door. I open the door and he starts screaming “WHERE IS HE? WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?”  The dude I have over comes out of my room and is like “Umm what’s going on?” and my ex starts yelling at him that he needs to leave immediately. An verbal altercation ensues for like 7 minutes and my ex goes “He has to leave right now or you will never fcking see or hear from me ever again. I swear to god.” So obviously I don’t want to never see him again but I’m not going to make the dude I have over leave because he’d probably never talk to me again and I assume my ex is just having an episode that he would come out of later. So he leaves and tells me he’ll never see me again. The guy I have over leaves soon after because the situation has obviously made him very uncomfortable. Then I get more texts from my ex that are like “I’m coming back and if he’s still there I’m going to beat the shit out of him and go to jail.” I immediately drive to my ex’s house to try to calm him down but he screams at me at the top of his lungs that he hates me and never wants to see me again, so I leave and notice shortly after that he’s blocked me on everything. Around 4am my roommate comes into my room freaking out because my ex has sent her a video of him slashing his face open with a razor. I immediately rush over to his house again and he refuses to let me in so I just sit outside his door for like 15 minutes before he finally opens it. His entire face and body is covered with blood. He’s still pissed at me and telling me he hates me but eventually he calms down enough to let me clean the blood and bandage his cuts. Both emotionally drained, we fall asleep next to each other for a few hours and when we wake up he doesn’t seem to be mad at me anymore. We talk for a little bit and he apologizes and I leave telling him that I will always love him. Then, the next day I get a text from him telling me that we need to talk. I head over to his house and he comes out and gets in my car and says “I’m just going to make this quick so it doesn’t get ugly. You have broken my heart and I never want to see you ever again.” He then proceeds to say the most hurtful things he could possibly say to me having known me so long for so well. He tells me that he knows at heart that I am a terrible person and that I am just like my dad who cheated on my mom and tore apart my family. He gets out of the car and I just sit there sobbing for several minutes before I drive to the liquor store and get a bottle of vodka. I drive to my house and chug that shit because I know the best I can do is just pass out for the night. I don’t hear from my ex until last night. He unblocked my number just to verbally assault me over text some more. He calls me a heartless bitch and a pathological liar and tells me i’m not the person he fell in love with. I try to defend myself but it just makes him more mad. He blocks me again shortly after, and here we are now. Knowing my ex and his mental illness, I should have known better than to let him come over before that boy came to pick me up. I will admit that. But I truly didn’t mean to hurt him like this. I hate knowing that I’m the source of this immense pain that he’s experiencing. He truly believes that I was out to break his heart despite the fact he broke mine when he broke up with me months ago. He and I have gotten in bad fights in the past but nothing this intense. I don’t want to lose him forever because I care and worry about him so much but I know this isn’t good for me. Any advice? Sorry for the long ass post—I didn’t want to leave too much detail out. Thanks guys"
1657,Just got diagnosed with PTSD. What do I do?,My life feels like it’s falling apart. I was doing so well for so long and then memories that I didn’t even know I had started resurfacing and wrecking my mental health. I talked to my therapist about it and she said we would start trauma counseling asap and she was so kind about it that I started sobbing all over again. What do you do when memories start coming back? How do you deal with them? I had four come out over the past two years...and then two this same week. It’s scaring me a lot and it’s very disorienting.

1658,Forgiveness...it is really worth it?,"This is my post here, although I've been tempted to engage for awhile since I joined this subreddit.

Anywho...this is something that often weighs on my mind, and I have sort of this mental battle within me about forgiveness.  On one hand, sure I can forgive small things like unintentional mistakes, but where do you draw the line in forgiving someone that hurt you in some way?

Despite coming from a religious family, I believe in God but I absolutely detest all forms of Christianity, and I definitely look down on those in our Black community who still worship and are brain-washed by ""White Jesus"".  With that mentality, we as Black people, unfortunately, tend to forgive the most egregious shit (like molestation/sexual abuse and murder), but I've always been more of a believer in ""eye for an eye"".  I've always heard that with forgiveness, it's suppose to ""free"" the offended person and not necessarily as a means to reconciliation, but to me, that also holds the door open to the same offender to do the same shit again and again.  I would rather do bodily harm to you after the first time so you wouldn't think twice of doing it again...you do something that fucked-up to me, I couldn't let you get away with that action.

So...are you for forgiveness or vengeance?"
1659,"I can’t eat [TW: suicidal ideation, talk of diet/food]","I’m(M18) not super into food as a person. I’m 5’6” and 130 lbs for context, not a big guy. Some people really like food, I’m more indifferent. I eat to fuel myself. I enjoy junk food as much as anyone else, but I typically eat fruit as a snack over chips. I’ve been vegetarian for over four years now, but I still eat eggs and cheese fairly regularly. 

When I moved on campus to start college, I slowly became less hungry. I know it happens to me with stress, but never to this extent. Usually I eat because I know I need to, even if I don’t feel hungry. I started just eating one time a day in the dining hall, just to force myself to eat something, and that was it. But now I’m even more averse to food.

I get nauseous whenever I eat. It was a problem for a short amount of time that I could only eat without nausea when I smoked bud, but I’m taking a tolerance break rn(a week so far without smoking atm) bc I recognized that problem. I was forcing myself to eat for a couple of weeks, but yesterday I decided I would only eat if I felt hungry, to see if that helped the nausea. It’s been 24 hours and I’m still not hungry, I ate a normal sized meal the night before.

I’m immensely depressed and suicidal(I have a plan and will probably act on it soon) but I have no clue what to do with myself. Anxiety as well, definitely all of this contributes to the constant nausea. Maybe will make a different post about that. 

TLDR

Right now I’m just looking for advice on how to eat. Is it good for me to force myself to eat even if I’m not hungry and it gives me nausea? Is there any technique that would help with this? It’s been worse before with me throwing up pretty much every day, and I’m not there right now, but I feel hopeless. I honestly feel like it’s kind of a good thing because if this goes on long enough I’ll just starve to death and not have to take my own action to kill myself."
1660,I had to get this off my chest. Please help.,"WARNING: MENTION OF SELF-HARM

Hi, I’m currently 16 and have been struggling for the past 6 years of constant self-hatred filled with panic attacks and breakdowns. 
I’m writing this here and only now because I just finished having a breakdown after some classmates triggered me. 

When I turned 10 I moved to another country, I was already pretty stressed about it since I had to leave my back then “friends” and my grandparents whom I really loved. 
Since day one in my new school, I got bullied for being overweight and not speaking that language. 
I was a bubbly and dumb kid tho, so I took the insults without minding them at first and tried to befriend other kids. 

When I turned 12 I was most certain that the other kids were making fun of me, and therefore I started to become more and more closed.
I thought it was because my clothes weren’t as cool as theirs, or because I didn’t had a phone to fully socialize with them. 
So I asked my parents for better clothes and a phone. I started dressing differently, but for all I could do the response was always the same shitty insults at my face and my body. 
After a while, I did get a phone.
I was so happy I told every classmate and one of them even added me in the class group. 
I was really into it, I thought they changed their mind and actually liked me. 
So I started chatting in the group, until I received a text message from a person I didn’t know nor have save in my contact list, I don’t remember the correct words, but I’m pretty sure it was something along with; 
“Are you ###### the whale from class ## ?“ 
with a picture of my back walking to school. 

Useless to say, I cried reading that. 
Have I said something bad? Did I offend someone for them to say something like this to me? 

I didn’t say anything and just blocked the number, but new numbers came everyday with new insults and pictures of me. 

I was so afraid to go to school, to leave the house, even answering the house phone made me so paranoid. 
And whenever I did leave the house, I would hide my face with my hair or with my jacket. 
I would tell my parents to stop putting pictures of me around the house and slowly I would hide every mirror.

Everybody in school forgot what I sounded like for a whole year. 

Eventually, I started to self harm. 
But no cutting, I was afraid of blood, so everytime I would take a lighter at school and burn my skin in the school’s bathrooms. 
And from that point on I started having panic attacks and fainting at school, for then praying for my teacher not to call my parents because they would just think that I want attention no matter if bad or good. 
I tried to kill myself in different ways, with my mom’s pills, the kitchen knifes, I tried jumping from my window. 
I only tried to stab myself but my mom find out and it was a shit show. 

My parents allowed me to go to the school “psychologist” (it was just a lady that helped “troubled” students) and she was the only one I could talk to most of the time. 
She noticed how sad and tired I was, and often would throw around the word “clinical depression” and “social anxiety” along side with “agoraphobia” and all that shit i still identified to this day. 

When I started going to high school, things really started going for the better. 
I stopped self harming, I started trusting a friend of mine who then became my best friend.

Then, at the age of 15 i moved back to my home country, and there the new school system fucked me up and triggered my anxiety most of the time.

Since I also started to be on the class group after years. 

They were nice, and understood my struggles. 
But everytime I would enjoy my time in that group, I would turn off my phone and stare at it. 
Waiting for a text to insult me.
To drag me down.
To tear me apart and make me go back to my dark times. 

Today, I had a discussion with my classmates and I closed the phone crying and was afraid to open it again. 

I’m so sick of feeling like this.
My parents know I’m mentally unstable, but they won’t send me to a psychologist because they are expensive and just there to fill up people with drugs. 

But isn’t that what sad and empty people want? To forget the pain for a little? Wouldn’t that be nice for at least a minute? 

I just want to know a way to forget my pain. 

I used to draw but when I do now I hate what I do. 
Art, music, rain, silence. 
The things I used to love are making me realize how sad I am and how bad I’m getting to hide those feeling when everything around me is falling apart. 

I hate feeling constantly like this, what should I do to make it go awayV"
1661,How to get rid of your repressed anger?,"I've been having a tough time these past few months and years actually. I have built up a huge amount of anger, frustration and anxiety, it's killing me and I don't know how to let it all out and get rid of everything. 
I really want to be happy but at this point I just want to be fine. I can't even have a good night sleep without waking up in the middle of the night angry and crying and wanting to scream and smash things. am also not talking to anyone because am having trouble trusting people and I have this believe that they will hurt me at some point. I want to feel okay or feel nothing at all
but I don't know how to do that.
how can I?"

1663,"Can you have hypochondria for your close ones, not for yourself?","With these stressful times, I feel like I'm becoming hyper fixated on the health of my close ones that I live with - my grandma and my mum. Maybe it has to do with the fact that ever since I was a kid whenever I've been too willful/talkative during stressful times, they've always accused me of 'wanting to kill them by stressing them out even more'. 

So now that we're all stuck together during lockdown and we also have other stress factors, whenever I complain too much I get this numbing anxiety that me talking too much would make them have a heart attack or a stroke or something and I shud up.

This is especially bad at nighttime when we all go to sleep and I just feel stressed out if one of them will die in their sleep or something (we've all been through too much stress, not even counting this year's pandemic - new country, my mum lost her job, we were on the brink of becoming homeless, my grandma moved with us and left everything she knew at 83). And she's 83 even if she's in great health. I just worry about her. 

My cat will also have a neutering surgery next week at the age of 4 (she was on hormonal injections before that). Both me and my mum have a fear of surgeries because my granddad and my uncle died during a surgery and my mum almost died when she gave birth to me because they didn't give her the proper amount of anesthesia. So I'm extremely stressed out about my cat. 

I also just finished my studies and will be graduating this March and I'm just so stressed out about finding a job after my current internship ends and I had a major falling out with my childhood best friend, and another one of my best friends sorta did a disappearing act and I realised she didn't care so much about me. I also feel very frustrated with my love life and I think I might fancy one of my guy friends but he's so, so, SO different from everything I've ever found romantic but I just find his personality so... intoxicating and so refreshing. He's just so... lively. But a part of me still thinks I want someone I can idealise and romanticise. 

So my questions are: is hypochondria for other people possible and how do I stop feeling terrified all the time?"
1664,I feel like there is something wrong with me but idk what it is and i dont wanna self diagnose,"I feel like alot is going wrong in my life .EVen the good stuff i find it often doesnt make me happy  .For example we got wifi at our house today and my brothers were all excisted..but me not so much .I mean sure its good a thing but the past days ive been just feeling numb and like i have a huge ball of pain in my throat and chest like I am always about to cry its hard to find enough privacy to do tht since I live in an appartement with 4 brothers. I also feel like tht i have overemotional reactions to stuff . I feel like my brain is foggy all the time but when i didnt go to college for 6 mounths due to covid I started feeling more like my self .I even started reading for fun for the first time since i was a kid. alot is happening in my life atm:

* I am studying electronic engeering  (2nd year) atm but i am seriosly thinking more and more about switching to english studies .I mainly choose my current uni cause they teach in english not because of electronics or engeering I didnt even do much reaserch before choosing it I take all the responsibilty for that because i was foolish and followed wht my dad told about the uni that companies will come and take you abroad...Thats def not true it might have been like tht in the 80s but my current college has lost that position years ago and the degree is wothless now basicly.Ever since i got to college I havent been feeling like my self . I dont think I have what it takes to succed in my current uni without it having a negative impact on me mentally (I am talking about only minimal passing grades btw) . More details in my post history.Thankfully college is free were i live.
* I dont wanna live in my country especially since i have really religious old fashioned muslim parents and i dont share alot of values with them atm. my mother basicly went into rage mode and then cried because we were casually talking and I said that i might not marry a woman tht wears a veil and stuff.I might even marry a non muslim as I plan to live abroad but i didnt tell her that.
* The only good thing in my life atm is tht i met a partner tht lives close to me instead of an online partner for the first time .She actually studies english wish is right next to my engeering uni so if i switch id study there too basicly.( we havent met irl yet per say but she did see me passing through the other day.Just thinking at meeting her makes me smile even at these miserable times...
* My mother might disown me in the future if i dont meet her strict ideals as she talks about this all the time....I am not sure about my dad tho . This mean tht I wanna be indipendent asap wich is putting alot of pressure on me tbh but idk how to get enough money to leave unless I apply for a scholarship to study abroad then work there.I cant get that much high grades in EE wich is another reason I might try english.I feel like even I have a physical home I dont feel like I do have a home at least emotionally .
* I have realized this year how miserable my parents marriage is and with divorce being so taboo her especially for women as divorced women are often looked down upon in this society.
* I dont really have any dreams about normal jobs I wish i did tbh maybe i am just lazy idk.. I wanna do something creative that I actually enjoy in the future ...might writing music or films or acting maybe smth to do with nature instead idk.. 
* I feel sad sometimes for no apparent reason and I think maybe something is wrong with my brain...I also find it extremly hard to study for engeering exams and to focus maybe thats cause I find it boring to study about machines  and circuits and stuff it makes me feel down if i study and guilty if i dont ....or maybe something is wrong with my brain or maybe my mother is right and i am just lazy

My mother says that the reason I dont wanna do EE is because I am lazy and dont wanna work hard she was angy so maybe he didnt mean but maybe she did idk . I think I would have no prblm working hard if i studied smth i enjoy tbh and I have always loved english and got good grades in it without trying that hard.

 I just feel like I am gonna explode I started having some really negative and dark thoughts recently that I didnt have in a long time...I dont wanna ask my dad for therapy money because I dont wanna depend on him so much i feel guilty for just asking him money to buy new clothes hes an civil engneering but still hes not wealthy by any means.Idk what to do tbh. I feel like my world is crahing down but maybe thats necceary for change to happen but I just dont wanna hurt so much not due to absence of merit neccesarily ..."
1665,The last two and a half years of my life,"Hi guys. This is the first time i’ve really posted on reddit like....ever, But i needed a place to vent after everything thats been going on. I have a brother that over the course of the last two and a half years, has slowly fallen into discourse.

He started acting out, doing what he wanted, became quick to temper, and not listening to my parents a bit over two years ago. For reference im 23 and my brother is 17. At first i was angry. I watched him fight with my mother and step father, with nothing changing for the better part of two years. He kept doing these outrageous things that we just couldn’t get why he would do these things. As of recently though, things starting to make more sense. 

He recently felt unsafe in his own home and needed to leave, as in, go to a hospital kinda safe. It was so surreal because i never thought mental health would be related to any of this. That was about a week and a half ago. During that time he got an mri to look at his brain for any damage. We all thought this might be the case, as he had played a few good years of sports and gotten a few bad concussions. However, the results were negative. His brain was fine. After a few more tests, doctors ruled him with severe bipolar disorder.

Flash forward to today as he felt refreshed and was scheduled to come home, so he was discharged. I see him and he looks good. Hes talking to me and everything is going well. However, i cant shake this feeling that all of this thats been going on for so long, was solved in a weeks trip. A few hours into the day i come downstairs and see my mom getting ready to leave with my brother. He asks me for a hug and cries onto my shoulder. I wasn’t quite sure how to react besides trying to comfort him. Heres what really got to me though. He cries pretty hard onto my shoulder, wipes his eyes then almost immediately like *snap* he is like “okay mom wheres this stuff and that stuff” almost no sadness or anything. Just complete turn of emotion. I know i shouldn’t be shocked, as this is the definition of being bipolar, however i hadn’t really come across it as this quick in emotional change. 

It really...just got to me i don’t know. He left a few minutes ago and im glad he’s going back for more help. Not really sure why i went on this whole rant because it helps nobody. I suppose i just needed an ear. 

Have a good day everyone"
1666,Why shouldn't I kill myself?,"I want to kill myself and I don't see any reason why I shouldn't, my own family can't stand me they always say how obnoxious I am, that I'm beating the dead horse, that I'm such a bitch, my favorite aunt can't seem to stand my personality. I'm only friends with one person from my old friend group and I haven't talked to her in ages. I'm clearly hesitant because I'm posting here but I don't know why. My parents say they love me but when I try to talk to them they tell me to shut up and not talk while the TV is on. My own dog doesn't even seem to care about me or he cares about me less than the rest of my family. I'm just so done at this point and I don't know what to do."

I don't get bullied or anything like that, I just dislike them for no particular reason. Its not like I hate them for anything in particular they're just so fucking boring, listening to the same music wearing the same clothes acting the same as everyone else, I just can't bring myself to enjoy being around them, I have no school social life I have friends outside of school and friends online but not at school. I'm not going to be some wannabe wah wah I'm so depressed look at me mister fucking edge lord over here, I believe this is an issue. Not really sure what it is, I'm not shy though if someone speaks directly to me or asks me a question specifically I will speak and can speak just fine. And the fact people actually care about fitting in is strange to me. I also spend about 4 hours after I get home lying in bed role-playing a leukemia patient instead of doing something productive but I think that's normal, but I don't have a reason to be depressed so that can't be it. I'm kinda just confused.

1670,"Anxiety, career and youth. A depression cocktail","I'm a 25yo guy. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of my life. 
Had a rough summer. I just landed the promotion I was basically dreaming about and started dating this awesome girl (19yo). That halpened in a span of a week this past August. 
That girl made me realise that one is young once, and that I have spent the majority of my 20s sat infront of a computer every day Mon till Fri until midnight.
I really started thinking...am I really spending my youth serving a corporation instead of LIVING? 
Anyway, she didn't said anything, my job was never an issue, we still found time to hang out. Those were just my thoughts, observing her enjoying her youth like I never had the chance to. 
She broke up with me, because she was not ready and had so much going on in her life and we split on good terms. But that was the last drop that made my cup spill. I've spent the last 2 weeks drinking every night while still at work, thinking how my 20s are half  out the door, how I've sold my sould and my youth to the devil so that I can support myself and help out my parents. I've been thinking of quitting my new job 3 months in. And that really induces anxiety and I've been depressed ever since. Can't sleep well. Can't behave properly...it's a true mid life crisis while still 25. 
How can I cope with this?"
1671,My story,"This post is mostly me talking about my life and how I got to this point and also because I don't have a close person I can talk seriously with. (I also apologize if my english is bad)

A few years ago I had what I would call ""Trauma"" and I think it is the main reason I have voices in my head and even changed my entire personality.

I was in the last year of middle school and I was so relieved I could leave since my classmates were bullying me, but I was also scared because I didn't want to go to a different school from my best friend.

I had to decide my future, I had to decide what I wanted to be in the future, in my country after middle school you can choose between a lot of schools that specializes in specific jobs. At first I wasn't worried and I normally continued the school year.

Then everything came at the same time.

My relatives started stressing me really bad telling me I had to decide as fast as possible the school, and adding to that stress came the stress of the final exam that I was never worried about until then.
Then the worst thing that could've happened....
My best friend told me he has been faking being my friend for all those years, and I wasn't angry, but I was sad, the only thing I thought was to understand what I did wrong to led to that.
The worst thing about all this is that I didn't have someone to talk about this, I was always kind of isolated from my parents since they never insisted in finding out if my ""I'm fine."" actually meant that.

All the stress and delusion led to the only way to solve all that... suicide.

I couldn't stand all that stress and the only thing that was supporting me disappear so suddenly.

Sometimes I could get so many sudden suicidal thoughts that just seeing a knife I could see all the ways I could've killed myself, but when those thoughts disappeared, fear came. The fear of death caused my mind to do actual crazy stuff, from watching to youtube videos all night until I collapsed to not be left alone with my suicidal thoughts... To inventing an imaginary friend thay could support me in my best friend's place.
This choice was probably influced by the fact that nobody understood me or even wanted to understand me, and so I thought: ""The only person that knows me completely is myself, and so he must be the perfect person to comfort me.""

He was named after the main protagonist of the story I was hoping to write in the future, Shirou.

He was supposed to be a really smart person that knew a lot of things and that also cared about his friends even if he wanted to be alone.

And like that I passed that hellish situation, I passed the exam, I actually choose the school I wanted, but I couldn't really move on that friendship.

So I decided to move on... drastically.

I didn't decide it, but I unconsciously started erasing all my past from my memories, for a whole year the past was nothing to me, or even worse, it didn't exist.

And the worst thing is that I actually started unconsciously talking to my imaginary friend, even if he couldn't reply anymore since there was no need, and I actually thought of him as of part of my daily life. (I kept a diary as if i was writing to him)

And just a few weeks ago I started having daily identity crisis. 
The reason is because I started being aware of strange thoughts in my head, thoughts that told me what to do, and heavily influenced my own thoughts, I knew they weren't my thoughts, they didn't ""sound"" like mine, like when in a dream you know a person is that person only because your subconscious tells you.

I was (still am) really scared, as I started being aware of it I realized how much it affected me.
I really like taking Quotev quizzes, mostly personality quizzes, and there I noticed how IT affected my thoughts, like choosing my favourite colour.

""Obviously my favourite colour is purple."" (Me)

""No it's red."" 

Those thoughts/voices have 2 ways to talk to me: 1) With a fast thought. 2) With an mental image of what they're meaning to tell.

I started investigating this voice, keeping note of everything he tells me to do or to think, and the conclusion scared me more than every horror movie I had seen.



I am a really overthinking person, I consider myself smart, as I search everything that takes my curiosity, and I also know a lot of stuff from different topics. 

This voice is really kind of arrogant and they're kind of reckless, like taking fun from doing stupid stuff that would get me into trouble.

I also sometimes unintentionally do stupid stuff but most pf the times aren't as much dangerous as the things the voices tell me to do.


The scary thing is that the voice is the same way I used to be before al that hell, I was exactly like that (and now I kinda understand why my best friend faked) and, the imaginary friend is a lot like the me of now.

After reading a lot, and I mean a lot, about what could this be, I found out D.I.D.

And the thought of being just a fake person, a person created by my past self really scares me, scares me so much that I can't think of anything else almost all day.


Another fact, I started noticing the voice as soon as I started remembering the past or at least try...



If you've reached here, reading the useless story about me I really thank you from the bottom of my heart."
1672,I’m so freaking stressed; need advice,"Ok, so this is my first post. Sorry if I don’t do this correctly. Anyways.... I’m wondering if I’m pulling myself into too many directions. I know I’m really the only one that knows how to gauge that but I want to see if you guys/gals believe I am doing too much.

Here’s my regular schedule: * I have 5 college classes that I generally study 3-4 hour a week each.

Since what I want to do after college is software development/something techy I spend 1-2hours over the weekend learning extra things outside of my classes.

I am trying to learn Japanese because I really want a new and fresh perspective in life. Currently I’m studying Japanese for 1-2 hours on the weekend. Possibly planning to do it 1 hour every weekday. (Depending on how you guys react to my schedule)

I workout on every other weekday for about 1-2 hours

I really love drawing so I try to draw whenever I have time.

I have a dog that I have to care for. (I won’t stop that)

I clean religiously (I won’t stop that)

I try to read when I have time (I won’t stop that)

I really want to learn the piano

I don’t really have a social life but I might start trying to do things with people (after this whole COVID thing of course)

And I love video games (I might have to stop playing them so much)

*And then like every other human I have about a thousand appointments a month.

(I’m 19 about to turn 20. I do all of these things because I am constantly focused on bettering myself. I plan on constantly working all of my 20’s and I don’t really see a need for a girlfriend)

Also could you recommend what I should about this? Like what should I cut out and etc..."
1673,Tips on how to get out of my own head,"I am a 21(F) and I have suffered from anxiety and depression for what seems like most of my young life at this point. I have taken meds prescribed by my dr, I have read self help books and numerous online articles, I have briefly went to counseling, and NOTHING HELPS...at least not for long. I have days when I feel “normal,” where I am genuinely happy with everyone in my life and am confident in my abilities, and then within the same week I will be unable to stop worrying about literally everything in my life, usually about things that I have no business worrying about. An example of this is is that I will think that my bf is fooling around on me behind my back or just straight up not being honest with me. As you can imagine, this causes him to think that I do not trust him and so we have pointless arguments which result in me feeling dumb and annoying for even saying anything because he just questions why I even worry and reassures me that I don’t need to worry. I KNOW I DONT NEED TO WORRY BUT I CANNOT get myself to just stop. I would like to at least learn how to catch myself having negative, overpowering thoughts and be able to consistently remind myself they are just thoughts. I know my feelings  are just because of how I am thinking, but idk how to get myself to just take step back and realize my thoughts are just thoughts. I will chain smoke cigs  and cry when things get too seem like too much, so clearly I have no working coping tools rn. It is hard for me to get myself motivated to even help myself. I have started going back to school after taking like 2 yrs off to figure out what I actually wanna do with my life, and try to get help with my mental health. I always worry that I am not going to ever finish school, or that I’m not actually smart or determined enough to get the job and career I want. This everyday worrying and lack of confidence is eating me alive all the time and I deeply worry it is going to ruin my relationships, such as the one w my bf."
1674,I either want to abandon my current life and start over or die,"Growing up I've always been the punching bag. Metaphorically and physically. My brother has always made sure he was superior to me by spreading rumors about me and letting his friends bully me. Hes been a master manipulator for as far as I can remember. I suffer from anxiety, depression and BPD. My family sees what I go through and does nothing about it. In fact, my brother gets more praise than me. 

Within this past year, my life went from 0 to 100 pretty fucking quick. I had gone down from 200lbs to 150lbs. I worked hard for that. I then noticed a sudden increase in friends. Then I got a kick ass job and was making 4 digits a week. THEN I met a girl that I fell in love with. My first girlfriend. For the first time in my life I was truly happy...then everything went to complete shit. 

3 months in I found out my ""girlfriend"" was fucking around with other guys behind my back. That was probably the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, believe it or not. Then a week later my boss calls me and says something among the lines of ""listen, you're a decent kid, but we have to let you go"". 
Yes. He actually called me a ""decent"" kid. 

So after losing my job and my first gf, I said to myself, ""I still have super supportive friends. I'm still doing better than I was 6 months ago. Things are still ok."" 

I have a bad habit of jinxing myself. Today, October 21st, 2020, my last friend stopped replying to me. 

I try to talk to my father about how I feel and how I've contemplated suicide. My father had mental issues previously in his life, so it's pretty fucked up when he completely disregards what I say and then has the audacity to tell me that he doesnt believe in mental disorders and that I should stop ""faking it"".

Most people dream about becoming millionaires and celebrities. My dream is to abandon my current life, change my name and live a happier life amongst complete strangers. Or just say fuck it all and jump off one of the two bridges in my city."
1675,eating disorder?,"i tend to totally loose appetite when i’m going through one of those “depressive” episodes that usually go on for a couple of weeks and off again for about the same period of time. 

i know a lot of people struggle with food during tough times, but for me i feel like it’s more of a “call for help” or a “notice me”..

let me elaborate on this... since i live with my parents and find it quite difficult to open up to them about this whole situation, i try to find ways that will make them think “oh.. he’s having a hard time, perhaps we could ask/help him through it?” and i feel like leaving my plate and food untouched on the table will make them a little bit concerned

one of the most prevalent habit i adopt is restraining myself from eating, hoping that they’ll ask me about why i do that, thus giving me an opportunity to talk about mental health in general (?)

i just want to know if other people do that"
1676,Please read if you’re aged between 11-18,"Hi, I applied for a position as lead mental health ambassador at my school and I need your help. I understand that it’s tough going through mental health issues, it’s a invisible monster that haunts us all. So this is where you guys come in. I would like you to leave messages about how you would like schools to help you deal with whatever you’re dealing. If you would prefer you can always dm me. I wanna be able to create a system that can cover as many bases as possible and get rid of the fear that many students have about going to school for help. I will take all suggestions seriously, and hopefully be able to use them to help future generations :)

Thank you."
1677,I’m trying my best god dammit!,"So I recently started school again (delayed going back due to issues at home), and with the new COVID restrictions I’m feeling even more isolated and alone than usual. 

Firstly, I’m not in the same classes as my friends as I usually meet up with them at break but for some ghastly reason; classes are not allowed to mix with each other. Even worse, we have breaks at different times of the day. So there goes my social life as I find it really difficult to speak to people I’m not comfortable with (my classmates are the typical asshole jocks). I don’t know what to do as I don’t talk to them outside of school either as I like to have my home separate from school to help with my anxiety. I’m weird like that I guess. 

My school councillor just quit too so that sucks.

Not more to say I just feel alone and wanted to get it out. God I’m weird :("
1678,Advice to get over this demon on my head,"I am someone that trains in gym , sport evertday and looks after health and appearance
Only reason I’m posting this is bcos I’m 22 now an adult and I think this embarrassing issue is getting worse 
Iv been Told by so many all the compliments of shape I’m in and my appearance which I worked hard on for long time .
I can’t see it all I see is the negatives and when it comes to girls, when a girl I like is possibly interested in me I cannot pull it together all my insecurities show , 
Fuck every interaction from nerves , overthinking

1679,This is my first reddit post &amp; the first time I'm actually writing down all of my childhood trauma.,
1680,I feel empty,"Sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense and I know there might be more important problems here, but I really need to get this off my chest.  


I feel empty inside... June was a really happy month for me, I was getting good at my favorite game, I wrote my exams and did good on them, I finally met my friends after the lockdown. I graduated middle school. Everything seemed great, now I honestly don’t feel happy. My previous class doesn’t speak to each other, of course I met some people in high school who are awesome and have the same interests as me, but I honestly don’t feel the same anymore... I don’t know what happened, but everything just passed so fast, now because of COVID and online learning I feel robbed of my last months with that class, we (mostly) knew each other for 9 years at that time and despite all of the differences I honestly treated them like extended family. Now I know that there are more hard things coming up in my life, which is indeed just starting. When I was told that I’ll miss that school I always thought it was stupid, but now I finally realized how true that was..."
1681,cant trust myself,"   tw: suicide ideation? 

    i’m 18 and i will be moving out of my parents’ house in a few weeks. this might be the dream of some teenagers my age but for me it doesn’t sound like good news, i’m really scared of being alone, and i’m scared of myself. 

   i tend to adopt really self destructive habits when i’m going through depressive episodes, especially during their peak.. 
   what kept me on the “right path” throughout all these years is the fact that i had company that’s been watching over me, preventing from doing bad things to myself (alcohol? suicide? drugs? though i still gave all that a try in the past) 

   i’m scared of having my own place because what if i get really depressed? i will have no one to help me and i will be free to do anything my brain tells me to. i could become addicted to something and ruin my life or straight up end it. 

   i won’t lie though, i’m kind of into that, it’s like i’m finally given the chance to do it. it’s relieving and scary at the same time. relieving when i think about it while going through it, and scary when i’m kind of enjoying life."
1682,I feel so pathetic all the time,"Do you ever just feel so stupid and pathetic? I'm 20 years old. I go to college for emergency telecommunications so I can be certified to be a 911 dispatcher. I am not terrible at school but I notice how unconfident I am all the time when doing practise calls. I have so much anxiety around people its crippling. I don't know what to do anymore, I can't continue to live my life like this. After I have my in class labs I come home and cry. I work part time at a fast food joint and even there I constantly make mistakes and I feel as if though people hate me. I don't even know where I am going with this post. I feel as though if I can't do a simple fast food job what on earth makes me think I can become a 911 dispatcher? 

I have a history of childhood trauma and I know its messed with my brain so much. I feel so lonely because I have no outside support.I live on my own, pay my own bills and have been since I was 16. I got discharged from my community worker a few weeks ago. I was on a good track and now I feel lost. Every time I bring up my social anxiety issues people tell me to get over it but I feel as though these patterns are ingrained in my stupid head. I space out all the time, I feel like I don't pick up information quickly and overall just slow. My brain feels scrambled all the time. I try therapeutic techniques such as mindfulness and trying to recognize these thoughts but its hard. I've been dealing with this stuff for so long, I am just tired of being a human. Its made me realize how important child development is and having stable relationships with caregivers are. It really does pave the foundations of your future relationships with others. 

On top of all this I also have trouble forming and maintaining relationships with people. I just feel this stupid loneliness and that feels like a black hole. It doesn't help that I'm shy and have this anxiety in my gut constantly. I always get ridiculed for not talking to people at work but I just don't know how, as pathetic as that sounds. of course its good to have people call you out and tell you the way it is but sometimes I wish I could have more of an empathic ear when venting about my problems. All throughout my childhood I've been given the tough love attitude and now my feelings just feel neglected to the point where I learn to push it under the rug and ignore them. The only time I feel content is when I am camping in nature with no one around me. 

I don't want to die, I just really want the pain and uncertainty of life to just stop which that within itself is inevitable.  If I don't manage my issues now there is no way I would even get hired as a dispatcher because I know they do psychological testing and such. Does anyone relate?"
1683,(18M) i need help coping with something,"The other day, i made a post about how my girlfriend of one year broke up with me. (i’ll post below) I’m in an extreme amount of pain. I feel like i’m crippled from my head down. I don’t have any energy to do anything at all. I’m already dealing with the breakup, but one thing that concerns me and scares me the most is her having sex or any kind of sexual interaction with any other males. It hurts me inside more than anything in my life knowing that she can do this with other males. I’ve told her that if she did do anything, it would cause more pain to me than anything ever before. She knows how i feel and she’s told me that she’s not going to do anything. she needs time to heal and i just want her back. I can’t go on this long knowing she could be having sex with other men. I trust her more than anything and i honestly don’t think she would do this. but the thought of it kills me.

1685,"Isolated, lonely and depressed. Not a good recipe.","I've been stuck at Uni for a month now, I'm doing very well academically but mentally I'm really suffering.

If you asked me 12 months ago I would have told you that this mental health stuff was bollocks but my god. The only people that I see are my roommates, and they all hate me, like banging on my door for a laugh at 1am hate me, and recording videos of me and sending them to each other hate me.

1000 students, including myself have CoViD at my accommodation and as a result I haven't been able to leave my room or see anyone aside from my roommates.

Worst of all is that I haven't been able to make any real friends, theres no shortage of cool people, and a lot of them are friendly, but I can't empathize with them on any higher level.

I'm writing this post to gather my thoughts into something more coherent than the very mixed emotions that I have right now. But even this isn't helping much.

I'm not suicidal, but my god, if this past month has shown me anything it's how quickly your mental health can take fall off the cliff."
1686,I hate myself,"Hello everyone,

I'm going to try and keep things as clear and concise as possible- My parents got divorced when I was 4, I'm 32 now. I grew up in an abusive relationship with my father. He was physically and verbally abusive. This lasted until I was 15.  I'm 1 of 3, my twin brother and my 2 year younger sister. Even with there being 3 of us, I was the target of the worst of everything, and just the majority of it. He was also very abusive to my mom, which I have some very vivid memories of. 

At 3 years old I became very aware of what was going on around me, and developed an extreme amount of empathy for everyone that was involved in all of this. For the next 12 years I was basically in a permanent protective mode for everyone except myself. He had visitation with us every other weekend where the 3 of us would stay over at his house. There were times when my brother or sister would break something, or would accidentally do something they weren't supposed to and I would step in and take the blame. I didn't do it every time, but I knew the reaction that was coming from him. Because I knew what was coming and had been going through it I did what I could to protect them, because there was no one around to do so. When we were around my mom I would take on a similar protector role. To her, I would randomly tell her I love her and give her a hug. But it wasn't random for me. I knew those actions were guaranteed to make her happy. I did many other things like that as well. She'd go outside in the middle of the night and stare at the stars-I always heard the front door open and I'd stay outside with her. This of course is only a very small snapshot over a 12 year period.

Because I took on that role so early, and did it for so long (and in some ways still do it) it's taken its toll.  I hate it when people do nice things for me. I hate my birthday because it's a day centered around me. I hate/feel guilty spending money on myself for things that I don't need. If it's not the basic necessities I feel guilty. 50"" TV? Feel guilty. Nice shoes? Feel guilty. Video games? Feel guilty. New phone? Feel guilty. Now add my wife into the mix-50"" TV for her? Let's go. Nice shoes for her? Where's my debit card? Same thing goes for my friends. 

I hate myself for enjoying the things that I do. I started teaching myself to DJ a couple years ago, I enjoy it yes, but I hate myself for enjoying it because of all the time, money, and energy that's been wasted on it. I feel stupid and embarrassed when I watch tutorials on YouTube about it (which are being watched using my $2000 PC which I feel like shit about for buying). I streamed my first DJ set about 2 weeks ago and while I had fun, I felt guilty and stupid the entire time. I did it at a friends house, so I interrupted their schedule, used their electricity, etc. and subsequently feel guilty about. 

All of my hobbies and things that I enjoy have always cost a stupid amount of money. My mom bought me a piano when I was 8. My dad bought me a Saxophone a couple years later, and a French Horn a few years after that. I enjoyed all of it, but I hate myself for enjoying it because of how much money it cost. 

I told my wife about some of these feelings earlier today, which I didn't want to do but I felt she should know. She then got upset because of how I feel about all of this. So now I feel stupid for telling her any of this because she started crying during her lunch break. 

I was also diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder many years ago, so I feel guilty when I have a mood swing because someone worries about me. I even see a therapist, but hate myself about it because of the money it costs. 

I'm even hating myself for writing all of this because at least 1 person is going to read it, and they'll never get the time back that they spent reading about me whining. 

So, I don't know what to do..."
1687,Instead of feeling sad I just go numb,"I went through like a 5 month period where there was very little joy in my life and now whenever something happens that upsets me I just feel disconnected from my life and I don’t really care about much and my emotions are nearly nonexistent when I get really sad, I dont even cry anymore I just feel no emotion and do not care when im sad, does this happen to anyone else?"
1688,Never going out again,"Today was the first time in 2 years that I went to the mall, I have social anxiety and agoraphobia, but I decided to go as a test to see if I was getting better. I was going to pay something, and one of on the two girls in front of me said to the other ""turn around, look at that fat girl""  then they both start laughing. I have a really big problem with my weight. That really hurt me. I won't go out never again.. or at least in a long time. I been crying all day. I feel horrible.

(Btw, sorry for my english )"
1689,I’m lost,"I’ve never done this before but I feel as if I have no one to vent to. I’m turning 24 week and I feel like my life is crap. I live in my mom’s garage, and I have no job. Every job I try to get never lasts. I live through a huge depression thinking I’m never good enough for anything so I guess that’s why. When high school ended, I got burnt out with everybody thinking I was supposed to do it all and with such high standards they gave me I completely shut down. I never been the same since then. I feel as if all my friends noticed because I only talk to like 2 now. I never have any interactions with females or none of that. Honestly I just feel super lonely and like I’m not myself. Sometimes I even look at my family with confusion as to how we are even related. They are awesome but we are completely different. It was hard for me to talk to people before but corona made it worse. I haven’t left my room in weeks(maybe months I lost count) unless it’s for some weed so that I can not think about myself. When I look in the mirror I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I went from being a happy and nice person to just someone waiting for their death date. Like I said not looking for answers or anything bc I don’t see any solutions, just needed to vent"
1690,everything is getting really heavy,"tw// sexual assault, eating disorder

i’m a 17 year old girl, if it matters at all. my earliest memory of any of this is my uncle (age 12) exposing me (age 6) to porn in my own childhood bedroom. we lived together, he took me in there and closed all the windows, locked the door, and made me watch a video. this is the way he introduced me to everything that would happen. i don’t remember the first time he actually touched me as it probably happened for over a year. he would let me use his video games as compensation. i feel as though i was desensitized to it, i don’t think i even saw him as danger, it was routine. not sure what the turning point was but i do remember one day i was alone in the kitchen, he came in and slipped his hand down my pants, and i told him no so he stopped, i’m guessing out of fear i would tell someone if he continued. i don’t think there was another incident after that one. for years after, i continued to interact with him like i did with all the other kids in the house, i guess i kind of forgot it ever even happened. this probably was the case until i was 13, everything started coming back to me and i was immediately disgusted with his existence (still am). i completely withdrew from having any type of relationship with him. i still live with him, and even looking at him makes me so angry and disgusted. i’ve never told anyone about what happened ever, and i wonder if he even remembers, i’m still scared to wear shorts in my own house. 

the other part of this story begins in 5th grade. i was bullied pretty heavily for my weight because i was a chubby kid. i remember specifically a group of boys who couldn’t walk past me without making a comment. to add insult to injury, one of my uncles (not the one from before) would also pick on me for the same thing. i couldn’t get away from it, i developed really low self image, and i found tumblr. if you were ever on eating disorder tumblr you can only imagine what that could’ve done to my 10 year old brain. it was about 5th-6th grade when i was starving myself and exercising religiously, and i managed to keep it from anyone as i had divorced parents and they both worked very often. i also was very anxious, i was very intrigued with the idea of death and often questioned my existence, i remember believing there was genuinely no reason for me to be alive, and i was staying my alive strictly for my parents’ happiness. the mental strain also made it harder for me to eat, i was constantly nauseous or had no appetite. by 6th-7th grade i was very thin, probably the thinnest i had ever been. i remember getting compliments for the way i looked from my loved ones which i’ve always found funny because that was probably my lowest point ever. i began cutting in 7th grade, and my last relapse was only a few months ago, but i can go months at a time without it now. my urges have been really strong lately but i haven’t done it. 

so currently i find myself struggling day to day. looking for a new job because my mom wants me to but i have no idea where i’m going to college or what i want to do with my life. i have a few friends but none of them very good, i mostly keep to myself. i smoke weed often ish, not sure if it helps me cope or is making me worse. i really hate the way i look, i want to love myself it’s just so hard, my body image is definitely not it’s best right now. i feel like mentally i can’t handle things that someone my age should be able to handle.

i don’t want it to sound as if i want pity or sympathy. i’m trying to heal, i’m trying to be happy. these are things i never got an opportunity to work past and i don’t know how to do it myself. i have a good relationship with my mom but she doesn’t know i’ve ever gone through anything ever. even the thought of opening up to her with all of this is nauseating. i just feel like i’m getting bad again, i feel like i’m going to start self destructing again. i was doing so good i was so happy and suddenly everything is eating me alive. i don’t know where to go for help, i needed to put it out somewhere, so if you listened to me, thank you so much."
1691,everything has come together and made me fucking angry and empty inside. i don’t want to live.,"this isn’t a sad soppy suicidal bullshit story like i’m probably used to writing but never posting. i don’t want to kill myself, i don’t necessarily want to die either, i am just truly fucking fed up of being alive. fucking tired. all the time. nothing is good anymore. i have nothing going for me and i’m going nowhere. i hate people. the only thing stopping me from cutting my entire body up and throwing myself into the sea is the 10% of me knowing that my family would probably be sad. yknow, raising someone for 18 years for them to just be gone the next day is wasteful. but i don’t see this shit getting better for me. i’ve tried to get help, it doesn’t work. i bottle everything up until there’s a ball of fire inside of me and i have no way to get it out. i’m fucking up my future bc my brain won’t allow me to just be happy and do my school work and get a job and smile and lose weight just everything is working against me all the time i can’t do fucking anything there is no fucking point even trying anymore"
1692,Why can’t I cry?,When I have really hard stressful and anxiety filled days all I want to do is cry but I can’t. I have all these emotions that I need to let out and nothing. I get super frustrated and it drives me deeper into my depression and makes me feel super empty. I can only cry when I’m laughing or a sentimental moment in another persons life. I can’t cry when it comes to my own feelings. Anyone have any strategies that I could use to have a stress relief? Thanks
1693,Stay stong,"First time posting to reddit, my message is stay strong.  I signed my divorce papers today and I thought it would be one of the best feelings in the world.  Instead I obsessed over it and ruined my relationship of 2 years with the most amazing woman I had met my girlfriend that just had to leave.

I knew of her mental health issues but was jaded by my looming divorce.  I wasn't there when she needed me but devoted everything she to my kids and our relationship.  

I just wanted to say at 36 I'm realizing how important this sub is.  I'm going to help her the best I can hope a miracle happens and she will have me back.

Stay strong everyone in this time where mental health has never been more important.  My hope with this post is that it will encourage others to tell their stories.  Try to find what makes them healthy again.

Thank you and stay strong."
1694,Small world.,"Currently stuck in my home town for so long, And one more year till i move out again... 
I’ve been so tired of people around me, I’ve been going to therapy and shit but never really helped. The best way for me is to cut them off and surround myself with right people. I’ve been trying and build myself again from zero, and it was going well till I started going out more and see some faces again. Just feel like I’m back to zero again and getting more tired of this fucking town. What i hate much more is that i see myself trying to go back to the past often. How much more do i need to regret. How much longer do i need to wait. This world feels so fucking small and I don’t feel free and comfortable. I need better mind control and self care. Anyone who felt or feeling this way tell me your story. How can we get out of this feeling ?"
1695,"Re-emergence of depression, need advice","  

Okay guys, gonna be a long one, so please bare with me.

First of all, I guess I have to tell you how the first episode went. Back in school I was a quiet, try-harding kid, but a very lonely one as well - in Russia it's possible to study with the same ppl from elementary to high school for 11 years straight - which I did, except all my friends, which were not many to begin with, left in 9th grade. So, 2 years of being an outcast (maybe this word is too strong) took a toll on me. But whatever, I passed the exams and enrolled in university - my grades allowed me to do this for free. There I tried to make up for everything I couldn't do at school - meaning getting friends/gf while showing some good old academic performance, but, needless to say, I failed miserably in everything. That's where I snaped, dropped from the uni before the first semester has finished, and pretty much spent 2.5 years in bed, dreaming of having enough courage to end this miserable exitance. This eventually got old, so I started reading on the subject of depression and experimenting. With the help of some positive thinking and good old Bob Ross, I managed to stabilize, enrolled in the university again - now for a fee, and life's been good ever since - had an easy time talking to ppl, made some close acquaintances, been at the top of probably the entire grade with just one B in 2 academic years. Until Covid struck, that is. I lost my job and it's been almost 8 months since I've last seen my classmates. I was pretty much forced into the secluded state I was so desperately trying to avoid. And now I am starting to feel the same way I did \~5 years ago. I can’t get out of bed, my day is lying for 12 hours straight staring at my laptop an then going to sleep, I used to go to sleep at 11 pm strict, now I’m back to all-nighters, and today was the first time I didn’t do my univ. assignment – not because I couldn’t do it or had any trouble doing it, but because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. That’s also the reason I’ve decided to look for help.  
 So, where do I go from here? I am longing for social interactions, but irl stuff like gyms and bars etc. are out of the question and all the people I could potentially hang out with live like 60-70 km away from me, so I’d have to take public transport. I am not afraid of Covid itself, but getting Corona in Russia terrifies me. Internet doesn’t really do it for me as well, not the video games at the very least.  
 I am simply not allowed to fall into this pit again. My parents, who supported me through the first episode, didn’t really understand what was happening, neither did I tell them, and “their star boy” dropping out of the uni and going full shut-in mod for 2.5 years had been rly devastating for them.  I understand that the whole depression thing is just chemicals acting weird in my brain, but this doesn’t help, neither does Mr. Ross anymore.   
 So, to summaries, I am looking for pretty much any way to cope with or maybe even overthrow this scourge, any advice will be appreciated.  
 P.s. Going to psychologist isn’t really an option for me, the only time I’ve been to one, the doctor pretty much exposed the entire profession as “you bring me money, I make you feel good about yourself”, which felt rather gross at the time. Don’t think I’ll be able to trust these ppl again for some time.  
 P.p.s. Wow, now that I am looking at this summary, I can’t help but wonder what was all that bitching for… Sorry guys."
1696,Coming clean with my psychiatrist.,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit or not but here it goes.(if there is a better one please guide me that way). 

Ive been seeing a psychiatrist for a year and half an i have been prescribed .5mg clonazapem an 40mg prozac for the longest time. It wasnt doing enough for my anxiety/chronic pain so i took the ""wrong route"" an have been taking an additional 1mg xanax on top of my .5mg clonazapem.  I want to attempt to get off of it all together because i know its not a long term solution,  but i need her help tapering down from the 1.5mg. How would most psychiatrists react to this? Would they be willing to help me? I want off but i dont want to my make my situation worse by telling her that i was taking more than she prescribed. I felt withdrawals today because im running low an it scared me into coming to this conclusion."
1697,Maintaining friendships while deeply struggling with mental health,"Hi! 

Is there anyone who struggles with similar experiences regarding maintaining friendships and struggling with mental health? 

Overall, half my friendships have been crappy in the sense that the friend lies, uses me, selfish, stabs me in the back kinda thing. There’s usually a defining moment where you stop being friends because they did something terrible to you...

But then the other half I’ve had good friendships in which they try to support me, want to hang out, give advice, standard friendship things. Nothing overly much but not anything below. They’re good people and if things had worked out it could’ve turned into lifetime friendships. And the reasons why these good friendships don’t work out is because of me. I’m a good friend and can be a good friend; it’s the part of maintaining it long term that is extremely difficult for me because I struggle so much with anxiety and depression.  I shut down and will go MIA. It could be months, it could be years. And just sort of disappear and don’t say anything at all to anyone. Those friends have cut me off and I have no ill will to anyone who has because essentially that what I do isn’t what a good friend does. I wish them the best hope they continue to succeed, I just cannot open up and tell them what I’m going through. 

I’m in therapy now. And very very very very slowly trying to address all my struggles."
1698,"M(18) Ive been pushing people away, Family, Friends, Because ive hit a rough spot in my life, is it my fault?","They have been pushing me, and pushing me, while i was in highschool i was working a full time job cause of my mother and her stupid reputation, and with my Father, if i dont get B+ or better be seems like he always hates me, My Grandma she always wants me to do shit with her, and when i cant she yells at me, and its all too much, almost everyone in my life hates me or wants something from me, everyone has tried to fuck me over countless times, and it became too much, i tried to killmyself and all the sudden i'm the bad guy, it seems like the only person who i can actually trust is my sister and my friends and now, anytime i'm in the same room with my family or grandma, it feels like i cant breath and i feel like i'm gonna try to kill myself again"
1699,What to expect from my first appointment with a psychiatrist,"I've never had access to psychiatric care before, and through my university student health resources now I do. I'm really jazzed about the idea of getting help, but that's turning into a fear that it won't be productive or go well.

Basically, what happens at the first appointment? What kind of questions will I be asked? Should I collect any information before the appointment? Is there anything I shouldn't tell her? Is she going to give me a diagnosis or a prescription right then or will we have to have more appointments to do that?

Thank you!"
1700,I’m admitting myself to inpatient soon,"I haven’t truly *admitted* i needed help in a long time, but recently I came to terms with the fact that I was manipulated for months, and later sexually assaulted in June. After a breakdown (or many) and a talk with my therapist and psychiatrist, I’ve decided I need time away. 

I can’t sleep well, or repress that trauma, and I had to tell my boyfriend about it which took a toll on my mental state. 

I’ve never even been in a partial inpatient program and I’m scared of staying away from home since it’s just me and my mom. I’m not sure quite why because I really need some help and I need someone to help me understand what happened to me as I’m in constant denial and having flashbacks.

I just need some support, and advice maybe from someone who’s gone to inpatient. I just need to feel like it’s not as scary as I’m making it."
1701,Early Warning Signs,"Hi everyone. How are you? 

Unfortunately, many people are suffering with Mental Health. But, when did they see the early signs of it? Mental illness rarely happens “out of the blue”, it builds itself up. Learning about the development of symptoms can help greatly in the long-run. It will give you a clear vision of the early warning signs. By doing so, you’ll be able to take action, rather than not knowing about it. When you notice the warning signs sooner, you can take an early intervention and by doing so, help reduce the severity of the illness. Down below, I will name the different signs and symptoms that will occur where experiencing a Mental Health illness... 

- Mood swings/changes
- A change in sleep schedule 
- Loss of interest in the things you love 
- Failing in school/quitting your local sports team 
- Having problems thinking
- Sensitivity increased  
- Feeling on the edge or nervous 
- Feeling disconnected 
- No desire to participate in any activities
- Odd, unusual behaviour 

If you’re experiencing more and 2/3 of these symptoms, speak out about it. The sooner you speak up about it, the sooner you’ll be able to see a Mental Health profession or a physician. 

Thanks for taking your time to read!"
1702,Panic Disorder? I am lost,"I sometimes get a memory that seems like it is a dream but it makes me panic. I feel like fainting, I start shaking, and become nauseous. I also begin to breath deeply. This dream/memory thing changes slightly every time I have it, and it comes out of nowhere. The setting and people change and this panic feeling comes and goes. The actual memory/dream panic lasts only 30ish seconds and is not scary at all. What is happening to my mind? Is it a panic disorder? I am so confused."
1703,Curious question about my past depression,"Just a warning I used to cut and I’ll talk about that a little bit and I don’t want to trigger anything for anyone!

So today a random thought/question popped into my head. Is it normal not to feel pain when you’re really depressed? I tried googling it but I was only finding stuff saying that depression causes pain. So now I’m really curious if it’s a common thing not to feel pain or if I was just extra fucked up. 

Here’s a little bit of my back story. About two years ago I had an extra bad season of anxiety followed up with depression. It lasted longer than any other time I felt like that. Eventually it just made me feel numb. Like I was so deep in the depression I couldn’t really feel much emotions wise. So in order to feel something I started to cut my leg. On some nights when it was really bad I wouldn’t even feel the cuts, or it wouldn’t hurt like at all. I did cut for a while but I don’t think not feeling it is due to scaring, because on those nights I’d cut extra deep to try to feel something and I still wouldn’t be able to feel it. 

I’m all good now though. I’ve found ways to keep my anxiety and depression in check. I was just wondering if other people had similar situations, so I decided to ask Reddit."
1704,How do you know meds are working?,"How do you know if your antidepressants are working? I tried prozac, which just kept me up all night, and I've been on zoloft for about 6 months. But I talked to some friends recently, and they said that if I wasn't sure it was doing anything, it probably wasn't. So if someone could offer some advice on how I could know if the next thing I try is working that would be great."
1705,Had my worst panic attack ever,"Hi again I just want to say some bull that happened. So if you've seen my other post here you know I have PAs. I usually have them at home I've only ever had 1 other in public. So I'm in my fifth period yesterday and I all of a sudden her ""this is a lockdown"" and the sound of the alarm. My body goes into shock to protect and usually this starts a PA for me. So we go through it and find out it was a surprise drill the sheriff department set up. One of my friends in that class had an Anxiety attack. He knows how to deal with while I'm fairly new to having PAs. My other friend notices I'm not being fully myself (I'm a big joker) bc he's making jokes and I'm not laughing. I feel the numbness of shock wearing off and my eyes start to tear up. I start a breathing exercise told me to do. I ask my teacher for a tissue and my body kicks into panic attack mode I'm shaking, crying etc. My teacher (He also get Panic attacks) comes up to me and asks what's wrong. I tell him bc I somehow could and he says it's okay and asks me do I know what triggered. I'm so distressed I can't really speak so he asks if it was the drill. I nod and I start to curl up into a ball to feel safe. Since at this point half the class is shaken he gave us sometime to wind down. I was able to calm myself down but I was shaking for the rest of the day. I usually have my dog to calm me but this one was really bad. So I just wanted to share that.

Thanks for listening"
1706,I don’t know what’s going on with me,"I’ve always been a pretty sad person. I’m not sure why, but lately it’s been getting worse. It’s so confusing because some days I feel insanely happy like I could take on the world and be whatever I wanna be, and then the next thing I know I don’t even wanna get out of bed, and life seems pointless. The smallest things will drag me down into an immense sadness. I feel like I have no more motivation, but I’m really trying. And for some reason I’ve been thinking about death daily. Sometimes I get scared and sometimes it sounds so peaceful. I tried to ask my parents for advice but they’re old school Hispanics. My mom tried telling me that she would make me a cup of some kind of tea and I’d feel happy again. I don’t know where to go. I’m scared to go to a doctor because of the expenses, and how do I even go about getting help? I really don’t know what I’m even saying but I’m sorry if I’m not supposed to post this here, I just don’t know where to go."

1715,Worst hospital stay ever,"I just want to vent. I've been home for a week and I'm still so angry at the ""care"" I received. I don't know if I'm being silly or overreacting, but this was the worst hospital stay I've ever experienced. I traveled several hours to what I was told was an excellent facility and was admitted for 7 days inpatient.



Where do I even start. **TL;DR I stayed in a behavioral health unit for 7 days and it was a wild nightmare from meds, to food, to treatment and ""care"", to discharge and I have a LOT to say about it.** Feel free to read this novel, or don't. I just want to get it out.



This is not my first rodeo. I brought with me a few pieces of clothing, a complete list of medications and providers and phone numbers, and left everything of value at home besides my ID and insurance card and my birth control. Intake at the crisis clinic went smoothly. The people I talked to were kind and helpful. It was only once was I was inside the unit that everything went to shit.




I was admitted in the late afternoon and arrived in time for dinner. Note: my doctor has asked me to cut all gluten from my diet while we await more testing to see if I have Celiac or not. I made sure this was noted, and to their credit the nurse would usually tell the server I had the gluten restriction at mealtimes. Because of covid, the cafeteria is closed and they bring a food cart around to each unit and serve meals from the cart. I discovered there were no alternative foods for people with restrictions. I assumed because it was my first day that they weren't expecting a gluten restricted patient and things would get straightened out later. Nope. If you had food allergies or dietary restrictions, you were simply given less food. Poor guy on the unit had many restrictions (chrons disease I think), and I often saw him given nothing but a banana or a bag of chips as a meal. Server knew nothing about gluten or other allergens. I was served foods I knew to contain gluten on several occasions (gravy, croutons, popcorn chicken etc), and often had to argue with the server over what I could or could not eat. (I would say ""no thank you I can't have gluten"" and she would say ""there's no gluten. If you don't want it just say that"" for example when I she put popcorn chicken on my salad and then picked it off when I protested.) Don't get me started on cross contamination either.




And then there were medication issues. I guess it was my mistake that I only brought one copy of my comprehensive medication list and gave it to the first person who requested it during intake. I did recite the list to everyone who asked subsequently though. Night meds come around on my first night and I'm handed a cup with three identical pills in it. I was expecting 1-2 pills for three different medications, so I questioned it. The nurse explains she has handed me 3x 3mg melatonin pills. Okay, I usually take 1-2x 10mg melatonin at home but I know that's a lot and they probably gave me what they could. So where are my other two prescriptions? Not in the system. She can call the doctor and ask about it. Later I'm called back to the med window and she gives me the night stomach med I was expecting, but not my nightly dose of Anafranil. Says it's ordered for the next morning (even though I tried to make it clear the difference between my day and night and ""as needed"" meds during intake). Whatever, I go to bed.



I wake up in the night with a terrible headache. I go to the nurse and request ibuprofen. Doctor has no orders for any pain meds (ibuprofen was in my list as an ""as needed"" med) so she calls to request it and send me back to my room to wait. As I'm walking back, I get nauseous. Collapse in my bathroom and puke and puke and puke. There's nothing in my stomach, just bile and then dry heaving. They call the medical doctor and eventually I'm given ginger ale and zofran. By the way, none of my belongings have been given to me yet. I was told I can't have what I brought with me by the evening staff. While vomiting, I had peed myself so I requested a change of clothes. Night staff was confused because I ""should have"" been given my belongings on arrival (all were deemed safe). Whatever at least I got my stuff.




Next morning I'm told I must not leave my room for at least 24hrs because of the vomiting and risk to other patients. Understandable. I am offered breakfast and refuse because I'm still not feeling well. An hour and a half after breakfast I am brought my morning medications. At least this time the pills are in labeled packages and not just random tablets in a cup. And they're wrong. The anafranil I needed last night is there and I refuse it because it's a night med for a reason. A similar but different morning stomach med is there and I take it because I need to keep my stomach in check even if it not my usual med. I also inform the nurse that this stomach med must be taken 30 mins prior to the first meal of the day and ask if I can be given my meds before breakfast next time. Told to discuss it with my doctor, which I do and a note is made in my chart (the next day they ""forgot"" and tried to give me food before meds again, but got it right after that). The rest of my meds are correct for that day.




I spend the rest of my day in my room. I assume I'm missing the groups (more on that later) and will catch up when I'm out of quarantine. By the way, all drinking water must be requested from the staff and they go into a locked room and bring you back a 6oz paper cup of water. You're expected to ask every time you need water (yeah because that's easy for people with severe anxiety). It took me a couple days to work up the courage to ask for it so I only had the juice that came with meals. Anyway, after dinner is served no one comes to take my tray away like they did for lunch. I start getting nervous because I'm in crisis and trying so hard to avoid self harm but now I'm alone in a room with a (plastic) knife. After two hours I gather up the courage to leave my room and request my tray be taken away because I didn't feel safe. The nurse tells me to return to my room and that the cleaning staff will be by sometime in the next two hours to remove it. I go back to my room and have an anxiety attack. Every 15 mins someone walks around and checks to make sure you're still alive the whole time I've been here. Next round, she sees me clutching a wash cloth and says ""don't you dare be tearing up the towels"" (I had no tissues and was holding the cloth to dry my eyes and nose). Eventually the tray is taken away later that night.




The next day I am allowed out of my room. That's when I discover the schedule I was given is a load of shit. On paper, it's a neatly structured day every day of the week, packed with groups and activities. My first ""normal"" day in the unit was not a single group or activity. Not the next day after that either. Most people stayed in their rooms, and those that didn't sat quietly in the common area while music blasted overhead. As I warmed up to the other patients and the unit, I found there were a few ripped up magazines, one incomplete puzzle, a box of crayons, and most of a deck of uno cards for the patients to entertain ourselves with. That's it. Supposedly there were some other art materials locked up that could be requested. There was a locked room with a TV in it that we were allowed to watch occasionally. I basically stared into the void for 7 days. On the rare chance there was a ""group"" it was a joke. I was expecting some form of group therapy at least, but over my entire stay I was given a couple worksheets and no discussions were held. Did I accidentally go to prison instead of behavioral health? 



I could also complain about the staff. Most seemed like they hated their job or would rather be doing anything else. Questions and requests were met with annoyance, even though you had to ask for everything. Some were downright mean. Another patient there seemed to be really struggling with whatever brought him to the hospital and also maybe some form of cognitive disability. The staff were so mean to him. Other patients would ask for things he needed because otherwise he would never get them. They would yell at him or ignore him. One girl I think had some kind of eating disorder (patients didn't talk to each other much) and would often be yelled at for not eating her food. Personally, I felt like I received zero care.



Eventually, I ask them to just discharge me and voice my complaints. I am told I have to stay until I finish tapering off one of my meds (a couple more days). Understandable. I sit through a couple more days of shitty meals and staring into space. Then comes discharge planning. I give them the names and phone numbers of my therapist and psychiatrist and inquire about their outpatient therapy program. I still want help, and I heard they're doing it all through zoom at the moment. I'm never given any information about the program despite asking repeatedly. 30 mins before I leave, a nurse goes over my aftercare with me. Gives me a paper with a list of appointments they made on my behalf with my therapist, psychiatrist, and the outpatient program they told me nothing about. I'm told to call each provider to confirm these appointments and later when I call I find my providers have no idea what I am talking about. They had no idea I was in the hospital and didn't know anything about these supposed appointments. Thankfully, my therapist held my weekly spot for me even though my partner canceled my appointments while I was in the hospital (reception canceled the appt but didn't tell the therapist why even though it was explained to them). I did actually get into the outpatient program, but I'm not even gonna talk about that shit show right now.




Start to finish the whole experience was such a clusterfuck. I just needed to get it out to someone."
1716,I want to die but I'm scared of doing it,"Hello users of Reddit

I want to die, but I'm scared to, is this normal, is this odd, am I just a coward? Idk"
1717,My experience with antidepressant pills in high school,"When I was in high school, I met with a psychologist who told me that as a young man, I should be happier than I was. He prescribed me antidepressant pills. My mood lifted, but I was less creative and uncomfortable with the idea that people who knew me didn’t know the “real me.” I stopped taking the pills and ultimately crashed hard. Reflecting on the experience years later, I wrote this song. [Blue](https://youtu.be/MjSG9su6kBg)"
1718,"I have a significant if not complete lack of empathy, I usually tell people the things they want to hear only out of pity or to get them off my back.","I've started noticing this about myself and realized it's not normal.

Most of the time I find it hard if not impossible to feel empathy for other people, I never hang out or talk to my family because I enjoy it, but because I want them to think that I care, so if I go visit say my grandma, she will be satisfied for the next few weeks and I won't have to worry about her, but I never do it because I want to, I only do it to maintain a seemingly neutral/positive relationship because being in the negative is more stressful and takes more effort.

I very rarely do things for people out of the kindness of my heart, most of the time I manipulate the conversation to make them believe im friendly and in good terms with them, while deep down I know I'm doing it because hopefully they will ""pay"" me back in any shape or form.

If I can't profit from the person, I instantly lose interest in them.

This happens a lot with women especially; whenever I begin a friendship with a woman I'm attracted to, I only remain interested in them so long as I'm able to get something out of them; the second the sexual/romantic relationship is no longer a possibility, I immediately lose all interest in the woman and erase them from my memory, regardless of how strong our bond is/was.

This extends to therapy too:
I often find myself manipulating my words in such a way that my therapist(s) will see me in a positive light, there are things I purposely keep hidden because I fear them judging me and trying to criticize my thoughts/actions. I will frequently express my thoughts and feelings just enough for them to feel bad for me but not enough for them to be disgusted/horrified or possibly call the authorities on me.

I've often thought about hurting innocent people, it's quite soothing to me infact, when the demons and the pain are too unbearable I often imagine myself in a situation where I'm brutalizing someone who hurt me in the past or taking the lives of others.

I have many opinions about different groups of people that I can't share because they would likely get me banned from Reddit or any other social media, but let's just say that I have negative feelings towards certain people and if I didn't have any self control I would probably be around the internet wishing death upon them.

Please know that I have no intention to act upon any of these fantasies; these are purely thoughts that happen in my head and that will remain in my head.

Same with friends and family, I often times manipulate the conversation so that the other person feels pity or contempt for me, or just to get compliments and feel good about myself, not in an obvious way though.

I realized I'm just a more sophisticated attention seeker, which ironically is what I hate the most about others.

I often fluctuate from a superiority complex to an inferiority complex, depending on how I'm feeling.
During fits of rage I often like to refer to myself as a god and calling my opponents things like worms etc..

So to sum it up I'm a piece of shit, I manipulate others to make me feel good about myself while indirectly belittling them.

Are these sociopathic traits? How do you distinguish a selfish asshole from a sociopath?"
1719,I've got everything and feel nothing,"I'm 18 and I always feel like I'm missing something. I'm not depressed, but there's always this void that I don't know how to get rid of.

 Growing up I used to be like 250lbs and got bullied for it.  So then I thought I'd be happy if I got skinny. Then for a couple years I worked out and dieted and lost it all, got in shape and I still wasn't happy. I just felt dull. 

Then, I never had friends so I made a few friends who I'd probably die for even to this day and even with all the company, I felt dull. 

Then, I thought it was girls. So I got good at talking to them, and started to get them but I still felt dull. 

After that, I thought it was growing up poor and being broke. So I started reselling stuff until I saved up to invest in stocks and make money online. Now I have like 40k in the bank, cool clothes, and still feel empty. 

Now, most recently, I thought it was how I hated living in my small hometown, so I moved all the way to NYC and I still feel the void.

 I'm at the point where I have no clue what it could be. I've had relationships but I've never really loved anybody. I've reconnected with my family, and even my dad who left me at a young age. I've found hobbies too and yet I'm always just voided of something and I have no clue what it is. If anybody can help, it would be very much appreciated because I'm just confused at this point. I'm never depressed but I'm always just slightly sad and nothing seems to fix it"
1720,Can someone tell me what this sounds like to you?,"I sometimes get a memory that seems like it is a dream but it makes me panic. I feel like fainting, I start shaking, and become nauseous. I also begin to breath deeply. This dream/memory thing changes slightly every time I have it, and it comes out of nowhere. The setting and people change and this panic feeling comes and goes. The actual memory/dream panic lasts only 30ish seconds and is not scary at all. What is happening to my mind? Is it a panic disorder? I am so confused."
1721,Could I be misdiagnosed?,"Hello.

About a year ago I decided to start therapy. My therapist thought I had bipolar disorder because I told him I would have intense mood swings and could go from suicidally depressed to euphoric, almost like I was high. The therapist recommended I seek the help of a psychiatrist.

I told the psychiatrist about the mood swings, paranoia, depression, anxiety, and drug use in the past.  But when he asked me about homicidal thoughts I lied because I wasn't sure what would happen if I said yes. 

He diagnosed me with major depression and anxiety and I went on medication for it. 

Could that thing that I left out mean the difference of a diagnosis?"
1722,I have been kinda depressed alot recently. Idk what to do now. But some parts have been good.,"Hi again. I’m sorry if i’m annoying people by posting alot on here. I use this though, as a way to get stuff off my chest and things. I’m sorry. 

I have been feeling ok for the past few days. I have been kinda happy / more happy than usual and it has been good and i have been with friends and stuff. 

I am now getting an IEP in place at my school which is good but i’m nervous / really anxious because my mum is going to speak with my teachers and things about it and it’s making me kinda scared for some reason.

Most likely, i’m gonna get called out of class, which triggers my anxiety alot when it happens.

Also, like, today, i have just been feeling down but really hyper (which is a good thing i guess) but anxious alot all of today which is..well yeah. Idk. 

I have been taking my meds and eating better and keeping hydrated now which is good. 

In lesson / class i cannot focus what so ever, resulting me getting told off in a few classes. 

I have exams in two weeks and idk what i am doing in them because i can’t even focus in lessons atm. I might be getting extra time due to the IED plan though. 

They are just making me really worried and i have literally got about 30 pcs of homework to do in 2 days. I cannot do it. I can’t even do 5 in 1 day xd. 

It’s just all becoming too much and they say the week off from school (next week) is gonna be a break from school, but we are getting lots of work to do. 


Hey, but at least the name calling and stuff has kinda stopped a bit? Apart from getting called (sorry if this triggers anyone): “An ADHD weilding retard that doesn’t know shit and can’t even answer maths questions right”. That made me feel amazing. /s


But yeah. I actually managed to write 2 whole pages in class yesterday which was kinda cool. I know it doesn’t sound like much but it was alot to me. Also i got rewarded and stuff for a piece of school work i did. 

That’s about it i think. And sorry if i’m annoying anyone by posting alot on here, i just do it to get stuff of my chest and out of my head. 


Thankyou"
1723,Personality?,"When I'm anxious or missing home, I start to act like a child. Movements, talking, everything. I don't know what this means but I was just wondering if this seems familiar to anyone."
1724,Got a job at a fortune 250 company. I worked in a vape shop before this so it's a big deal to me. I'm managing my anxiety so far but I'm worried I'm too stupid to excel.,"With the chronic anxiety and depression my memory has been in decline for years. And my mind never rests so concentration is difficult. Getting back into basic meditation and better practices at home will help, I think. I want to be positive. This is an amazing opportunity and I can't let myself sabotage it. Just wanted to share some positivity and maybe glean some good vibes from you all. Hope you all are having a good day/night."
1725,Should I tell my mom about this?,"My mom and I were talking a couple of hours before, just about random things and then she asked me if I was alright because I was laughing a lot, and I told her that I was because nothing was bothering me at the time. She then proceeded to tell me how I've ruined my life because of my weight and because I don't know what I want to do later in my life (I'm 15). About an hour ago she came into my room, sat on a chair and talked to me for about 15 minutes and told me how she's there for me and to tell her if anything is ever bothering me. That turned into an argument (I guess she was arguing with herself because I was just looking at her and hoping that she'll get out of my room soon) about how many times she sat down and went on about the same thing over and over again. Then she asked me to talk to her about why I haven't been doing anything, why am I laying in my bed all day watching Netflix, I didn't know what to say because I was and still am tired, it's currently 2 am. When my mom finally left the room, I turned off the lights, broke down crying and laid in my bed. This is where the story and my question begins. I felt broken, lost, I felt like I was crying over nothing, as it was only a physical reaction of my body rather than an emotional reason. I wanted to hurt myself, break something, the feeling of anger and frustration was piling inside me wanting to become an action. But I don't know over what. Then I calmed down for a few seconds, started to think about when I was little, of my grandpa who was alive at the time. I broke down again, I wanted to die so badly, like I've never wanted before. Something hurt but I couldn't feel it on my body, I only felt the presence of the pain that made twitch and shake, but in a horrible way. At that moment my mom started sending me messages, like she always does after we talk about something, telling me everything she said to me before but phrasing it differently. This time I felt as awful as I did before, but the messages, they were pressuring me into answering if I wanted to change my life, I said yes, but in reality I was sobbing, being unable to think about myself a year in the future, I wanted to delete the messaging app because I really didn't know what to answer. I wanted to tell her about how I felt, about what happened to me but something was stopping me from doing so. I wanted to tell her that I felt like I was dying, in the worst way possible and that I needed help from a psychiatrist or something, because I could not help myself. Now that I've calmed down I can see a little clearer, but I'm not tired anymore. I feel drained, and it still hurts to live. Should I tell her about this, or should I just keep it to myself if I feel better later?


I'm sorry if I made any mistakes writing this, English isn't my first language, I tried my best to put the feelings that I was feeling into words."
