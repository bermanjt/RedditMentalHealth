0,Everyday is another day closer...,"Life has been rocky and not perfect by any means. I’ve been stuck in an everlasting cell in my mind trying to break free and release the damaging thoughts. From smoking to drinking to self harming, last year I was on the verge of ending my life. Soon after my girlfriend (at the time) ended our relationship, I was failing college miserably and was close to being kicked out. Also at work, where I was nearly fired for slacking 

However, at this current point in my life I can truly say I am happier. I’ve improved at work and I have a new amazing girlfriend. Not to mention that I have also succeeded at college and been accepted into university. I’ve let go of bad habits, people and negative energy.

I’ve been through counselling, therapy, online talk
forums and chats. Whilst it’s only limited support, I’ve had to fight for myself.

My advice to overcome the suffering from mental health is to first, let go. Holding onto whatever it is that cannot be changed will consume you and eat you alive. It seems so hard but it will really help. Secondly, look ahead for change. You want to break away from old habits and that will happen with a new scenario, place, people and interactions. Find a new hobby or
job and meet new people. It will really boost your confidence. My third advice is to NOT expect so much from anything. Go into things with a neutral mindset and with the hopes of it going good or bad. Never determine an outcome before you’ve lived it. Fourth, be aware of what it is that’s making you FEEL a certain way. Find that issue and feel what it is. Control it and ask yourself “why am i feeling like this?” What you don’t want to do is to cause an affect on everything because of this one thing. 

Change was forthcoming and inevitability was imminent. I hope I am able to share a bit of wisdom and spread positivity, kindness snd hope in all of you in dire need!

Best of luck!"

2,I can’t be ill too?,"Hey everyone,
I‘m looking for some advice. I’m in a very bad place right now and I’m starting to get desperate.

I‘m suffering from depression and anxiety. I have self harmed quite a lot in the past and I have suicidal thoughts. My dad has been struggling with depression and my brother as well. I’m quite a good actress (at least when it comes to act normal or downplay my own issues) so my family kind of relies on me as a... idk, counselor? No, that’s not the right word. But I’m the person who is “fine”. Someone to give advice or just distract. While actually I’m far from being fine. I’m in so much pain and sometimes I just want to disappear. But I can’t tell my family, especially my little brother. I’m so afraid of making everything even more difficult for everyone."
3,What Does It Truly Mean to be Yourself?,"I'm not going to lie. I've been feeling pretty solid mentally, despite of everything happening around us in the world right now. Of the past years, this is the most solid ground I've ever stood on.

But, now that I'm no longer in that haze of depression, I've noticed something was...off? I no longer know what I look like. Sounds crazy, right? I literally can't tell you what I look like at all. In my head, I'm a completely different person than in real life. Every time I look in a mirror, it feels like a shock to my brain, a stranger staring back at me. I don't know why this suddenly started, or why I can't see myself as I truly am, but I'm not sure how to go about even fixing it.

On one hand, if I don't know what I look like, then what's there to be self conscious about? I wore a dress the other day, something I haven't done in ten years. But, is this just a delusion to help me cope with something I didn't even know was wrong?

Has anyone else experienced this?"
4,Anxiety?,"Hi all. For the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing some symptoms that I feel like might be anxiety, specifically rapid heartbeat. It’s weird though because it will occur at the most random times, and I haven’t experienced any “hard” things or had any majorly stressful events happen to me recently. But my heart speeds up randomly and nothing I do seems to get it beating regularly again. I also tremble/shake sometimes but not always. Could this be anxiety or panic attacks? I really don’t know that much about mental illness/health issues and haven’t seen a doctor or therapist about it. 

Has anyone else experienced this or have any thoughts? Thanks."
5,Something weird is happening,"I just went through the end of a 3 year relationship about 3 weeks ago. I tried swallowing my pride one last time to make it work but my ex said he wants nothing to do with me, he doesn’t care about me, that nothing he does is my business anymore. He’s doing a pretty good job at pretending I don’t exist. If that’s his way of healing, I respect that. But something in my brain is telling me “What if you made this relationship all up in your head, what if it never happened? Maybe that’s why you’re so easy to forget” . I know the relationship happened, I have all the pictures, videos, texts, like I said it was 3 years of my life but it’s like something in my brain is telling me I made it all up. And for some reason, part of me believes it. My reality feels very distorted. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this?"
6,Anxiety attack at the mall.,"I posted similar in r/anxiety but it was much more light-hearted.

An hour ago I almost spent $200ish dollars I really don't have on skincare products I don't need because I am basically incapable of saying no. To anyone without my level of social and situational anxiety this sounds ridiculous but it's so hard to get out of these situations once I'm in them.

I know how I am so I actively avoid eye contact and leave a wide space between me and anyone that will try to sell me anything. Despite this, a lady at a high end skincare store spoke up and asked if I'd like a lotion sample. I said ""no, but thank you very much"" as I am overly polite in an attempt to balance my awkwardness.

She insisted and said I could take it to go so I agreed as saying no twice to something free is somehow rude in my head. She then stated ""come here, let me go get one for sensitive skin"" and walked into the store. I have obvious rosacea and in my mind she was going above and beyond so I followed. Big mistake. 

I'm not exactly sure what happened next but somehow I ended up in a chair and she was rubbing a face mask on the back of my arm so I could see the effect it had on my skin. She's telling me all about the product and I'm nodding along and commenting as one does to make the other person know you're listening. 

My brain at this point has all alarm bells ringing for multiple reasons. I don't really have money for this, I don't know that I won't be allergic to it as I am to many things, and I literally had a bag with THREE LIVE MICE in it in boxes for my snake. You know, the whole reason I came. Not something that can afford to let sit for however long while I listen to a lady talk about something I don't care about. I say nothing about this however, I am incapable of it. It would be rude to not let her finish. It's my fault I followed. I don't know how to extract myself politely. 

She tried another lotion on me because I showed interest (as I have about everything she's said) and starts going on about how much they all are. Hundreds of dollars. So much money. I make a comment about how I'm buying presents for my grandparents and don't have much right now (which is true) but that I like the product and would look into it. (I don't want to be rude and say her stuff sucks.) 

This doesn't work. She starts giving me lower numbers. Deals. Talking about how long they'll last. I ooh and ahh at appropriate times but am starting to panic. Full panic attack immanent but I'm squashing it down because I don't want to seem weird. She keeps talking about price and I keep making comments about how I don't know if I could do that right now for this and that reason. Nearly ten minutes into this, I can't hold the panic attack much longer, I feel clammy and my heart is pounding and I cave. I tell her ok, she sold me. Just to get away from here and this situation. (I internally scream at myself ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?!?!"") I smile and follow her up to the counter.

I give her my credit card. It doesn't go through and pops up with a number to call so she tells me she'll put my stuff aside while I call........I do but it's a merchant number. Something wrong on her end but she isn't understanding. She keeps asking me for another card which I literally don't have, asking me to pull cash but it's a credit card so I can't. (Vision blurring a bit as my head is swimming from my heart beating so fast from my already started panic attack.) I finally leave after she gets my cell number and giving me her own and states that she'll hold onto my stuff and the price for me until Monday.

I called my husband (who's in the middle of a D&amp;D game with his friends but picks up anyways because he's a sweetheart) after getting into the car outside of the mall so he could talk me through my panic attack that finally fully seizes me. Full on hyperventilating and gasping because I don't have enough air to sob properly. I couldn't even tell him what had happened until I settled down enough to talk ten minutes later. I'm still shakey an hour after.

I can NOT handle situations like this and have done similar things in the past but not with anything NEAR this expensive. I can't believe how close I came to walking out with that stuff. We're not terribly well off but it wouldn't have prevented me from paying bills....my husband wouldn't even have been upset at me. I would have felt awful though and more of an idiot than I do now for getting into the situation to begin with. I know I wasn't strapped to the chair and ""could have walked out"" but I COULDN'T. The thing people dont realize is that I am fully conscious of the terrible decisions I'm making but I am incapable of actually making the rational decisions or doing the obvious things to make it better. Because of the way my brain works and it tends to escalate the situation and it's awful understanding that you're making it worse but not being able to change it or stop.

Oh and I blocked her number already and am obviously not going back on Monday for the stuff. The mice also got out of their boxes while I was in panic mode in the car and I had the fun time of trying to catch them and put them into a grocery bag while still coming down from the attack in the middle of a freaking mall parking lot. I'm sure a bunch of people saw me and wondered what the heck I was doing. So that was fun and I'm going to be afraid to go to that mall for a while now. I feel so utterly useless and incapable of basic adult things like going shopping. I thought I was doing better but this just cut me up inside and I'm still suffering some anxious heart flutters even thinking about it despite nothing actually happening. I'm so thankful for my husband but the last thing I want is to force him to go shopping with me for everything. I just want to curl up in a ball on my couch and never leave my apartment.

TLDR: I almost spent $200 on skincare products because my anxiety disorder made me think it was a better choice than saying no and walking away from someone."

9,"People who have gone to the hospital for suicide thoughts, what happened? (US)","I can't do this anymore. I really really can't. So much shit has gone down in the past couple of days/week and I'm completely over everything. Just everything from the past year and everything just seems to keep building and building. And I feel like I'm at my end

I really want to die and I was driving and just thought how easy it would be to swerve. Just to end it all.

How much I really want to not be here anymore. But also I know my willpower won't let me do it.

I know I should go to the hospital but I want to know what they will do if I go. I wouldn't say I'm in critical danger because as much as I do really not want to be here anymore, I know to my core that I don't have the willpower to actually do anything, but I know I need help and a lot of it"
10,paranoia is the reason i can’t sleep and i really need help,"i have this intense, consistent, reoccurring thought that someone i used to date is going to hurt me. he never showed any abusive tendencies, he never once hurt, hit or even touched me in a way that was meant to hurt me. not once. he didn’t have the best mental health, and could be a bit nasty to the people around him, but not once did i see him display aggressive or harmful behaviour. he would show a disconnect to death and sometimes laugh at wildly inappropriate moments which sometimes scared me. but he hasn’t ever hurt me nor has he ever threatened to, yet i am absolutely petrified and for some reason believe he is plotting to hurt me. i don’t know why. our relationship ended on bad terms, but it’s still a little foggy and he tried to reach out again but i shut him down, and he hasn’t contacted me since. i live very close to him but he has never been to my house and i doubt he knows what number or even what road i live on. i don’t know why i think he’s going to hurt me. i have OCD and i think it may just be an intrusive thought, but i don’t know how to stop it. please help. please tell me that i’m safe. i don’t know how to handle this."

12,You may not even be aware when you're becoming irritable and snapping at people - checking in regularly with how you're feeling can help you to know when to take a break rather than react immediately,"We all try our best to speak kindly to the people around us but during stressful periods we can sometimes get a bit snippy (especially if someone is clicking their pen repeatedly). Its OK to have a bad day - but we can limit the impact of our grumpiness by regularly checking in with how we're feeling and taking time to tend to our difficult feelings. Nothing is more important than your peace - and by working on your peace through meditation your words will be kinder, making the world a better place.

13,100 blog posts about schizophrenia and mental health - major milestone," It's taken almost four years - but I just published my 100th blog post about schizophrenia and mental illness. This one summarizes a dozen of my most relevant posts and provides links to them.

14,My own hatred of alcohol has caused a strain in my relationship,"I have major problems with alcohol and it has caused a strain on my relationship. I have a very troublesome past with alcohol. Both of my parents were alcoholics, they fought all the time until the finally divorced. I lived with my mom, and while she had stopped drinking as much, she would still get drunk sometimes and become angry with me for anything I did, which left me feeling bad for a long times afterwards. After she died, I went to live with my dad, who was still an alcoholic. He drank all the time and tried to hide it from me as best as he could. I would still find numerous empty vodka bottles, whisky bottles, etc in the trash can. Sometimes he would drink in excess when I was home and yell at me, berate me, belittle me, and make me feel absolutely miserable and worthless. I think he was a big contributing factor to my depression.

Last year, all my emotions started to bubble over. I became so depressed. Nothing had any meaning for me, and I too turned to alcohol to make a feeble attempt to cope. Instead of coping, however, it made me feel worse. I drank almost daily, withering away in my own sadness. It got so bad that I considered suicide for a while before actually deciding to do it. Luckily, a dear friend of mine caught onto what was happening and helped talk me down. I will be forever thankful for her. I still struggle with depression and anxiety, but I don't turn to alcohol anymore. I've turned away from it, and I have a strong hatred for it.

In the summer of last year, I got into a relationship with a man whom I had been friends with, and secretly in love with, for years. This was (and still is) my first real relationship. We've had our ups and downs while navigating our relationship. It's hard for both of us since we both have mental illnesses that make this relationship much harder than it should be. The one thing we haven't yet figured out and worked past is alcohol. He has also had his own issues with alcohol. His father was an alcoholic and died because of it. He doesn't like alcohol either, but will still drink when he's with his friends.

I just can't bear thinking about him drinking. When I know he's going to see his friends, I get overcome with anxiety. I know he rarely drinks.. and I mean, rarely. He's been out drinking with his friends like two times in the past six months, but I can't stand it. It makes me feel so, so bad to know that he's drinking. I know it isn't often, but it still just hurts me so badly. I don't want to feel like this. I want to be okay with him drinking with his friends, but I just can't. I dont know why. It just makes me feel so awful. I just sit and cry for hours. I know it makes him feel bad, seeing me react this way, and it hurts me knowing that I hurt him. But I just can't stop feeling like this. I don't know what to do."
15,Just need to vent about some things in my life,[removed]
16,(Repost) I need help with my wife,[removed]
17,How can I help ?,"Hi. I’m in love, I’m in a great relationship, I [28M] am living with her [25F] and our lovely little cat. But there a problem constantly being brought up that I do not know how to solve or how to be a part of the solution, she’s fixated on the fact she her body has changed. She says she gained some weight (I honestly don’t see it, but it is hard to do when you spend all of your free time together). I can acknowledge looking at photograph before we met (over a year ago) that she did gained some weight. I can see and feel that she’s spiraling out of control with that thought and that’s where I’d like to be a part of the solution. 

There are a few things you have to know about her to fully understand the situation. First, she’s what a psychologist would call gifted. No not the gifted your teacher called you in third grade, genuinely gifted. Super high IQ, extreme awareness of everything that surrounds her, high understanding of social interactions. This is also mixed with hyper-sensitivity which from what I understand basically means that everything feels overwhelming quite rapidly. Now, I’m not a psychologist, I’m a watchmaker. I know how fix micro mechanical things. 

The problem started about 4-6 months ago. I’ve been very aware of it for at least 4 months. Since then I’ve tried quite a few things. Such as: 

1.	Telling her she’s beautiful (which now that I write this down, I realise it might not be a good idea because it brings her appearance which could be reminding her that she’s unsatisfied about the way she looks) 
2.	Cooking better meals and making more balanced portions for her and If we don’t have leftovers for both our lunch, I’d leave her the healthier portion and grab myself some restaurant. 
3.	I’ve tried during crisis times reminding her that her image is not the sole definition of her person, to which she agrees, but still that part of her is unsatisfying and overwhelming. From what I understand she cries daily while I’m at work and she works from home. 
4.	I’m always there for her if anything happens, but she doesn’t want to talk too much about these kind of issues – I think it’s due to the fact she’s scared of being a burden. 
5.	I try to manage her stress levels and plan activities to take her mind off of things. 
6.	I try to make her feel sexy

She’s helping herself too. I’m not the only one trying to work on this. A few examples are: 

1.	She’s been followed by one of the top psychologists specialised in gifted persons for the past 10 years and I know she brought this up with her. 
2.	She works out everyday – 45 minutes of hardcore spinning classes. 
3.	She cuts on out of meal time snack, but I think this is the main issue relating to why she’s gaining weight. 
4.	She’s planed an upcoming séance with a specialist specialised in alimentary trouble (Trouble alimentaire in French) 

As you can guess with any mental health issues there’s real life consequences. One of the hardest for me personally, would be anything that has to do with our life in bed. She’s “ashamed” of what she looks like – listening to her, you’d believe she’s 600 pounds – so it’s making the situation really difficult. The frequency is … which, I do understand why with the issues she’s facing. We basically have sex when she thinks I’m due. I always get the feeling this is more of a chore for her, she wants it over as soon as possible. I know this may sounds like me making her issues about me, but at this point I think I’m just writing out my heart because it’s what I do when I feel overwhelmed and I honestly want to make this about finding more ways to help her than making myself feel better. I love her, she’s a wonderful person and I honestly and deeply want her to be better.

Do you have any suggestion ?"
18,Fear and Guilt,Is there a connection between fear and guilt? Can fear cause guilt?
19,Am I fucking myself over by going to a residential treatment program?,"My depression and anxiety have been getting way worse over the past few months. I'm constantly suicidal. I want to scream at my mom all the time, just because she's talking. My anxiety is so bad. 

I just. I can't do this. I have no schedule. It feels like I have no support. I want the structure that would come with going to a residential treatment. 

But I'm really worried that it'll be traumatizing (anxiety and routine-wise, plus having to interact with people CONSTANTLY) or that I won't be able to integrate back into regular life, or that I'll fall behind in school. 

Please, I need advice. I don't know what to do."

21,Pre-Pandemic soul therapy,"At this time, so many of us 
If not all in some way have seen loss and a lot of darkness right now.

I’ll be honest, hell, long before all of this.. I have had a “black and white “ perception on life and my own self image. 
Before I move forward: 
in no way am I posting this as a sympathizer or for any recognition. Honestly I have a phobia of public recognition.. among other physical/mental disabilities I’d rather not disclose now. 

Before the pandemic I worked a full time job, a sh*t job but I was working my ass off to provide for my partner and I as ‘newlyweds’.. I was the breadwinner and it was the only ego I had, until recently. 

Anyway, with my medical issues, per say and this overwhelming crisis on us all. I completely crumbled. From their on, it’s been almost a domino-effect.. I got let go, I’ve been on unemployment and waiting on social security.. pill after pill, doctor appts, therapy almost every other day now..

Mind you, this is not my first roll of psych treatment. When I was 14, I ate a bottle of pills and drank my mummies favorite bottles of Chardonnay (as she wasn’t home nearly half the time in that period.. at work or wherever else. Every day.) 

I’m gonna shut up about myself, because my point wasn’t to tell my life story thru all this post. 
The argument I’m moving forward to is how imperative Caring for the homeless (before all) and mentally disabled is during this crisis. I’ve had much distrust and my own paranoia of ‘mental health’ in the past. But recently I have found it the only option I have even for myself to live a healthier life and marriage.. 

I remembered something, after my appointment earlier todaythat made me kind of smile at myself.. for once. 

I was discussing homelessness and problems in the “mental health” community with my dad over the phone. I’m in Ca he is in WNY over 2,000 mi apart... when I came across an awesome young Lady named Manda I found on YouTube thru invisible people. Upon listening to her awesome story, i began reminiscing about an encounter I had with a young homeless girl, probably not much older than me.. (I’m 24) it was early last autumn

One afternoon I was pulling in to my local shopping center to get some fast food. That day I was livid about something.. can’t exactly remember what happened but I recall I wasn’t exactly the nicest guy to encounter that day. Anyway, before I pulled in to the drive thru of my destination: I saw the young girl i mentioned earlier, struggling with a baby stroller, obviously full of what Worldly possessions she still had. It immediately put me in my place and struck me out of whatever distractions I had. 

I remember, it had to have been over 90 degrees and any of you who know SoCal heat it’s NOT cool to be out for more than a few minutes!! I pulled up and had about 10 dollars and some change in my console. I immediately handed it to her and she said “thanks you didn’t have to” not thinking I just said “I felt like it. Please be safe sweetie..” before I pulled off, she tapped on my window with tears in her eyes and a weary but gorgeous little grin on her lips. What she said will always resonate in my mind.. “You know, most people don’t think of me at all. You don’t know how much it meant to hear you say  ‘be safe’. Thanks again..” and she quickly walked off under the shade of the restaurant. 

I wish I kept things like that encounter on my mind each day. It’d remind me how awesome life still kinda is...

As simple and mundane as the salutation “be safe” is starting to become. I’m starting to recall how much it meant to that girl that day last year.. I hope she’s still somewhere now, but safe and warm with what she truly needs. I hope all people, no matter what background on the streets today can find home again soon.. The words “be safe” to a complete stranger could mean everything or nothing. I’m happy to know what it means to me.."
22,Why do I do this to myself?!,Why I am I sitting here right now talking to this girl (that I’ve been talking to for a week straight now) and right before I text her back thinking *why do I even bother wasting this girls time when I know I’m not good enough for her??* like why do I think that?? Why put myself into that mindset before it EVEN HAPPENS?!? Like I want to stop and I’m noticing problems/tendencY!! But I just don’t know how to stop them from intruding
23,Having a real hard time with not being able to block out bad thoughts...,"I feel really bad and I can't stop thinking about everything bringing me down. 

Anyone got any idea what to do when the darkness hits too late for friends or family or comfort eating?"
24,done with this,"For the past almost two weeks I have been worse mentally than I have ever been. It is worse than the bad times in Iraq, worse than the nightmares and flashbacks that came after. I don't want this to be the new normal. Tomorrow my ex wife is picking up our daughter so she can meet her new boyfriend. As soon as she is gone I am done with this world. I barley made it living with the PTSD and depression and at some point it is just more than I can take. I hope my kids know that I loved them and was proud of them. I honestly don't know why I am writing this but I figure Reddit is anonymous cant hurt. I have a plan I am pretty sure will be successful with no chance of a half measure. doubled up on pills and gun. going to do it in the truck. leave less of a mess for everyone and well away from the house or people. 12 hours to go and this torture will stop."

26,How do you deal with a panic attack alone?,"I keep having them out of the blue, and its making me hard to breathe. I also feel like my room's envoloping me and its getting narrower. I need help"
27,Threatening suicide just for attention?,"I have a 28 year old brother who was diagnosed with autism when he was very young. Although he is on the spectrum, he is high functioning. He drives a car, has his license, he is verbal, etc. However, he is still a little different than a typical 28 year old guy. He still lives with my parents, never been in any serious relationships, and he gets a government check for his disability but it was determined that he does not have enough experience/knowledge with managing money to receive the money directly, so the money actually goes to my mom and then she gives him a portion of it every month. The rest of it goes into some kind of savings account. Several years back, my dad found a note in my brothers room that he had written. I don’t know what exactly it said but it indicated that he was possibly feeling suicidal. I believe he has written something about how the world would be better off without him, or something of that nature. 

I urged my mom that he really should see a psychologist. It took a while but she did eventually take him to one. He went on antidepressants for a while (not sure if he still takes them) and went to a few therapy sessions but my mom always seemed to think that the therapy wasn’t helpful. I tried telling her that it takes a while to get comfortable with your therapist and build trust. My husband went to a psychologist every week for 3-4 years until he felt like he was at a point where felt he was ok to stop going. 

Every now and then, I still see him post things on Facebook. Like for example, how he thinks he is hopeless/ worthless and other disparaging posts. My mom was talking to me today about how he has really been getting under her skin lately because he vapes and she has repeatedly told him not to do it inside the house. He continued to sneak around and do it anyway, so she finally told him as long as he’s living there, he’s not allowed to vape at all. Anytime she has caught him with any vape since then, she said she has taken it away from him. She said she has had a serious talk with him about this and that he tries to pull the “sympathy card” and says things to her like that he hates himself. 

She doesn’t seem to have any sympathy for him and in fact, judging from the way she speaks about him, she seems quite annoyed by him. She thinks that his talk of suicide and his overall attitude is just him trying to get attention. She doesn’t think he would ever actually kill himself. The way I see it, he probably is looking for attention, but that also doesn’t mean that he wouldn’t commit suicide. I think it’s better to be safe than sorry, which is why I immediately suggest that they get him help after they found that note in his room. Regardless of whether he would actually kill himself or not, I think he feels unloved/ uncared for, and he’s reaching out for help. 

What are you thoughts?"
28,I got scammed and robbed today,"I wanted to help my family with some extra money so I had decided to sell my laptop. The thing was pretty good and could be sold at high prices, so it was more than enough to help. A person contacted me yesterday telling me he was interested in buying it so I went through with negotiations. Today that person put the money in my bank account but turns out it was ""ghost money"" from an account using checks with no money. I asked they guy because it didn't reflect the quantity so he dedided to point a gun at me and take everything. He took the laptop and some money I had on me. Long story short: Today I lost 1000usd approximately.

I am currently dealing with depression. I'm about to lose an uncle due to covid and my bro was diagnosed with diabetes. The shock from being held at gunpoint and having my stuff stolen really broke me today. I just wanted to help my family, but now I have no money, I'm unemployed and the world sucks. I don't know how to continue if things like these keep happening on a daily basis. 

I just want out honestly. Give me a fresh start or just be happy for more than 24 hours."
29,(TW: Self Harm &amp; Suicidal Thoughts Mention) How can I ask my partner if they’re hurting themself?,"Im sorry if this isn’t the right place for this but I didn’t really know where else to ask.

For context; my partner has been really struggling lately, being stuck in a somewhat abusive household and not being able to see their therapist in person, among other things, has been really hard for them. They’re depressed and have talked to me quite a bit about their suicidal thoughts. They told me that they’re passively suicidal, that they want to die but won’t actually do it, but I still can’t help but be concerned.

Tonight we were at a friends house to hang for a bit (it was only 4 people and in my province we’re allowed gatherings of 10 people without distancing) and I didn’t wanna bring it up because they were having fun but I noticed a couple cuts on their arm. It’s possible they just got scratched by one of their cats, but the cuts were so straight and almost perfectly parallel, they looked too neat and deep to be cat scratches. Idk, just, knowing that my partner’s mental health has been particularly bad lately and knowing that they’ve hurt themself before, it’s not unlikely that they cut. I’m kinda doubting myself because I wouldn’t think someone would wear a t-shirt with fairly fresh cuts on their arm, but I’ve never done anything like that so I can’t really speak on what they would or wouldn’t do.

I know it’s possible that I’m overreacting and my anxiety is just getting the better of me but I don’t want to just ignore this. If they are hurting themself it’s probably only gonna get worse, but I don’t know how to approach them about it without sounding rude/like I’m assuming the worst. 

I hope I’m not coming off as insincere, I just wanna help them so badly but I have no idea how."
30,"Going back to college, I’m going to do what makes me happy","I’ve realized that lately, all I really do is ruminate and think about how I should have done things differently in the past so I wasn’t such a burden on others. Now I realize, that the past is the past and the only way left to go is forward. I’m going to get rid of the toxic people in my life and do what really makes me happy. I’m going to continue my studies ($80k in student debt for an engineering degree with the support of my friends and family, I used to stress over this but all you really need to do to conquer debt is to prepare and live frugally), and I’m going to do what makes ME happy. 

I might get homesick and cry a lot, but that’s okay. It shows me how much I love my parents and how much more I should do for them because of how much they’ve done for me. I need to go to sleep now, writing helps me validate my feelings and I plan on doing it more often."
31,How To Talk To Someone About Mental Health,"Let me start by saying that I struggle with anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and I *might* have depression to tack onto that, so I’ve shared my problems with mental health to multiple people already. With that being said, however, I struggle with talking to people about *their* mental health. The reason why this is is because I tend to want to give suggestions on how to promote mental health, but whenever none work, I tend to give up and say something like “I don’t know what to tell you, then”. What should I do in a situation in which I run out of things to say?"
32,I’m sick of this,He guys so . I don’t know but my parents get mad at me for everything it’s like I can’t make one mistake without being a worthless  . My dad Throws stuff at me . They Run me down to beat me when I do something wrong . I’m 14 and a sophomore I have a 4.3 gpa top 1% in the class .

But I mean whatever they pay the bills and pay for all my stuff right ?

35,"Small small portion of my story. Not too in detail, and then some words of encouragement.","      So I’m new to this whole subreddit but I found it just in time. I am an 18 year old male. I’m gonna start out by sharing what I’ve been feeling lately, and then put some nice words out there for you all. 


   All I do is worry. I worry, and I think. I don’t speak, but I think. I feel like everyday my mind is getting the best of me. Constantly worrying, and thinking about everything there is to think about. I feel like I don’t want to do anything. I just want to be where I want to be now, or I don’t want to be anywhere at all. 


   I grew up my entire life, with 2 parents. Up until about 16 years. My parents divorced. I was given the choice to live with my mother, or my “father”. I chose my father, as I spent most of my time with him. My mother told me, in a bitter rage. “HE IS NOT YOUR REAL DAD, YOU CAN NOT LIVE WITH HIM. YOUR REAL DAD DIED WHEN YOU WERE BORN”. Heartbroken, confused, and angry. I spent the next year going down a bad path, and spiralling rather quickly. 


    I got my life together, I found a purpose. Making money. I spent the next 4 months working at a department store, to scrape enough money to start a business. I couldn’t. I was stuck in a loop. Work, check, spend to live. Work, check, spend to live. I had nothing. I still don’t. Friends lost in time. Family lost in time. Gone, at the blink of an eye. Taken by a force, that no one truly understands. My mental health is something that I miss more than anything though. I wish I had thought more about myself, and how I could change. 


    6 months later, and I’m in a new state. 6 months later, I’m alone. 6 months later, I’m struggling. I will make it. I will make it. I will make it. I will do everything I said I wanted to do. I will make it. I will start a successful business. I will spend my spare time gaming and streaming building an audience. I will live out my dreams. 


     Now less about me, and more about you. You will make it. YOU. WILL. MAKE IT. YOU. WILL. MAKE IT. YOU. WILL. MAKE IT. YOU. WILL. MAKE IT. I don’t care WHAT you’re going through, I don’t care WHAT situation you’re in. You. Will. Make it. We will make it TOGETHER. You will be where you want to be. It doesn’t happen overnight. You. Will. Make it. 


      Envision yourself where you TRULY. want to be. Do not say dead. Do not take the easy, and selfish way out. Ask yourself, what would TRULY. Make you happy? Where do you want to be in 10 years. What is your dream. Now. Tell yourself it will happen. Tell yourself you will make it there. The road may not be smooth, but you need to ACCEPT that. You need to understand that. You. Will. MAKE IT. 



      I won’t tell more, about me. Although I could write a book. You know my story now, but do you know me? Do you know how I look? Do you know what I do ? How I live? Exactly. Your story doesn’t define who you are. Your story does not make you. You make you. You decide where you are, because you have free will. You are human and you belong. You deserve to have a life that you want to live , and if someone else is trying to define you, or control you?.  Leave. Get out. Move. Do anything you can to get away. Only you can make the change and do what makes you happy."
36,Please help,"I can't cope with the way I look anymore. Everyone hates people who look like me and I can't do it. I can't leave my house anymore, I hate myself so much. If I was thin I would be ok, I'd be able to eat normally and do all the things I enjoy. I'm in so much pain everyday and I haven't gone a day without crying in years. I've tried to lose weight and starve myself so many times but I can't do it when I hate myself so much. I don't deserve to be healthy. I'm not super overweight, just by 5-10 pounds but I keep thinking I'm obese. I have never felt comfortable in my body before, how am I supposed to live knowing that everyone who looks at me thinks I'm hideous? I can't find the confidence and will to make a good change because I keep spiraling. Everyone seems to hate girls unless they are beautiful.

My grandma passed away today, a month apart from her husband, my grandpa. My mother has lost both of her parents in such a short amount of time and it is taking a toll on everyone.

I've just emotionally shut down at this point. I feel numb and hurt and defeated. I can't find anything to look forward to anymore and feel like i have somewhat lost all hope. I don't think im at the point of suicide, because i havent had thoughts of killing myself, but i definitely want this suffering to end.

enjoying the simple things in life don't help. i've lost all interest in my favorite activities and reaching out to my friends makes me feel like a burden. i feel like theyre just obligated to say ""i'm sorry"" or ""i hope things get better"".

I most definitely cannot go to therapy.

what do i do?"

Backstory:

Last night my sister and I were wasted and we were making prank phone calls. (very immature, I know)  I called this one place and ended up talking to this guy for like 15 minutes. I don't remember anything we were saying but I remember him just being like silent alot.

Now I am freaking out because what if we said something bad and maybe they were recording us and then go to the news with it and then im cancelled? They show my job? Call the police? Reverse look up my number and come to my house? Should I call and apologize?"

41,Weird Head Feeling Accompanied by Lethargic Behavior?,"Hey there! I have BPD, Anxiety, Depression, and PMDD, but I don't know what causes this frequent sensation that usually happens the day after intense emotions, anxiety attacks, and when I'm most depressed. It could just be dissociation, it probably is, but a lot of googling about this weird head feeling leaves with me with nothing similar to what i feel. Perhaps it's not related to my mental health at all, and it's some other medical thing, but it most frequently happens when I'm my most emotionally drained, so I feel like there is a link, and I'm curious if anyone experiences this or knows an explanation for it.

The head feeling is really hard to describe, but I'll try my best. It's almost like the buzzed feeling of being high or drunk, but I'm completely sober and able to think clearly ( at a much slower pace though ). Another way to describe it is like my head is stuffed with cotton balls. Sometimes my vision blurs slightly, and I often dissociate while it's happening. I also have no energy, and often my mind is almost completely clear, which is weird, because usually my thoughts are racing and very reactive, even when I'm calm. It's like I'm sitting there lifeless almost, like I'm asleep while I'm awake. People will speak to me, and when I respond my voice will be devoid of emotion, or at least it sounds that way to me. I'll be driving when it happens and I'll suddenly be somewhere else without even realizing it.

Is this just dissociating? Am I just extremely tired (even if I slept a normal amount)? It honestly feels like my brain isn't getting enough circulation or something."

43,Hallucinating as a child?,"So when I was 4 I was in the bathtub taking a bath and then I got soap in my eyes. My vision blurred and I started crying but then I saw a hallucination, or whatever the fuck it was idk, I saw myself in the bathroom but with rocks as eyes. I don't know what it was I still don't. When I was 8 I heard screaming in my ear in the middle of the night. When I was 7 I saw something change before my own eyes when I was trying to sleep. I've heard music before and voices like ones but they were too mumbled to understand what they were saying. I'm NOT CRAZY. I'm tired of everyone telling me ""it was your imagination"" like noooo. I don't know what to do about it. I always thought it was no big deal. I didn't think much about it until I started to have paranoia and convince myself of crazy things. One time I woke up and started hearing a voice that said ""I miss you please don't go"" and weird shit. It was saying something about ""Statin"" whatever that is. I frequently have dreams where I'm raped or molested even though I've never been raped or molested before. It doesn't make any sense. I used to want to just leave my house and go on fantasy filled adventures. I even told myself I could do that once. But I know it can't . life is so damn boring ugh. I don't have hallucinations anymore and little paranoia. But it always comes back. I want SO BADLLY to just go on cool adventures and do cool shit. Why does life have to be so full and boring? I'm not doing anything. All I do is be depressed"
44,I think I might be in the warning stages for something, I haven't eaten more than once a day in months. And not usually much more than taco Bell or gas station food. I just haven't felt hungry. I've lost a lot of weight over the course of a year and I just read an article from the Cleveland clinic about how a flight or fight reflex can slow down you metabolism for a bit. And it's been a very stressful few months so I'm worried that I just keep doing it and I'm just never relaxed enough to eat. What if some of the things going wrong are just because I don't have enough energy left to have a conversation with my friends
45,People with anxiety: how do you handle phone calls?,"I’ve struggled with anxiety for just about a decade now. Over the past 3/4 years I’ve developed this extreme phobia of answering or making phone calls, even if it’s people I know or are very close with. I don’t know how to explain the feeling other than what feels like a wall closing off my vocal cords and a deep deep fear over what the conversation will be about.

This has obviously seriously affected my ability to be a functioning adult. I’ve been trying to find a new job (especially one in my field) for months now. I’ve had multiple phone/zoom interviews (thanks covid) but as much as I tried to instill some confidence in myself, I missed every single one. And I really hate myself for it. Same goes for needing to make both doctor and therapy appointments, and not many places around do online scheduling.

So I don’t really know what to do, I know I need to get help for this, but I genuinely cannot call a therapist or doctor and ask them for help.

Anyone else who feels this way or used to, how do you manage this? Or is there anyone resources anyone would be able to share. I feel like anyone I talk to about this always hits me with “oh just call it’s not hard!!!” so seriously any help would be appreciated!"
46,Do you usually blame yourself for not listening to your instincts before something bad happens?,"I am generally a very trusting and forgiving person and give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but there are moments when my instincts tell me I should not.

50,How do I tell a suicide vulnerable person that they're wrong?,"I (18F) got a call from my cousin (18F) and she was crying because of a fight with a friend.

It was basically about how she felt frustrated about him blowing plans off to hang out with her and haven't been the best to respond to when it comes to hanging out.

But this guy is my friend too. I know him. He's just really busy, with work and tennis practice. I haven't hung out with him outside of school but the way she was explaining everything about what was going on with her and the friend didn't sound right at all.

So I talked to him and he explained where he was coming from. The way he explained what went down I could understand where she would get mad and the miscommunication literally went from 0 to 100.
He told me that she called him twice. Once last month. And today. And from the way she was saying things to him, he interpreted it as attitude for the lack of him hanging out with her. The way she was explaining herself was through a more understanding tone.

I've been best friends with my cousin since forever. It's really hard for me to talk to her sometimes because she's really sensitive to anything that doesn't align with her and she's also very head strong. I feel like she blew this way out of proportion and made him sound very antagonizing. The thoughts and concerns she expressed were too deep as well...

My cousin has depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, and OCD. She's in a vulnerable state and I just don't know how to help her out without her feeling like she's to blame. She has an issue with victimizing others and herself"
51,"Told someone I starved myself, they laughed in my face.","I told a staff member at a mental hospital I starved myself , he laughed in my face. I told my phsycitrist I thought I had OCD, he told me I didn't right away without giving a chance to explain why. My mom found a noose in my room and stole it without saying anything. She found my suicide note to. This is why I don't like to seek help. No one fucking cares."
52,More to let go finally.,"For all who reads these. Know your not alone and I’ve been to that dark side, and I know your strong enough to make it! (I’m on mobile so excuse mistakes)

So this is my father this time, he was a tough love person he believed in punishment in a way not slot of people understood. He wanted us to be able to take anything life threw at us physically and keep going. I know he meant well but he was harsh on me especially when it came to punishment, I remember anyone said anything to me grown man or someone my age he gave me two options I show them pain even if it meant breaking as many of there bones as I could or he did that to me. 

3 years later and I’m not a fighting person people tell me I look like a boxer but in reality only time I could hurt someone willingly is protect the weak. The scared. And females. All of which I have no boundary’s. But even tho I don’t wanna hurt anyone I still have that urge to hit someone and show them what I can when they even look at me. Over 100 fist fights in my life time at only 18 it was almost a daily thing before.

Yesterday a guy gave me a smug look, this dirty look and having my father breathing down my neck everyday even tho I haven’t seen him in two years just the scars he left on me I felt myself tense and all I could do was walk away. Now in my fathers eyes I’m a pussy a bitch but I felt proud of myself. My girlfriend the smile she gave me when I walked away from this random ass guy. It felt like I had won the lottery.

One of you told me to keep working out and I have been my anger is mellowing by the day! Now 6’4 230 pounds body fat 11% and I am working hard everyday saving for my girlfriend to start college soon and I wanna thank all of you who have helped me everyday. With every moment I control myself I feel rewarded and all of you should to. You all helped me dearly."
53,I’m so tired of my mental illnesses. I just can’t get better.,"
I’m so tired of being mentally ill. I don’t even like saying that because honestly I don’t even feel like it’s mental illness it always just feels like me not... being right.

I’m SO anxious about this internship and I just absolutely hate the idea of having it honestly?? I’ve already applied and I feel like I’m just... terrified???? I’m so worried that I’m not going to be able to perform well and that I’m just going to make mistakes. I hate having so much pressure hanging over my head and having responsibilities like this because it’s literally just a CONSTANT stressor.

I can’t get my sleep schedule together and barely have enough energy to get through the day as it is. Honestly I feel like just being alive is all I can handle and even that feels like too much sometimes. Keeping up with eating and sleeping and dealing with not feeling well ON TOP of everything else is just.... too much for me.

I’m on such an awful sleep schedule right now and keep napping during the day and it causes me to get literally nothing done. Which adds stress because the things I NEED to get done get pushed to the last second. And honestly everything else is so unfulfilling... nothing feels like it gets me excited to get out of bed. I’m rarely even really “wanting” to do something and if I ever do it’s usually more videos games or something unproductive like that.

I really thought I was going to have time to figure things out but I just don’t. Corona took that away from me. I thought I’d get out of school and then do everything I could to figure out why I constantly feel so unhappy and unfulfilled and incapable of everything — even tho my life honestly isn’t that bad. Like I shouldn’t feel this distressed and unhappy, but I just keep feeling this way. It’s been so discouraging because I’ve seen psychiatrists, a therapist, I’ve got diagnosed, and done everything you’re supposed to do! I ended up in the hospital freshman year for mental illness and I just feel like I’ve never gotten a break... I just pushed through farther by finding a major I could “manage” through. Not one I’d actually enjoy :/

I finally even got some downtime in between school and this internship it still wasn’t enough. I still just keep feeling so bad and making the people around me upset and just no one seems to understand or be able to help me in how desperately bad I want to change how I feel.
I already feel so behind and like I failure. I just don’t feel like I can keep up and I just feel stupid and incapable. 

I don’t ever want to do anything. I just sit in bed and scroll on my phone and smoke. I’ve tried not doing that, I don’t personally feel addicted or anything it’s just nothing else really seems to be fulfilling and everything else is so overwhelming. Everything just all feels irritating and difficult and I just don’t seem to like - get it?? I don’t get how to do things right and I’m at the point where I just kinda feel hopeless and not good enough and like I’m just constantly fighting my own brain to get it to work. Even the meds don’t help enough and have kinda just been making me sick. I can’t go anywhere or do anything because of corona and it’s literally not any different from my life prior to corona besides having school to do. Like I don’t do shit and don’t wanna do shit and just never feel good despite the fact I feel like I have so much I should be happy for. Like yeah I’d like to travel more n shit and there’s def stuff I feel like I want??? But even picturing myself doing that stuff is kinda scary... because I know how I’m gonna feel... my brain just doesn’t work and I have some expectation of how things should be based on comparing myself to others and how they seem to feel and live such fulfilling lives.

Tbh I’m just feeling... made wrong. And... I’m gonna keep doing what I’m doing. Killing myself isn’t an option. I just keep moving forward and dealing with it despite how I feel and how much I fail and make others unhappy. I just keep tying people to myself for them to realize I’m not a very good person to be around. People seem to count on me and believe in me, even if I don’t believe in myself. I just wish I felt happy and normal and like life isn’t so stressful and impossible. I don’t even know what I’m searching for to feel or what. I just know I feel like I’m doing every single little tiny thing wrong and feel guilty for literally everything. I’m scared for what’s next honestly. I think I can at least get through this internship, but idk I don’t feel like I’m fit for society or to be able to function in the real world. Even if I was out of it and in my maladaptive daydream Montana meadows taking care of cows and chickens and vibing in a little ranch house with enough money to not be stressed and being away from society.... I don’t know... even if I was there.. would I be able to be happy? Or would I feel just as guilty and unfulfilled as I do now? 

I feel like I’m being a perfectionist in my own life and being in the process of it is so uncomfortable feeling so wrong and out of place. I don’t even know what I can do. I have to get a job and the only thing I have is design. I don’t really have any other experience or skills. I just feel kinda trapped in my own brain and in my own situation. Like I just moved to a new apartment with a nice view, I have a bf, and cool cats and shit. Like I should be happy?? I should feel lucky and more grateful?? And I am grateful! But I just can’t seem to make myself enjoy... life itself. 

I honestly feel kinda hopeless about getting better. Bad things are coming. The US is burning and my parents are out working in a pandemic and I’m just sitting here draining financially while my brain is just trying to kill me and ruin things. And the saddest part is that that’s still me :( I’m still the one feeling this way and making these decisions. This is me. This is how I’m living my life. I want to feel differently, but I just... can’t."
54,Help identifying psychological pain symptom,"Hi all,

I have a question about a specific symptom that I'm hoping someone can help me identify. If this is the place for this, or if you think I'd get better results elsewhere, feel free to point me in the right direction.

My wife has experienced intense psychological pain for years. It seems to be tied to physical things, such as it getting much worse for weeks a couple times that she's eaten bread (she doesn't have celiac disease, but does appear to have a sensitivity to gliadin according to one test) or when she stays up late. She's made some guesses as to its cause, but they only have loose evidence and for now I'd like to hear if this sounds like anything anyone is familiar with without influencing what people think.

She describes it as the closest thing to hell she can imagine experiencing. She feels it nearly constantly, but can distract herself with TV or something during the day, but at night when she tries to sleep (and sometimes when it's bad enough during the day that she can't ignore it), she sometimes cries for hours and wishes her life would end...

Let me know if I can provide any other details that would help. I know I haven't provided a lot but that's mostly because we don't know much. She is going to discuss this with her psychiatrist at an appointment in two weeks, but she's had a sharp decline the last few days and it would really help her to know if anyone else has experienced this...

Thanks in advance for any way you can help."
55,Am I experiencing anything abnormal?,"Hi there. My past two therapists have presumed I have anxiety and depression, and I trust that to be true, but I wanted to ask about a common symptom I have.

Does anyone else get Day Nightmares, where you sort of just freeze and start imagining terrible things happening to you? Scenarios that just feel very real in your head, and you struggle to snap out of it?

What are they? Are they in any way normal with anxiety?"
56,everything’s at rock bottom. what do I do?,"honestly I’m such a fucking mess right now. my depression is probably the worst it’s been, I’m very suicidal and SH regularly, my anxiety is so incredibly bad that just being conscience is painful, not to mention my terrible social anxiety. I have such bad insomnia and I keep having tactile hallucinations. my ADHD is also raging and I think I’m on the brink of having a psychotic break. I’m having anxiety and panic attacks almost every night. there’s probably more problems too that I might not know about. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never been this miserable. I just so sick of everything, I hate life so so so much. 

I don’t know what steps to take. Right now I have a few options. 
1. kill myself. I know no one on this sub is going to advocate for this but it would honestly be so refreshing and relieving for me and looks like the best method so far. if only I had a good method of doing it. though I’m not super keen on this method anymore bc I think my mom found out I was SH and now she’s being unusually nice to me and she was half the reason I wanted to die bfore so idk. 

2. Running away. This would solve a lot of my problems. School, friends/keeping up a social eyes, not having people around to judge me, toxic family, toxic town, all expectations... etc. problem is, this would present a whole new amount of problems like not being found, food, housing, water. I could be assaulted, kidnapped or trafficked. Not to mention it’s probably not the best idea during COVID rn. The downsides are as bad as the upsides I think so it’s not that great of an option. 

3. Psych ward. This is an option I’m barely considering bc I do not want to go to a psych ward at all. I think that would just make me super suicidal. I hate being forced into routines, having my personal space invaded and being watched over 24/7. I hate when my freedom to do things and go places are limited. 

4. Therapy? This is probably the one that most of you will advocate for but this is probably another one that I hate. I’m really bad at expressing my problems. I saw some posts on the other subs a few days ago and I genuinely didn’t know that ppl told therapists about SH and suicidal thoughts. I’ve always thought that in therapy you just sugarcoat things and lie so no one worries. I’ve never told a single person about any of my problems before. My social anxiety definitely plays a part in that. Plus, the one time I told someone I had depression, they laughed it off despite supporting my other friend who also had depression. I’m really used to no one (friends and family) caring about my mental health. I’m so used to being the friend that comforts other ppl and acts ok all the time. Also I don’t see how therapy like once a week will help.

So looking at all my options, yea kms seems like the best option. I need advice on what other options there are. I’m not looking to die just for the sake of dying. I just want all this to stop. I just don’t want to live like this anymore. If there were other options, I’d probably take them but right now I just can’t find any. I’m really just sick of my life."
57,what is therapy like?,"If y’all feel comfortable, would y’all mind telling me what your therapy experience was like and what your main problems were for you to go to therapy?"
58,How do you know if you're depressed?,"I'm sad, but also angry. I haven't felt true, genuine joy in ages, Sure I smile and laugh, but it's so no one bothers me, all I feel is just anger and sadness. Yesterday, I took the razor from a pencil sharpener and cut the tip of my finger, Ik thats not much but that usually leads to much darker things. I don't want to be sad or angry but thats I seem to get. I no longer wish to be around any one, I just wish to be alone, I often have very sad thoughts and thoughts about hurting others. I never speak of this to anyone, but since you all are just strangers on the internet, I don't care really care if you judge me. I don't want to be seen as a crazy person, but that's all I feel..."
59,"Psychologist said I might likely have Anti-Social Personality Disorder, further testing is needed at this time; may I have some first-hand experiences from people dealing with this condition, or people that know someone that has it?","As I said, my psychologist said I might very likely have this, and it might correlate with/be a cause of my Bipolar Depression, but that she has to work with me with some extra tests and exercises until she’s certain, anyways, I would like to see some first hand experiences and opinions about this matter. Thank you in advance!"
60,I’m really angry at how the make mental disorders glamorous,"Recently there was a guy who said some really racist comments to another man. Later, he used to defend himself his mental disorder, stating that, although in treatment and stable, he suffered an attack and acted like all those disgusting actions are due to his sickness (after, a psychiatrist declared he was not having a attack and therefore should not use that as an excuse). Anyways, I still feel terrible, since it’s of this kind of people I don’t trust anyone to tell I have bipolar disorder. On another case, I had (past) a friend who would call herself depressed, even though she was not (she attended a psychologist and they told her she was perfectly fine, and I know this because she made me go with her). When I was diagnosed, she turned her back on me and kept blaming everything I did on my disorder, even though I was stable. After that I was not stable anymore, and I suffered a lot, since she was one of my four friends. When I changed schools, I met this wonderful girl who embraced me as I was and never blamed anything on my disorder, except when I wasn’t medicated, of course. Last, but not least, I see a lot of men blaming their wives, who are victim of domestic violence, and saying that they are “crazy” and “bipolar”. This is really, really awful for me, and every time I hear it, makes me feel awful. I feel wrong, like I shouldn’t exist as I am and I can’t trust anyone anymore to talk about my disorder.
I feel like media, and principally movies and tv shows normalize and romanticize disorders too much.
Sorry to vent, but it’s been bothering me for a while."

62,Is it normal to feel guilty for no reason all the time? Like I feel guilty for being alive.,I don’t understand it. And it hurts.
63,"I don't know if my ""bad feelings"" are normal and if they actually warrant a visit to a therapist.","Info: I am a student. I have been having these self loathing thoughts for more than 6 years now. They decreased than before, so I thought they are going away. But I am not sure.

I've been lately observing that I get these ""episodes"" of sadness and self loathing and it's usually a trigger of some kind. I have had these feelings for a while now. The trigger can be as small as me not being able to solve a problem. Sometimes the same trigger or something even worse (like being rejected for a job) does nothing to me.

And sometimes these feelings come back without any triggers, when I have some free time and I'm left to my own thoughts. I used to chalk it up to as one of the episodes. But lately I have been doubting that maybe I just am distracted the rest of the day from these thoughts. Either that, or I have just blocked a part of my brain and have become numb to it. Basically, my default has maybe changed to having literally no opinion of myself from self loathing. And I have been counting that as a good thing but I am not sure anymore.

So, I was thinking, is me having these feelings a normal thing? I have never actually talked to anyone about this and I don't know if people are actually happy all the time and love themselves all the time. And does this actually warrant for a visit to a therapist? Or should I be doing something on my own?

Thank you."

Because we can’t commit him until he makes a threat. I could really use coke guidance."
65,You could probably fill out a worksheet of all my converging mental illnesses. Ive been getting better though. Need perspective on something.,"I go to work, I do my job, I'm quiet, and if all goes well I go home without any hassles. No one ever complains about my ethic.. The quality of the work.. Etc.. It's just done right every time. I'm not very social. But recently I've been involved in group projects. That's where everything started going wrong. There's this lady, let's call her Tammy, that is really obsessive about the process and order of the work. I am perfectly fine and productive outside of her, but she feels the need to nitpick every little thing I do and talk down to me when I give insight. I'm really insecure. She thinks I'm an idiot. Maybe I'm socially retarded. I've been withdrawn for a long time, so it's hard for me to react to people appropriately in conversation. She sort of starting spreading roomers about me to everyone. On top of this.. During the course of several group meetings, this girl has started flirting with me. I reciprocate it... Because well.. Why not. But it turns out that there is another guy in the office that is really obsessed with her. To the point he will lurk in our work area. He also says bad things about me. Calls me an idiot to other people, jokes about my personality etc.. Now I'm getting noticed by more people than I'm comfortable with. I'm being subjected to a lot of judgement and hate. Its making me fall apart. I don't know what to do. I feel like I have good intentions and good will towards others but the people around me want to see me suffer. I feel horrible going to work. I don't really want to see anyone anymore. This happened before. I saved a lot of money and quit my job and just sat in my apartment for a long time. Until I went broke. I feel like it's happening again. I don't know how to cope with it. I feel powerless in all of this. Like allowing others to see me has opened me up to some kind of vicious infection of the mind. I know this stuff sounds ridiculous. But I really just want to quit my job and hide from the world. I don't know. Sorry."

I've tried to explain these fantasies to Psych people and they find it confusing I call it ""false memories"" but it's not quite like a delusion because I don't fully believe in it but I question it. I find ways to justify why I may have forgot like someone slipped me acid or other drugs and this is a flashback which justifies my paranoia.

72,Feeling like you’re dying after depression,"I (25m) have a question that I’m looking for your experience and guidance.
After you came out of your deepest depression, or bear your depression, or something similar, did you ever feel like “sick” or unwell, or have an impending sense of doom or lurking death, or have like a domino effect (affect?) of things like “going wrong” with your body?

**Think Zuko in Ba-Sing-Se**

I’m can say that I’ve definitely beat my lifelong depression, and now that I don’t want to die or hate waking up every morning, I’ve noticed other things about myself.
Like I have way more anxiety attacks than I ever did when I was depressed. It bugs me though because why now? Being at this point of figuring out how to actually be happy alone, and being more open to being myself (as a straight white guy but you know what I mean, like accepting and being okay with my existence) with no regard to how others could negatively perceive me either physically or mentally.

I had a physical a week and a half ago and my blood work was 100% normal, my urine sample was hydrated and clean, blood pressure was spot on. Ekg came back with an irregular beat (just one) so I’m going to get a 2D Echo for it next month, but even my family/friends in the medical field primarily believe it’s caused by some sort of subconscious anxiety that I’m not even positive I’m feeling until I’m getting heart attack symptoms (it’s not always this bad, but it gets there sometimes and it got there tonight), you know?

I just want to hear about your experience with possibly a similar situation to bring some reassurance that could possibly help ease my mind.

Thank you, kind strangers."
73,Why is sexual attraction normal?,Yeah we’re sexual beings but why?
74,What is going on with my brain?!?,"Just wondering if anyone here has experienced something similar and hopefully you have either some tips an idea of what’s is going on. 

For the past two years about I’ve been dealing with a bit of a personality change. I don’t know how to describe it but I don’t feel like myself at all. Like it’s almost like I’ve lost who I was before and all I’m doing now is my best imitation of what I used to be like. Anyways, now all I feel like doing is staying in bed and just like staring at a wall or some other lifeless object and just zoning on. Like just not there at all. When I’m around people I no longer take pleasure in conversation. When I hangout with my best friends it’s not fun it’s just blah. Like there is nothing going on. Then I have to ask myself what I would usually say or joke about or suggest when I’m around them but there is no feeling to it. You know that feeling you get when you listen to your favorite song, or when you kiss or hug someone you really love, or when you do something you really enjoy. That’s all gone or like really diminished. Like all my emotions are sort of blunted if you will.

Also for some reason I’ve gained a taste for alcohol. I would rarely drink before the onset of these symptoms and I would go years without ever craving a drink. There were times back when I was myself where I would try to force down a cold beer just so I could you know try and enjoy it at the end of the day but I literally couldn’t. I found drinking alcohol completely repugnant. Like it was literally impossible to drink at ALL. Now for some reason I feel myself craving a drink after the day or like drinking more than I usually would. 

The odd part is that all of this gets much worse when I take antidepressants. Including the drinking. I literally feel like dead already even though I’m not. Like I’m not really there or not alive. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this? I know there is a word for it because I feel like the lack of enjoyment, pleasure, the blunted emotions, the feeling like I’m not alive, and the drinking are all very related. I’m positive someone else out there deals with this and I would like to hear what everyone else’s opinion is? Also giving me a word to this would be great. I need to ask my doctor about this the next chance I get. Also this happened around the time I had a few suicide attempts through overdosing and while I was on a lot of meds.

I’m so worried my brain won’t be the same and that I’ll die literally never being...well actually alive. Just dead."
75,can you be depressed without feeling sadness?,[removed]
76,could i have an anxiety disorder,i dont have the same problems anymore because ive moved to a less stressfull school and because of quarantine. last year i was constantly anxious in school. i couldn't talk to people properly. when i didnt know what to say i just froze. i felt sick i was sweating and went red. my mind was racing and i felt like everyone was looking at me and what they were thinking of me. i was self conscious about eating in front of people so i never ate i just sat in the canteen waiting for me friend to finish. i usually felt sick and a few times i talked. it was really fast talking. people stared at me because i talked really fast and couldnt stop. my hands looked terrible so i was self conscious of that too and covered them with my sleeves. i have a people hierarchy. i am inferior to everyone. everyone is better than me so i always put my head down and looked at the floor. when i was put on pressure i couldnt do anything or ask for help. writing was difficult and i would spend 30 minutes feeling sick and other stuff just worrying about how i havent written anything because nothing is good enough. i think my feelings are pathetic. i tried talking to people about my other problems but it makes me feel terrible and pathetic. i didnt feel the same in my new school but i felt pathetic about my feelings and because the school cared more about mental health there was less pressure. ive been thinmkng for about a year that maybe i have an anxiety disorder.
77,My mental mood swings throughout this Quarantine.,"I'll try to give a timeline to help

March through April-  I'm 16, Got notified that there would be no more school due to someone contracting COVID at our school. Life felt good and I thought I had a necessary break from it all.

&amp;#x200B;

May-June - Isolation has taken a severe toll on me. My physical appearance began severely deteriorating, I went from clear skin to moderate-severe acne and I haven't had a hair cut in 6 months. I began using milk jugs in my room so that I could piss in them because I was so terrified to look at my own face in the bathroom mirror, I kept repeating the same process everyday of watching \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and eating horrid while using social media 24/7. I really fell out of contact with my family it's fucking insane, I've always been quite anti-social but now my social skills became worse, I give second thoughts to every decision I do in front of someone. It's sad, I've tried to commit suicide through this period twice, I've done many drugs and I regret it. 

&amp;#x200B;

July-Present- At the start of July I got a well-paying job! And ever since then my mental state is slowly but surely improving. I would not say I'm happy but I lost that nihilist mindset I had previously. But honestly, I just want to feel how I felt when I was younger (13-14) I remember being in this same exact position during the summer when I was that age, I was losing weight and I felt fucking amazing doing it. I could do anything I want to cause I felt like I was on track with life.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously I would have thoughts about what a toxic person would say about me or if this girl will respond to my texts but I've cut them all off from my life and it's made me happier but I wish to have an even more improved mindset soon. 

I struggle with my thoughts about my weight, my acne, my skin color, and even my voice! I can't really find a mental escape in anything as I used to previously. When I was younger if I had a bad day I could load up something on PlayStation/pc or watch youtube. But now it just feels like filler to numb the pain of which is my existence. So may I ask, how can I extremely boost my self-confidence? And how can I improve my mindset on life?"
78,All this alone time and stress is bringing out trauma for me and I have no one to talk to.,"I feel like no matter how hard I try I hate myself because my life has been full of trauma and pain and I don’t feel like I can heal from it because I’m also depressed and have ocd/anxiety disorder. I’ve lost relationships and friendships over “being too sad to be around”. 

Particularly a few years ago I found my friend when he passed in his sleep... I think about this everyday and I can’t keep living under the weight of this pain. Most days I feel like not a real person I’m just this character that exists for other people. When I talk to my friends and family they just point out all the good things I have in my life which makes me feel like empty and worse. Usually end up apologizing if I ever bring up my trauma or depression."

80,encouragement to seek therapy??,"I'm sorry this is so long I just needed to vent. I had an anxiety attack (or what I think is one) after getting into an argument with my family. I genuinely felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown (I felt angry and frustrated, and I wanted to scream and break stuff but I just started laughing (as a coping mechanism????) and then crying instead), but someone calmed me down right before. My mom said I was acting like a psycho and to stop it (just great freakin advice). Then I just started crying which led to me hyperventilating for 30 minutes. I managed to calm myself down and started crying again right after. There have been really extreme points where my mental health has been awful, but I felt ok afterwards and didn't do anything about it. It's a recurring cycle of me being really down and unable to handle myself and my environment then being ok every few weeks. Because I keep going back to a neutral/ok state it discourages me from seeking help. I manage to convince myself I'm ok/don't need help. Also if I've gone this long without help why should I seek help now??? I've wanted to go to therapy but I'm scared it'll be weird and I'm nervous especially because there's a stigma around talking about your issues. I genuinely want to know what's wrong with me and I have a few ideas (adhd/general anxiety/something else), but I'm just scared. On top of that, my semester starts soon so I feel like that's going to put me in a mode where I'm super work focused and neglectful of myself so I'm worried.

My last therapist was through the school and she was awful, which put me off to the idea of therapy. But right now, I think I might need it, because at this point I have no idea what else to do. It’s hard for me to express myself and I minimize my feelings, which makes it hard for a therapist to understand what I’m going through. For 8 months now I’ve been self harming regularly and I’ve had suicidal ideation and thoughts. I want to ask for help from my parents, but very thing is so complicated and it feels like no one cares. It’s embarrassing to be this way and I don’t want to upset them. Has anyone been in this situation and have any advice on how to ask for therapy?"
86,I feel empty,"

I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."

i don’t care. i literally cannot bring myself to give a fuck about anyone but my best friends (outside of familial relations of course). i find no relationships worth pursuing as they’d all turn out to be fruitless in the end. i feel the urge to isolate myself from the rest of the world bc its just not worth putting time and effort into keeping relationships where i feel i gain no direct benefit. my 3 best friends are truly the only thing that really matters to me. all of my other friends, acquaintances, etc. couldn’t mean less to me. i wouldn’t shed a single tear if they died. i find myself wondering sometimes if it’d be worth it to just drop all of my current friends and keep to myself more often rather than socialize with everyone on the block as the natural extrovert i am. i see it increasingly difficult to distinguish whether i truly feel comfortable or not in the presence of those i deem friends, as the line grows blurrier as time passes. i haven’t felt depressed in a while. in fact, i’d say recently, in these past few months, i’ve been the happiest i’ve felt since elementary school. i get so incredibly annoyed with people even speaking to me; why talk if you have nothing substantial to give me or contribute to the conversation? why speak if your tongue is branded with the lies of the crowd? im seeking out opinions because i want to know if this is a common feeling, or if there’s any explanation for why i feel the way i do. thank you."
93,i wanna die,i literally can’t see myself after high school or anything i’m probs gonna be dead
94,How do I learn to trust my partner depsite his intrusive thoughts?,[removed]
95,Just venting...,"I've wanted to kill myself for a while now (4 years) and just want to talk openly about how I feel about stuff.
I do speak to my best friend about this stuff but she also has similar issues. I feel like shit when at home, because of my brother making a big deal about everything making my mum put a lot more than a fair share of work into me, and at school because I often get bullied about who I hang out with and some times about remarks teachers say (my most recent example is I had my shirts untucked and my teacher said ""tuck your shirt in. You shouldn't need your mummy to dress you in the morning."")
I don't know what to do because I want to ask for help from the school or something but it's so embarrassing and my mum already has a lot to deal with.
That's all I have to say for now but I will probably be on the subreddit again because I think it will help a lot. Its reasons like these that make reddit the superior social media.
Thanks for know."
96,How To Cope?,"Not going to go in depth, but how do you go about coping with things? Like feeling overwhelmed, really sad or mad, or just anxious. I don't like the *5-4-3-2-1 things* trick; in the moment it feels silly. Anyone have anything useful? Thanks!"
97,Why is mental health help so unbelievably difficult to get?!,"I’m getting rejected left and right either because the pandemic has made it so offices aren’t taking new patients or they don’t accept Medicaid. Like fuck me for being poor enough to need assistance and for mentally crumbling during an outbreak, right?! I hate this shit. Like I’m just not functioning. I either can’t sleep at all or do nothing but sleep, I lock myself away to sob periodically, I can’t clean, I’m practically catatonic at work, what the fuck am I supposed to do?! Ughhhhh"
98,Paranoia at night,"Its ridiculous that I'm paranoid. I'm pretty sure I have a fear of bugs but specifically roaches. Where I live, it's currently the hottest part of the year, where we start seeing them more frequently. I usually get a panic attack when I see one. I've woken up to them on me before and I'm always paranoid that's going to happen again. What's even more ridiculous is the fact that I dont see them THAT often. Maybe once a week. But I'm still paranoid everywhere I go in my house that there will be a roach. I'll be up late at night because I cant get comfortable for being worried about bugs. Does anyone have any advice for how to try to distract myself? I have a hard time doing things like watching youtube because I have ADHD and I'll end up staying up until 4:30 like I am right now. If anyone has any tips that'd be fantastic"
99,My thoughts are very odd,"Has anybody had similar experiences?
Just for some contest I have had depression-like episodes and mania-like ones and psychotic symptoms, but I’ve never been properly diagnosed, it has only been suggested that I might have bipolar.
So... my thoughts are pretty weird. Aside from delusional thoughts, they are just weird in general.
Often my brain forms random thoughts that I feel like weren’t made by me, but they are in my own voice. They are so random and the sentences don’t even make logical sense. Or sometimes they do but I feel like I didn’t think those things and the thoughts somehow appeared in my head. 
Also my brain can generate these random thoughts but using the voices of my friends and family.
Other times I can’t think in my own normal voice anymore but my brain forces me to think in the voice of a friend or family member and I can’t stop that.
It also happens that my brain gets stuck and I find myself involuntarily repeating a thought over and over in my head.
Also when I walk I can’t help but think on beat to my steps and I can’t think in a normal fluent rhythm, but I stop bit by bit and wait for the next step.
Why do you think this happens? Does it happen to anybody else?"
100,I'm doing really bad tonight,"My head is spinning. I'm hearing so much noise in my brain right now. I'm feeling so high right now and I don't know why. 

I feel like I'm not me. All I want is hugs and candy :c"
101,Do these things seem real/ worth seeing a therapist over?,"I’m posting this on mobile so sorry if formatting is strange. Also, this might get kind of long so sorry for that too. I am 19F and for a while I’ve been considering seeing a therapist but I seem to have some kind of imposter syndrome when it comes to mental health. I guess I am just looking for reassurance that these things are not normal before I reach out because I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. I have close friends who struggle with severe anxiety and depression and next to them I feel like my issues aren’t real.

I’d say I am pretty self aware and I do lots of research about things I feel/ experience but I have never been diagnosed with anything. For the sake of this post I will use terms of things I am skeptical of having but nothing is confirmed. Based on what I’ve read I think I have BDD and hypochondria.

About BDD: For the past 6 or so years I have been extremely insecure and nothing anyone says will ease it. I hyper focus on the smallest most random aspects of my physical appearance and think it’s all anyone can see when they look at me. When friends and family tell me otherwise I assume they’re lying. I have spent large amounts of money to “fix” these flaws but am never satisfied. I know it’s ridiculous but I also can’t help it. I can’t remember a day in my life where I wasn’t concerned about how I look or about what others thought. I often cry and feel disgusting/ worthless due to my appearance.

About hypochondria: I don’t remember how long I’ve been anxious about my health but I know it has recently gotten worse. I have convinced myself that I have deadly illnesses on multiple occasions within the past year to the point of panic attacks or almost driving myself to the hospital. It is terrifying genuinely thinking you’re on the brink of death. Examples of things I’ve convinced myself of having is heart attacks, appendicitis, and cancer.

I also have this thing I’ve done since childhood that I like to call opposite hoarding. The “scientific” name is compulsive decluttering. Extra clutter stresses me out so much, I can’t even look at it. As a kid I would put tons of my possessions in trash bags for my mom to give away. I regret it because now I have literally nothing from when I was a child. People seem to view being minimalistic as a “good” thing but this is definitely to the extreme. I still do it all the time and will throw away perfectly good items just to feel some relief.

All of the things I mentioned have been linked to OCD but I am pretty sure I don’t have OCD, however my mom had it as a child. Overall, I have a very worst case scenario mindset and am constantly stressed out and worried about multiple things at once. I overthink everything and I can never feel relaxed, it’s like my mind is stuck on 110%. I think I might have generalized anxiety but I am not sure because I lack physical symptoms. I was very socially anxious in high school but I seem to be getting better about it now that I am in college. 

I know everyone can benefit from therapy but it is expensive so I am trying to gauge if it’s worth it. These things interfere with my life but I can still function school and work wise. If you read all of this, thank you! I appreciate any feedback."
102,Ughhhhh,"I experience the highest highs. I get so happy and excited, I have a hard time sleeping. I buy stuff. I obsess over subjects. I invest time into researching. I learn everything I can for a couple days. I make plans with friends and talk to strangers. I clean, I cook. Life is good, it’s smooth and easy. I’m -16 year old girl in love with a boy, fall back on your bed and sigh deeply- good. That kind of good when you want to stop smiling but your lips keep tugging up and you can’t stop. Laughing at my own jokes, content. I feel like me. This won’t ever end I love life and that’s it! Peace. Kindness. Everything is awesome. 

Then, in a moment it’s gone. My positive outlook that colored everything sunny and fun turns gray. I get overwhelmed. I’m tired, unmotivated. My house gets dirty. I forget about plans I make, or I cancel them. I forget to respond to texts and emails. I cry about stuff I can’t control like my mom getting older or times when I have to leave my dog alone. My chest has a near constant ache, like a boot filled with metal is pressing on my chest. I feel hopeless. Life is pointless.  Everything is bad. Anything that can go wrong does. 

I don’t think I’m bipolar because I’m not a risk taker. I would like to believe my happy side is just normal. But the low swings just kill me something. Should I go to the doctor or go to a counselor? Do I need meds? I feel like I’m in physical pain from the pure stress, anxiety, sadness I feel. Will this ever stop? Why can’t I just be happy"
103,I feel bad but I need someone to talk to. I feel guilty about writing certain things and I need to get it off of my chest. (18+ please),Ugh maybe someone can help me. I just need a good listener. I highly highly doubt if you’re reading this that you’ll want to listen to me because it’s very strange.
104,Mean and Rude People Make Me Depressed,"I really hate the way everyone keeps treating me. I get so down that I can’t even function or get out of bed. I’ve got shit to do and I’m not suicidal but sometimes I wear my heart on my sleeve and people use it as their punching bag...or so it seems. 

About an hour ago, I shared a link on the Coronavirus subreddit asking a question about the data and  everyone seems to be rude to me. It feels like I’m being silenced as all my comment reply’s get downvoted so much.

I don’t want to die but I wish someone would just kill me already."
105,Why do I hit myself when angry,"Toxic relationship and crazy family shit for a while has made me so frustrated lately. (I know I should leave a toxic relationship - plz don’t - I just can’t) but whenever my bf fucks with me and I have a problem with it and start to confront him, he just ghosts me and doesn’t respond. 
I go fucking crazy trying to be calm, I can’t do anything, I just sit here and in an outburst I hit myself in the head, I slap myself, pull my hair, hit myself with whatever is infront of me...a lot of the time it’s unconscious it just feels like an outburst. Why? Is this normal

He then lies and makes some excuse that I know is a lie because he messes up the story and contradicts himself. My night ruined. I can’t focus on anything else, I just wanna block him on everything but I know tomorrow I’ll love him and miss him again. Help me 

I"
106,I’ve (15M) just felt a lot worse lately,[removed]
107,Why am I like this,"There are so many things wrong with me that I don’t even know where to begin. I guess one thing that’s been on my mind a lot is that I have no self worth, like, at all. I just don’t think I deserve anything and it will range from me almost crying when someone says they care about me, to me almost not eating because I don’t think I deserve food. And honestly, I don’t think I’m wrong at all. I really don’t deserve food, kindness, love, compassion, or the amazing life I’ve been given. I’m nothing but a failure who constantly messes things up due to my lack of confidence and social skills. And then don’t even get me started on my inability to get a decent amount of sleep. 

I just want one night of decent sleep. Is it really so much to ask for? Well whatever kind of higher being exists; God, Ganon, Jesus, Sothis, the Greek gods, Shrek, the Roman gods, any deities, the Goddess Hylia, etc. apparently thinks so because I have yet to get more than 7 hours of sleep (on a good day) in over two years. It’s not only taking a toll on my mental health, but my physical health as well. I’m pretty certain I’m slowly dying, but eh, death is probably better than this god forsaken world we are all forced to live on."

111,Need help helping others,"Hello so I was wondering what the best way to going around helping those online. I am in a guild on an online game. This game is such an escape for a lot of young men. We help a lot of people in game however I want to take it to the next level and try to help people IRL as well. However i need guidance, I have some experience with helping people get the help they need from the military, I always had 1 service member in my room late at night talking to me about dark stuff going on in there minds. Not only that I have dealt with my own mental illness questions on my own. However, I don't know how to transfer what I know to help those in the game. Could someone give me some guidance?

Thank you for your time.

TLDR; I need guidance helping people with mental illness online in a game, I have some IRL experience helping people like this, I myself had suffered from mental illness as well."
112,I know how to be not miserable but i cant get there,"I realised that my miserable pathetic self is not the end of the world and that patience and some work will help me.

But for some reason i can't keep my head off of what i dont have right now
I just wanna be able to relax my mind and focus on the little steps i have to do.

I wanna be able to focus on getting discipline and live in the moment

Why is that?
Is there anyway to get rid of that feeling"
113,went for a mental health check appointment,"alright so backstory, my mental health was absolute shit and decided; maybe i want to see a therapist.

my friend told me about this mental health service where they do free mental health checks, basically asking you questions on your mental health and if they notice any concerns, they can refer you to a therapist/counsellor/(doctor on more serious terms).

here's the thing, i finished the appointment earlier today and she said something along the lines of ""it seems to me that you are going through depression"" and ""have been dealing with it for a while (a few years) even if it just gradually started coming up, and not all at once"" and long story short, i'm possibly going for therapy/counselling services soon.

it's just. i'm not sure? what she meant by ""going through depression""? i told her, and she acknowledged, that lately my mental health has been on and off, but i've recovered from a 7 month void (which. i guess was my depressive episode?) so i guess in that sense i'm not really going through it right now? but i've told her that i'm scared because there's a possibility of my mental health going down again at any random time.

also the people from that service are ""qualified mental health professionals"".. does that mean i'm diagnosed with depression...? she never did any physical checks on me, just question analysis for at least an hour and a half (and previously, an hour). how does a diagnosis work bro i literally don't know.. do they just tell you ""you have depression"" or do they give you a paper or something 🤨 did she mean i have depression? she also said that bc of some of my answers, there may be other possible concerns (but they aren't as serious/severe as compared)

honestly i'm trying not to overthink it too much but i really need to know :/ i mean, it's possible for me to message her and clarify with her, since i do have to eventually update her on the referral for which therapy/counselling service i prefer... but for now please help me out D:"
114,"Taking multiple medications, is a bit scary! ADHD-Bipolar-Anxiety","Hey there, I'm not sure if I can put this here. But here it goes. I'm (25F) diagnosed with bipolar type 2, ADHD inattentive, and not really diagnosed but I suffer from anxiety as well. I'm not asking for advice on the medications I take, but if you have tried them I would appreciate your input on the matter. 

I take Lamotrigine and Arip + Ritalin for my bipolar and ADHD. I also sometimes take Diazepam or Clonazepam for sleep or anxiety. The medications have worked for me so far but I came back home (I was living abroad) and this whole Covid-19 happened and I didn't have access to any doctor.

Fast forward to the doctor I saw few days ago because my depression kinda is acting up sometimes and I can't get Ritalin without prescription. 

This new doctor has given me 3 new types of medications to add on. Lithium for depression, Atomoxetine for ADHD and Propranolol for anxiety.

I'm not planning to take all of them because it sounds crazy to me that I need to take 6-7 types of medications on daily basis. 
Is it me or does this sound crazy? I know people with multiple disorders need multiple medications and that's why I was taking 3-4. But 6 is just crazy. Am I over reacting? Is this sound? Does anyone else take this many medications as well?"

116,I don't feel like I should have problems,"I can trace the root of a certain issue back to a middle school relationship, and I feel like an idiot because of it. But I spent months just trying to be what my girlfriend wanted. I wanted nothing but to make her happy. And at the end she told me that she never really loved me. That shouldn't have bothered me, it was fucking middle school after all, but it felt like a betrayel. I know I was annoying, I get it. I wouldn't want to have dated me either. But my one friend who I thought would never lie to me and always be there for me broke my trust. And I literally can not get close with a single person. I have one friend but there's things that even she doesn't know about it. Every other relationship is surface level at most. And I feel like an idiot bc it was a middle school relationship. There's so many people with actual problems and then there's me. I shouldn't be throwing myself a pity party over how lonely I am. I don't deserve to be sad when there's people with legitimate reasons to feel so."
117,fkn tired,"i just feel pretty fucked right now. i just want to sleep all the time. i just don’t see the point of any of it anymore, i don’t remember what fun is and everything just seems so fucking meaningless. it’s not like i’m not trying, i’ve quit drinking since february, i eat enough, pretty healthy stuff too, i work out every single day, even take fucking vitamins everyday, all the stereotypical self-help shit but it doesn’t really make a fucking difference. it felt like it was for a while and i thought i was getting better but for no reason at all i’ve just completely deteriorated over the past couple days. 

i’m almost always depressed and when i’m not depressed i’m just irreconcilably angry, like so angry i wanna slam my head into a concrete wall at full velocity, or the type of angry where i’m constantly imagining and almost craving the feeling of being shot (not sure that’s very relatable but it’s a pretty constant thought when i’m like that, also i’ve never actually been shot and don’t actually want to, i think it’s more the concept of sharp, burning pain seems appealing for some reason at the time, idk). 

at least i have energy when i’m angry, though.

i was at the gym today and every time i stopped moving to rest or something i just had this overwhelming, shell-shocked feeling. i don’t even know what could’ve caused it, like i’ve had a shitty past or whatever (who hasn’t?) but literally nothing’s happened recently that could’ve caused it.

i just constantly feel like there’s something inherently wrong with me and i don’t know how to fix it, i’ve tried multiple therapists but i honestly hated going and it never seemed to make anything better. i feel like i’m incapable of feeling loved by anyone. i feel worthless and disgusting and unwanted. i just really want to feel accepted by someone who actually knows me, but at the same time i’m so fucking angry at everything and everyone all the time that i don’t want anything to do with people.

I've seen doctors but they just tell me to have good diet and give some vitamin pills based on some tests but they don't seem to work. While i maintain an okay diet just like others in my family, they suggest I'm 'stressed'. I do overthink stuffs, and have social anxiety and a bit inferiority complex but no other mental illness. I perform well in my studies and have some go-to hobbies i enjoy very much, I'm hardly bored but yes i find myself spending hours starting at ceiling and imagining all sort of awful things and I can't withdraw from it because perhaps I enjoy it.

My only other shot at an outside job right now is doing art but I don't want to do art anymore because my heart is just not in it

I am looking into coding and mechanic apprenticeships now and possibly delivery driver work but some of these don't address the need to lose weight

125,There is something wrong with my head,"I feel like shit. I don't know why I keep ruining everything. Things have been going great lately with my best friend and I. But I keep overthinking things and making it all bad for myself. He is always there to help me out with my problems but I can't seem to get help for myself. We chat and everything is fine for a couple of days but then I over complicate things in my head, over think too many thoughts, wallow in my feelings too much and everything turns to shit. My only coping mechanism at the moment is to just cry about everything. There is no other way for me to let everything out except for when the tears flow. I get so mad at myself for being such a problem. I want to stop all these negative thoughts. But I think there's something wrong with me in the head. If I get too deep into everything, suicidal thoughts will surface. But I know I won't do anything to myself because I'm just too dumb to do anything. My best friend must really hate me, at least a small percentage even though he says he doesn't. I don't know how he deals with me all the time. I'm just a hot mess. I'm trash and I ruin everything good. Just right now, he was working on some stuff and I kept babbling and overcomplicating things, leading me to delete some social media apps in the rage of my emotions. I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with not being able to contact him. He's been my only pillar during these tough times of the pandemic. But I keep pushing him away. Again, because I'm trash. I feel like I'm a bother to him. Just stress on his shoulders that shouldn't even be there in the first place. Part of me wants to cut off contact with him completely so that I can stop being such a burden. But I have no ther friends that I can rely on. I don't want to push him and losing him is one of my greatest fears. I don't even know where I'm going with this post anymore. All I know is that I can't stop crying and I fucking hate myself."
126,Hi I’m already being treated for depression and social anxiety but I’ve noticed something recently and I don’t know what it means,"Whenever I hang out with friends, especially a large group of people, whenever I’m on my bus ride home or sometimes it can be the day after, I just feel so sad and numb inside. This usually happens every time I hang out with friends but I have no idea what it means. I’m trying to be more confident and social but I can’t because after I feel like shit so I just prefer to stay inside hidden. 
And sometimes it can be when I’m acc with my friends.  Like eg I went out with five other girls once and they were talking and I kinda went into my own bubble and couldn’t stop thinking abt things that have happened in the past and how I shouldn’t have even come with them. 
It’s really annoying but I have no idea what it means , does anyone have any ideas ?

130,Should I see a Psychiatrist?,"Hello!

I don't really want to retell my whole life story so I'll keep this one short. Please ask questions if you need more info. Here's why I think I should be seeing a psychiatrist.

* Mood swings
   * Sometimes, I can have mood swings - usually from happy to extreme sadness. It's annoying to say the least. It often builds up when I get a lot of good news/hopes over a few days, then one or more bad news. I'll usually only see the wrong side and start being really sad..
      * Example A: I've done an internship at a company and was told that I'd likely be hired when I graduate, but due to Covid that won't happen. I remember being sad as fuck for a whole week, not wanting to do anything and basically just thinking that my life was over and that I'd never get the job I wanted. It got better over the next weeks with the help of some friends.
      * Example B: Started Tinder lately, had several promising conversations that abruptly ended in ghosting. I started thinking that I'll never be able to date anyone (I'm 20) and will spend my life alone whilst most of my friends are in happy, long-term (3+ years) relationships.
* Overall lack of attention/Short attention span
   * I have a very short attention span and often fail to stay focused on a specific task for a long time. For instance in school I've never studied anything at home because I couldn't stand studying for more than 15 minutes in a row. It also happens in my day to day life: I can sometimes ignore people for a few seconds in the middle of a conversation just because I'm going to start thinking about something else. It's really annoying. Likewise, I can't think about something for more than a few seconds before getting intrusive thoughts that will break my concentration.
* I'm never in the mood for anything, even things I like.
   * I'm a programmer, and I have several personal projects going on, yet I rarely work on them these days. I haven't touched some in months, yet I'd still love to finish them. For instance right now I prefer to scroll reddit than start my IDE and work. Nothing's preventing me from doing it though - just very low motivation, and I usually can't focus on it for more than an hour. On the contrary, I sometimes have periods where I'll work on it for a full day non-stop with only bathroom breaks. I just wish to be able to work daily on them and actually like it (= avoid burning myself out).

That's about it. Do you think I should see a psychiatrist or would another psychologist be better?  
I just want to get some help someday. There is nothing urgent - I'm not on the verge of suicide, but I strongly believe that improving my focus and motivation would drastically improve my quality of life. Right now my parents are away for a few weeks (+ I got my driver's license recently) so it'd be the ideal time for me to see one.

I could start training seriously in some video games to get really good (e.g. CSGO/LoL), I could work on my projects everyday and produce something I can be proud of (that'd get me my dream job), or I could just be a better, friendlier human.

Thanks."

most of y'all normies need to find a purpose in life, stop complaining all the time, you have worth in your life, you're just operating in a dissociated druggy like mode. Get up and do something, you can do it.

After applying in January, I was supposed to get my work permit by March 2020. The pandemic started and I am still waiting for the immigration document. Under implied status of the application, I am allowed to stay and work till August 31st. I don't know what I am going to do if my visa doesn't come through before the end of the month.

This stress is killing me inside. I can't tell this to my parents in my home country, they will get stressed out. I can't return to my country as it's under lockdown. Since March, I have been working at my 20% productivity level, have been running regularly, eating cheap, trying to meditate with failure and watching porn more than usual (4 times a week).

I am tired, worried and losing my mind. I just want to be at peace."
136,I’m 28 years old and I’ll make lunch and start browsing reddit and then leave and completely forget I have dishes to clean. Could these perceived severe memory problems I’m having be caused by my smartphone?,I have spina bifida and have trouble concentrating at work. I put my phone on airplane mode at work and barely look at it anymore. Being distracted by my phone used to be a huge problem at work but I rarely got in trouble for it because my dad is my boss so he overlooked it I guess. My concentration is so bad that I think I have dementia. I read on the internet (not always accurate information) that early dementia is possible with spina bifida but I don’t have evidence that I have it. Doctors are skeptical about me having dementia because I’m 28 which I completely understand. I had a neuropsychological test that showed I have below average verbal memory. But I’m wondering if this is caused by my smartphone and I’m just not aware of it?
137,Reddit is bad for my mental health but I keep coming back,"I go through cycles of deleting my account, leaving Reddit for my mental health for a few months and then end up downloading it again and making a new account. I don't know why I do this. I don't particularly like Reddit but I get pulled back in every so often. 

I try and avoid subreddits I know will trigger me, but eventually I see them and it can be hard to just not click on them once you see an interesting post. 
It's just that whenever I leave a comment and someone replies in a nasty way, or is rude or hateful it genuinely makes me want to self harm, even over something small. It's strange because I haven't self harmed regularly in years, and I thought I was over it, but the majority of the time when I get the urge, it's because something or someone on Reddit has triggered me. So many people on here are so ready to be hurtful when they disagree with you. 

I'm always happier and mentally healthier off Reddit, and I notice a definite drop in my mental health whenever I download the app. My body confidence drops, I start genuinely hating myself and thinking I'm stupid, but whenever I need advice, or I'm looking for information or opinions on something, I always end up back here. 

No other website triggers me like this, and when I don't have Reddit in my life I rarely think of self harming."

141,Study abroad opportunity has been cancelled due to COVID. I feel devastated because it has been my dream and don't know how to process this,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I guess I just want to know if anyone here has had their dream or an opportunity taken away by something beyond their control? And what did you guys do to cope with it/come to terms with it?

Some background on my situtation. I just got word that my home uni is cancelling the program and resuming it presumably in 2022 (I would have graduated by then). I was set to study abroad next Spring semester so i've been really devastated and crushed. It was my only chance to experience it and it was taken away by something that I have no control over so I feel powerless. Many will say that there's still post-grad, traveling someday, etc, but let's be real there's no experience quite like studying abroad as an undergrad. Plus, it's harder to get into grad school.

It has been my dream for a long time. I have researched quite extensively, imagined studying/living abroad and experiencing all the things an exchange student would (traveling, socializing with diff people, independence, etc). I spent a lot of effort in the application process. A lot of the things I achieved in my uni (good grades, dean's list standing) were done in preparation for this moment. I feel gutted and heavy because all this planning and emotional investment have built up to this. COVID has taken away many opportunities for a lot of people and it sucks that this is what we've come to. 

I'm wondering if anyone is going through the same situation right now or have experienced having a good opportunity taken away, or a dream crushed by this pandemic or something totally out of their control. I don't know how to deal with this honestly. Need advice on how to move on or say goodbye to this dream. 

I can't talk to anyone about it in fear of being called shallow or told that some have it worse. Any help would be appreciated."
142,Can death be a form of abandonment?,I often get caught up in thoughts of my family and friends dying or something happening to them. Could an excess of this be described as some sort of fear of abandonment?
143,Different Steps To Improve Your Mental Well-Being,"There is evidence that suggest that there is a 5 step guide you can take to improve your very own mental health and well-being. Will they work? There’s only one way to find out. Try them! Trying these steps could help you feel much more positive within yourself and you’ll be able to get the most out fo your life by doing so. 

Firstly... **connect with others**. This can be family members, friends or even co-workers. Just by surrounding yourself with other people, you will feel less lonely. Good relationships with others is crucial and very important for your mental wellbeing. For example, by surrounding yourself with others, it helps you to build a sense of belonging and self-worth, it gives you a good opportunity to share past stories, positive stories. Lastly, it provides you with some well-earned emotional support, also gives you the opportunity to support others.  

This brings me to the point on how to build a stronger and closer relationships with others. Firstly, spend as much time of your day with the family. This can be watching TV, having some food or just a general chat. Not only will this build your relationship with them even more, but it will build your confidence. Secondly, after the pandemic is done and dusted (whenever that is), arrange a day out with your friends. Go for a walk? Play some sport? Go cycling? Go out for some food? Anything! :) Or you can go and have some lunch with your co-worker? Volunteer at the local hospital? Or, if you’re not comfortable enough to go outside, how about spending time with your friends or family over technology? Such as FaceTime, Skype, Zoom... it will keep you all connected together. 

Secondly... **be physically active**. Important! Being active is not only fantastic for your fitness and physical health. But past evidence has shown it to be great for your mental wellbeing by raising your self-esteem, it helps you by giving yourself a challenge or a specific goal to reach and achieve and it causes chemical changes in your brain which can help change your mood massively. But, understandably, when you’re in confident and self-esteem, you’re not able to put your running shoes on and go for a run within a few minutes, it takes more than that. Firstly, do some research, find out about getting started with exercising, what are the benefits of doing it. Next, when you understand the concept of exercising much better, research further and find free activities that can help you get fit. Not only running is the best to way to keep running, you can swim, cycle or even dance! When you feel ready, pick an activity to do and stick with it. The NHS have plenty of podcast on exercising such as their “Couch To 5K Podcast”. I highly recommend! 

Third on the list is... **learning brand new skills**. Research has shown that learning brand new skills can improve your mental wellbeing by boosting your own self-confidence and raises your self-esteem too, it helps you to build a sense of purpose and lastly, it helps you to connect with others better. Usually, many people have the same excuse when it comes to learning new things, such as “I don’t have enough time”, but there are different ways to bring learning into life. Here are some things you can try out TODAY!
- Try learning a new hobby that will challenge you. This can be a sport that you’ve never done before, writing a blog or learning to draw, paint or dance. 
- Work on your very own project. How about creating a brand new website? Or build a bike? Do some gardening? Or perhaps a DIY project? 
- Learn a new dish and cook it. Not only will you create a brand new dish, but you’ll eat it also. Yum!
- Learn a new subject at a local college or university. This can be a new language or a practical course such as plumbing or carpeting. 

4th on the list is.... **helping and giving others**. Personally, one of my favourite things to do. Helping and giving to others brings a joy to yourself as you feel like you’ve done something meaningful for someone. For example, if you’ve helped somebody on the stress or had a conversation with someone, you may not know, but that could be the nicest thing someone has done to that person for years. With brings me to my point, be kind to everyone, you have no idea what they could be going through. Share your smile and generosity with others. The act of kindness and giving to others creates a positive feeling and a sense of reward, it gives you the feeling or purpose and self-worth and most important, it helps you to connect with other people. It doesn’t matter how big or small your act is, it will make YOU feel better within yourself. A small act of kindness would consist of helping the elderly with shopping or a big act of kindness would be volunteering in the local community. Both are very powerful act of kindness. But, there are others things you can try:
- If someone has done something for you, don’t ignore their kindness. Re-pay them with a “Thank You” and a smile. 
- Spend time with family member or friend that are in need of emotional support. 
- Offering to help someone who is struggling on a particular project. 
- Volunteering in the community.

And lastly... **concentrate and pay attention to the present**. Paying attention to what’s happening today will help your mental wellbeing better than remembering what happened last year or the year before. Some people call this awareness “mindfulness”, which means that you enjoy life more and you’re able to understand yourself much better. This way of thinking can give you a positive way of life and how you’re able to approach different challenges.

144,I'm struggling with pathological lying and need help. Thank you.,"I've been lying so much for so long and I've been feeling nothing from it but only now is all the guilt and shame from the past 17 fucking years of my life making up so many different personas coming to me and I can't take it anymore. I know I need help and I want to get it but I can't imagine myself going to a psychiatrist or whatever a mental health doctor is called and admitting that I've built my whole life upon fake shit I don't even know why or how I came up with. I don't even know how I'm going to face my friends and loved ones and tell them whatever they know about me is false. No one's going to trust me anymore. Recently I got called out on a small lie by my close friend, and only then did I realise that I seriously fucked myself up. It was my first time getting called out, and at that moment the weight of all my lies came crashing down on me. I want to stop but I can't.   


I've been struggling with this for a week and I need advice on how to move forward. I've been thinking of stopping lying but not admitting to the shit I've fabricated in the past. I don't know what to do anymore. My whole life is fake. I'm overwhelmed."
145,Why am I active by evening and very lazy in the mornings?,"It's just these days. I tell myself to wake up early and start working asap. But I wake up late (10AM onwards) and with a sleep of over 8-9 hours and still feel very very tired.

And at work, I also don't feel like doing anything productive. I don't want to move from my sitting position even for water/food.

Never been so lazy my life so far. I am 30."
146,should i keep this friendship going?,"so i (21m) have this friend i used to work with, she’s literally the only person i’d consider as a friend (and i don’t really have any other people like family or anything either, something, something shitty past, call the fkn waambulance or whatever), anyway so she’s literally the only person who knows me on more than just a surface level, i’ve told her things i’ve never told and never would tell anyone else (and honestly, i mostly regret even telling her anything, only got there because one time i was really high and spilled a bunch of personal shit to her, as you do and that kinda opened the floodgates for me feeling sorta comfortable sharing stuff i normally wouldn’t, but again, that’s whatever). she seems to enjoy spending time with me at least occasionally and i’ve even gotten drunk texts from her about how she knows i struggle with liking myself but that she loves me because of how cool and funny and loyal i am (humble too, obviously), so she can clearly tolerate me to some extent. 

anyway, naturally my idiot monkey brain went ahead and caught feelings, shock horror. after keeping that suppressed for about six months, hoping the feelings would kindly fuck right off, i started to avoid her as a result, got gradually more and more depressed until eventually my depression culminated in me getting extremely fucked on vodka and antidepressants at a work event and my dumb idiot drunk brain thought that was the best time to tell her how i felt over text, classy i know. i was also “encouraged” quit my job after that night. couple days passed and she said she doesn’t feel the same way, and i can’t really blame her tbh, i’m heroin-addict-skinny, look younger than i should for my age and honestly my mental state is pretty fucked and she’s well aware of exactly how acutely. 

after i quit that job we went from seeing each other almost every day at work for barely ever, but still texting here and there. i got the vibe something was a little different after i told her but i’m also pretty prone to getting paranoid about these things. just stuff like sometimes we’d be texting and she’d disappear for a day or two before responding and the conversations got way shorter, but she’d almost always text me first, usually outta the blue for no real reason and she coulda just been busy or whatever and maybe i’m reading too much into it. 

also spent this time being sorta distanced to start improving myself independently, went from eating almost nothing to bulking up a fair bit but still eating healthy, started working out every day, quit drinking and doing drugs back in february and all that good shit.

anyway last month she texted me, i answered and i got nothing for a whole month, so i assumed that was the friendship kinda just dying out, it sucked obviously but it also kinda felt like a weight had been lifted and i just kept up my routine and tried not to let it get me down. but last week she got back to me finally, like no time had passed. now i’m pretty fkn confused and have been spiralling into a bad depression (not sure if it’s because of the situation or just coincidental timing as i’ve been known to get morbidly depressed outta nowhere in the past) and i’m not sure if she’s playing some kinda game or she gets some kinda validation from me that she wants now or if i’m being completely paranoid and she genuinely just likes talking to me still and so is just trying to do that.

so on the one hand, half of my brain (i guess we’ll tentatively call it the healthy, self-help book side) thinks that i should get over it, and that i need a friend and she’s good for me to talk to which could go a long way to improving my mental state, something i’ve been trying hard to work on recently.

on the other hand, the part of my brain that’s not a fkn simp is screaming at me that i should stop it because i’m not gonna stop having these feelings and she’s never gonna feel the same way, so sticking around is just making me look and feel pathetic and making me feel completely unloved, unloveable and fkn disgusting.

tough call, so i’m outsourcing"
147,"How can I tell if someone is always bored, or depressed?",
148,What’s the difference in behavior for someone who is always bored vs someone who is depressed?,
149,I met someone on Discord and she has been acting really weird,"A year ago, I met K. She is 24, female. Everything she does is deliberate in regards to her personality. I just don’t know if my theories are right about her and I want opinions.

I’ve always known her past is bad but she doesn’t really go into detail. Her parents were divorced and she has had multiple relationships online. One of which called her a psycho. She told me she catfished me and that she was insecure and guilty. In servers, she is excessively happy and loves being the center of attention. She is clingy, needy and really does care about people. 

The problem is, is when it feels like she wants to be hurt. She invited me to a server where she was bullying someone and she was bullied by him. A week later, she couldn’t take it anymore. She was acting like a victim and blamed me for not protecting her.

Now whenever I give her life advice, she replies with one word: “True”. When I compliment her, is when she goes into more detail. I told her she’s smart but she says she isn’t and hasn’t succeeded in life. I told her she can read people and she said she can’t and she always feels disappointed. 

What’s interesting is that her display picture (profile picture) keeps changing. I’ve noticed when she’s sad she uses dark or sad pictures. Normally, she uses mirror selfies of other girls, sometimes in a nsfw way. She logs on very often sometimes staying up till 3 am.

I think her trauma has to do with abuse. I feel like it's a cycle that's going on. She feels happy then sad then happy.

Is it possible for someone to either hide their personality or to constantly change their personality? Are there other experiences where people do want attention even after trauma? Why mirror selfies, does she feel like she wants to be someone else?"

151,Being Institutionalized Damn Near Killed Me,"I posted an angry post awhile back. I admitted myself. Went to go face my demons head on. Its a known fact people with an anger problem will deny they have a problem even avoiding help when they're drowning. I've been avoiding ""help"" my whole life. I'm 28 married with 2 step children(whom I'm probably messing up in the head). In life I've been told by a few professionals that I'm bi-polar and suffer from PTSD. There's probably more. Actually I know there's more. I'm just never honest when the time comes. Being part of an inpatient treatment almost killed me and I regret trying to get help. For the first half I was sedated and told to suppress a lot of my shit so I didn't get attacked by other patients. It was a shit show. There's more but I dont want to scare anyone. Eventually they got me on a cocktail of drugs that I believed were working. I was sleeping. I was concentrating, listening to people, being active, and felt calm. Not sedated not drugged. It took a week but finally they hit the nail on the head. Then I got released with different meds, different doses, and honestly an ugly bill. My little family is struggling financially because I ""took a vacation"". I stopped taking the meds and started smoking cigarettes and weed again. And honestly last night while I was coloring with my son all I could think about was shoving the pencil in my jugular. Which is funny because I usually don't have suicidal tendencies more homicidal. So this scared me. I usually only feel this low when I'm using or drinking. But I've been clean off the hard shit for almost 6 years now. I don't know how to adjust."

153,I’m not really sure what’s going on.,"As the title says, I’m really not sure what’s going on with me, for a bit of back story, I just turned 20, I’m living with my parents at the moment, which has never been the best environment, &amp; I just got a high stress level job, &amp; as well, my significant other is living with me as well.
I’ve kind of been this way for awhile, people can’t tell when I’m joking &amp; when I’m not, I sound serious, when I’m not serious at all. My boyfriend jokes a lot, so I joke back, &amp; after he quits joking I guess I kind of continue joking &amp; he gets mad, or upset, or sometimes hurt by things I say. He says the same kind of stuff, I just continue doing so after he stops. We’ve spoke about it a million times &amp; he’s even questioning the relationship because of it, some times it’s like things just come out impulsively, I didn’t even mean to continue talking, other times stuff he jokes about something random that hurts my feelings &amp; so I’ll keep going a bit more than I should. But it’s usually the impulsive kind of stuff. &amp; I don’t really know what to do about it, like of course I want to stop, of course I listen to him, I’m hearing him, I’m trying, but I guess I don’t know my limits when he’s joking with me &amp; I joke back &amp; I don’t know how to change my tone to make it not sound so serious. I personally feel there are issues in the relationship on his side, but I don’t really feel like I can talk to him about it cause of how he acts when I try. I dunno. If anyone has any advice, let me know please."
154,I’m lost,"I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."
155,I don't know what to do anymore,"Well, I've reached this point again. The only other time it got this bad was my first ever midterm exam and the stress around it, as well as all the other crap that involved my parent's divorce, my abusive father, my friends turning toxic, and me feeling unwanted and unbearably alone. I had to go to my school counselor because I said I was maybe going to do something drastic. I'm pretty dang sure I have depression, and every time I think I'm getting better, I slip back down into the chasm again. My mom was recently diagnosed with leukemia, and that was it's own battle that I've now dealt with. Sometimes it comes back, but not as severe as before. Well, now things have gotten worse. My SO may or may not be moving away. This is the person I have loved for nearly two years of my life, and now they may be moving nearly 2,000 miles across the country. Life keeps throwing me around like a rag doll and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so hollow and sad all of the time, and so emotionally bruised that each time I get hit with a new thing it just gets worse and worse"

160,How I beat anxiety and depression.,"As I’m typing this, it’s hard for me to believe it’s true but I’ve really done it. I actually feel somewhat stable for the first time in years. Here’s what worked: 
- I realized my anxiety and lack of self trust was causing me to rush and never really finish anything all the way. So now I take the time to do things properly, actually ACT like I believe in myself and it does wonders for my self esteem. 
- Grounding techniques. For me, fighting with the thoughts only made it worse. I write down my general mood once a day and why I think I feel that way, and for anything else I immediately stop and ground myself. Awareness, like noticing things you can see, feel, hear etc. Say it to yourself. 
- It sounds corny but meditation is massive for me. A 10 minute session and suddenly all my stress is melted away and it helps keep it away. 
- Less social media 
- Consistency! There will ALWAYS be bad days, that doesn’t mean it’s not working. 

Good luck!!! And one more thing - please, please don’t ever give up. I nearly ended my life early this year and I can’t describe how glad I am to still be alive. It gets better, it really does."
161,Advice On Hospital Treatment,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember but I’ve never felt like I’m battling them as I can often suppress them.

I don't really remember the last time I was genuinely happy or sad or angry.. It's almost like there's two mes and it's driving me crazy.. Even when I look at myself in the mirror it feels like I'm looking at a stranger. 

I've thinking through these past weeks and I think I've been feeling like this even since I was a kid (right now  I'm 17) and I considered it to be normal telling myself maybe I was just bored of many things that I used to like and I focused almost all my time on school and my grades but since the lockdown I don't really know how to feel anymore. I don't have those distractions keeping me away from thinking about this whole situation and I hate it. A few months ago I got accepted to university with a possible scholarship and the usual reaction would be happiness but at that moment I felt literally nothing more like a “ok I guess ” state and even though I spent the whole day smiling just because my family was completely proud of me and I didn't want to ruin the mood. I was supposed to be happy but I felt miserable. 

It's not possible for me to trust myself anymore. It's a never ending cycle of numbness, euphoria with a high self esteem, like feeling on top of the world and tiredness. And it's incredibly hard for me to even make up my mind about anything since I feel like no matter what I do I'll end up betraying myself some way. Like my thoughts are no longer mine and I'm just looking at my own life from far away. Going to the doctor it's not an option since my parents think it's a waste of money and time but I don't really know what to do anymore, music used to be a pretty good way to calm myself down whenever I felt this way but it's no longer working and now I just feel confused and completely anxious about the whole thing. Any kind of advice would be helpful and thanks for reading if you made it this far."
163,is that normal??,"so i just wanted to know if any of you experienced that, like when i get up in the morning, the first 2 hours i feel dissy, i get up and see black, i walk and i feel like i am going to pass out. I feel this almost every morning
Also once (like 2 years ago or so) i felt a really really weird thing, i realised i couldn't remember words like pillow, door, towel as i was talking to my mom, she freaked out and told me to rEaD a bOoK, yeah.. and that's what i tried, i opened the book and i was shook, i couldn't read"
164,Why is getting treatment so expensive?,"I’m lucky because I’m not in a life or death situation. I do have a difficult time functioning. I have cptsd, depression, and GAD. I just want to feel happy and normal. I want to actually begin my life and thrive. I’m 20, recently no contact with abusive parents and financially don’t have any help. I’ve already spent $3000 on a treatment that didn’t really help, I see a therapist weekly and was about to do an IOP program but it would cost me over $2000. I have to choose between being financially stable or mentally stable. It really shouldn’t be this difficult."
165,Is this anxiety related?," 

Ive(19/m) never had problems with anxiety before, so im new to this.

I've booked a flight to my girlfriend about 8 days ago, and eversince then ive been having these symptoms:

\-Heat flashes-A sick gut feeling-An impending sense of doom-Flashback like Dejavus-And a feelign of slow vision, like my eyes take extra time to focus on things

Im not sure if this is anxiety related at all, my girlfriend told me it might be.

Whats worrying me the most would have to be the Flashback like Dejavus, as they give me small panic attacks, and the slow vision, because it makes me feel weird, and as if im not myself.

Also ive been losing interest in things that i usually really enjoy since then, and my sex drive definetly has gotten a lot lower.

Can anyone tell me if this is Anxiety related?

Will this pass?"
166,I actually don't know,"I just joined art community this june and strived to be better at it until I can open for commissions. I just opened for commissions this august and well I can say it went successful. people commissioned me. At first it was fun, then now I feel so bummed. I feel like I can't do it. I am so frustrated. All my clients are nice. They did not set deadlines for me, but still, I know I should finish them right away. I have had rest after finishing two commissions, but I still feel unmotivated doing the next ones. I feel like I have lost my motivation with art overall. I am afraid of losing my passion once again.  I lost my passion 3 years ago, and regained it this june quarantine. I don't know what I should do, I want to keep this passion. I want to know if this is normal. Do other artists also feel like this? If you do, what do you do to ease it up? 

Idk if anyone will reply, but I truly appreciate if you do. I just feel so shitty feeling like this."
167,TW FOR SUICIDE!!!!!! // my internet friend is going to kill themselves and there’s nothing i can so.," i have had an internet friend for 6+ years now and we’ve had our ups and downs but we’ve always said it’s like theres a red string around our fingers together and if we were in a big city, we’d always find each other somehow. they’ve known me when a lot of my trauma was happening, so they’re pretty prominent figure in my life even if we don’t talk everyday.


 well. they’re going to kill themselves. i can’t do anything– ive dug through every post and none of them are liked by their now ex s/o, they have a bad relationship w their family so there’s literally no sign of interaction, at all. they keep saying “when” in regards to tonight as opposed to if. ive begged them to go to the hospital but they refuse. i dont have an address. i have nothing and it’s like watching someone die. they message me and every message is fruitless because nothing i say matters and they’ve even outright said that. so i text them and it all means nothing, nothing i say helps or matters and i feel like im going to break and shatter if they actually follow through.


 just last year on sept 27th i lost a childhood best friend to suicide. it’d be twice in under a year. i have a first and last name as well as a town– i dont know what that’d do. i don’t want to lose them. but they make it seem inevitable. i feel like id lose a part of myself with them. 


any comfort or advice is appreciated. i feel like a husk of a person right now. it’s like a ticking bomb"
168,How to handle embarrassment,"I live in a neighborhood with houses very close together and I often keep my windows open. I can clearly hear my neighbors and they can clearly hear me. I’m not particularly close with my neighbors. Just the occasional hello.

The past year has been super rough. My husband and I were fighting a lot for a while, and yelling a lot. In the heat of the moment, it didn’t matter that neighbors could hear. Never had the cops called or anything, but definitely yelled at each other. 

Everyone involved has been through a lot of therapy in the past year and things are much, much better now. But I still can’t help think about, and my husband does as well, how our neighbors have heard us fight in the past. They probably think we’re just awful. It has gotten to the point where neither of us wants to spend time outside or do yard work because we’re ashamed of what our neighbors might think of us.

How can we get over this? We’re so ashamed of the fighting in our past but don’t want to suffer that shame forever."
169,(TW) My r*pist contacted me again,"I don't really know what else to say.

Its been roughly 10 years since he did what he did. But every so often (roughly every 2 years) he takes pleasure in contacting me or showing up in my life.

Nothing like waiting until I start feeling less paranoid to message me and relight that fire I suppose.

I have a support system. I'm on a video call with my psychosexual therapist this week. But I'm just. .. Devastated. Utterly devastated. My depression has been worse lately due to poor health, lockdown shielding and losing my job during covid so this has just put my brain in the most horrendous vice grip. 

If anyone else out there faces this kind of torment, my heart is with you because I know it kills me every damn time, even when he's 'polite'."
170,"Trauma, anxiety and fear of working","LONG READ - SORRY VENTING TOO

I have struggled with mental health issues like depression,anxiety and other issues all my life (diagnosed at 11 with depression/anxiety after a mental breakdown. There have been many things that have happened from childhood to now that i still struggle with  from trauma at home,school or my mind. My relationship with my mother had alot of impact on how i think and who i am now, im currently no contact so you can guess it wasnt a good relationship. 

From 16-18 i was in an on/off relationship and it was extremely toxic from both sides but mine due to his behaviour towards which turned became resentment/hate/anger. He was verbally abusive ,emotionally abusive, withholding of affection/attention (we only touched each other for sex), i got an std from him (i got us clean) things escalate and he started to threaten me with a punch or headbutt. It ended badly when he started to basically date another 16 yr old girl while i lived there (i never saw her in person as she was grounded...). We lived in a shared flat that neither of us could leave because it was for people who needed support (i moved out at 17 and he got kicked out at 18 and i helped him get support from them).
I also at this point started to go near having another breakdown so thats most likely why i never saw her (thank god). i had to listen to him talk to some other girl all day and night, i couldnt sleep or eat because i didnt want to leave my room, the tension was so uncomfortable and it was miserable.Im not proud of who i was during this time but i was vile towards him in every way i could be, anytime he had something that was mine i would demand it back right there (most of the household stuff was mine so i took it all to my room), he wouldnt come near me as id switched from a quiet doormat to actively trying to instigate a fight with him or take the piss that he cant date a girl his own age because he needs them obedient, sex toy and blonde (he had a type which i was not at all). In the end we had a “fight”, he just grabbed ahold of my hoodie and i grabbed him by his neck and we flung about into a table, it ended with me launching a cup at him. I had a weird episode which resulted in my moving to my friends for 3 months. I had a sort of panic/stress attack, i felt extreme anger and threw objects around, my heart rate kept beating fast with a random sudden drop which made me lightheaded, hearing alot of noise which felt deafening so i fell to the floor in fetal position trying to make it stop while also being hot/red from feeling pure rage. I started to catch myself talking to myself when alone at friends home, i became so isolated it was awful. I moved back home as id calmed down and felt stable to handle what was happening, he moved out after about a month and i was calm for a short time.

(18 now)
1month after abusive relationship ends i was spiked, blacking in and out from being dropped on my head and raped in a park and public bathroom. I had alot of injuries and had to take time off work due to concussion. I filed a report with police mid 2019 after the man who assaulted me approached me again. While letting my dog run around on a grassy area in my town i saw him stood behind a van watching me, i could identify him from the red hat and black coat he was wearing each interaction. I see him often in his car, i can hear him talking to people outside the pub/kebab i live next too, which is hard. The  investigation is still going but its nearing the end to him being charged, with the provided evidence i was able to give its almost likely he will be prosecuted as ive been told. I now think i may be suffering from ptsd or something similar. I had a panic attack when a random guy walked past me in a black coat, i was scared and i froze despite it clearly not being the rapist. My confidence and control with sex have gone, i used to be able to take control but now i cant do much as movement in my hips is difficult, i lost confidence so i cant take control or feel like i cant. It even affected my work, i was a support worker and i would cry on shift sometimes when alone, i couldn’t focus so started messing things up or not remembering things, nearly having panic attacks, scratching my nails so much blood started to soak my sleeves. I just wasnt present at all. 

I was made redundant the day before my birthday and in September i will have my last payment. i have been looking for work outside of care as i lost the passion for it i once had due to a shitty boss/work environment. Theres nothing atm but ive just realised how much im trying to push this off and thinking in depth about it im just scared. Im scared of seeing my rapist face to face, im scared of seeing my ex, im scared of groups of people, i seriously struggle with change and idk what to do...idk if i can work im just so anxious, paranoid and scared. 
Idk what my options are, idk what support to seek, idk what i need to be myself again....
Obviously i dont have a choice in working if i want to keep my flat and feed my dog but idk wha im supposed to do...i dont think im able to work currently, my brain doesnt function like it used to...."

174,How to handle anxiety due to the lock down,"Hello! I think I've discovered a new problem. And I'd really love to just, immediately start handling that. I'm not usually on top of things, but I'd like to try it out maybe just this once. 

So, I have had generalized anxiety and panic attacks for as long as I can remember. I'm very easily put on edge. My school went online and I chose to leave my job due to safety. I've been doing really well with what I'm supposed to do during this time, and not so great mentally. I've stayed home, only leaving for occasional trips to the grocery store or to go on a run in the (quiet and lonely) neighborhood. For the past 5 months, I've probably gotten about 72 hours of out-of-my-house time, at most, and probably closer to 36 hours if that was changed to out-of-my-neighborhood time. 

I have finally decided to see my family. It's been a long while, I'd moved out just days before lock down; I didn't expect it would be so long before I saw them again. And I decided to spend two nights. I want to spend time with them, they're my family and I love them. But I think I'm feeling very overwhelmed.  

I didn't get a single wink of sleep on the first night (last night). And I woke up with that pit in my stomach, the anxiety one, I hope people know what I'm talking about. I'm feeling this somewhat overwhelming low buzz anxiety. My stomach feels awful, my head feels awful, I feel awful. I want to hide in my room and not come out, I also want to run back home. I may or may not be having an anxiety attack as I'm typing, I feel like I haven't figure it out yet and I've been feeling it and trying to think over it for hours now, but I feel so clouded. Part of me feels tempted to climb out of my window and escape. *I feel? trapped? And that makes me want to run to? where I've been locked up for months?*

I just feel so confused, and worried about my mind and my anxiety. I don't want this to get any worse, but I'm not really sure how to conquer it."
175,I find myself getting really upset at people for not complying with masks and social distancing. How can I help reduce this new anxiety?,"I can’t control other people, I know that, but I feel increasingly angry and upset at random strangers and it’s not healthy. Any tips or suggestions?"
176,Is this OCD/ my story,"When it all started, i was at primary school, the trigger was believing i had walked in on my mum dead, however she had passed out and was making strange noises. This then caused me to pass out and bang my head so hard that i lost vision and had concussion when visiting the doctor, the same day he told me he was going to have to “chop my head off” this day was traumatic for me as I didn’t understand the situation as I was 10 years old at the time. After a week off of school and not still not feeling right i began to believe that i wasnt real and i felt constantly dissociated from my body and would often have out of body experiences where i would feel nothing and as if i was just watching - i couldn’t feel my body. When i was back at school i wasn’t worried about anthing however i would be aware that i felt different and randomly the feeling of ‘feeling not real’ would just happen. When the doctor diagnosed me with anxiety and depression when i was in year, 9 I looked back and assumed it was panic attacks it took me over 5 years to tell my mum that i was feeling this way (over the years it was ok some days and worse on others) and at the time i found it so difficult to explain how i was feeling that i would just say i didn’t know. When i began to have therapy i would be shouted at by my dad for not going to school and for making my mum upset when i was confused. When i was put on medication (fluoxetine) two years after beginning to open up about my feelings, it stopped the depression which was caused by these uncontrollable thoughts and feelings however the medication does not and never has stopped my ‘panic attacks’ or ‘anxiety’. The triggers that cause it are being uncomfortable in situations that i can’t avoid or control, loud noises, lots of talking not being able to chose where i place myself, lighting, certain rooms and places, feeling sick or becoming ill and certain foods or drinks. When i was younger it would happen randomly and i wouldn’t be able to control it however now i know what my triggers are i tend to avoid such things. I also believe that being happy sometimes causes it as i believe that i subconsciously tell myself i am not allowed to be happy or excited. I have lived with this for 9 years i’ve had cognitive behavioural therapy  which didn’t work on me as i find it extremely difficult to verbally talk about my emotions.

Things that have helped it have been leaving school, moving house, learning to drive and becoming independent as i don’t have to worry about other people’s thoughts or have to bother other people with my problems.

Any ideas/thoughts about this would be very appreciated thank you."
177,"Can somebody here help me?? I need to talk to people to understand how human psychology works, how to read people, how to socially interact in the best way.

178,sudden hurry rush?,I don't know why but sometimes I'll get like a hurry rush out of nowhere. examples: shopping online and finding a new shop or hearing about a new tvshow through instagram. I don't know if this could be fear of missing out or maybe a sign of anxiety. It feels like a type of excitement but a bothersome one. I have to remind myself to stay calm. It comes out of nowhere because there is no actual time rush and I feel like I'm 'running out of time' when there isn't even a deadline or a serious task to be handled. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I'm not that good at explaining it and it might not seem like a big deal but it makes me feel uncomfortable

182,Random Thoughts,"Mind as calm as water. 
Yet the smoothest of water will show a ripple or two. 
Ripples from fish feeding, or life. 
Life creates these ripples that effect the flow of our mind
We may not be able to control all of life’s causes but our climate can change its effect on us
Will you endure through the storm or will you drown in what are now countless waves crashing in your mind 
We must look in the water and be able to reflect on ourselves and be humbled by the questions we avoid the most.

184,"Hey cheer up, we can all get through this.","*My friends betrayed me when I was in grade 9
*Caught my mom having sex with other guy
*My own relative touched me privately
*I got cheated on multiple times
*I never had real friends that will be with me on hard days.
*My teachers on 11th grade has favoritsm and I am never included.
*I am suffering from anxiety and depression.
*I got body shamed because I'm skinny.
*My own relatives talking shit about me.
*My kindness took for granted like million times.

185,How do you talk to parents who don't believe in therapy/addressing mental illness about seeking mental health help?,"I'm seventeen and very much dependent on my parents who do not emphasize the importance of mental health or really believe in therapy. However, I've struggled with anxiety for a long time and may or may not be depressed (hence why I need to see a professional). Additionally, one of my sisters was already diagnosed with depression a few years ago and there's kind of a pressure on me to be well. Like *she's* the mentally ill one, not me. They don't openly talk about what she's been through and they get uncomfortable and change the subject when she mentions her experiences. How do I breach the topic of my own mental health to them?"
186,"For some reason i always feel like its hard for me to think, and my eyes are tired why do you think?","ok, so for some reason whenether i try to think its extremely difficult, and like for some reason I squint randomly one of my eye's like a nervous tic almost, idk why. idk why but I always feel tired, it could be because I used to be under constant stress all the time and worked a lot, although I take a lot of caffeine and get plenty of sleep, so I'm not sure what it is. 

But there are times when I can feel like my brain is working really good like, when that happen's I'm aware of the present and am in the present, but when I'm this tired state I think its because I'm too much inside of my head. 

I also don't exercise at all, so i think that could also be it, but it's like my brain is half on, but i get enough sleep, and take caffeine, so that fact that I'm not alert is beyond weird. I've seen people that experienced this same exact thing, i have friend who is entrepreneur that works non stop, and i can tell in his eyes that he's in that exact same state, where your brain works, but it feels like your tired in a way. So i think it has a lot to do with constantly working

For those that may think they know what I'm talking about, what helped you, and do you have any tips, all will be appreciated."
187,I hate my dad,"I hate my dad. I hate him so much, he doesn’t know how much pain he’s cost me, my siblings, my mom, and even my grandma. Everywhere we go we have to listen to him! When I was a kid he hit my mom. At one point he hit my younger brother in the neck but my mom didn’t let that slide. He’s such a kid, all he does is hang out with his friends and drink. The only thing he’s good for is getting money and being lazy. He’s weird too, he cheats on my mom, he’s a pervert. On my sisters birthday one time, he was so upset and acted like it was a day for him. When he gets mad we all have to go in our rooms and hide. One time he almost made us all crash because he was hitting my mom; she told him to stop, and she said we’re gonna crash. BUT of course he didn’t care. He’s egotistic. Only cares about social media and the likes he’ll get. Him: “OH that’s a good picture let’s post it.” I hate him. He always brings his friends over and never tells us until the last minute. He doesn’t know how to clean and wouldn’t bother. He doesn’t know that we cry for my mom. He doesn’t know I have nightmares of HIM! I needed to vent because now he’s gonna force me and my siblings to see his stupid friends! I don’t know what to do...."
188,"I know I could benefit from antidepressants, yet the very condition they could help (health anxiety) prevents me from trying them. Very frustrated.","One of the craziest aspects of my own health anxiety is how good I am at researching medications and conditions. I don't just google things; I read medical papers extensively. I even manage to get access to paywalled papers.

The thing is I know I need help in the form of antidepressants, yet my health anxiety is so bad that I research these antidepressants extensively and end up scaring myself off trying them.

One paper I read lately found an association between SSRI use and intracranial bleeding. Given an aneurysm is one of my greatest health anxiety fears, that immediately put me off SSRI's. 

This is very frustrating. I really do want to try these medications but the voice in my head is there that tells me I'm basically risking my life, which is fucking insane seeing as millions of people take them every year without dying."

194,Mental health is at an all time low,"I can’t talk to anyone in my life about this, and i’m sick of typing it out to no one, or some app that spits out pre set messages that tell me to meditate. Might as well tell some strangers. 

My mental health has been terrible lately and i’ve been pretending im okay and lying to my friends, or at least not telling them anything beyond “I haven’t been feeling well”. I’m so isolated and lonely. I feel like i’m trapped in my mind. 

I CANNOT stop self hate thoughts. At first they were quiet and infrequent, but now they invade every aspect of what I do. Washing dishes? I didn’t wash them fast enough, I failed. Talking to people online? That’s not how real people talk. You can’t even communicate right. 

Everything I do is wrong. Even when I do nothing, theres always the “you’re lazy and a waste of space” thoughts. I feel like I have the lowest self esteem possible. 

On top of the self hate thoughts, everything just feels .. not real. Or at least I don’t feel real, or human. Sometimes it feels like everything is an AI generated simulation. Or that i’m dreaming. Or that everyone else is real and genuine, but I can’t even qualify as a human being. My “feelings” are just an approximation of what an actual person would feel. 

And I self harmed for the 2nd time last night. This is the first time i’ve told anyone, even if its to strangers. Ive been letting my nails grow out and I scratched up my arm until it left marks. I just wanted to feel something and stop the self hate thoughts for a minute. It helped with neither. 

I can’t afford therapy, and meditation doesn’t work for me. I feel doomed to be like this forever.

TLDR; isolated and depressed, self hate thoughts, unreality, self harm"

198,A couple of dreams that i had recently.,"hello everyone, what's up?  
I had this very weird dream today and it's kind of an continuation of another dream i had a couple of days ago. In both dreams are refrencess to LOK ( Legend of Korra ) for some odd reason. ( I wasn't watching the show or anything related to it in a while now ).  
From what i can recall in the first dream i was talking to a couple of characters from the series after some of the events of the series went down ( and a couple of some fiction ones - like one of the characters dying ) and basiclly just living day to day life.  
In the other one - the one i had last night is the one who's more interesting :  
In the beginning ( of the parts i can remember ) i was a character from the series ( either Tarrlok or his brother Amon ) and i was running away from home ( for some odd reason ) and i reached a slope of a mountain, i started falling down the slope with my brother ( again, the one from the serie ) hanging for dear life on an edge only to fall about 15-20 meters down.  
When i got up ( still in the dream, after i fell down ) i saw a cliff, from which i can see my neighborhood from a distance of around 400-600 meters down.   
Then my brother said to me ""jump with me TheHighSchooler2, were going home"" ( or something along this lines i can't remember exactly what he said )  
Then he jumped down.  
In here something odd happens - i got a bit of consciousness and awareness to the fact that i was in a dream but i didn't woke up. i was streesing out from the jump because from the one hand it was scary AF but on the other hand i was a little aware that it was a dream.  
After stressing about it for what seemed like 40 seconds i jumped down and after landing the dream cut out and i woke up.  
I really don't know why the heck am i dreaming those dreams so i went here for an explaintion.  
If you need me to explain anything or elaborate ask ( either DM or the comments ).  
And one last thing to mention, im not a native speaker of English so im sorry for the bad English.  
Have a good day everyone!"

201,"How can I overcome guilt, anxiety, and nervousness?","I need help guys I’ve been feeling guilt, anxiety, and nervousness for the past couple of days over something I did in the past which im not proud of. I’m not gonna get into the details but I want to know how can I overcome these feelings and push it to the back of my mind and suppress it again. Many people have told me to forgive myself and let go but it isn’t as easy as it seems these thoughts are always lingering in my mind. It’s like my mind is telling me I should feel bad for such and such. If anyone related to this experience can you give me some advice?"
202,"Unsure on what to do, need some advice please?","Hi, I’m looking for some advice on how to handle a situation. Here is a bit of back story to my situation: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/i6s7fj/abused_as_a_child_what_to_do_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

So none of my family apart from my boyfriend know what’s happened to me but it’s sister 1’s birthday tomorrow and my family is expecting me to come to their house and see her. I really can’t face it but I’m not ready to tell the rest of my family what’s happened as I’m still just coming to terms with it now.

Is there anything I could say to my family to get out of going tomorrow without bringing up questions? Or is there another way I could handle this?

Thanks 😊"
203,My girlfriend has suicidal thoughts and I don’t know how to help,"My partner has had a history of suicidal tendencies, and recently she has been doing a lot worse. She often says she wants to die. But the thing is that she doesn’t want to go and seek professional help, no matter how hard I try to convince her. It feels that no matter what I do doesn’t help her, and I know that she no longer feels happy, even if it is with me. It’s very hard and I worry about her a lot. It also affects me when she has depressive episodes (she is not diagnosed so I do not know how to refer to them) and starts acting in a different way. 

Is there any way I can help her? Does anyone have any advice?"

205,My aunt,"I posted about her not long ago. I am sad to say that my aunt, Elizabeth O'Connor, lost her battle with cancer a few days ago. I have cried, but I get the feeling that I'm suppressing a lot of my emotions. I feel embarrassed and ashamed but I don't understand why. I see her as having ascended to a happier place, as if in death she achieved grace and perhaps I'm ashamed because I've attempted suicide whereas she is dead and she didn't want to die.

She was a Jehovah's witness, and I'm an atheist, but I hope she finds paradise, wherever she is.

She never married but she was content. She had many friends and a loving family.

Liz was wise and gentle, but strong and assertive. She was a paradox; old and frail, but made strong by her faith. She also used to be a teacher for disabled children and was a compassionate and patient person. She gave so much and never asked for anything in return. 

I love you, Liz. I hope you are in a better place. I love you and you'll always be in my heart."
206,Im gonna tell my therapist about my abuse.,"I didn’t want to tell her for ages because it was my brother and I didn’t want to get him into trouble but my mum told me that I should tell her, so I am going to on Tuesday. Quite scary because every time I even think about it or talk about it, I shut my self down and my anxiety goes through the roof but it’s gonna be very important for a right diagnosis."
207,"Is anyone else the spouse, the caretaker?","Hey! I'm new here and I hope this is an ok place to post. 

My husband is wonderful and amazing. He has always suffered depression. 3 years ago it became quite severe. He was suicidal. He never acted on it, but I was very afraid. He's a stay at home dad, partially due to physical disabilities, and at the time I had to find back up childcare because I was truly afraid I'd come home to find him dead. 

He does receive treatment. He has meds, therapy, and support. His former doctor perhaps gave him too much medication (Abilify, Paxil, Gabapentin, something else too), but at the time it was just so bad. We've now moved and he has a new doctor who reduced his meds. He is finishing TMS therapy and hopefully reducing the meds. 

He rarely bathes, doesn't brush his teeth, and isn't a cheerful person. Obviously I understand that's the depression. He's happy at times and is a stable and kind father, but he isn't the cheerful and energetic man I married. He has nominal interest in talking to me, though we do spend time together and he is happy to be with me. He's physically gross and dirty, but I'm very attracted to him anyway honestly lol. I'm probably overplaying the misery of it because we do have happy times. 

That being said, the depression and illness hang like a cloud and for the last 3 years he's just bleh. Tried multiple drugs and therapists. 

Yes, I know all the tropes about caring for myself and finding support. I know and engage in it and I would really appreciate if no one on this thread said the term ""self-care."" If I have to hear that term said to me *one more time* I don't know what I'm going to do... For those of you who have been in this role, you undoubtedly know how minimizing and invalidating it is to be told that painting your nails and going to a spa a couple times a month is somehow supposed to make you feel better in this kind of situation. I know self-care can be more and better than that, but I simply don't want to hear more about this than I already have. Please assume that I fully know about this option and engage in it. 

Anyway, my father-in-law made a comment today that he hasn't seen my husband honestly happy in three years. He said that he sees old pictures where my husband is happy and that he just isn't happy anymore. It felt like a slap in the face because there's so much truth in the comment. 

Logically I know it isn't my fault, but it feels a little like it is. we're coming up on our fifth wedding anniversary and we've spent more than half of our marriage with him severely depressed. It's heartbreaking. Some people don't ""get better"" from depression. It just is. 

It also feels really sad for me. I've been cheerleader, the happy and engaged parent, the appointment-maker and the housework-doer... Taken on extra responsibilities while working full-time and managed his care. I've covered for him in social situations and we've lost social connections. 

Has anyone else been the spouse in caretaker of someone with chronic mental illness? Tell me about your journey :) I'm not alone, right?"
208,Advice,I've been in a super bad state of mind lately and I need some ways to help distract myself or atleast help
209,I think i might have pure ocd - TW self harm and suicide mentions,Since late January i have been struggling with episodes of depression and since mid February ive had impulsive intrusive thoughts the thoughts started with ones about breaking my fingers and i would have these thoughts for about an hour or two and they felt horrible and impulsive i never ended breaking my fingers then quarantine hit and the thoughts got worse. Then from april to early june i had constant thoughts all day about killing myself although i did not want to kill myself but with the thoughts being almost constant they became more and more convincing if i wasnt feeling too bad i could deal with them but if i wasnt they would make me incredibly agitated and to the point where i would punch and hit myself and engage in cutting. I had also had a few instances of hearing voices which had made me incredibly paranoid and these thoughts just made me obsess over it and look into schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders which made things worse as well as my brain telling me the voices are coming for me. Most of the intrusive thoughts only ever get bad is when im feeling bad and ive been out of a depression for 7-8 weeks i had a small argument with my dad about 3 weeks ago and i began obsessing over shaving my head and carving kys and then hanging myself the thoughts got really bad and i began hitting myself in the head and breaking my sh streak of like a month and a half. I also keep getting images of me kms which cause me discomfort. Most the thoughts are trigged by stress and strong emotions. I can get really worked up about things i had a few things go wrong with a guitar amp of mine and when my guitar which is my main souce of calmness and happiness fails i cannot calm down and i got stressed angry and sh. And the whole time of that my thoughts wont shut the fuck up about killing myself idk they just make me angry. I also keep bringing up times when i have small miss understandings with people or times when ive been a bit rude and and then the thoughts tell me im a horrible bad person. If i go to my parents and i say i think i have pure ocd which they dont really know what it is they will call it off idk if anyone reads this and leaves any advice its much appreciated thank you

212,Loneliness,"I am someone who is surrounded by many great friends for whom I would be ready to do many things, I also have a GF that I hold very dear to my heart.  I know that I sometimes feel as if people are below me, not always but it isn't that rare either.  I never let it show of course because getting punched in the face isn't something I'm keen on.

 And that leads me to the main topic of today, I always feel incredibly lonely despite whoever might be around me. I always feel as if something or someone was missing. I often feel as if people don't understand my thought process, what goes on inside my head (not that it's anything beyond their comprehension, just a bit strange like making connections where they don't see one but not smart, just strange). This loneliness made me develop a kind of protective attitude towards most people I meet and enjoy being with (I try not show it too much because I know what it feels like to have someone worrying over you at any decision you wanna take), but no matter how many there are I just can't seem to find that one platonic relationship I seem to crave (I don't have any standards, I don't even know what it is I'm looking for).

I know it doesn't sound like much given how I describe it but I want people to understand how frustrating it feels to be so disconnected from everybody, how hate-inducing it is to feel in the depth of your guts that your missing that one specific thing you can't even name while surrounded by things that resemble it, how ashamed i am when I look at those people and think to myself (you're so close and yet so far away from whatever it is I am seeking.). Yes this  sounds like petty whining from someone who didn't have many trouble in his life (which is mostly true, most of my life has been rather easy). But this is something I'm to prideful and idiotic to really say to the people close to me so I'm just using this opportunity to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for reading this, have a nice day and I hope everything goes better in your life."
213,"I'm socially anxious and depressed everyday, I'm afraid to live my life and am full of self-loathing and shame.","I almost never go out, for walks or to the store. I'm 17 years old and I've spent the past 3, almost 4 years inside in isolation due to losing all my friends at age 13. The first 2 years I had no issues with depression or anxiety, but I think it got to me the most in the last 1 1/2 years. Now, I can't live my life like I want. I never feel comfortable in what I wear, I'm not fantastic in doing things in front of others. I don't like other people to know what I'm watching or listening to. I feel afraid to make myself look nice because I think it's too much and others will judge or make fun of me. I'm now awkward in social interactions with others and I don't know how to handle situations well. I'm mean to my family, cruel and abusive. I have no hope anything can fix me or make my life better. The only time I feel good is either when I go to bed or when I wake up, dress in comfy clothes and just play video games, watch TV or listen to music. I have a hatred for how I look (even though I look handsome, because my family always tells me. And my body is fit, too.) and I'm insecure about my resilience emotionally or mentally. 

I've completely downgraded into a cruel, mean, unstable, lying, insecure, selfish, angry, hateful, pessimistic loser. I could be doing so much more with my life right now, but I just CAN'T. I can't handle going outside like I used to, being in front of others or handle criticism without becoming insecure. Any faith I have in myself that I could possibly do something I want without fear, embarrassment or awkwardness is quickly shot down by myself. I have no friends because I've isolated for 4 years. 2 years out of just wanting to and not caring, and the last year and a half purely out of fear and anxiety. I'm losing who I am and I can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I see no hope for myself in the future, with a job or with other people. I can't get help right now and I hear the same stuff everyday."
214,Just feel like nothing.,"I keep sleeping in and binge watching shows inside everyday so i can distract myself from feeling lonely and worthless all day. I try to do things but i can't even remember many things that i feel like doing. I think something sounds nice to do but then i get distracted and never think of it again that day. And then just keeps happening over and over every day. Sometimes i try and just go outside and see what i can find to do, but i can only think of a couple things that don't take very long and i feel like i have failed because i wasted another day and then its that i've wasted an entire month, and so on. I just feel like i'm in a loop and even when i try and change things up by getting a job, or trying to focus on just one project, all of a sudden it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do. And I should just go back to my endless rotation of nothingness. i want to feel more. i want to feel loved and wanted. i want to be helpful and useful but now im not even useful. ive been lazy and worthless for months now, i have been the bare minumom. and now i feel like i am less than even that. like im just a stain that will always be."
215,Is involuntary ''playing'' with the letters of the targets of vehicles a psychotic symptom?,"For example, seeing KDS in a vehicles' target I inmediatly think about KIDS, or seeing HTL I inmediatly think about Hitler.

216,Am I Having Panic Attacks?,"Ironically, because of the COVID-19 isolation order, I've been able to sit down more often and talk with my mom and I inadvertently commented on the fact that I have a hard time breathing while at school or in public places with lots of people present. Naturally, she became concerned and asked me to explain more in detail and I, very confusedly, did so. 

I explained that while at school I'll experience shortness of breath, shaking hands, nervous sweats, dizziness, and sometimes hear a constant ringing in my ear that no one else hears. I will also experience diarrhea or an insistent need to use the restroom between classes even on an empty stomach and bladder. The same would happen whenever I'm out in crowded, public areas, especially when I'm out alone. 

I tried to reassure her that I've been dealing with it for years now and that it wasn't a big deal. I even tried to joke about how I had almost collapsed after giving my midterm speech for one of my classes, but she didn't find it funny. She just became more and more concerned. 

My mom then explained to me that what I was experiencing sounded like I was having panic attacks. I didn't quite believe her, as what I know about panic attacks is from media and it always looked a lot more serious and dramatic than what I felt like I had. But then she asked me if the strength of these ""attacks"" have increased lately, and I realized that yes, they have. 

In high school, I would sometimes experience some dizziness and diarrhea only sometimes, like once or twice a month based on stress. Now that I'm in college, I realize I was experiencing all of that almost every day I was on campus and going to class. 

I don't know if I'm actually experiencing panic attacks, but my mom has me almost completely convinced that I am. And just this past Monday, for no apparent reason, I had broken out into a cold sweat while at work (alone) and had begun seeing stars and breathing heavily. I don't know how long it had lasted, but it happened twice that day and I have no idea why. 

I live in the USA and I've just started looking for someone (a therapist or something) that can help me understand what's going on and why and how I can get it under control or at least more manageable. I could really use the advice as I'm scared that it's only going to get worse as time goes on."

I don't wanna die alone.
I wanna know what love feels like. The sort of love that is so pure that they understand your pain even without you having to tell then. Just their presence their makes you feel safe and understood. 

Listening to sad music as I type this so I'm probably sounding too much like a hippy
Cried for a lot of the journey on the train. It's not a bad thing though, in fact it's the opposite. When I let myself cry its showing that my defenses are coming down a bit and I'm allowing myself to feel an emotion. It's better than feeling numb
Annoyed at myself for not being my authentic self at my friends on saturday. It's sad that the only time I felt free is when I was drunk. I'm relying on an external factor to give me the confidence to say whatever is on my mind.
I wish I could be as confident and free as I am when I'm drunk 
It's a work in progress though 
Going to send this to jen in the hope that if she sees me being vulnerable it helps her to have the confidence to tell me her worries (if she wants to) without fearing judgement
Need to keep looking forward and keep fighting to improve... cant stop fighting.
I know I'm never gonna be 'normal' and  happy but if I can get to a point where I can get more good days than bad it's good enough.

When I look at homeless people I can relate to them. I can empathize with them. I see their pain, yet I see their potential and wasted talent.

222,"Religion and the future are depressing me, I don't want to commit suicide but sometimes I just don't want to exist anymore.","On one hand, hearing and reading about how the comfort some of us live in, isn't going to last forever and how due to climate change, our lives will be much worse in the future. I'm kind of defeatist about these things, like how wouldn't it make me depressed about it, I'm going to lose something forever and there isn't much to do about it. I'm too weak to live in the future world as projected by scientists.

On the other hand I'm in an eternal conflict with the religion I got from my parents and how my actions and my lack of belief/conflict with it is going to put me in a place where I'm going to be concious while suffering for eternity. Also just the conflict itself, what is true, what's not, if the religion is true, why did they put so much weight on us, how am I going to handle this question if I can only believe without many other hints? How do even people manage to find their own answers for these things? Also I just don't want religion to be true, it would be too much

This stuff really is too much sometimes, it's really overwhelming. I just wanted to live in peace, not with any afterlife or whatever. I sometimes wish I just didn't exist, that I never had conciousness and that there's no consequences. That I'm just not there. Wouldn't this be the ultimate relief. Literally nothing. Unimaginable for us, but objectively no single thing to be ever worried about, because nothing.

Not suicidal in any way, it wouldn't be as fulfilling as not existing, would involve physical and psychological pain etc. 

I wonder if anyone else can relate to this. Also sorry if I flared this wrong but it sounds like it fits this kind of text the best"

A good one. I see things happening in front of my eyes and i can't stop it. It really is becoming what my boyfriend often gets worried about is that i am fucking up my own game. I overslept today. Didn't feel good. Usually i eat away my sadness but i skipped a meal today. Sleep doesn't make me feel refreshed anymore. I almost always wake up tired. I feel so lost i can't explain. This has been going on for years now. I thought I'd have some direction in life by now. I hate this feeling of going in circles. Makes me wanna sleep if I'm not going to amount to anything.  This has taken me so far away from the things i liked to do....music, painting. Its sucking off the excellence i once had in my talents. I'm tired of victimizing myself milking off my hard times. I've become an unreliable unconfident  person. Putting everyone around me on a pedestal. I've started forgetting things as i speak. Going backwards. I don't even know if i hate it anymore. i just feel like a burden to everyone around me. None of my friends understand.

226,how to not be controlling,"hello, new to this subreddit, on mobile and not the best with Grammer. to make a long story short I recently went through a break up, this I know is the person I want to spendy life with, but we don't always get what we want. through the breakup I noticed everything I did and everything thing I said was to get her back, and I was being very controlling and manipulative, I believe we both were co dependent we both went through the panic, I know these are normal emotions/ reactions but now I am looking back on the relationship, In my mind I did everything for her, I paid the bills, put a roof over her head, did all these nice things and in return I felt like I deserved her love, but love is voluntary, she fell out of love because she felt something was missing, there was times were I made her feel alone, times were I made her feel isolated. even now we are past all the deep emotions and she is feeling guilty, she did nothing wrong, we were still talking because I think we both still need something from each other, I think she likes the chase/ emotional support, and I feel like I just genuinely love her, but what ever it is we both are having trouble letting go, and most days when we talk I feel good, we have fun goofey conversation, but then it gets deep, or I get pushy to see her because I miss her, and we go backwards, she won't see me because she doesn't want to fall in love again, I want to see her bet all I want is for her to fall in love again, we are at a standstill, and it's mostly me that is pushing her away further, this is my perspective,  I want opinions on how to stop being pushy, how do I stop being controlling, how do I better cope with these emotions, I keep thinking in my mind she won't see me because she is with her ex, or she is giving up, how do I process this better and just genuinely be a better human being."
227,Keep ticking everyone off.,Im convinced I'm like the worst person my family will ever have to deal with just based on how upset they all get at me or because of me. Not that I necessarily understand or mean to upset them in any way. But I do. Ive always felt like I can't bring up what's truly on my mind just cause I am terrified of confrontation but even that they have issues with. It's like there's no point even communicating this with them cause it can't be justified nor are my emotions ever rational. Guess this is more of a tangent. Just feel sick for being a shit person in their lives.
228,My sister,"Not sure if I am posting this in the right place, but here goes:

I have an older sister. She's a decade older than me, and we've never been close. In fact she's always been the problem kid in the family, the ""black sheep."" She's had drug problems since she was a teen and always had a ""fuck you, I'll do what I want"" kind of attitude. I am not sure of all of her diagnoses but I do know she was diagnosed as BPD a long time ago. She's been in rehab once, as a teen, and I remember the family would visit her while in rehab. It didn't do any good. She's abused drugs all her adult life and her teeth are all destroyed. 

I know she got into meth for awhile, was on adderall after lying to a doc that she had narcolepsy, and abused painkillers - she basically stole a bunch of money from her now ex husband and they divorced. I know my sister is ill but she is also very abusive. Like, she's never nice. Ever. She stole a bunch of my clothes and a Sony camera of mine went missing when she was staying at my parent's house, in my old bedroom. I confronted her about it and she attacked me - hitting me in my mouth and my lips were split open. To this day, she brags about it (""I kicked that bitch's ass!"") like hurting me is something to be proud of. I never got an apology for that and I never reported it, even though I should have. She's attacked me before that, and she attacked our mom, too, but you get the picture. She has never been nice to me and the only time she is, is when she wants something from me. She's left countless hateful messages on my phone as well as my parents, siblings, doctors, you name it. She has had so many doctors drop her as a patient, psychiatrists included, because she calls them horrible words and leaves hateful messages. You can't tell her she is wrong about anything. You can't tell her to stop a behavior and try to set a boundary, or she will lash out more. Her only friends dropped her because she did the same to them. She is so toxic that I decided that I don't want her in my life. She hasn't worked in decades and she has disability benefits and currently stays at my brother's house. Needless to say, he really struggles with her there. 

Her behavior is dangerous. She doesn't know where I live because I don't want her to know - one time when she was suicidal she went looking for my place despite not knowing where I lived, just knew the general area. She is always trying to trick family members into telling her where I live. Recently, my brother visited me at my place, and she found out and  she called me from a private number (I have her blocked) and left me two hateful messages because she was jealous. I told my brother what she did when he arrived home and he confronted her about it. She started screaming that she knew he would take my ""side"" and punched herself in her face saying she was going to call the cops and tell them my brother did it. He wants to kick her out, I think it's amazing he has put up with her for this long. 

My parents are elderly and this kind of destructive behavior from my sister is destroying them. Our mom has high blood pressure and my sister is killing her. I also have all kinds of trauma in dealing with her, too. 

I guess I'm just writing and letting others know how awful this situation is. She really should be in an institution of some sort, but we don't know how to get her in one. If anyone has any advice, or can just relate, but I just needed to talk to someone."
229,Difficulty with trusting people close to me.,"
Idk why, but I struggle with trusting friends and family at times. No matter how little evidence there is to support my claims a part of me is convinced that they’re lying to me and want to ridicule (and potentially harm) me. Suddenly every normal body language seems to be a secret code, as if they’re mocking me in front of me. At its absolute worst I’ll believe strangers on the street are whispering about me— how I look, walk, (my thoughts?) and my very essence. I’m wondering if anyone can relate."

I just want to be out of commission for a while with absolutely no conscious thought. I don’t want to be seriously hurt or ill but I want everything to just go back for a while. It’s especially bad when I’m at work. I’ll be standing there with a customer and I’ll just think about fainting and hitting my head on the counter. Then I’ll wake up hours later and be sitting in a hospital bed. In the moment I think that’ll solve my problems but logically I know it won’t.

233,Advice on how to help my Abandonment Issues,"Hi there. 

I have pretty severe Abandonment Issues when it comes to other people. It’s been bad for years but since a semi-recent (October 2019) friend growing distant it’s gotten so bad, I need to do something to help myself. 

I keep thinking a lot about these people who have come and gone in my life and getting stuck and sad in my head because I don’t have a connection like that anymore. But in addition to this, my abandonment issues are preventing me from making new friends and allowing myself to get close (because I’m afraid I’ll just end up alone again). 

Can people give advice on how to cope? Exercises that you’ve heard about, anything. How can I live more for myself rather than for the connections I have with others?

Many thanks."

I don’t know what the heck is wrong with me, I had my dog in my room and I just had this horrible urge to hit her. I resisted the urge and let her out of my room before I did something horrible, but I still have this urge to do something.

TLDR of my situation/life: severe bullying from family and friends growing up, very verbally abusive family, currently with MS, back injury, and other medical stuff, dealing with a back breakup emotionally still, and just.... overwhelmed with my life.

K, best like..... short way to say it. Anyway, some things I need for medical stuff like doctor appointments and medicine were temporarily taken from me (temp cause I’m working on one and fixed another) but when it happened I fell into a very depressive tizzy and..... and I was rough with some dishes (none broke) and also slammed my chair down (cause it was hurting my back to just sit in it).

I know these are not good reactions.... tbh it is not the person I want to be and strive every day to be better than my parents and before all this medical stuff I never did anything like this.....

In those moments I will look in the mirror, smile and feel genuine joy as I say “you’re going to die” to myself in the mirror. 
I think about how there’s no knowing at what pace our galaxy moves through the universe, where I am and how fast I’m going. And within that, time is relative and I get this sort of absurd existential mania as a consciousness that cannot understand even itself

Lately I've been noticing that after social interactions I can't stop thinking about the ways I ""messed up"". And even though I'm able to convince myself logically that it wasn't that bad and that people don't hate me for it, I keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think I'm a terrible person.

I can't stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and I try to distract myself from these thoughts, but they always come back and then they won't leave me alone. I've talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that I currently can't stop thinking about and they reassure me that it's not that bad which helps for a while but then I go back to thinking that I made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it's okay.

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

244,Does anyone else have these issues? TW suicidal thoughts and self harm,"Form when I was 18 (27 now) I have been dealing with the inability to really feel genuine joy from just about anything that I use to love ( making music/outdoor activities/etc) or really connect with people on an emotional level. I also have these entrenched thoughts that when I meet people (especially other men) that they are going to betray me or hurt me in some way that I can’t get rid of. I have experienced points where I have minutes to hours of my day that I simply can’t remember. For example when I was in my freshman year of college, my girlfriend at time and her mother bombarded me for over three hours because I went to a party the night before and got drunk. I don’t remember when the harassment stopped but I remember hearing this static noise that just got louder and louder and what sounded like a 12 year old boy telling me to jump out my window and other really negative things about everyone I knew and myself. I must have blacked out because when I came to I had completely destroyed my dorm room and heard my roommate trying to open the door. Ever since that incident I have random moments when that same static and voice telling me to kill myself or commenting on something that I am doing (almost always in a negative way). It almost feels like I can have a full conversation with this voice. The most recent episode was a few days ago where I had a pretty heated argument with my wife but nothing I was saying made an sense or had nothing to do with what we were arguing about like I was having the argument with someone who wasn’t there. I went to take a shower and was suddenly on the toilet and had cut my wrist pretty bad with a pair of scissors. My wife has told me on several occasions that when she asks me a question or tries to talk to me that responses don’t make sense. I have seriously considered suicide before but it has never progressed passed thoughts. I have told my wife about the issues which makes me feel a little better because she has been nothing but supportive. I have considered going to a medical professional several times but every time I get this overwhelming feeling of dread and the voice telling me that they are going to lock me up and take away my family from me which stops me from going all together. It also doesn’t help that mental illness is severely frowned upon in both my wife and I’s families and in my career field (grounds for dismissal). I feel like I am constantly stuck in a mental whirlwind of torture and I need to know if anyone on here knows what might be wrong with me or has the same issues that I have. Hopefully I will have an appointment with a psychiatrist in the next week or so."

249,Was I experiencing an anxiety attack?,"⚠️TW Suicide⚠️

Ok so I‘m a bit confused on what happened to me yesterday. 

For instance my best friend tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago. She locked herself in the bathroom and tried to slit her wrists. Her best friend (I‘ll call him J. ) was there and he managed to save her before I arrived. I comforted her afterwards and made sure she wasn’t alone the whole time. When we talked about it a few days later she told me that she will try it again and we won‘t be able to save her this time. I haven‘t really slept since, bc I‘m afraid of waking up to a suicide note text. 

So now to what happened yesterday. Our friend E. had a party with I‘d say about 30 people. Me and J. have held contact in the past few weeks because it was stressing him out a lot too. We were outside talking and kinda comforting each other while getting more and more drunk.(It was my first time getting drunk since the attempt) She talked to some other dudes in that time (also friends of her). Eventually she went inside with them and I didn‘t think much of it those are people she can trust. So J. and I stayed outside for a while. When we went inside she was gone. I texted her and got no answer. I called her and still no answer. I started asking people if they had seen her and when nobody had, I started getting worried. E. then told me she could be in the bathroom since it‘s been locked for half an hour and he can‘t get inside. So I immediately got J. and we tried getting into the bathroom. She ignored calls and texts. After about 10 minutes she opened the door asking if we have lost our minds. She was completely okay. Her and the two dudes just locked themselves in there to chill out a bit.  

So when we walked back to the party again we were completely silent. Both of us didn’t say one word. J‘s favourite song was on but he didn’t even react to it (which he usually does) we just went outside. His friend noticed that something was wrong bc he didn’t react to the song at all. I was just sitting there and staring into the void. I wanted to cry so bad but I just couldn’t. J. and his friend went a little bit away and I could hear parts of what they were talking. And then I heard J. crying uncontrollably. I‘ve known him for over two years now and I know him pretty well but I‘ve never seen him cry or even expressing his feelings. It went on for half an hour. I was just sitting there unable to move or cry. Around that time I started noticing that I couldn’t really see properly at some times. It was just all a blurry image and didn‘t feel real at all. When J. calmed down his friend went back inside and he just sat there and stared into the void just like I did. At some point he went into the garden and I heard him hitting something with a stick repeatedly. At that time I really wanted to cry so bad but I just couldn’t. When he came back he seemed like himself again. He looked at me and asked me if I was ok. I simply said no. He sat down next to me and then I finally started crying. He hugged me and comforted me. And at some point my legs started shaking really bad. I didn’t even notice it until he pointed it out. I also didn‘t notice that I was breathing very shortly and he thought I was hyperventilating. I wasn‘t even really crying anymore I was just shaking and breathing weird. He tried to calm me down and helped me with my breathing. He covered me in a blanked and asked me if i was cold. I wasn‘t I just couldn’t stop shaking. Other people started to notice. J. asked E. to bring everyone inside. But then my best friend came out and as soon as I heard her voice asking if I was ok I started to cry again and he told her to leave. I was just in his arms not being able to breathe properly or stop shaking. He really helped me a lot I don‘t know what would have happened if he wasn‘t there. But it just didn‘t get better at all. I‘ve had a crush on him for over a year now one could think that being in his arms would help me calm down but it just didn‘t. 

At some point he brought me upstairs. E. prepared a bed for us in a room where we would be alone. He had his arms around me telling me how strong I am and that I have to look out for myself too. I never had the feeling that I wasn‘t getting enough air or something but breathing normally wasn’t possible. The shaking was so intense that eventually it even started to hurt. I think until i was relatively calm again it took 3 hours. He was there the whole time having his arms around me. 

When it was time to go home i was still shaking a little bit and my legs really hurt. I slept at my best friends place that night and she didn‘t even notice what really happened. She even was in a good mood. She thought we just cuddled and that I was shaking because I was cold. She obviously knows that he‘s my crush (he doesn’t) so i think she didn’t think much of all that. I couldn‘t sleep all night and went home pretty early. While I‘m writing this I‘m shaking again. My legs still hurt. 

Was that an anxiety attack? I‘ve never experienced anything like that in my life and I can‘t really find anything online. I‘d appreciate it if anyone could help me."
250,I don’t remember much of my (4-11 y/o) childhood,"I don’t remember much of my childhood from age 4-11. (I’m 14 now) I do remember some stuff, obviously, but not much. I always hear people talk about their past school experiences but I just don’t remember that much. I remember faces and some experiences and I know the memories are in there somewhere but idk where??? lmao. I sometimes have extreme fear for objects or places for no reason. It’s complicated. I know I was bullied, but not how. I used to have extreme anger issues so maybe that has something to do with it?

252,What should I expect?,"For the past five years I have been dealing with what I believe to be PTSD from a traumatic event. My symptoms have been severe causing me to drop out of society due to  fear and anxiety. Suicidal thoughts have been a consistent, daily, struggle for 5 years. I actually didn’t even put it together as possibly being PTSD until earlier this year when I had a very intense flashback, followed by random panic attacks. I was diagnosed with MDD 8 or 9 years ago and always thought my symptoms were related to that. It very well could be my depression, but this has been so overwhelming that I don’t think it’s that simple. I made an appointment with a random therapist in my city for Monday. I’ve been in therapy before but it was always a waste of time. I want someone who is actually going to have a treatment plan instead of having me come in just to talk about my feelings. What should I do when I see this therapist on Monday? How do I know she isn’t going to be as worthless as all the other ones?"
253,TL;DR I've Had Enough,"Not sure if CW/TW are needed here but yeah...

So I'm a 20 something year old female in London UK. I'm diagnosed with EUPD(BPD) but I'm like 75% sure I'm autistic. Anyway, I suffer with quite severe anxiety and I get pretty depressed every so often. I've been admitted to hospital a couple of times. I'm unable to work at the moment because I keep getting panic attacks, they stopped near the beginning of lockdown for a good 2 months but they're slowly creeping back in. Because I can't work I'm on incapacity benefit, but I'm also homeless because I can't afford to pay rent. I've been sofa surfing for 3 years and I've run out of people who will have me. I don't want to be on the streets, I'm too scared for that. 

But I can't go to the housing office for help because I used my mum's address as my postal address (and that's where my drivers licence says I live and in order to vote in the last election I'm down on the electoral register there and when I was visiting before I ODd so ended up in a hospital there so now I'm registered to a local doctors surgery so they could discharge me with support. 

And it's ruined everything because now they think I live in Medway (which is a place full of unhappy memories and trauma) so I can only be housed there. The only good thing in my life is my rugby club. They are my family, my friends, my support network, my focus and my pride... and Medway is 80+ mi away from them. I can't afford to travel there and back 3 times a week. And my mental health can't cope with being in that awful place. 

I've had enough of how difficult it is just to get by. I want to work (I'm a teacher) and I'll settle for part time and I'll settle for not being a full class teacher. If it means part time tuition or something then sure... but I can't because of the panic attacks and on the wage I'd get I still wouldn't be able to afford rent anywhere. I know I might not be able to afford London rent but even looking at places outside of London like Reading or Basingstoke... but it's not possible. 

Housing is so expensive. It's unobtainable. I can't even afford a room that it's so small the door doesn't open because the single bed takes up all the floor space with a shared bathroom with black mould all over the ceiling and shower. 

It makes me so angry that you can charge £550pcm to share a bedroom with some creep... like you don't even have your own room, just a single bed and you have to sleep with some random iteration in the same room as you. No privacy, no security... and I'm the one that's mental?!"
254,"I’m pretty sure my anxiety is affecting me physically, I’m scared about my future health, and there’s nothing I can do to address it at this time.","Anxiety and depression is something that I always dealt with in the sense that it was just kinda there since I was like 10. I’m pretty sure I was diagnosed with depression and maybe even an anxiety disorder, and have taken several medications for both most of my life.

My anxiety changed drastically in early 2019, when I pretty much had a nervous breakdown. I was such a mess that I wound up dropping out of school because I fell behind to the point that I would have failed most, if not all, of my classes. Some of my professors were willing to work with me, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to make up the work, so I just dropped everything in the hopes of being able to reset mentally.

The root cause of my anxiety then, and for the past ~18 months, is that I started questioning my gender identity. I don’t want to drag out this post, so to keep it brief: I was born male but I experience dysphoria (particularly about body shape/features and not having breasts), sometimes feel more comfortable in feminine clothes and have the desire to present female, and generally feel that I have a more “female” personality. At the very least, I believe that I am genderfluid or non-binary.

Unfortunately, I’ve had to keep all of this to myself. My family is super conservative Christian, and I know from things my parents and sisters have said that they wouldn’t be supportive. If anything, based on recent discussions about someone my family knows who transitioned in which they were referred to as a “weirdo” and “sicko,” I have reason to believe they are straight up transphobic.

So yeah, my anxiety has been through the roof as I have had to navigate all of this by myself. I’m not out to anyone I actually know, and being closeted is really taking its toll.

I still live at home, so that makes it next to impossible to be myself.  I feel guilty about the fact that I’ve been doing a lot of lying about my whereabouts when I’ve gone shopping or had my breasts measured for a bra fitting, and all of the hiding I’ve been doing with the clothes I’ve bought.

Unfortunately, I am also covered by my parents’ health insurance, which means that I can’t see a gender therapist. Even seeing a therapist in general would lead to a lot of prying, and I’m not very good at lying. I doubt I have the means financially to pay out of pocket, if that’s even possible.

I studied sociology and social work, so I have a bit of background in psychology. Through that, I know about the potential physiological affects of anxiety, and I think my near constant anxiety for such an extended period of time is the cause of the gastrointestinal issues I’ve had for around the same amount of time.

But what I’m really worried about is the long term affects. Anxiety is linked to all kinds of awful health issues, and at this point I’m convinced I’m going to die young as a result of one or several of those things if something doesn’t change. I just wish that there was something I could do about it.

I’m sorry this is so long, I just need help."
255,Feeling Bad About Taking Meds,"So I take both sertraline and clomipramine for ocd and I’ve been feeling like I should stop. I read somewhere that it changes who you are, like there’s two different “you’s”, one medicated and one unmedicated which is who you really are. I’m 15 and have taken meds for like 5 years now but I’ve been wanting to stop because I feel so shitty about it, like the meds are the only thing that make me what I am and all."
256,Do I need to see a mental health professional?,"So my mood changes pretty often, sometimes a few times a week, sometimes more/less. I've struggled with a bit of suicidal ideation, it's not a lot but it's always kind of just... there. I know that I don't want to die but I just don't want to feel the way I do when I'm depressed. I have no friends and it's hard for me to trust people. I think that nobody cares about me at all and that's why my self-worth is extremely low. I don't always feel depressed. Sometimes I feel normal, but I'm still aware of how I think people feel about me. Some days I'm more energetic/hyper than usual. So on days that I'm OK, I think that maybe I don't need to see a professional since my depression is pretty sporadic, so I'm like going back-and-forth about it."
257,Days where you cannot bring yourself to do anything besides sleep and lay in bed during quarantine?,"For the most part I've done quite well with the pandemic. I took efforts to get my anxiety and depression under pretty good control last year, so was already on Buspirone before this all started which helps me a lot and also had been in therapy for a while which got me on a good path too. 


For the most part I've done quite well with finding ways to use all this empty time in a positive way, have taken up meditation and go to the gym (safely) quite often, make sure to get outdoors, eat healthy, etc.

But occasionally I get hit with days where I just have zero motivation and sleep a LOT, and spend a lot of the day just on Reddit and Netflix and so on. It's hard to get myself to do the things I regularly make myself do to try to be proactive for my mental health, since the days all have begun to blend together so much.

I know mental health  has dropped considerably for many in these times and I just wondered if that is relatable"
258,I'm afraid and need a way to build up my confidence,"A little info about me, I'm 27 , male,and lvee in pa usa..I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid. And I feel like I'm in an awkward position in my life that I'm not comfortable with. I've tried jobs in the past and I just have not be able to do it. I've pushed myself to the point of losing my way getting thier to interviews and gotten jobs despite visibly having panic attacks during the interview process. Not many times but a few starting from when I was 17 till now and I'm 28. Long story short I never kept a job over 2 months. I cant handle the stress, drama, bosses, customers, all of it. I mentally break down and start crying out of nowhere cant keep up with being thrown in and expected to perform etc.

 My last job I tried was landscaping and I felt pretty good about it after the stress of the initial period.. And then I was thrown into a team with a crew leader who wanted me to go fast and cut corners and there was a conflict between him and another lady on a separate landscaping crew in the same company . Which I somewhow fell in between on the job sites and it wasn't good. They were fine I'm sure having been going at it like that for years but I couldn't withstand the verbal beating I took as a result of the bickering back and forth about how I was not doing the job.   Anyway that was a couple years ago, 

I've been doing stuff on my pc from my grandparents home since then and had some cool stuff happen. Got brought onto a esports team for small game and made quite a bit of money from that playing at a high level but now that is kind of at risk of dieing out.  My grandfather recently was diagnosed with lung cancer and went through keemo.. they have a farm and animals and I've always helped but even more so recently been forced to take on a lot more. Which is fine with me.  But I'm afraid , I'm not co fident in my ability to function on my own. Although in reality I have a certain amount of experience just from living this long. Socially and work wisev it's not so much .  I've tried therapy and meds in the past and nothing worked . Lost my insurance at 26 and finally just now I got on amerihealth recently . So, I have a lot of physical issues and mental that I dont know where to begin with but I can start making appointments I guess.  Lack of energy, anxiety, focus issues, stomach pain and issues with ibs and stuff , and more.. I guess I'm afraid, I dont feel confident in getting through this . I always was, I always suspected that going on my current path around now things would get really bad for me if ii wasnt successful enough to be self reliant and live on my own.. and now I'm here ."
259,Inside the mind of a suicidal person,"I’m sorry. That’s the overwhelming feeling that occupies the mind. Sorry for not being strong enough to deal with this. Even feeling this way brings unimaginable shame. I’m angry at myself. Angry for being a burden to the people I love. Angry they have to see me this way. Angry I ever let anyone know how I feel. They all have their own problems, it’s unfair for me to put my emotions on them. It’s selfish. Once people know how you feel... they’re no longer there just for you. You become a project to them. Someone they now communicate with because they feel they have to, you become nothing but an obligation. A human should never be brought to feel that low, yet look where we find ourselves. Look at what the mind is capable of believing. Because on the outside you know none of this is real, you know you’re loved, you’re not an obligation; however you can’t believe it. What is that barrier that stops us from believing what we know to be true? Fear. Doubt. A feeling of worthlessness and disdain for yourself. You don’t want to believe what’s real, because you feel you don’t deserve love. You want what you believe you deserve... punishment. Separation from everyone. A longing to be truly alone. You crave it. Your mind eventually inches closer and closer to the only thing that can bring you that satisfaction and longing for emptiness: death. The sweet relief from all pain and worry. Ahhhh... what a beautiful feeling it is to feel nothing at all. Death is bliss."
260,"The thing about mental health issues is that, sometimes you don't know how to live any other way","I've been having serious mental health issues for a good four years now if I'm not wrong. I kind of remember the exact period of time when things started to become lifeless and colourless around me and slowly little things became bigger things, I mean little patterns and the way I thought about myself, they way I saw everything, and I'd say it started with external factors pushing me down this road but it continued for so long because of me. I had a choice to turn my life around but I couldn't - because I started to go through a road of anxiety and depression and I couldn't ask anyone for help. The past two years have been gracious, I was able to get out of the difficult situations in my life but I just couldn't let that feeling go.

But I finally mustered the courage to seek a therapist, ask people for help and support, and I really want to make things better. At first I wasn't aware of what was happening with me and now I do and I want to take action."
261,Can you be traumatized by something YOU have done?,"Long story short, I'm 21 and i already have multiple mental health issues (C-PTSD, chronic depression, possibly Schizoïd Personality Disorder), due to heavy bullying in middle school.

During a summer camp, when i was 14, i had my first and only GF. I never had anyone care about me before then, and i think i started being a bit of a jerk to her, as i could get a little handsy even though i later realized she was embarassed. It was ""just"" that, me letting my hands wander a bit too much, but i still cant stop thinking about what i did, up to this day, and almost every day. I hate what i did, to the point of hitting me (not hard, tho) and getting a bit of anxiety everytime i think about it. 

Also, i now consider myself pretty much asexual and im starting to wonder if that's not related to that. I'd also like to recontact her to apologize for what i did, but i have no idea if she still thinks about it, and i think that it might be better for her if she forgot about it (i wouldnt like her to suffer from it)

As I said, i already have PTSD, and honestly the symptoms are quite similar, but i wanted to know if it  is possible for someone to get PTSD from something they have done to someone else."
262,How must I balance prioritizing myself and also prioritizing my aging parents?,"I have just backed out two weeks ago from a career opportunity that could finally take me out of this mediocre life. Currently, I work as an underpaid healthworker swabbing confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients in my country. I still get flashbacks from my previous breakdown. I feel like a disappointment to my parents. All I ever wished for was to pay them back for the years they have spent financially on me (i.e. school). My parents never pressured me or anything, by the way, it's just my thoughts making me sad and all.

Tl;dr I refused a job that pays more because I think I wouldn't be happy there and I accepted a low-paying job that somehow makes me feel satisfied, but I want to adequately finance my parents and now I can't."

264,Thoughts on Video Chat Therapy,"I’m finally ready to see a therapist again after not seeing one for 4-5 years and because of the pandemic my sessions are going to be through video chat. I am really nervous about that because I’m not sure I feel comfortable in my own home to talk about things that will make me so vulnerable, especially to a new person i have never met. Has anyone else done video chat therapy? If so what are your thoughts on it and is there a way to make it better and more comfortable? Thanks in advance!"
265,I’m struggling and need to vent badly.,"I literally don’t have any friends. I moved out of California and to Arizona. I don’t know how to drive, don’t have money because I don’t have a job. My social security has been fucking me so I can’t get a job or my Arizona ID. I just got over food poisoning. My aunt and uncle went to Vegas for my aunts birthday, my cousin is out with her boyfriend at the lake. I’m stuck in bed and haven’t eaten all day. I wanna go out and get food but it’s 110 and it not a good idea to go out and walk. I’m slipping back into a hole I have fought so hard to get out of. I want to cry but I haven’t gotten myself to do so."
266,Update on luna,"Few days ago I posted this:
PLEASE I'M TERRIFIED FOR HER. Hi, my friend luna tried posting but it's not showing up so this is her message. Copy and pasted. (I'm 15)

Hi, I'm new to Reddit so please be gentle with me. Anyways, my name is Luna, I'm 16 and live in Poland. So, my problem is that I live in a abusive household with very toxic parents and brother and I want to get out of our house right now. My parents have been abusing me verbally and physically almost my entire life, and I have had thought about commiting su*cide but I truly don't want to harm myself because I found a very good friend (That's a different story) and I don't want to hurt him. I truly don't know what to do with myself anymore. Please, answer me. Thank you guys.


(This part is me not her) I suggested because she wants to move country badly and has a few career paths in mind (Psychologist, dancer, actor), I thought she could move to the UK where I live to study at college or university. She loves to game (dunno if that means anything here).
Please help her. I'll message every comment to her ❤️.

Me now: there was other stuff like she got raped my her brother and severely beat.
Her dad beat her brother and chucked him out the house, she is feeling much better now. However she is very traumatised. I want to be able to raise money for her but can't set up a gofundme."
267,Strange Situation,"I don’t really know why I have came to a mental health reddit but it seemed to be one of my best options. Recently what I have been experiencing over the past few months since lockdown is unusual to me. 
I started off daydreaming a lot about myself in better scenarios with people who don’t exist just pretending and making up stories in my head. Keep in mind this is just to pass the time.  But nowadays it’s all I do. I can’t not zone out. It’s at the point where I don’t even enjoy doing real life activities because I have all of these weird stories in my head of an ideal life and real life just seems very dull now.  Has anyone else ever experienced this.  Sorry for poor explanation."
268,"Does anyone else ""stress laugh/smile"", or am i just strange?","I've been through a lot of things growing up, and one of the main coping mechanisms i've developed is to laugh or smile when stressed or uncomfortable. Its hella awkward and i can't control it at all.

I've heard of stress laughing being a real thing, but my husband doesn't believe that it is and often uses my coping mechanism as ""you're laughing so it must be okay"". It's not okay, but i can't seem to convince him that stress laughter is a real coping mechanism and an uncontrollable one at that. If anyone else here experiences the same thing, i'll show this post to him to make a point. This really bugs me, because some of the things that make me stress laugh are real stress factors and i can't control how my body reacts to them."
269,Prozac,"I am reaching out to others here who have been diagnosed with clinical depression. If you were prescribed Prozac could you share your experiences with taking the medication? How did it impact your mood, focus, general state of mind, happiness, suicidal thoughts? How long did you take it for and were you ever able to get off of it? How much did it cost you per month to buy the medicine? I have been prescribed a mild dose of Prozac and wanted to hear other people's experiences. I have been clinically depressed for sometime and much of it has to do with a heavily toxic work environment and having little social support living in a rural town. My family doesn't understand the support that someone with depression needs which doesn't help either. Have people on this forum found a way to get out of their depression without taking medication? What worked and did not work for you? Thank you so much for your help."
270,I’m tired of feeling like this. How do I change?,"
I’m 19 and in college. When I started my second semester of college in January I remember not being as happy as I was during the first semester. Since then everything has gone downhill.

I don’t care about anything anymore. I’ve lost motivation for doing homework. I feel like I’m too dumb for the major. I’ve been passionate about my major for 2 years. I give absolute zero shits about it now.

I used to love baking and reading and don’t even do that anymore. Everything is a chore for me. I can’t concentrate on my homework for more than 10mins and end up letting everything pile up to the last minute and rush to finish it.

I used to love going to work, but it hurts every minute is struggle. I feel like every bit of my soul is being pulled  away every second in there. Being around people is draining to me. Every social interaction is bad I always mess up. I know everyone at work hates me even the people who do like me hates me but is just nice. 

Every time I walk into that building I get impending doom. You know how hard is it to be in a building for 12 hrs when when the 20 people there hate you?  Everything nice people say to me is a lies. They don’t think I know that they’re lying (I know that’s irrational but my brain makes me think this).

I can sleep for 12 hrs and still be tired. Some days I get enough motivation to do something and the rest of the days I feel like doing nothing.

I hate everything I once loved. I just want to stay in bed a listen to music and waste away.
I don’t feel anything anymore.

If I just died in my sleep so I wouldn’t have to wake up and annoy people with my presence that would be good."
271,"(Anxious depression) I feel like my S/O doesn't get me, and I feel like a burden","Hi,

I've been struggling with gradually worsening depression since the beginning of the pandemic, and as those of you who struggle with it know it comes with feelings of self doubt, self loathing, physical exhaustion and lethargy, not being able to do much, not being able to focus. So I haven't been going out much, and I haven't been seeing anyone but my boyfriend. And he's working on weekdays, and takes care of his daughter on the weekends. So he's a pretty busy person who has his shit together, when compared to me. He's been very supportive and he's the one that encouraged me to start seeking professional help in the first place. However lately I feel like he sees me as a disfunctional person who ""does this to themself on purpose, as self sabotage"". Well yes, but I don't want my mind to be self destructive either, I wish I could control it. Anyways. Today I called him when I was feeling overwhelmed, and he told me I should get out of the house, not do this to myself, go out and see some friends or at least take a walk. I know he intends well, but I felt so misunderstood, and as if he sees me as a child, a disfunctional being that requires ""a push in the right direction"". (He's also 10 years older than me, so this part has become an extra insecurity during these fragile times.) I already hate being in this situation and wish I was in the place to go out and do stuff, and occupy my mind with things other than my insecurities, past, future, etc. I just feel alone, and as if nobody around me truly understands me. It's extra lonesome during the pandemic because a lot of my friends have gone to their hometowns while I stayed in the city where I go to college. I almost exclusively get to see my partner, and he's extremely busy, or otherwise trying to give me advice that is simply not helpful. I don't know what to do."
272,What sort of mental condition do I have if I’m incredibly anxious and upset over having touched something highly unsanitary?,"So basically I touched a bottle of vodka that a homeless person was trying to steal, it was left on the ground and I picked it up to hand it to the security guard but then realized that it’s very gross because the bottle was on the homeless guy in a wheelchair. I saw there was some dirt on my hand after that. I rushed home and scrubbed my left hand and arm with a sponge and soap, and Clorox wipes. What sort of mental condition is this? Keep in mind I’m obsessing over this. I think this way often about stuff."
273,I'm (16M) just gonna let out my deal with an issue here so i can sleep at night without feeling bad about myself,"1) Forgive me for any mistake or error as im not from a english speaking country .
2) Not sure which flair to post as Im in a mix of venting out my emotion , asking advices and thoughts , .
Q : Why didnt I tell anyone except for my 4 friends ?
A : I wanna remain anonymous and those 4 friends wont rat out anyone .
Backstory : This happened back in March (before covid) But i elected to keep quiet as idk if i should say anything , I told my 4 friends that i met last year (When i was 15) . Alright , back in March I attempted to kill myself (again) but couldn't do it . My mom  came into my room and saw me sitting at the window (i live in the 7th floor of an 8 floor apartment) with my feel hanging out the window . She literally prevented my suicide by threatening me that she will kill me herself if i didn't crawl my sorry back to the bed . So i did and that was the end of it , still wondering what would happen if i actually jumped after she said that .
Q : You may be asking why do u wanna kill yourself ? A : Well its kinda complected . I wanted to kms again because I had a short fight with another kid in my class (who was a actual gangster , i think the gang is called 03) . It wasn't much of a fight but more of a he punch me in the face so i took of my shoe and threw it at his face , we almost actually fight but i saw a teacher climbing up the staircase (my class is on the 2nd floor of a 3 floor school) and walking to the right hallway so i stop cuz i know non of the class are gonna rat out this fight of we stopped rn and i dont have to go to the discipline room for a petty fight like this . 
Q : Why did we fight ? 
A : Cuz I was in a bad mood that day (due to me remembering my oast trauma) , he kicked me that day during recess and he has been harassing me , taking my stuff and not returning it for quite a while so i got hella mad that day and i let my emotion take over me called him the most popular derogatory word (you guessed it the n-word , with a -a not a -er) and thats why the ""fight"" broke out .
Q : Why didn't i told any teacher ? W
A : Well i did , i wrote a letter to my maths teacher (who was also a disciplinary teacher) explaining the situation , well fast forward a few days later nothing happened , so yeah . 
Q : Why did I only consult that group of friends i known last year?
Backstory : As to why i told the 4 of them about my issue even though we only actually known each other properly for 1 year , well 3 of them are going thru issues as well ( 2 of them are living with their mom as their parents divorced , the friend that consulted me has mom has cancer , not sure what cancer , i didn't ask him cus that private stuff) and the last dude , well he didn't have any apparent problem but he is a great listener) 
A : Because I dont think Any other friends would understand it . The friends that i made at 14 , well all but one of them didn't do anything to make me hate them for a while . What did they do ? Well they told the entire class before i came to school to ignore my existence for 1 day to see how would i feel . After that incident idk if i can ever trust them again with my private issue . And the Friends i made when i first came to highschool (13) , well they wpuld always rat out whatever I told them to their other friends so that is a no-go . 
Q : Why didnt I consult my parents ? 
A : Because parents and my mom's garndma is one of the problem . He would beat me up if i fked up on something . Like last year around Nov , He wanted me to help him carry a metal frame into the house , so i did and when i grip the thing wrongly and almost dropped it (my fault) , he put down the frame and punched me in the arm , I fell down the floor pretending it was painful so he punched me very hard , twice in the side as a reminder that I dont fake how painful a punch was . He also kicked me out of the house once (When i was 12) because he scold me and said that it was my fault that he didn't win the lotto , my mom managed to convince him to invite me back to the house (Technically I deserved that cuz when he didn't get the winning number he told me to get out the house immediately , I thought he was serious so i packed my stuff , he got really mad and actually kicked me out) . My mom when i was 11 locked me at my grandmother's house after an argument , My uncle (my mom's younger brother) quickly open the door and told me to be fast , well i was too slow as she shut the elevator door on me . I ran down the stairs (16 Floors) To try to get to her and when i did she drove off without me (she came back later but how was I suppose to know ? So I climb back the 16 floors , took me 5 minutes to reach my granma's house) and i saw her shoes there , I thought she hated me for that so i walked down the stairs and tried to walk my way back on foot , well i didnt get very far , As I walked to the nearby police station she appeared and told me to gtf in the car , she scold me in the car and said that i had to explain to the police what happened (thankfully I didnt have to do anything) cus she thought i got kidnapped . And my grandma , well between the ages of 9~12 she would always whip me with a bamboo cane if i didn't wake up from my nap on time , i loved her but i hated that she did that to me . 
Q : Child Protective Services , Mental Health Care ? 
A : I dont think that exist in south east asia ( I live in Malaysia) 
Q : Is your family abusive ? 
A : No , they were just brought up that way , but if i were to have any children , i definitely would not treat them like how s.e.a parents treated their kids . I want stop this cycle of abuse to keep going on . 
Q : Did any other factors contributed to how i act now ? 
A : Yes , between year 2013 (9½) ~ 2016 (12¼) I was bullied by 3 students . Since I was taken home by an uncle who rode a van (Its common for parents to pay Uncles and Aunties as a driver to drive their kids home , you may think that wont it be risky to do so , well yeah , but people normally dont just drive back 4 or 5 students , they drive back around a class full of students in 1 or 2 rounds to save on gas and earn more profit) . So yeah During those 3 years , since our Standard/year would release class early , It is just me and those 3 that have nothing to do . The leader , accused me of taking a large sum of money and not returning it , she said if i dont let her and her friends to whip her with a bamboo cane (uncle's) for an unknown amount of time (They would whip me until the other standard are released) So that went on for years until i was 12 , I wrote a sucide letter and tried to jump off the window of my apartment but i couldn't do it as im scared that i would break my parents heart . So i told my mom that the 3 were bullying me , Mom confronted the uncle and told him something (I couldn't remember what) , and promptly told him that i ain't sitting on that van again . She ask if i had any friends who could take me home  (thankfully i did and that brought an end to my primary school suffering) . 
Idk how to tl;dr this ."
274,I’m in a dark place.,"I’m so tired of it all. 
I keep everyone I know so far from me. I haven’t actually felt anything that hasn’t been put on for other people in so long. I haven’t cried for years. I lie to everyone I talk to, it just happens, and I get some sick fucking buzz from it. 
Every night I think about how people would act without me, and how little it’d matter. 
Anything my “friends” know about me is a complete fabrication. I’m getting so irrationally angry at people, I can just imagine beating the shit out of them. And it feels so good. 
I’m just so lost."
275,Does anyone else experience hallucinating tears?,"I've been bipolar for a few years now and during my lower points I like to cry it out as a way to cope. However, around the end of last year I started crying less, as in my crying episodes went from being an hour to 5-10 minutes. It then came down to 2-ish minutes, and I've found myself unable to cry at all now. I feel all the sadness and pain as usual but I can't let it out. Recently, I've started experiencing a really strange phenomenon; I would go into an episode peak and I would feel tears coming out and streaming down my face. But when I go to wipe them away, my face is completely dry? I was excited to be able to cry again but now I'm just confused, has anyone else ever had this happen?"
276,When am I supposed to kill myself?,My life is fucked and has always been. I'm obviously cursed and a stain on this world. So when do I remove myself? The world is clearly telling me it doesn't give a fuck about me. No one cares if I die but if it became a murder-suicide thing then suddenly they give a shit because other people are involved.
277,Help checking in on a friend,"Hi y’all. A friend of mine had a bit of a melt down earlier this week, sharing incredibly personal and scary things on his story and posts on socials. I checked in on him a few times that day, and he kept assuring me that he was fine, but his posts spoke a different story including one about suicide and one saying that the hospital was the “next stop”. Now he has been radio silent on social media since Tuesday afternoon. I texted him on Wednesday to check in, and he didn’t answer. Same on Thursday, Friday, and today. The texts delivered, so I know his phone is on, but he hasn’t answered.

I told him on Thursday in my “check in” text that I was going to continue to check in until he got “super annoyed and tell(s) me to fuck off” but I don’t know how to keep doing it without repeating myself. I don’t want to keep saying “checking in because I care about you” so I’m looking for other things to say to remind him that I’m thinking about him but not necessarily in as many words. More fun things, maybe? 

Any ideas or suggestions? Insight?"
278,Started self bruising again but not doing cutting or anything dangerous. Is this wrong if it helps me not have as much suicidal ideation?,"By accident injured myself (instantly swelled up and turned purple), I guess I wasn’t immune to the pain so I felt it, and bruised everywhere in new spots. It felt really good and I thought I couldn’t walk until I got upset with my family &amp; ended up walking on it for hours after that night to release stress. Didn’t take anything with me and just ran out of the place I was in &amp; came home eventually at 11pm. Lol I guess physical pain is less than emotional pain. Completely forgot about it because of my emotional pain. Kinda weird how pain balances out. I realized that the pain helped me cope today &amp; went back to self brushing. Not really self harm but is this so wrong? It’s been helping and idk why I stopped cause it really helps. I just possibly can’t do it this week coming up cause people will see so it sucks. And I can only use so many excuses."
279,Feel like I need to cry but I can’t,Wish I could cry cause I’m finally alone in my room. My stomach just hurts more and I wish I could just cry. So angry and hurt with people I thought were my family and loved me.
280,Suicide thoughts,"I’m 23 year old female. I’ve been through a lot which everyone could say they have. For example my parents got divorced when I was one, my dad was an alcoholic most of my life, i got bullied through out school mostly high school and I’ve had anxiety since I was a little girl. I can’t even remember what age. I’ve always had insecurity issues and anxiety my whole life. I got into an abusive relationship from 15-20 years old and got into a near death experience when my ex tried to kill me so I do have ptsd from that as well. After my 5 year relationship I got into severe depression where I would eat and sleep A LOT. Now I’m with an amazing man that’s my soulmate and is an amazing support but recently all my anxiety is coming back and I’ve been having anger outbursts that turn into panic attacks. Then I have these thought loops about absurd things that would never even happen and they won’t stop then I feel like I can’t control my mind or myself and that I’m going crazy and I just want it all to end to the point where I want to hurt myself but I know I would never kill myself because of my family or my boyfriend. I JUST NEED MY HEAD TO STOP OVERTHINKING. I have an appointment for a therapist and I’m hoping this will help but anyone have any tips or feel this way or no why I’m feeling this way when I’ve never had suicidal thoughts like this before?"
281,My grandma just told me my weight is embarrassing,"Just wanted to talk about what happened some minutes ago because it’s making me feel like crap lol.

So I’m fat, since I was a child I’ve been self conscious, kids at my school (and family) always pointed out my imperfections with later turned to insecurities; I was bullied by my best friends in 5th grade when I was 10-11 which them turned to some kind of depression? And also gave me some suicidal thoughts and a suicide attempt (no one noticed since I regretted it halfway and stopped before I could do anything more dangerous). It’s been some years since that but I’m still feeling like that, and because of this pandemic I’ve had more suicidal thoughts and insomnia, which just basically made me a time bomb lmao, long story short, I have COVID and my grandma was making an appointment with a doctor, and asked for my weight, I just said “I don’t know, it’s 70kg I think” and she assumed it was because I was lazy and didn’t want to weight myself, but it’s because I don’t want to know my weight, she forced me to weigh myself and I was right, and THEN, SHE HAS THE AUDACITY TO SAY IN FRONT OF ME AND MY MOM “Oh, I told the doctor you weighed 68kg because I was embarrassed you weighed that much” LIKE EXCUSE ME?!, then I went to the bathroom, cried for half and hour (because my brain heard it as a synonym for “you’re fat and that makes you an embarrassment)”). Anyways, hope your day is better than mine, take care and wear a mask 💖."
282,How’s the best way to tell friends I’m struggling?,I’ve struggled for years and have kept it secret from my friends. I keep telling them I’m ok when I’m not. I want to tell them but I’m scared of their judgments.
283,I ruin everything.,"It seems no matter how hard I try to connect with people and form real relationships both my disability and mental illness work in tandem to make me look as weak and pathetic as possible. I can’t hear people well so I often have to ask people over and over what they said making me look dumb. Then my ADHD makes it so even if I can hear them I can’t pay attention because there is snippets of YouTube videos, ideas for conversation topics, ideas for writing projects, and self-dialogue all fighting to be focused on in my head. Then my anxiety makes it so even if I pay attention and I can hear them I never sure how to react and how they will react to what I’m saying and I am never satisfied with how they react. Finally, my depression makes it so even if I can hear, pay attention, and am relatively certain of what I’m saying, it doesn’t matter because I didn’t get out of bed yesterday to wash my hair and now relationships don’t matter anymore because they think I’m gross."
284,People dragging me down again,"So I have been getting better from my depression and anxiety but my absolute best friend is keeping me from growing. Every day she has to remind me of what depression feels like and she coppies all of my mental illnesses as well as everything I do even though she's never been diagnosed, is the most loud and energetic person I've met, coppies my personality and style and has admitted to this and was perfectly fine until i told her about my therapy. She has to tell me her struggles but in a way that she acts as if I have no idea how she feels and that I've never gone through that. But I have. Ive come back from being suicidal and I dont want to be pulled back. Being around her is draining and she makes everything about her. She said that without me she wouldve probably killed herself and she would kill herself if i left her. She's really toxic but she's also really nice to me. She said she tried cutting because I was doing it. And then she goes and makes FUN of all my anxiety attacks. I lowkey hate her but I cant just dump her or she will kill herself. I have no idea what to do. She's really keeping me from growing.

Summary: my best friend is keeping me from  growing and said she would kill herself without me."

287,How do I become happy again,"I want to be happy,.I have forgotten hot to feel good about myself, I don't know what to do because I feel myself going down again and i don't like it.. please help, how do i become happy again?"
288,I trick for those who feel depressed.,"A few days ago I was feeling depressed and dissatisfied with my life that's when I discovered a new coping mechanism.
So when you feel like that try thinking of some accomplishments big or small, for example.

1. I lost 78 lbs in 25 week where last time if took me 2 2. years to lose 50 lbs.
I'm commuting to work on bike (10 km one way)
3. I made it past my probation at work.
4. I'm going to be working in town (worked in the oilsands and I've been trying to get out for years.)
5. I read all The Walking Dead.

I managed to feel better and some excitement in my life, it may not work for everyone but I can help some."
289,Not sure what’s wrong with me but it’s ruining my life,"I hope I’m posting this correctly and to the right subreddit, and if I’m not please let me know and I will readjust accordingly. 

I want to start off by saying that I’m in no way asking for a diagnosis, and I am not trying to self diagnose myself. I just want some insight and maybe some resources (helpful articles, etc.) on what’s going on in my head. I haven’t seen a therapist in about 3 years due to me moving, and I’ve procrastinated finding a new therapist for multiple reasons including: A) Having to go through my extensive list of mental trauma sounds exhausting, especially if I have to do it multiple times until I find someone I vibe with, and B) I no longer have insurance. 

So, to help me get a grasp on my mental health until I’m able to budget in regular therapy sessions again, I was hoping to just get some opinions and ideas. AGAIN, I am not asking for a diagnosis of any kind, just ideas or maybe some tendencies I may have. This is purely for education. 

What I was diagnosed with a few years ago was just generalized anxiety, depression, and I showed signs of executive dysfunction. I was prescribed accordingly, and that was that. Had to come off the medications since I was moving... anyway, moving on. 

I wish I were exaggerating when I say that whatever is happening inside my brain is ruining my life. I always seem to set standards for myself before doing anything else, and then I don’t have the energy or motivation to perform said standards. For example, I want to watch a movie, but I cannot watch that movie until I clear off the trash from my nightstand, scrub and clean my cat’s water fountain, and put my laundry away. I don’t have the energy to do all of these things so I stay in bed miserable because I cannot function until I do those things. Another example: I want to light my candle but I can’t light my candle until I’ve completed all productive tasks for the day... because I guess in my head lighting a candle symbolizes completion, and if I light it under any other circumstances it just doesn’t feel right... it’s hard to explain. It’s almost like I can’t allow myself to enjoy things like watching a movie or lighting candle until I complete this random to do list in my head. 

In addition to my already horrible anxiety, I feel like my brain gives me ultimatums (if that’s the right word) for the most ridiculous things. “Go back upstairs and put that shoe back in the corner where the other one is. Someone is gonna trip on it and it will be your fault.” “You didn’t hang your shirt up in its usual spot, you’re going to have bad luck now until you adjust it.” 

Sometimes it’s so bad that I’ve shown up to work late before because I had to turn around and go back home because I swore I left my curling iron plugged in and I thought my apartment was gonna burn down. I literally could not restrain myself; I was struggling to breathe and couldn’t focus unless I went back. (Yes, it was unplugged.) 

There are also times when I will see something with my own eyes, and a second later my brain will say “check again”, “check again”, “one more time”, “op—one more time”, and it will go on and on. Sometimes I need to ask my friends or family to verify things because I just don’t trust myself anymore. This makes me laugh now, but I just started a new job and was told to be there this past Monday at 8:30am. I sat in the parking lot from ~8:15-8:30 convinced that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I checked the email several times and still kept staring at the doors, then checked my calendar several times to make sure it was this Monday and not next Monday.

Anyway. If it’s not already obvious, it may seem like I have some OCD tendencies. So then why am I here if I already have a general idea of what I would want to talk to my future psychiatrist about? Because now I’m convinced I don’t actually have these tendencies and I’m just acting. I feel this way because I didn’t really understand what OCD was until I met a friend who happened to have it. I did some research, not because I thought I might have it, but because I wanted to educate myself so that I could better understand my friend’s habits and behaviors. I wanted to make sure I was being mindful of how I approach them, (Being very direct to avoid causing them to overthink as much as I can, reassuring them when they need it, etc.) As I was researching, I did notice some behaviors similar to my own, but I tried not to think much of it. I’ve noticed I tend to convince myself that I have things wrong with me a lot, and I didn’t want to set myself down that path. It was too late, though, because ever since then I’ve just been noticing my behaviors more and more. 

And now I just think I’m faking it all. “You’re just acting this way because your friend has it and you doing this is some strange tactic to establish a bond with them.”

Lately I’ve been asking myself... Did I have these symptoms before I learned about OCD? Is this even OCD or is it just really bad anxiety and I’m trying to find a better fitting label for it, so I’m acting accordingly? 

You know how when you meet new people, you eventually adopt some of their speech patterns or small quirks without noticing? It’s totally harmless and normal (wait... this is normal right?) and we don’t think much of it... it can even be endearing sometimes. Well, I now feel like I do this with some mental illnesses. Which... who in their right mind would want a mental illness of any kind? I don’t even know. All I know is that it’s ruining my day to day life and I wish I could finally understand what’s going on so I can learn to cope with it... whether it’s anxiety, OCD, or some weird copycat behavior."
290,"Food doesn't taste good anymore, google claims it's a symptom of depression","I know, I know. Never trust the internet. A lot has been happening with my body recently and every time I go to Google it's always a symptom of depression. When I was 13 a psychiatrist made me take a test and it said I had severe depression too. Nothing's ever been done about it like a diagnosis or medication but things keep getting worse. My period is getting delayed constantly (as a trans guy you'd think I would be happy with that, but it's like you can feel the estrogen building up and up and up and I hate it), food doesn't taste good even though I could never tell when I was hungry in the first place, my sleep is out of whack (has been since I was 7), my weight is going all over the place (I have a bad relationship with my weight so this isn't good) and I find myself wanting so SH a lot more. Idk, I should feel something, I should be able to tell. I should feel like I'm on the same planet as you guys. I get a fair few numb or sad periods, the more recent ones have been lasting months at a time. Should I see about getting a diagnosis and possibly meds? I've tried therapy but it's a bunch of pointless talking to me. I don't cry or get any of my feelings out, I'm just recounting events and my annoyance at this world and the people living in it.

I'm turning 16 soon, I don't want to live like this."
291,TICHAGNED MY MINDI AM THE BEST PERSON GOD OMPNIPTENT TIN THE UNIVERSE,trhjoiahngai/ kl
292,do certain octaves in songs throw you into a panic attack as well?,"so i was on tiktok and a video came across my for you page where this person was singing a more chilling, folk type song - i'm usually really into that but there were certain notes they hit (higher pitched, maybe a sharp C6 or around that octave, i'm not the best at identifying notes) that just threw me into a complete panic attack - not the type where i'm like ""oh i'm a little nervous, weird"" it was full on ""i feel like i'm in danger, i don't understand why this feels so bad""

for additional context, i don't have any stims that i'm really aware of (nothing has really effected me at all in a way like this before) - i do have anxiety and depression though so i'm not sure if that's effect it or not.

does anyone else have certain octaves or notes that physically effect you like that?"
293,Stupid anxiety!,"In the past three or so years when I get super stressed out or frustrated I stutter and stumble with my words a lot. Also if I’m super excited or happy about something. I never used to do it, but I deal I guess. It’s super annoying, but when I recognize myself doing that I know how to calm down, stop trying to talk, and try again. It may take a few tries, but it’s mostly just embarrassing, no harm done. My immediate family have gotten used to it cause I explained why it happens sometimes. I’m very lucky to have such a patient family, but extended family I don’t know....

This was a little over a year ago but something happened that I still stress about. Probably nobody remembers but It still bugs me an I wanted to tell someone. 
I was visiting family and one evening had a panic attack. I don’t recall what triggered it, but I know that afterwards I had to pull myself together and go out an eat dinner with everybody. Nobody knows I have issues with stuttering when I’m under a lot of pressure, or anxiety/depression/ptsd in general. So whenever I tried to talk an did that they gave me funny looks. I also feel like I offended my uncle, who has always had a stutter, by just suddenly doing that. I know it’s so stupid, but I was just so worried everyone would think bad about me for some reason? It’s so embarrassing to remember, although I doubt anyone else remembers. Nothing bad was said to me, no consequence or conversation. Ik it’s just my social anxiety, and if I actually have that issue I shouldn’t feel this way, and have nothing to be upset about.... but I do anyway and it’s so annoying. There are so many small moments like this that I just can’t let go of, and it really affects me for some reason. 
Anyway, that’s it. I just wanted to tell someone I suppose, so thanks!"
294,Please help me. I don't know what's going on anymore.,"I'm sorry if this post turns out shitty, but I'm pretty shaken up from what has been happening as of lately. I just want some help and had nowhere else to turn to. My parents couldn't help. My school haven't helped. I have not recieved help from medical professionals. I just want some advice.


About me:

*14yr male
*Sleep schedule is nonexistent
*Mental scarring from constant bullying by students, teachers and adults
*Trust issues
*Low self esteem


Issues:

*Paranoia
*Anxiety
*Seeing and hearing things that aren't there
*Nightmares
*An overall decline in cognitive function and mental health
*Surreal experiences


The paranoia is self-explanatory.

The anxiety is also self-explanatory.

I sometimes see things move past me or hear people saying ""hey"" in a whisper. I don't share a room and the voice isn't recognizable.

The nightmares often include suffering in physical and mental ways. I am oftentimes harmed by guns and sometimes suffocation. Sometimes I feel actual pain, although it is relatively mild. 

Thinking is getting hard and my memory is getting worse, but it's always been terrible.

Yesterday, I went out to eat with my parents and noticed that everyone's face looked familiar, even though I have never met or seen them. Imagine taking a stranger's face and replacing it with a family memeber's face. That's the only way I can put it.


I don't know what's going on. It all feels like some bizarre dream, but I know it's real. I just want to know what's going on. I just want some help, please."

296,Sudden fear of going to sleep?,"So for about two weeks I've been having this massive fear of going to sleep. I have no idea why this is happening all of a sudden and no idea what to do about it.

I've got no reason to feel anxious about anything and throughout the day I feel completely fine. But around 10pm I've just been on the brink of tears scared of sleeping and this doesn't end until about 6am.

I pulled an all nighter last night and its currently almost 4am where I am now with no sign of sleeping soon. I can usually sleep for 1 - 2 hours before waking up and then the fear starts all over again as I try to get back to sleep.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had experienced anything like this and if this is maybe a sign of something else? I've never had anything like this before and it's starting to get kind of worrying.
Thanks for reading."
297,"I don't know what to do or how to even title this, my current mental state is an absolute mess, and I'm sure that I'm a terrible human being at this point with no redeeming qualities whatsoever","These past few months have been super fucking stressful for me, and it all came to a head last night.

Almost a year ago, I met the person that I married(I'll call him my partner, mostly because I don't know what to refer him as, I'll explain that in a bit). We had a very rocky start to our relationship, but that slowly became more amiable as the days went by. I was kicked out from my SIL's house and needed a place to stay, and my partner took me in to his home. I lied like crazy in the beginning of my time there, including saying that I loved him very much, so much in fact that it hurt.

We got into a bit of a fight the next month, and I was preparing to leave and move back in with my grandparents(I moved out earlier that year to live in a different state), but they basically told me that they would not help me until I could help myself. I forgot what I told my partner to let me continue to stay with him(he was already ok with whatever I chose to do, God bless him, he has been nothing but kind and loving to me through all this), but I definitely lied about it. At least I think I did. I honestly don't remember either way, so I'm assuming I lied. 

The months went on, I grew to actually love him, but I kept lying about little things and continued to not do much around the house, and basically being a leech while doing the bare minimum to keep him from kicking me out(even though he has repeatedly told me he would never do that, no matter how bad it got). 

Shit really hit the fan the day after we officially married. The managers of his apartment did an inspection, and even though the apartment was passable, they still overreacted and abused us up until last month, when we fled and are basically homeless in a van and have been for a month or so now. I've continued to do the bare minimum, if that, to keep our lives going and at least semi-comfortable. 

Last night, my partner finally reached his breaking point. All the major and fundamental lies I told him came out, and I completely broke his heart to pieces and he no longer trusts anything I have said or done, even the truthful parts. I do not blaim him at all for feeling that way, nor do I wish to paint myself as the victim here. 

We have come to an agreement this morning that as long as I really do care about him and want to change for the better, I am allowed to stay. If not, I have to leave of my own volition. He says that he still loves me, and I really do think I love him, I just don't trust myself at all and I don't know if anything I think and feel is real at all. My schizoeffective has been acting up all day, and has been compounding my already near-nonexistant self-esteem.

I don't know, I feel like I'm sounding very victimy right now and that is not my intention at all. I just feel like a douchebag of the highest degree and there is nothing I can do to fix that. I don't know what I'm asking for, I just don't know. I don't want sympathy, I just want to fix what I broke and have trust in my life. Death is too kind of a way out for me and does nothing but hurt the living.

I just want harm to none and do no harm. I don't know if any of this makes any sense, I tried to keep it as coherent as possible through the loud screaming in my head muddling up my languaging skills."
298,Does sex help you with your mental health?,"I have been having lots of sex lately and it is great! I love my life. Do you guys feel the same way?

300,My boyfriend’s poor mental health,"I’m dating the love of my life, and I couldn’t be happier about it...however, there is something I have been struggling with lately: his mental health.

He has anxiety, depression and OCD. I have been as supportive as I can, but sometimes it is just bigger than me.

He won’t talk to me, even though he was ok two minutes ago because he feels terrible, and I don’t know what to do. Should I give him space? How do I help him without pushing the situation?

I sometimes feel that I should break up with him, but it just would make everything worse. He would go down, and honestly, I would too. My boyfriend is the love of my life, but he is falling into a hole that I can seem to get him out of.

Am I being selfish? Or impatient? 

The thing that hurts the most is that he doesn’t believe that I love him. But man, I have fallen so deep for him...

Maybe he need something I can’t offer, maybe he would be better off without me? I don’t know what to think, my heart is broken.

I want to help so bad, but he doesn’t allow it. I need to let him know that I’m here, but often I just can’t do anything to fix the issue. 

He has a psychology team that is helping him. But it isn’t working.

This is too much for me to take, but again, leaving him doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.

I’m confused, scared and heartbroken. Please, help me."
301,I dont know anymore,"Hey, I wanted to share how I feel here bc I kinda need  to vent. So since at least last year, I was already feeling worse and worse, for no particular reason really, I was starting to have more and more bad days and breakdowns, at the start of the year I had a really really bad phase bc of many things happening combined. I eventually got better for a brief period of time in febuary, but since then, idk when I really felt happiness for the last time. I was starting to feel more lonely and all I did was distracting me with videogames all day, I just waited till the day ended, cried in bed, went to school, waited for the day to end and so on. It isnt like I lost someone or something horrible happened, its just that I cant be happy. I only have a very few amount of real friends but still no one to really talk to, I feel like no one understands me, even if Im together with people I just feel lonely. Everything just hurts. It got kinda worse the last 2 weeks. Im always sitting at school waiting to come home and let all the tears out. Life doesnt seem worth living anymore, Im having suicidal thoughts and I recently tried to hurt me.i just want to feel normal again.. I cant take it anymore."
302,Dark night of the soul,"I just need some place to talk to someone (that I don’t actually know therefore cannot let down). My whole entire being feels like it is breaking, every day. Around this time last year I had just about had all I could take from life, and after calling suicide prevention hotline for an entire weekend just to stay on the planet, decided I needed major changes. I got into spirituality since I couldn’t afford more therapy (have been in and out since feeling this way at 18). Unfortunately, another traumatic event occurred. Then 2020 began. This one has honestly unhinged me and I’ve just been floundering ever since. I can’t remember the last time I felt okay. I can’t remember what it’s like to laugh and actually feel happy. I can’t go through life feeling like this anymore. When I try to tell people I know that I feel like this, I’m either 1. Not blunt enough and they can’t see what I’m trying to get at 2. Guilt me into “well that hurts my feelings because I care about you”.  I truly don’t know what to do, I call suicide prevention hotline to feel better enough to fall asleep. I am trying and it doesn’t feel like there has been any light at the end of the tunnel. I know there’s nothing any of you can do for me but I just needed a virtual vent space for a second to feel heard I guess."
303,What can I do,[removed]
304,I don’t know if this belongs here but why is getting in trouble always so much more embarrassing when you’re wearing less clothes?,"So I’m 15 (assigned female) and I don’t know why, but all my life I’ve always found it way more embarrassing to get in trouble when I’m wearing less clothes or wearing strange clothes (like costumes or just weird things in general)

I remember when I was about 7 and my cousins (both boys) came over to stay with me, my brother, and my mom and stepdad. I don’t remember the exact reason why, but I’m pretty sure it was because their mom was working night shift at the hospital and their dad probably was too. Anyway, we were all playing together and I thought it was hot so I took my shirt off. I didn’t think too much of it, and my mom didn’t either, since I was 7 and my brother would’ve been 10 or 11 and my cousins would’ve been 6-7 and 9-10. I don’t remember what exactly happened but my stepdad scolded me about something and he was pretty harsh with it, and while I don’t remember exactly what it was for or what I did next, I do remember this weird feeling that I was exposed and looked ridiculous because I was shirtless, even though what he said probably didn’t have to do with my state of dress

Now as I’m older, I wear a lot of shorts and muscle shirts on my weird muscle-less body and any time I’m scolded (probably not the right word) by my mom, it always seems a lot worse than when I’m wearing a sweatshirt or baggy t shirt with sweatpants

Anyway, is this just me? Is there a reason being chided when you’re wearing fewer clothes is more embarrassing? I imagine it has something to do with society condemns female nudity or something but there might also be another reason? I dunno"
305,SSRI Withdrawal,"It looks like I'll be running out of my SSRI, Lexapro, that I've been on for about a year and a half now. I take a daily 20mg dose. I have no primary care or a referral to see a psychiatrist in time to get another prescription in time. 

My plan is to take them until they run out and to weather the withdrawal symptoms. What do I have to look forward to? What will make some of this easier?"
306,why would someone be in a mental hospital for several years?,"i grew up knowing nothing about my family history and because of that i don't know what i'm susceptible to. however, i do know that i have an uncle who has been in a mental hospital for years, i've never met him. i'm very concerned about being susceptible to schizophrenia/psychosis, because i know marijuana use can trigger it. i figured that schizophrenia might be the reason why someone would stay in a mental hospital for that long, but can anyone tell me about this? i'm have no idea how to see if i am at genetic risk for any psychological disorders other than by seeing what my uncle has/asking my dad (who refuses to tell me)."
307,Help?,"Ummmm...well for starters I’m new to this subreddit and I really don’t know how to express myself but, in short I’m a minor and I’m not sure but I think I have aspergers. For starters, when I was younger, my parents thought I actually had autism and apparently took me to a psychiatrist but they’ve never told me about the results or anything. And more recently, I started researching mental illnesses more and I happened to come across a page about Aspergers. When I read it I realized how I actually had many signs of it, specifically when it comes to eye contact because it makes me feel uncomfortable. Idk, if somebody with aspergers sees this can you please prove me wrong"
308,I am not strong enough to deal with my life right now,"I have had the worst summer of my life. Too many things have happened. I don't know how to deal with it all. 

* Before the pandemic, I had a breakdown about my college major and decided to switch course in the middle of the year. I was feeling lost and crazy but I was going to get an internship in my new field - then the pandemic came and I lost the internship
* I came home to my childhood house where my brother and his friends abused me and the dog I started fostering 
* My family splintered because of it and I was responsible for bridging the emotional gaps between everyone

And then the past couple of weeks: 

* I went back to New York with my brother and he had a psychotic break that I witnessed. I spent 36 hours trying to keep him from killing himself or me, and had the most terrifying night of my life
* I was forced to give up my beloved dog and go back to my childhood house, with twelve hours to fully move out of my apartment
* I found out I was pregnant, scheduled an abortion, found out I wasn't pregnant anymore and actually had a miscarriage weeks ago that I hadn't noticed
* At dinner with my father, I watched him slip and fall directly on his head. I thought he had died, but he only tore some ligaments in his leg. I stayed in the hospital parking lot until 1 because I wasn't allowed to go in as I waited for them to tell me whether the bleeding in his brain was under control 

And so many more small things in between all of this. I tried to tell my parents that I am struggling and they just get angry at me. I have been so successful and competent before this and now I feel numb and manic and on the brink of doing something crazy. How do I handle all of this?"
309,My disassociation and forgetfulness is starting to affect my everyday life.,"  As the title says, I’m (19F) recently struggling with disassociation and forgetfulness. It’s to the point it’s affecting my job. I can’t seem to focus, and tend to keep moving my hands in conversation to at least keep some focus. I’m paying for everything to fix up a house my uncle and his ex wife destroyed, and college. It’s just so hard to focus on one thing, especially with my parents arguing. 
  I went to therapy for 2 years after a car accident, and loads of family trauma and gotten diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Panic, and Major Depressive disorder. My parents argued as a result of my mothers family. Specifically my uncle. I witnessed a lot of screaming matches from said uncle, acted as my Mom’s therapist with her complaining about my Dad to me ranging from sex life, etc. I genuinely think my mother doesn’t know how she’s affecting me, recently started setting boundaries and she offhandedly said, “I guess I just have no one to talk to I guess. I can’t even talk to my own child.”
  I’m going to start medication, but it seems like it has been getting worse? I get really bad migraines with the slightest stress, or just randomly. Usually they get really bad if I get angry or anxious. 
  I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry if this is so out of wack, I just want to know how to handle myself..."
310,Having Zero Friends,"I have no friends. ""Oh you've got to have at least one or two friends, even if they aren't close friends"" you might say. Wrong. I have zero friends. I can't remember the last time I spoke with anyone besides my immediate family members or counselors.

I live completely isolated from the world. When I am out in public, mentally I am swimming in a pool of anxiety and fear. Everyone is an enemy. Not because I don't like people, but because my mind is set that they all hate me.

I look around and I see no one else like me. Everyone has some kind of social tie. Most people have multiple. I have never seen or heard of someone like me. That is, someone with zero friends.

I guess this post is a desperate cry for help. Am I alone? Has God picked me specifically to be absolutely abnormally miserable? When I imagine that I'm the only one in the world this socially isolated, all I want to do is die. Is that weird?"
311,"It doesn't get better, it will be best if im dead","It doesn't get better. It's just an endless cycle of bad. I have been betrayed by everyone which is why I'm alone all the time now, I'm better off without people because I know how they're all like. I have no future, nothing to live for. I'm struggling in uni, which is my only hope right now. I hate my job, I'm a forever alone virgin. I have nothing to look forward to in the future. 

I'm just a burden to everyone at this point. It would be best if I just kill myself, no more struggle, no more pain, no more loneliness. No one will miss me, no one will care. All I am to people if someone who is just there when I'm needed. I'm always the background character, I'm always the weak and problematic one. 

I will definitely kill myself. It's just the best and only solution for everything. No one cares."
312,I feel invisible,"All my friends act like I'm not here, like I don't exist I don't feel like they even like me. Like if I'm feelin down they don't act like I'm here, when I broke my arm they didn't even text me, even after I texted them, they always leave me out and act like I'm nothing, like trash. I don't know if I'm overreacting but I just feel invisible, like if I was gone nothing would change, I have about 2 friends that have always been with me my whole life and I'm trying to hang with them more.  I don't know what to do because I have so much history and poured my heart out to them. I'm so confused and i feel so alone, like nobody cares."
313,I need some help,"So this just happened and I don't know what to do about it.

They immediately shot down the idea and said that ""I don't need that on my record"" and that I shouldn't get tested because that won't help me. They then quickly stormed off telling me that we will talk about it in the morning.  I didn't really know what to expect from it but now I'm really freaking out because just comforting them about this took me a long time to do so and now I'm stuck wide awake waiting for morning to come. I don't know what to think as I am a 15M and can't really do anything about it on my own and if they don't agree to it there isn't much I can do. So any help or words of wisdom would really help me RN."
314,How to deal with a family member who has psychosis?,"I have a family member who has psychosis and takes medictations but they still fear/scream/harm and other things.

I dont want the case to increase but dont know what to do. I try to interact as little as possible while making sure they get medications on time."
315,I'm Unsure If It's Possible I Have Tourette's,"I don't know much about Tourette's, because I've just recently learned about it, but I feel that I might display some of the symptoms. I definitely don't mean to offend or self-diagnose myself, but I'm very confused as to why I do certain things. My symptoms are mild, but confusing as to why I do them. I tend to have muscle spasms (typically in the arms), but it happens mostly when I'm upset. There's times when I have a strong urge to hit myself or pull my hair and it's nearly impossible to stop myself from doing it. I've always had little ""obsessions"" with making certain noises or doing certain things (twitching my nose a lot, rolling my eyes excessively even in inappropriate situations or situations I had to hide my face so I don't offend people, and grunting). There's times when I don't have ""tics"" at all, but other times it's almost constant. The most when I'm irritated, frustrated or in the middle of a break down. During those times I shake my arms and hands excessively (I don't really mean to and I don't know why I do it), hit my head, hit my legs or arms, bite myself or throw things, and continuously ball my hand into a fist. I also clear my throat all the freaking time and idk if it's a symptom or if something is wrong with my throat. What is wrong with meeee?"
316,My Dear Friend | Anxiety Storytelling | trigger warning,"She's telling me not to share my truth. She's telling me that I'm an outcast and no one will ever understand me, no one will ever love me - but they'll pretend that they do, out of pity or willful deceit. She's convinced that no one really likes me or wants me around, like I somehow ruin experiences just because I exist. She thinks I inconvenience others so I should put their needs before my own. She believes I'm less than others so I need to prove my worthiness. 

I don't know what I ever did that would cause anyone to dislike me, at least without first getting to know me. I'm a good person, I know I am. Why does she only see the worst in me?

She's constantly imagining the worst-case scenario. She's fixated, stuck in her negativity. I try to get her to see the truth (which is so much less painful than her reality) but she just keeps going farther down the hole, creating and replaying visions of discomfort, agony, or fear. Like being in a horrifying car accident and losing the ones she loves. Or getting attacked in the middle of the night, her life ending before she ever really got to live. Or coming to the realization that she is being deceived by the people she loves and thought she could trust...

I've known her for as long as I can remember. She's had a hard life and I understand why she is the way she is... But none of her fears are real and I can't convince her to see that. She's lost, her mind in overdrive. She's hyper-aware of everything, overwhelmed and convinced that everyone can tell she's freaking out. I know that no one can tell (her suffering is invisible to most), and even if they could tell, I know they wouldn't pass judgement because she's an amazing person and she has a lot of people who care about her - I only wish she knew that.

Despite all of the love and support she receives, she still struggles to keep herself afloat. Her chest feels tight and heavy. She can't breathe. She can't move. She's in pain and she can't escape it. In her teenage years, her pain manifested in terrifying panic attacks and social anxiety. Back then she didn't know how to pull herself out of the hole without hurting herself. She hurt herself for a long time before she learned how to cope with the depth of her emotions. 

Years have passed since then. She's grown now and she's come a long way since her teenage years. She has healthier coping mechanisms, but sometimes they're still not enough.

Sometimes deep breathing helps. Sometimes meditation helps. Sometimes she can release her mind and body from her pain and suffering. Sometimes she can't.

Sometimes she becomes lost in her inner turmoil and suffers for weeks at a time. But she doesn't want anyone to see her at her worst, especially because she knows she'll eventually bounce back - she has good moments too. So when things get tough, she has a tendency to hide. Her body and mind in pain, she suffers alone because she doesn't want to inconvenience her friends and loved ones.


I love her and I'm there for her if she needs someone to pick her up when she falls. I am her honest and compassionate voice of reason but sometimes she just can't hear me. Sometimes the wave of emotion is too much and she's swept off her feet. She's far away, out of touch from herself and everyone around her, barely able to keep her head above the water. It breaks my heart to watch her silent suffering but I can only wait for her along the shoreline because if I step into the current with her we'll both be lost at sea...



She is my anxiety.
But I am not her.



- - - 



I spent the better part of my life trapped inside my head, unable to muster the courage to express how I felt inside. Afraid and unsure of how to let anyone in, I suffered alone.

When I was 22, I ended my first serious relationship, we had been off and on since we were 16. The relationship was a painful learning experience and when we separated for good, I had no idea who I was. I had spent my young adult years with him, always chasing what he wanted to do, trying to keep up with his lifestyle. After separating, I suddenly had nothing...And so began my journey to self discovery.

It took me many years to grow into the woman I am today. Some know my past and have witnessed the major changes I've undergone over the years. To them, I'm a completely different person, I made it out alive and well. Others have just entered my life and are surprised at my continued battle with anxiety and depression. I bet they wonder how someone so happy-go-lucky and friendly could have such a troubled past? 

I believe that my pain, however much it tainted my perspective or tore at my heart, gifted me with a level of depth that only those who have suffered can understand. Like a pendulum swinging from side to side, the greater capacity we have for pain, the greater capacity (and appreciation) we have for pleasure.

My years of suffering forged the empowered woman I am today. If I had never struggled, I wouldn't appreciate the life I now have in the same way. I believe that my pain tore me apart but - remarkably - made room for something else to grow from within, something beautiful. I believe the same is true for you and everyone you know. We are all capable of rising above whatever is keeping us from living our best lives.

It's not an easy journey, it was never meant to be. And unfortunately, the longer your reality is tainted with anxiety, depression, insecurity, or hopelessness, the longer it takes to unwind and rewire your mind to think differently. But hear me out: you can rise above. 

If you believe in the process and you trust yourself, you can and will rise above.

I share this deeply personal truth because I believe that my story can inspire and set fire to changes in the way we perceive mental health. Not everyone is at a place where they can openly talk about their emotions and experiences, but I know that if I connected with others who understood what I was going through, it would have made a world of a difference for me. My heart goes out to all affected by mental illness. Stay strong, you will rise again &lt;3"
317,Should I quit my job and focus on my menta health?,"I work at a grocery store and my OCD greatly affects me to what I do. I’m always exhausted every single day no matter how much I sleep I get. I asked if I could be transferred to a different department due to my OCD which was a huge mistake from me. They said I wouldn’t be able to leave the department because of my disability. If I can’t do 85% of the job, I would have to be terminated. Which only left me which night shift overstocking. I feel like I have neglected my mental health my entire life and never really worked on it. I’m a high school drop out, 23, poor hygiene, no friends to rely on with social anxiety which has actually reduced ever since I got a job so I feel like trying to find a new job would be less stressful since I can take my skills and what I’ve learned on dealing with my social anxiety much better. I just feel alone, I really have no one to talk to. I don’t take meds when I should. Constantly eating and eating although I haven’t really gained weight due to how physical my job is. Wondering whether I should quit my job and focus on myself for a bit. Then get back to finding a job and getting my life back together."
318,My family at my mom's house is falling apart,"So.. my mom and my dad are divorced and we moved around a few times and my mom met this guy named Chad, now Chad, at first I hated him because he came on way too strong, him and my mom were moving way too fast, marriage in the first 6 months, and just slightly after that moving in together, now after that I started bonding with Chad and eventually I started loving him and I to this day look at him as my best father figure, my dad is present and treats me amazing but I just never had the same bond I have with Chad, now, then the arguments started, and eventually we moved back to where we lived before we moved in with him (we rented the house out for a while) and everything looked to be better, they're still seeing eachother but just at different houses, everything looked good, then it all happened so fast, everything just got fucked up so fast again, my mom barely even talks to him and he's trying so hard and he's done so many amazing things for my mom, yet my mom is just constantly being an asshole to him, now, yesterday I spent the night at my friend's house, and this morning apparently my mom had a guy over at her house, and she said last night she was at chads spending the night but I have no idea if that's true or not, anyway I figured out about the guy because my stepdad told my girlfriend about it on the way to drop her off back at her house, I can't imagine my life without Chad, but it looks like soon that's a reality I'm gonna need to face, and I might have to deal with this POS guy coming to a married woman's house with all this shit going on, and if I meet this guy and snap at him, when my mom gets mad I'm gonna tell her how much all this has chipped away at my security of being happy at her house, the family here used to be so amazing but here it is crumbling."
319,Should I be freaking out that my therapist hasn't responded to me?,"My therapist is awesome and we have a great relationship. I've been seeing her for over 2 years now and we often email and occasionally text in between sessions. However, I sent her an email thanking her for filling out some paperwork for me last week, and she never responded. Then, the next day I ended up having to go to the hospital so I texted her when I was on the way to let her know that I was going to the hospital, didn't know when I would be out, just in case I wasn't there for my next appointment I was giving her a heads up. I just got out of the hospital and see she never responded. I'm really worried she doesn't care about me anymore. I do have problems with being abandoned in the past. The only thing I can think of is that we were emailing too much (I've been sending a lot of emails lately unfortunately) and she recognizes that now and isn't responding anymore. I'm just really worried. I'd love objective advice on how I'm seeing this. I have a history of being invalidated emotionally for my mental illness over the course of my life and it's done a lot of damage to me, so I'm always scared that my therapist out of nowhere is just gonna think I'm faking my problems. I'm not. I'm worried she is thinking this now and that's why she won't respond. She almost always responds within a couple hours."
320,"It isn't what's causing the depression, it's the depression itself. DEMONS","Since I knew what depression was I thought that something has to be hurting you to feel this way, you can't feel this way without reasoning. Childhood trauma could definitely cause depression and other mental and psychological issues for the rest of your life. I've heard of chemical imbalance but I ignored it because I was stubborn. I thought that maybe the negative thoughts themselves were causing the pain, irritability, and anxiety. It's just the way I cope with the hell going on in my head. It is a chemical imbalance. 

For example, I'm depressed because I'm lonely and I want love from a female and I'm anxious because I'm afraid I'm going to be lonely all my life, I'm afraid I'm going to die alone, I'm afraid I'm not going to have a wife and kids one day. But something is telling me I am going to be successful, I am going to have a big house with wife and kids, I am going to be financially free. I have faith in myself.

My depression started at about 12 - 13, I was sad because I didn't have a girlfriend. I was jealous that other boys had girls all over them. And I'm dealing with the same fucking problems, I'm now a 19 year old virgin. I don't want to care anymore, I need to take care of myself. I have big plans for life. I have a feeling that my hard work and patience is going to pay off so good. But the demons in my head are telling me I'm going to fail in life and commit suicide as a depressed virgin.

It's a game. Mental health is testing my strength, my ability to cope."
321,Please come check out my new community,Hi guys! So I’ve recently made a community called r/Insecurities_support the lack of safe for work communities discussing things like insecurities and self consciousness shocks me and I know as a teenager myself most of us struggle with at least something and I really wanted to create a community which is solely used for that purpose. I would appreciate it so much if you’d check it out and get as many people to join as possible so we grow a community that is safe for people to share.
322,I feel stuck,"This post is prolly gonna be a big mess of words. I just felt like getting this out so bare with me...

I'm just sick of my mom drinking and smoking weed. And I feel bad for wanting her to quit. She just gets so fucking annoying when she's high. She tries to avoid me and not talk to me but it's hard to completely avoid someone you live with. And its ruined our relationship. 

She has it in her head that she can drink a tiny bit and I won't notice but I do and it ruins the rest of the day. She also has it in her head that the weed wears off after like an hour when I only see it go away after at least 3 hours. And then she wonders why I lock myself in my room all day. 

I wish I didn't mind her doing that stuff because she's told me before that it's the only thing that makes her happy and that hurt. Cuz I don't want her to not be happy but I just can't stand her when she isn't herself. It's a horrible feeling when you don't wanna be anywhere near your parent bc you're scared that their breath will smell like beer. 

It makes me sick when I walk into the kitchen at night and have to spray 10 tons of air freshener bc it smells so bad and there's cans all over the counter. It's hard to not drink when someone you live with does and is very open about it. 

I had a therapist. She knew about the drinking but Marijuana isn't completely legal in my state and I didn't know if I should tell her. So here I am complaining to Reddit about it.

It hurts to see her passed out on the couch cuddling up to a fucking bottle of Vodka. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't wanna make her quit because I know how hard it is but it's gotten to the point where I'm spending half of my life at my friend's house cuz I don't wanna go home. 

Any advice about any of this? If not then cool I guess...I just felt like complaining. I'll prolly end up deleting this. 

Also I hope you guys are having a decent night &lt;3"

330,I can't understand what I'm feeling,"I'm currently leaving the antidepressants I've been taking for the last year and a half. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety after a suicide attempt on early January 2019, 3 days before my birthday.  The events that led up to the event aren't relevant, but what's relevant is that I downplayed my mental health for way too long. Depression in my young and Latin-American mind was just an illusion and a sign of weakness, thus, I just drank myself to sleep in order to avoid anxiety. I've been taking Escitalopram for the last year and a half, and left Alprazolam more or less 6 months ago. 

Panama has had one of the strictest and longest quarantines to date and my two hours to go out are from 7am to 9am, severely limiting any social interactions. I've been isolated and actually quite mentally calm for the last months, since I'm studying at college online and I love my mayor dearly. Last week I knew a bunch of my faculty freshmen, making several acquaintances very fast since I'm very extroverted and social. Beyond a transient quarantine relationship I decided to end since I felt nothing, I've had no interaction with my friends here whatsoever. Tonight I finished several projects and then sat with my laptop in my bed, where I'm writing now.

After almost a month of decreasing my doses of the antidepressants, I've been 2 weeks or so drug-free. Now, I feel as if beyond my Major, all meaning in life has ceded. I can't find any value in building a relationship beyond the couple of friends I talk with several times everyday. I used to write poetry to understand what I felt, or at least grasp a notion of it. I don't know if this is a side effect of the long-term antidepressant drug usage, where my feeling where almost completely suppressed. I'm genuinely concerned if I'll ever recover the sentient and sensible being I once was."

Just feel bad for complaining to my friends. Not suicidal, just upset about my panic and and drunk. Just need some artificial insurance to get through the night"
333,Looking for help finding proper counseling.,"Southern California here.  I've been dealing with serious depression and suicidal ideation.  Had three therapists, one who actually ghosted me, one who made light of my sexual abuse at a young age, and the most recent seemed more like a life coach.  I'm not very good with opening up and someone telling me I need to love myself before someone else will isn't going to do anything to help me.  I'm better with scientific and logical approaches so I think that should be mentioned

Not sure how to find a proper therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist to help me.  Any thoughts or keywords to use when asking would be appreciated.  

Full disclosure: I know nothing about this topic so detail is appreciated."
334,Is it possible I am at risk of DID?,"I have taken a few tests on Google (which I do not think are very useful but could be a rudimentary baseline of sorts) which say I am high risk, however I do not know if I actually am. It does not feel like I have 'alters', but rather 'different mes', who are still the same me but with different personalities. One minute I want to spread positivity among the world, then transition over around 10 minutes to wanting the world to burst into flames, or one minute I want to be a productive and wonderful person, then transitioning over to just wanting to sit in my bed and stare at a wall all day. I also talk in different 'styles' as I call them (I.E. middle-aged British women, catty teenager, sarcastic business woman) quite frequently, often switching them throughout conversations. I can talk to myself outloud for hours on end, having complex conversations with people who I hate. It feels like they're almost there, even though I know they're not. I have frequent and sudden mood swings, which can be unsettling if unexpected. Am I just stupid for asking these questions? Am I just normal and not realising it?"
335,I Trusted A Friend To Visit Me and They Talked Behind My Back About My Messy House To Another Friend,"I have been struggling very, *very* hard since about 2013. I have had a lot of major life traumas in that short time. I suffer from chronic depression, hypothyroidism, and chronic pain amongst other things, but those specific illnesses can make housekeeping a challenge.


I had fallen into, and am still in, a very deep depression. My house has been like eviction level trashed before. I'm  not happy or proud of how gross it's gotten in the past. Things had gotten a lot better, but there are a lot of old habits to unlearn. Because of these struggles, in addition to having a dog with kidney failure and incontinence at the time, my house was in rough shape.


Several months ago, I invited a friend over on a handful of occasions. Having people over is not something that I often do, due to my anxiety, and at the time the cleanliness of the house. During some of these visits, this person would drink, eat, and sleep here. Never complained about the mess. I thought it was nice having them around to hang out with cause we were both going through some things,  and having someone around really helped distract me from the misery. 


We became somewhat distant again recently  as a result of life. Not too long ago, I was told by another trusted friend, that this person pretty harshly talked about my living space and how disgusted they were by it. This info really hurt to hear. They have visited every living space that I've ever had and they knew that this was different and extreme. Instead of helping or asking if things were ok, this person would trash the place even worse when they visited. My other friend claims Friend A told them they offered us help, but only if they were paid. They didn't even clean up their own messes they made when they were here let alone offer us help. And to ask for money for an offer we didn't even request? Idk. I have a feeling that I won't feel comfortable or safe inviting this person over ever again."

341,Finally reaching out,"I don’t know if I’m in the wrong subreddit, 

I have never posted before or really looked for help but I am struggling. I created a message to send my mom reaching out for help, after a lifetime of never accepting any. Despite psych ward stents/multiple therapists &amp; psychiatrists I have been walled off &amp; had a case of the whole eccentric imposter syndrome. I’m diagnosed with schtizoaffective disorder. I can’t keep holding shit together like I’m not suffering &amp; I’m an exception &amp; manipulating my way through life by being ingenious. I feel so barely involved with my own existence, like I’m just scattered. I don’t know how else to explain it. I just woke up recently to realize how I wasn’t living life like I need to be &amp; deserve to be.

Is my message to my mom too much or manipulative or is it enough to show I need help?


“I know I'm probably kind of manic &amp; too introspective rn, but I appreciate the fact that you always hang out with me in such an accepting way when I'm around you &amp; talk to me. You always make me feel heard and consider my side. 

It's all I could ask for in anyone, and I'm lucky to have that with you. 
Having a mom that's so willing to accept me is a privilege. I know I'm probably just kind of insecure becoming really vulnerable for once instead of being the ice queen type I’ve always been. But I’m at point where I need hugs &amp; love &amp; I don’t know how to ask for it or take it in if I even get it. I think after the stroke &amp; the whole pandemic thing I just have no idea how to approach things being so raw &amp;  fully experiencing it now instead of feeling jaded or disassociating myself entirely or exploding with so much energy that I'm exposing people to really interpersonal or weird sides of me they aren’t comfortable with where it makes me insecure &amp; pull back or that drains me completely if received well.

I dont know how to not be extremely distant &amp; offensively walled off or too interpersonal &amp; projecting. I have to learn to live with myself, functionally. Not just drifting by being misunderstood &amp; likeable. I want people to be so involved that they’ll be able to talk to my therapist that they’ll talk to them theirselves &amp; give honest opinions of my behavior, and me trust them enough to allow that.

I need to tell people I need help or reminders or reassurance &amp; im ready to receive that. I just need reminders I'm still wanted for that bc I don't want to be a burden. But I’m reaching go out for help?”


Thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice or shared experience. Good or bad."
342,I don’t know what do anymore,"
I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."
343,Do you feel have enough money will solve your depression?,"I am 22 and just long story short, I failed college, can't even find and hold even one job in my whole entire life and always have to rely on the parent.   


I feel if I just have enough money (doesn't matter the source, could be lottery tick or a good enough job that I do enjoy), a lot of problems will be solved, at least for a while before the problem of being too rich start kicks in or that thinking of ""always want more"". I am not trying to be rich, or too focused on the material goods but the truth of the matter is it is the real world, you got to have some material good to be well being.

The girl my heart “loves” my brain says will never feel the same, she works with me and those people are amazing and I’ve done everything I can do to try and move on from her, so I can stay with those people who helped me move forward from my darkest points. Now as I work I see her growing ever closer to my closet work friend a man who helped me out of the the worst of it, now I feel I can’t talk to him about such things. Maybe it’s my own depression playing cruel cruel tricks on me, maybe not. I’ve tried talking with my out of work friends but I feel as though I’ve lost my connections to them. A void. My family has always put my emotions and mental health as a low priority, I have a blind a deaf brother I understand that he takes precedents, but for 27 years now they’ve made me believe my happiness isn’t important. I’ve been through therapy, I go in go through the motions make progress get told I’m “healthy” then come out and begin the slow slide back down. The cycle continues. I wonder now if a fresh start some where else is my only option to break the cycle of pain? A new name a new country. A fresh start."
346,Setting Boundaries,"Mobile, sorry for format.

This is a long one, I apologize in advance. Last spring, I dealt with a huge bout of depression and anxiety, the brunt of which was dealt with largely by my friends and roommates as they scrambled to save me from myself. Concurrently, a close friend who helped me during that period of my life was also dealing with severe anxiety and depression. We supported one another, and I eventually improved after taking meds and opening up more about my past trauma (some of which I shared with her only recently). She has also started taking meds but has not improved as much at all. It’s gotten to the point where I am on FaceTime or in bed with her until the early hours of the morning grasping at straws to support someone who I am so ill equipped to support. Though I’m aware of this, I’m afraid of what she will do if I stop constantly spending our time together helping her work through something that is occasionally quite triggering for me (on that note, she asked that we not even discuss my trauma because it is triggering for her). 

I know that I should set boundaries but she can be volatile and lash out when she’s vulnerable and I don’t think she would understand if I told her I needed space or limited involvement. On paper, she might say she would, but in practice it would breed resentment. Just tonight, I asked her to think about what I do to try to help when she’s struggling and let me know what actually works, because we often just sit together for hours as she inconsolably wallows in her dark thoughts. I was met with “that isn’t exactly my top priority right now” and essentially waved off. She is very much the type to tell me to leave her alone for “my own sake” but feel hurt when I actually do and that, coupled with the fact that she gave in to my unhealthy neediness when I was at a low point, makes me feel obliged to constantly listen to her either joke/make light of her suicidal ideation or sob for hours about thoughts that I can’t help to remedy. This post almost doubles as an AITA because I feel so horrible about wanting space given that she was there for me a few months ago and still supports me as I continue to recover. She was one of many people who I relied on, but I think I’m one of the only people she opens up to like this and I’m bearing the brunt of it. We are now roommates and, though we are living with others, I worry things will only escalate from here. I apologize for the length but I’m at a moral and psychological impasse, as I’m desperate for boundaries from someone who sees me as a soulmate  but simultaneously constantly fears abandonment on my part and would interpret aloofness as rejection. Please help. Just now, she texted saying that I “made her most recent mental breakdown about her by talking about how hard it was for me to help when she doesn’t know how I can go about doing that and that it made things worse for her.” I love her but this isn’t sustainable and I’m scared."
347,Does anyone else get extremely anxious for the littlest things?,"Hey all. Does anyone else get really anxious/worried about small things? Or paranoid? Like if your family has been out for a little bit longer than you expected, and you instantly worry that they got in a car wreck? Or that anything you say in public (like school or work) with sounds stupid to others and they’ll think about what you said and laugh at you in their head?"

But like i said, everyone hates me in my mind, even thought in reality they might not know me well enough to make that judgement. This has lead me to be really sad sometimes and even not saying hello to some of my friends because i assume they dont want to even recognise me.

352,How do I build mental resilience?,"I have a lot on my plate. I wanted to study in US this year and going and then not going and maybe going is causing a lot of stress. Now embassies might open, I am not sure can I afford it. My girlfriend is in US and the distance is just so gruesome. I want to go since my career is stagnant and I want to be with her. 

My parents and siblings expect a lot of financial and emotional support from me since my parents income has dwindled in COVID 19. My office expects a lot of work and I am unable to deliver. I left my apartment in another part of country and can't find a sublet for it, so I am just paying rent for it. I also have some gastric worries and pain while I poo.. overall it has been so many things to deal with that I really dont know what to do.. I am obese now and it takes incredible engery to fast and workout. I feel like an imposter at office and resent that why I stopped learning for past few years. Obviously poor quality of sleep, unable to sleep till 3 am and then can't get out of bed easily. 

I know people say build compartments, one task at a time, plan and see what you can take.

When I think about all this holistically I just freeze and dont know what to do?"
353,Lazy or Depressed?,"Hey all. It seems like a straight forward question but I just want to ask. Am I lazy or depressed? 

I’ve lost motivation for almost everything. It’s hard for me to actually feel like I should do something. It feels like I’m stuck in a mental box that’s hard to get out of. I’m very anxious right now because of online school starting. I want to become a mechanical engineer, but I don’t find the motivation to learn or even look up stuff about it. 

I’d like to be productive. I don’t play video games anymore unless a friend calls and tells me to get on. 

I don’t know. I’ve been gong through some stuff"
354,How to tell Bipolar,"Dear Reddit, 

I live in a fairly conservative family where drug use is substantially frowned upon. My mom is a medical doctor and discovered that I had used an illicit drug, LSD. The result of this was a substantial reevaluation of my past choices, but moreover relatedly impacted the way I approached thinking through ""life"", in an obscure way, and the way it impacted my future choices. As a result, I broke down on three occasions and was hospitalized for mental health reasons for all of them. In each of these instances, however, the actual reasons for being hospitalized seemed two-sided. On the one hand, I was behaving abnormally (limiting food consumption and sleep by significant amounts, etc.) on the other, my parent's concern seemed to amplify bias significantly with respect to the actual events which lead to my hospitalization. In other words, yes I may have been acting out of sorts, but whether I should have been hospitalized seemed unfairly one-sided. The actual trauma of being forcibly placed in a hospital under (this may be a biased description) the false pretense of self admittance, and the bureaucratic placeholders to keep me in hospital, left a considerable impression. I was informed that I had ""manic depression"" and that I had been acting in a manic. This is the extent of what I know of my ""condition."" I could speak at length at the many injustices I faced (such as being coerced to sign documents) or the horrors that I saw others face (being physically removed. . .) yet what has me most concerned is the actual soundness of what I was being ""treated"" for. 

My question is twofold.  Firstly, how can one determine if such a diagnosis holds water?  and Secondly, in the case that the diagnoses are unsound, then how one prove or qualify the alternative? 

It reminds me of a section from  Catch 22:

""Oh, they're there, all right,"" Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight with Appleby in the officers' club, ""although he probably doesn’t even know it. That's why he can’t see things as they really are.""

""How come he doesn't know it?’ inquired Yossarian.

""Because he’s got flies in his eyes,"" Orr explained with exaggerated patience. ""How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes?""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Furthermore, recently I have been staying up very late playing dungeons and dragons - a 3 to 5-hour board game- and have got myself stuck in a very poor sleep cycle. One morning my Mom walked into my room and called me manic for not falling asleep. I got fairly heated because that ascription not only brings back bad memories but also, if not taken seriously, as I have discovered, may lead to seemingly arbitrary and very subjective claims for hospitalization.  

I am worried, deeply, that my lack of an effort to fall asleep; This very, unapologetically long, call for help into the deep web that is Reddit, is a symptom of ""mania"" that I feel I have been falsely diagnosed with. Upon a quick search of this ""mania"" Bipolar disorder was one of the first that came up. 

I do not intend to discredit mental disorders in general. I believe that mental health conditions and disorders are a very real thing. I have seen them up close and personal, however, I still do not agree with the treatment of those deemed hospitalized. I am skeptical, and even though I do not feel that I am bipolar, ""I don't think I am"" does not externally qualify me to claim that this is the case. However, at the same time, ""I know because I am a professional,"" does not seem to qualify this either, especially when the impression I receive is that some judgments (not all of them) feel happenstance or for the sake of a consensus - a form of ""hot cognition"" naturally part of this line of work. 

If there is no way for me to internally determine if I am Bipolar and if external judgments feel happenstance or for the sake of consensus, then on what condition or criteria should I accept or reject such claims made.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As an afternote, I just want to reassure the reader that I no longer take any illicit drugs nor do I take any medication to ""help"" as I have not felt the need to do this."

357,Having difficulty breathing while crying?? Panic or Anxiety attack? Or not?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask about this so if it's not, pls tell me and I'll remove it. Thank you!!

So last week me and my mom got into a huge fight. I was so angry that I could barely think. My mom cried and my sisters went to comfort her while I was there losing my mind alone in my room. My other sister went in our room after and Idk what happened but when I was explaining to her my side while crying, I suddenly have difficult time breathing. My chest hurts so bad like I'm having hiccups (?) and I can't stop crying. I can't speak properly because I was catching my breath. I was so scared. I searched it on the internet and it suggested that I'm having a panic or anxiety attack? I honestly don't know if this is true since it's my first time experiencing it and it was so scary. What do y'all think? 

And I'm sorry if you ever find this question disrespectful!! It wasn't my intention."

359,Mental Health in Mexican American Households,"I will always love and be proud of my Mexican parents for going the distance and setting a foundation for my siblings and I. However, I will always HATE machismo. I will always HATE how my emotions have always taken a back seat ever since I was a child. I’d feel pain. Emotional trauma. Real sorrow and my parents would tell me to stop being so weak and being a cry baby and to not let things get to me etc. They still haven’t changed their ways. As an adult now and especially during sheltering In Place, I’ve gone through an ugly breakup(called off engagement) dealt with alcoholism and depression. Yet for the Latino household....It’s all. BS. It’s not real to them. It’s not a valid reason to be emotional. It’s just weakness to them. It’s just being dramatic and over the top. Maybe not all Mexican families. But mine takes the cake on not giving a FUCK about mental health. It’s almost as if they poke fun at the wounds to try to defuse how painful it is. But they don’t understand that they’re wounds that were never ever really healed in the first place. I’m damn sure never going to let my children feel like their emotions and feelings don’t matter. I’ll never dismiss nor belittle or invalidate emotions of people I love. Ever."
360,struggling with suicidal thoughts,"lately I feel like a guiney pig for my psychiatrist because she keeps trying different combos of meds all the time on me and nothing seems to work.  my only saving grace is (which sounds bad) is my xanax prescription because it keeps me out of my head and in my body if that makes any sense.  I don't abuse it but i do use it frequently for major anxiety and super stressful situations.  I have lots of people reaching out to me telling me that they care about my wellbeing but at this point I already kinda know.  the problem is I've lost my own drive to live anymore I feel like I'm in limbo just living without a purpose.  I'm not a religious person so that isn't really something that i can cling to in hard times but I'm starting to feel that these psychiatrists and therapists don't fully understand that YES I can be a functional individual but my pain is more emotional and in my head not something that can necessarily be resolved with forgiveness or reconciliation. the only thing that I have found that helps me is these stupid pills which I would rather be off of but they help me get through my days.  

this is kindof me just venting feel free to throw some advice my way if you so choose."

362,Life in general has been so hard lately.,"There's been a lot lately. Between this pandemic, a recent death close to my family, stuff going on with my parents, at home, and work.  My metal health has been fucked.  I feel so numb to everything it's starting to feel like a dream . I have been reaching out to a therapist for some help and support which is good.  I just wish things would calm down and be easy again like it once was.  Things just don't feel real anymore and I don't like it at all.  Idk when I will start therapy sessions but I pray that this will help change my life somehow."
363,I (23M) tend to exaggerate the possible consequences of my actions,"There are consequences for every action and I normally can reasonably guess what they will be. But sometimes, when I do something bad or stupid, I tend to overblow the consequences I might face. I get in my head so much that the imagined consequences are highly improbable. 

For example, I asked my supervisor at the uni for a deadline extension on my thesis (because I'm a lazy fuck and don't put in any work). In the e-mail, among other things, I asked my supervisor, if he was thinking of terminating our association because of it. He granted me a 10-day extension, but didn't even respond to that question and told me to please keep things professional and not ask frivolous questions. I hadn't realised at the moment how comical and drenched in self-pity that question must have sounded, but once I read it again I felt really embarrassed.

To give you another example, when I was starting my internship, there was some trouble with my paperwork. I asked my then supervisor if they were going to let me go, because my paperwork wasn't in order. She thought it was a really weird thing to ask. Of course they wouldn't! My paperwork was sorted out the next day. 

People get really angry at me for this. A friend has told me they get upset, because they think I'm doing a bit to get sympathy, or that I'm doing it to wallow in self-pity. Maybe they are right, I can't really tell though, and I want to stop doing that."
364,Support for sexual abuse?,"Hi, my friend experienced a very unfortunate event where her ex assaulted her and came close to forcing himself on her. She went to the police and he was charged but just got a good behaviour bond. Slap on the wrist. She’s dealing with negative feelings from the event itself, the process with the police and also has imagined gatekeepers saying he didn’t even go through with it so she won’t fit in with ‘real’ victims.

We’re looking for online communities where she might be able to get some support. Where she could tell her story, ask questions, talk about her feelings and even get involved in the process of healing for other people in similar positions. Any recommendations for subs or even anything outside of reddit? Your suggestions would be very appreciated. Thanks."
365,I-I don't know what this is... but if someone does?,"So I need to tell someone about this, but I don't know who (this isnt really a topic for my irl friends and it's not something i want to tell my mutuals bcs i dont want them to think differently of me, and my parents would just tell me to grow up already or pray)

since childhood, i'd have moments where i'd feel like everything was fake. I would be lying in bed, and suddenly my mind would go blank. I would feel the breath in me but it didnt feel like it was me (?). I'd wait and I'd wait, just to start feeling again, because the nothing i felt didnt feel real. i'd have to keep reminding myself that *this* is existing. i am *alive*. then i'd feel fear. nothing else. just fear. i'd feel like i'd stopped existing.

eventually, i taught myself how to keep my mind active, because as soon as silence settled, as soon as everything was quite, i'd stop existing. i knew i was alive, i knew i was right there, but it didnt feel like it.

recently though, i dont know if it has anything to do with what's been happening, it's been coming back. i'd be doing my work, and suddenly it feels like everything is gone. it's right there in front of me, but it's not. the worst thing is now i dont even see the point of anything. because once i die, all there is going to be is that nothing. the void of black. no matter what i do, no matter whose lives i change, no matter what job i get, nothing fucking matters. hell, i could find the cure for cancer. give it a couple hundred years i'll be nothing more than a name that once had meaning. nothing matters. nada. wallashi. its all pointless. the only constant is the void. the nothing. nothing is all life has to offer. and thats so fucking scary. 

i used to be so happy. i was always laughing, smiling, joking. i was the class clown, people came to me to have fun. i was fun. i was happy.

i cant talk to anyone, because i know people have it worse. i know all i need is to be grateful. and i am. i'm grateful that i get to live. that i get to breath. that i get to open my eyes every morning and see the sun. i dont really know how to put this, but i feel like i dont deserve help? writing it down it sounds stupid, but it's more just... idk i guess im guilt-tripping myself? like... people are starving, dying, being tortured, being killed, living in poverty, and i'm here, living with my family, in a first-world country (or second world... idk what australia is), i'm getting a good education and i have three meals a day. and i'm the one who dares think i need help? who the fuck do i think i am?

idk

just.... if someone maybe knew what this was, if i could label those thoughts, the feeling of nothing, maybe they'd go away? i really don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even anything wrong with me...."
366,I’VE TRIED EVERYTHING,"So I’m a 21 year old male that’s been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve literally tried everything; psychiatrist, psychologist, medications and even moved back home to try and help yet all I want more in this world is to die.

367,Major decline in mental health for the first time in my life (20),"As the title states, this pandemic has literally opened Pandora’s box of emotions I can’t seem to handle. For one with context, I’ve always delt with family issues with a really abusive household and I never got out much, so it never really bothered me until now. Being home all the time with that, with no way to escape it, has been getting to me now after years of just ignoring it or shoving it down in my brains priorities.

I always focused on my external life, my close friends I made etc. So I never paid mind to it as I saw them as an escape, recently (early March) I finally asked out this girl who I was great friends with who liked me too, I took way too long to ask her out despite the signs but we only dated for a week and it was amazing before the closures happened. Since then she ghosted me and broke up with me in one message after a month and a half then ghosted me after, and till this day I’m still not over it.

My mind is all over the place, and I’m just sick of existing. I’m in a constant state of emptiness and I can’t seem to find anything that can make me happy even temporarily, I never suffered with mental illness or anything so I don’t know what to do I don’t even know if that’s what this is, but I’ve never experienced it before. I’m afraid of who I will be when it’s over, because it’s like all the social ness inside of me died in the last couple of months, I want to socialize but I can’t muster up the strength to do so, my brain just can’t push aside the shitty feeling of wanting to stay in bed and feel like shit with constant negative thoughts all day long. It’s even been hard to try to take care of myself, I stopped eating etc and it’s not even purposeful. It’s just so hard with everything that I just don’t care even though I really want to if that makes sense especially on the good hours I have where I start feeling better only for the usual crappy feelings to creep in and take over.

If anyone has any advice for this I’d love to hear it because this is by far the worst time I’ve ever had in my life and I honestly don’t know what to do. This is the first time I’m even addressing this feeling after months because it’s only getting worse."
368,What do you guys do to reset after having a string of bad days? I can’t seem to kick out of this.,"I’ve been feeling very bad the last couple of day’s. I’ve crying multiple times a day without an obvious trigger and wanting to shut myself away in my room. I’m convinced everyone in my life is going to realize how tedious I am or that I’ve tricked them into caring about me. What’s weird is the last week has been exceptionally good and I’ve been incredibly healthy and focused the last couple months. Working out a lot and doing my hobbies. It came over me like a wave after work on Thursday and I feel stupid and ungrateful for my life. I can’t seem to get out of this mindset that everything, including myself, is grotesque. I’m just wondering what everyone’s coping mechanisms are?  or looking for some new self care ideas? 

I’d like to add:I am on medication and do have a therapist. I workout, eat pretty clean and have been mindlessly doing hygiene and household chores. 

Thank you!"

371,"My best friend is struggling with her mental health really bad, can't get professional help right now and I'm overwhelmed - what should I do?","Hello, I apologize if this is an off topic but I really don't know what to do, so any advice would be appreciated.

My best friend (since kindergarten, we're in our 30s) lives in another state but we've always kept in close contact, we text each other on a daily basis.

But now this is going out of hand. She doesn't have any real friends where she lives, she lost her job recently, so I see where this is coming from but she's really obsessive. To keep it short without giving too much details, every other day I wake up (we live in different time zones) to a wall of text and several links to mental health articles, she self diagnoses different mental illnesses/disorders and pathological unhealthy relationships dynamics (she's struggling with her marriage too).

I've already told her over and over that she needs to get help, but money is tight and her husband is currently in therapy for some situation he's struggling with, she gets some group therapy in a support system (related to her husband situation) but I don't think this is helping, I rather think that it is making it worse because she is exposed to a number of toxic thoughts without being able to focus on her own situation and it adds up.

I don't really know what to do. First, I'm really worried for her and I feel so helpless, but also I'm going through a lot of pressure at work and this is draining me out. I can't wake up every morning to 46 new messages from her, most of which self diagnosed disorders, with links to articles which say ""if you do this, you might be (insert disorder)"". I am close to the point where I roll my eyes every time my phone buzzes and I hate it because I know I'm being unfair, but I feel so overwhelmed.

I don't want to let her down, but at the moment I really have no time to deal with it on a daily basis (obviously, I can't just type a short answer and call it a day, but if I'm at work I can't sit down and have a real conversation with her... I would if it was once in a while, but this happens every day). I openly say it to her (sorry, I'm going through a shitty day, I'll get back to you later) and I also get to vent and talk to her about my own personal life, so I'm not saying she's self absorbed, she's still my best friend. But she's been spiraling for 6 months now and I don't know how to handle it anymore. 

What should I do? At this point it's clear that I can't help her other than being there and listen to her, but it's affecting me too and I don't know what to do, for both of us."
372,Does anyone who’s self aware find it difficult to get sad because you’re always advocating for both sides?,"I am self aware to some extent and everytime i’m bothered about something, i find myself also advocating for the person/thing that made me sad in the first place. 

It’s such a frustrating feeling to not feel like you can be upset because you’re always giving them the benefit of doubt and sabotaging yourself in the process. It’s as though my being understanding towards them takes away my right to be angry with them. 

Idk how else to explain but it’s a difficult feeling."
373,I’ve become too agreeable and nice to people and when I do wish to say something critical I get ghosted. I feel alone.,"I have been home from college since March living with my parents and grandparents. I haven’t gone anywhere due to the stress of anything happening to my family during this pandemic. The issue arises in the fact that my cousins live 2 houses down and treat us as if we are paranoid.

I was shocked by this because these are their grandparents to and having to explain to my cousin, lets call him AP, who is the same age, that it is not worth the risk to hang out since he goes to work and out for lunch. He accepted this but still commented that people were being overly paranoid.

Before the main part, I want to provide a little background. AP and I have been super close for our whole lives but after I went off to college 7 years ago, now in Grad school, we went down different paths since he stayed in the same town. He went to community college and eventually dropped out, getting into drugs and partying. Whenever I came I could sense him changing until eventually he started considering his “friends” his true family because they fed into his ego trips and gave him a fun time by partying with him. Whereas his parents, siblings and my family confronted him whenever we felt he was being to stubborn or angry by trying to reason with him but he always thought of us as being against him for irrational reasons. This eventually got worse and worse. For example, one time I was watching a show with his brother at their house and we did this as a weekly thing and he was always out and about doing things with his “friends.” But this night he happened to be home. So as we are sitting there about to start the show, he walks in and tells us to stop. He says its his turn and to give him the remote. To provide context, him and I were 22 and his brother was 4 years older then us, so this felt pretty insulting. We told him no, and he turns off the tv and sits down in front of us and repeats himself. Now his brother gets angry and tells him that we watch at this time every week and why is he being so selfish. This sets him off and he starts yelling. This eventually escalated to wear i had to hold his dad and his brother off of him. The cops were called and he left the house for the night. There were many nights like this where little things would set him off so I started to learn that I can’t be honest with him like I used to be and instead I became to the point and not argumentative as not to set him off for his mom’s sake. But he became worse and worse and started calling his friends, his true brothers. Until, one night I got a call saying he was in an accident.

 He suffered a lot during that period due to a major injury and when I first saw him after that he was very weak and burst into tears remembering all the good times we had together as little kids. From whispering to each other during movies, to playing video games and playing pranks on others. From making home movies to playing basketball. The first thing he said to me when he saw me in his hospital bed was “sorry” and how he had let his family down. I believed the shit out of him and went back to my old ways of saying trying to make him feel good by saying that once he gets better will do this and that. And he enthusiastically agreed. But after he got better, he had to serve a few months for his dui. I visited him in this period worried that he may have changed but when I talked to him that same excitement was there and he listed a bunch of things that he wanted to do together after he was out. Leaving that day gave me hope that maybe the person I considered to be like a brother to me had finally turned the corner.

I waited for the day he came back home enthusiastically and got a call from his mom saying to come over. So I went over with a smile on my face and when I went to say hi to him he quickly said hi and walked right passed me, asking his mom where his socks were. I was dumbfounded but thought maybe I was overthinking it. So I follow him asking what he wants to do now that he’s out and he said he was going out. I asked where, and he said to hang with his friends. My heart dropped, not once did he consider me or even text me that we should hang out later. Unless I had gone over there he wouldn’t have regarded me at all. This gnawed at me because I thought about him so much and I didn’t feel that reciprocated and it just added to my inner turmoil where I asked whether I’m being selfish, but this has stayed with me 3 years later so obviously this moment cut deep. He chose the friends who became intoxicated with him, asked him to drive them, who left him on the road with a broken back because they were afraid of the cops over me. His mom was saddened, his dad was angry, his brother was silent and I felt worthless. I went back home feeling like shit. 

This was my gap year so I was going to be home so I thought we could rebuild our relationship but at the same time I didn’t want to initiate that after he left me that day. A couple days later he texts saying to come over so I ecstatically went to his house. Even writing this, I feel like such a pushover who just arrives when called. So, I go over to his house and see him in an ankle monitor. He was now forced to stay home for 6 months as a part of his sentence. So I reasoned that this was the reason he went out right away that day because he knew he couldn’t later. So, I felt better. We hung out all day and played video games. Over the next few months I would be doing my own thing and would get a text saying “come over.” Not asking me but telling me. Of course, after a while I felt annoyed because he never asked but basically told me to come over. I would then respond back saying I would come later and then he wouldn’t reply so I would second guess myself and say coming for his mom’s sake not to anger the all mighty AP. 6 months passed, my gap year went and he went back to his old ways and moved in and out of the house whenever he felt like it. I finally told myself to not waste anymore time. I felt it was too one-sided and that I was watering grass that did not wish to grow.

Fast forward to now:

When the pandemic hit, he was back home, going to work and had a girlfriend. When I talked to him before coming home from college to quarantine, he seemed in a much better place and even cut off some friends. The first day I came home, I was on high alert and did not want anyone coming over since it was March and there was a lot of uncertainty. But he came over that day to say hi and sat down in the living room. I was being a little stand offish wondering whether he was not taking the pandemic seriously, especially with our grandma right there. And then he started coughing so I told him to leave. And he left right away concerned too. This swelled me with pride that he was concerned. He was sick for over a week with the flu and tested negative for Covid. We talked everyday on the Ps4 since we we’re both home and started playing videogames everyday. We were both super nice to eachother like adults but that felt off to me because even that light ribbing we gave eachother like a couple pals wasn’t there. I felt afraid to anger him and he must have felt something similar. There was a wall there. We talked almost everyday for the last 6 months while playing online and that facade is there. I may be the only one who feels this way out of us too but to me it felt like our relationship can’t restrengthen fully if we are tip toeing and being agreeable all the time but we still started opening up again and sharing stuff with each other. So, maybe I was wrong about the wall.

 So fast forward to the past week on Thursday, when his sister came home to her parents from where she was living and was coming to our house as part of a tradition in my culture. This was fine with me since she had been quarantining alone but AP got word and decided to come to. I told him while we were online that I was not comfortable with him coming because he went to work and still hung out sometimes with his girlfriend or a couple friends. This was his response: “I don’t care. I’m coming. You guys are so paranoid.” 

I was shocked, my heart rate strengthened and I didn’t know what to say. I felt angry that after spending so much time opening up and then being told that he doesn’t care. I stayed silent the rest of the game and he knew I was mad. So before he came, I called him and said I didn’t like that he straight up said that he doesn’t care what I have to say and he said sorry that he should’ve been more careful with his words. I accepted and was happy I didn’t hold that in and was being fully honest with him. The wall was broken. I told him to wear a mask and he said of course and he said that he would stand 6 feet from our grandma. I felt good that I was able to be honest and said what was on my mind. When he came he did give our grandma a fist bump but I brushed it off. But this could’ve ended dreadfully I later found out.

3 days later on Sunday, I found out that someone at his office had tested positive from Covid that previous monday. So first thing I do is text AP in confusion and frustration , and ask him if its true. He says ya and that he tested negative so I dial it down and say good. That night I jump on to play online with him and this thought continues to gnaw at me so I ask him when did he get tested. He says on friday. I freeze, realizing this is a day after he came to our house. My anxiety goes up, I ask him when he found out about the person who tested positive. He says monday. So no I’m angry realizing that he came over to our house knowing this and before getting tested. I ask him calmly but anxiety in my voice, why he would take that risk when I specifically said not to come. He says he knew he was fine. I say how when he hadn’t been tested yet, knowing his answer was ridiculous. He stumbles and answers annoyed, that he’s fine so it doesn’t even matter. I’m flabbergasted. I tell him, “That’s fucked up man.” And he doesn’t say much after as we finish our game. I’m in shock but don’t talk about it anymore. And he starts talking more and more about his frustration with the game and I just make small talk. That was a week ago and we haven’t talked since, when before we talked almost everyday. So I felt bad, like a little bitch, and decided to text him today to ask him if he wanted to play seeing that he was online. He didn’t respond to my text or chat invite and logged off soon after. He has ghosted me before when I criticized him so I know that this isn’t me being paranoid but this is my last straw.

Writing this whole thing out and reliving the last couple years I feel like such a pushover, going out of my way. And this extends passed AP. I have become overly nice to everyone and analyze everything I say or text with extreme scrutiny so I don’t piss anyone on off and push people away. But it is extremely tiring and it makes me feel like I have a wall up that doesn’t allow me to make genuine relationships where I can say what I want with out feeling like i’ll be abandoned.

I never used to be like and was more of a guy who said whatever he wanted and had strong friendships. But now I overthink everything and feel like it isn’t worth going out of my way if after everything I’m being honest with someone over something that is right on my part and they ghost me. I don’t want to give fucks anymore but my mind won’t let me. I’m just sad."
374,I just want to be sick,"That's all it is. I want to make myself sick. I'm at my wits end really.
I've gone through a really tough break up with a girl after she cheated on me, second relationship this has happened in in a row, but after I blocked her for say a week, I unblocked her again, I broke down crying and told her I still loved her. And I do, that's not a lie. I do really love her. She's honestly the most beautiful woman and she's kind at heart and I got along with her super well, but, I guess that wasn't enough for her. 
But I told her we could try work things out, and in the midst of this pandemic, we met up. It was a good day, and, I thought we had fixed it, but she told me before she left ""I just don't see a future between us anymore"".
When she got home, she texted me ""I don't find you attractive anymore"".
She explained why after I asked her to, and I'll admit, I did put on a few pounds over lockdown, but it's nothing crazy. I still look the same just maybe a lil extra on the hips I guess. I mean I guess it's okay she's not attracted to me, but, she said we weren't getting back together until I worked on myself. I already had body issues before this, which she knows of, I took some drugs that got me really high but on the comedown would make me sick during our relationship, I told her that was the reason and she didn't really take notice tbh.
But, even though she does these things that are res flags, I still love her, and I want her more than anything else, but I feel like even if I try now, it's too late.
She met up with the guy yesterday again... When we met, she told me she could omly meet at 2 till 6 because that's when she'd be able to get rides home. Yesterday, I didn't hear off her till 9, so I already know she spent more time with him than she really wanted to with me, but I brushed it off, they're just friends, right? well today there was no good morning message, though she was online. so I sent the first one. and after something like 20 minutes, she messages back, and tells me she's at his house.
And I just don't know anymore. It's really killing me inside. As cliche as this sounds, I know I love her far more than most people love. She's my genuine everything and I wanted this life with her.
But it never seems she cares about me when I tell her how I feel about all these things. She tries saying I'm just jealous and controlling, even though she admitted to cheating, though she didn't see it as cheating.
I just want to hurt myself. I cry every single night now. I can't bother to eat most of the day anymore, and I keep forcing myself to throw up if I do because I immediately feel like shit. I keep considering suicide just to end it so I don't have to be around to feel this anymore.
I hate her but I fucking love her. I just wish she was still mine. i wish I was still attractive to her. I just wish I wasn't around."
375,Is healing/recovery a responsibility?,"I am very sorry if the following post might be triggering to anyone. 

I saw a post online saying that “having issues does not justify bad behavior, if you have trauma it is your responsibility to heal.” Trauma does not exactly equal mental illness, so I’m kind of torn with how to respond. But as a person with trauma, I feel kind of annoyed towards the second half of the statement?

I agree that having mental issues shouldn’t be an excuse towards being a shitty person. Many actions are because of the mental illness though, so it’s a really tough discussion... As with the next part, I feel it’s kind of annoying to say that healing is a **responsibility** as it is not a person’s fault when an external factor causes their trauma. By making them accountable for their trauma and giving them added responsibility is... unfair? I mean healing is pretty much directly facing your own trauma and it’s no easy feat.

Open to a discussion, please be kind ❤️"
376,Anxiety about developing Schizophrenia,"Just found out that being premature increases risk for schizophrenia. I was born after about 30-32 weeks, and I have used lsd about 4 times, shrooms 1 times, and smoked weed pretty heavily for a little under a year I’ve been clean for about a month now. I have noticed some behaviors that relate to the negative symptoms like, depression, mild anxiety, no motivation, wanting to stay locked in my room, hardly have any friends and I never feel like going out to hangout with them, and I have had trouble with school and concentrating since my freshman year of high school. I moved to an independent study school where I pretty much just do my work at home and hardly ever go into class. The most anti social type of schooling I could find and even then it’s been extremely hard trying to get through. I’m currently 18 no positive symptoms at all except I have illusory palinopsia which is a common symptom of HPPD due to my lsd use however is this a symptom for Schizophrenia?  Wouldn’t have my drug use made it manifest already?"
377,Everyday everything gets harder,"I feel like I cannot function like a normal person because of my mental health problems but no one notices. Everyday it gets harder and harder to do my uni work - no one understands when I try to explain to them how much I struggle to do the uni work like I. just. can’t. do. it. I am sitting there and screaming at myself in my head and tearing up because I know I’m just making it harder for myself by not doing it but I still can’t do it. And every day I just get more depressed and more anxious and more paranoid. I literally feel like I’m losing my mind. But no one in my life can see it at all. When I talk to people about how I feel they legitimately do not believe me. I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can do 3 years of uni like this but everyone just thinks I’m lazy and stupid. I’m such a fucking failure, why do I struggle to just live and study at uni when everyone else can do it?"
378,Don't you get tired of randomly encouraged by people of the internet who knows absolutely nothing about what you're going through?,"I'm not talking about this forum. It's perfectly fine to reply to those who publicy expressed distress who wants and needs help. It's absolutely fine to give personal attention to specific burdens.

I'm talking about those random comments on Youtube or other platforms saying ""You're beautiful, you're worthy, you're talented, don't give up on yourself!"" like bitch no you don't even know me? I mean like that generic crap that can apply to just about everyone. 

It was cute the first ten thousand encounters but then I realized how cheap it is. I get that it's a genuine gesture (and maybe not maybe it's just upvote farm) but it feels so random and impersonal and shallow. You don't even know how I look like, you don't even know how I define my worth, you don't even know my aspirations, and you don't even know what I'm good or bad at. How am I supposed to be in any way comforted by someone so completely ignorant of who I am?

You just KNOW they don't mean it. It just feels like a cheap trick to make you feel better on the surface so you don't make any more ruckus with your unhappiness. I mean it's starting to feel akin to giving starving children a small piece of candy for a meal. 

Lately I've felt the same about songs of the same caliber. At least there's work put in to songs to make them sound good. 

I dunno guys I've felt this way for a long time but today for some reason it was irritating me to no end. It feels so fake. I think it does more harm than good to those who actually need that sort of help and encouragement."
379,Do you guys have trouble sleeping?,"It's been 4 days now since I had a proper night of sleep. I just can't stand it anymore. I feel so tired and I can't sleep at all. As soon as I lie down on my bed my body starts to shake, move, I feel dizzy, even my pillow bothers me. I'm trying to reach my doctor but she isn't answering the phone. 
Plus, a friend said that lack of sleep can cause brain demage and now I am paranoid"

381,It is so easy to fake a smile,"It is so easy to fake a smile...

It is so much easier than telling people what is going on.

Than telling them that they said something hurtful.

Than telling them that they are the reason you went from a great mood to a bad mood.

I can wear that fake smile all-day, until I come home, lay on my bed... then I feel so unhappy, I could actually cry."
382,I'm 22 now and I just can't keep going on,"Today I woke up as 22 yo man. In Iran (not that this is the weird factor. I live in Iran). Opened my eyes and had nothing to wake up to. Again. And it hit me pretty bad.
I'm 22. I have 22 years worth of memory, most of it has been consumed by being bullied, depression, anxiety and losing the will to live. I didn't even expect to be 22. I was supposed to be dead.
Now, today. No future ahead of me (cause of my living condition, being in Iran and all), no one to support me and no money to reach out and get help. I bought a cake today, a small sponge cake, instead of candles, all I had on me was my cigs. I looked at the burning cigarette on the cheap, low quality sponge cake and I didn't want it. Any of it. I think I gave up, right when I was lookin at my 22nd birthday cake.
I think I'll survive (it's probable, I probably won't commit suicide for today at least), but the pain and the pressure, it'll set me off one day and I'm not strong enough to srand my ground, guys."
383,I don’t know what to do. My life is a fucking hurricane.,"I leave a trail of shit in my wake. I’m so disorganized and chaotic and I don’t take care of anything. My car is full of junk and trash and food and my brakes just completely gave out after I ignored two weeks or terrible squealing. I have no idea how I’m going to pay for the repairs, my wife and I want to buy a house and I have no idea how I can work on our future while my life just seems like a dumpster fire. 

Nothing in my life is not chaotic. I have no idea what to do. I’m so overwhelmed."
384,Why does it seem like I’ll never be able to have a happy/healthy relationship?,"My entire life I have dealt with extreme anxiety and stress. I used to be prescribed Zoloft (SSRI) and it’s didn’t help much. I eventually went on a psychedelic escapade and completely discovered myself after my ex broke up with me months ago. Just a little back story. 

So anyways recently I have met a girl who absolutely blows my mind. She’s such an amazing, kind, and caring individual not to mention she’s absolutely gorgeous and funny (and the sex is 15/10) and means the world to me. Only problem is we’re not dating we’re just a “thing” and it’s basically polyamory. She has a group of female friends who all have sex with each other occasionally but I’m the only guy she’s sleeping with. I am genuinely fine with it but it feels like my conscious and subconscious are on 2 different playing fields about the matter and it’s causing my head to basically self destruct. 

My problem in the past was always having extremely negative racing thoughts so bad that I would just curl up into a ball and cry. 

Why does it seem like I can’t be happy in life without these horrible racing thoughts? When I wasn’t talking to anyone and just going about life I felt like I found a balance, I was neither happy nor sad but it felt nice. Now that I have happiness back in my life I feel all the depression and negative thoughts coming back as well. I just want to be able to enjoy life to the fullest and understand why I am the way I am"
385,I know this sounds odd but anyone relate?,"Has anyone else ever tried to clean something like there shower, but not done a great job and then beat themeselves up for not doing a better job or doing the correct way.

I am an anxious person and I obsess a lot over things, I keep thinking I didn’t rub in the chemicals hard enough and that when I hung my shower mat over the shower screen that chemicals are on it now and they will transfer to my skin when I touch the mat"

388,How do I not feel insecure in arguments,"Backstory: I have a really difficult relationship with my mom since the earliest moments of my childhood. This leads to any insecurities on me and myself including self-worth and having really strong problems with overthinking etc. I'm already approaching therapy but this is not what this is about.

The problem I need advice on, is about me and an old friend of mine, I know for a long time now. We are well known in other friend groups, for having a lot of arguments and discussions. Sometimes because I don't agree with his points or mostly because he is somewhat toxic about delivering or taking criticism of in certain topics. 

For example, we talked about trump. His opinion was that he's not that terrible like the media is presenting in media while my opinion is that Trump is not a good president, alone on the fact that he reacted way to late on the COVID-19 Virus. He was not happy with that. He didn't take any of my arguments seriously and became somewhat toxic by nitpicking my words. Even when I tried to show him videos or articles, nothing was enough for him that counts as a good argument for him to talk about.

This situation dug up an old hole on me. It felt like I was talking with my mother again, making me feel like I have nothing to say. This is so frustrating because I really know that I have my own opinion, that I'm 100% represent it but I can't stop think about being a ""low-class"" in this situation. I keep trying to reflect on something I can't reflect on and I really need something like advice to maybe approach this on some other perspectives."
389,Woke up confused and false memory.,"Hi, I woke up half an hour ago from a deep sleep, and I’m the process of going back to to complete my sleep. Anyway, I woke up with what felt like a false memory, specifically that I had done something heinous. I became anxious and approached my parents about it and my mother, being the doctor she is, assured me that I roused from a hypnogogic state. 

I’m still slightly confused as to what happened. Can anyone offer any insight? Thank you."
390,I’m schizoaffective and I’m having a hard time dealing with it.,"I was diagnosed not too long ago and I’ve been using reddit and my resources that I have in person to the fullest extent to get help and talk when I need to talk. I know my thoughts don’t belong to me anymore but they’re making me so depressed. Forcing me to relive parts of my past, making me hate the situation I have they even tell my to kill myself sometimes. I’m just really sad it’s painful, literal physical pain. I just feel like crying and screaming. I try to silence my thoughts with loud music or playing video games, smoking, online window shopping, watching Netflix or taking long hot showers. But they never go away and they know my tricks and making it exceedingly difficult to manage my life. I hardly eat, I’ve upgraded to 2 meals a day rather than my 0-1 meal a day, and I can’t keep myself together. My room is a mess, my hygiene is a mess, my life is a mess. I wish I wasn’t so abnormal why can’t I have normal people problems why am I cursed with this disease?"

392,Only child with emotionally unavailable parents,"Hi, as the title says, I'm an only child who had a pretty good childhood from a material and educational point of view, but my parents were very detached because they're both emotionally repressed due to their own childhood trauma + their relationship is also awful. So it's a dysfunctional family pretty much, even though on surface level it seemed alright. For eg. we never went on holidays together, they never hugged me, and they never said they loved me (my mother started saying she loves me after I left my home country, so in my twenties - a bit late lol, but at least she's trying). 

My father was completely emotionally and verbally absent (he would barely speak to me and my mother), and my mother was very authoritarian and was ordering me around, she also had a short temper so I always had to walk on eggshells with her. I had to grow up by myself basically and be my own emotional support. I've become very independent and self-sufficient due to that situation, but there are other negative effects that I haven't fully understood yet, so please let me know if you have any insight. I would like to go to therapy some day but I'd like to understand this more (I've realised all of the above very recently - still new to this).

What I've noticed so far:

1. I don't really miss friends? I value their friendship but I don't have that aching feeling if I don't see them for long. When they say ""miss you xx"" I say it back, but I'm not really feeling it and it's making me feel awful. I really like them and they're great people, but it's as though I have all these millions of barriers.
2. I question authority sometimes.
3. I am *terrified* of being myself and vulnerable, both in friendships and romantic relationships (especially).
4. I *need* affection and being taken care of emotionally by my romantic partner (and I also want to return the favor). This is not quite healthy because I end up depending on him emotionally too much - it's as though I have this very idealistic idea of romance where my partner is my savior and I'm expecting him to nurture me the way my parents have failed to do.
5. The above point also makes me extremely perfectionistic in love and I get disappointed *so quickly* (""oh he's not the savior that I thought he was""/""oh he's not that ideal partner that I had in mind"") - even though he is wonderful. It's as if my mind enhances the negative qualities that I see in romantic partners, even though they're not a big deal.
6. Not necessarily a negative one but I've made it my life mission (well, one of my many life missions :P) to have my own loving family. To have kids that I can nurture and raise the way my parents have not managed to. With love, care, affection, communication, understanding. This is definitely not bad, I just don't want to become obsessed with it, you know, or have my entire identity revolve around my future husband and kids.

Any other areas I should be aware of? Thank you so much!"
393,Anything to help libido?,So since I’ve been on antidepressants my libido has been zero. I’m 34M and would like to get into the dating scene but I have zero interest in sex and very rarely masturbate. If I do masturbate its a very soft erection and is all underwhelming. I will awk my GP what my options are? The depression is getting better as are all its symptoms so I dunno why this one is still lingering. Anybody here had experience? I’m on 40mg Prozac and 5mg Olanzapine.
394,Need advice/help,Lately i have been really worrying about what i did in my past not that its bad but i fear im going to go to hell for it. I also fear i am going to lose control of my body and i just cant do anything due to worry and i dont know what to do
395,My friend who says they don't want to die anymore looks like they do,"When we first met his eyes had that dead look. That no emotion cold darkness look. Over about 5 months he started to get his shine back, little bit by bit. Then quarantine hit. His eyes started getting darker. He started rocking more. He started twitching more. Today he asked if we could video call when I woke up so we are now. His eyes are so dead. I'm scared he's going to try to leave again. I really don't want third time to be the charm. I don't know how to help and what to do."
396,Why do I get an overwhelming sadness and cry / feel the need to cry when I receive presents?,"I can’t understand what happens. My boyfriend bought me a beautiful ring and he told me about it over the phone and afterwards I started to cry. Whenever I get a present or I’m told about it, especially if it’s from my boyfriend, I get sad about it and cry/feel the need to cry. I thought it’s just me being overwhelmed but I want to understand it properly. 
Of course I’m so grateful for him and whatever gifts he gets me, I just don’t know how to act and my emotions get all wobbly. It’s the same kind of sad you get on your birthday. 
Does anyone know what’s happening?"

I used to be able to feel it, but I've grown numb to it. Maube just feeling a little cold inside. Feelings of inadequacy hiding behind a mask of pragmatism? 

I am an introvert and do regular introspection to re-evaluate my mind, but it's been difficult to do that lately. 

Basically, any techniques that could help feel it again? I can tell people are reaching out to.me, but I just shy away."

399,Is social media destroying our mental health?,"I've been suffering of anxiety and depression for the majority of my life (since i was 15 to about 19).

The best decision i've ever had in my life was to stop using social media. after two moth i felt much better, i had less anxiety and depression decreased significantly. after about 6 moth i recovered from my mental illness. 

I found social media usage is toxic because:

* I stopped enjoying simple stuff
* I was sacrificing your real life to create a fake-always happy digital version of yourself
* Constantly comparing myself to others fake-life making me fell worthless.

i'm curious to read your experience about usage of instagram/youtube etc. and mental health and benefit or downsides you had when you tried to limit your social media usage."

401,My Brother Needs Help,"If there is anyone on Reddit who may have any clue after reading this of what my brother may potentially have, I’d love to know. I’m not looking for an official diagnosis, but my brother won’t go to the doctor for help which is why if maybe we have a sense of what’s going on we can help him better.

My brother started doing drugs (mostly if not only hallucinogens) in early high school, maybe as far back as middle school. He’s abused hallucinogens so badly over the last decade of his life (he’s 27), that I think he’s living in a distorted reality, or in the least consistently trying to escape the current reality. He thinks crazy thoughts such as the idea that someone is following him (this thought hasn’t gone away). The only possible way I feel this could be possible if he didn’t pay someone for drugs which I’m pretty sure he still uses despite him denying it. 

He doesn’t know how to socially interact well anymore. I’ve become very disconnected from him. I can’t talk to him about anything anymore. When we video call (I live in Japan), he will have long periods of silence in between questions I ask, or when we are not sure what to talk about. He always answers most questions with the same answer and repeats the same questions over. It oftentimes takes him longer to respond. It’s not very obvious until you really take the time to talk to him. It’s little things at first like his intonation compared to other people, and once you get deeper he’ll open up about his full belief in a range of conspiracy theories and what are most likely hallucinations (what I think the whole someone’s following him idea is). 

He has huge anger management issues. He’s broken dozens (not an exaggeration) of electronics over the years including MP3 players (which were expressive at the time), computers, laptops, gaming platforms, as well as many walls and my grandmas kitchen cabinet a couple months after she passed away and started living in her house alone. He had been living with her for months up until her sudden passing in November. 

He cannot keep a job. He’s worked dozens if not over a hundred jobs and every time he quits no matter how good the job is for him. He only ever graduated high school so it’s more difficult for him to find a full time job with benefits. On top of that he always prefers working part time because he just mentally can’t seem to handle working a full time job. Oftentimes when he’s quits he’ll say something along the lines of, “I can’t do this anymore” and just up and leave in the middle of a shift.

He treats my father (what I guess you could refer to as his caretaker) like scum. He’ll call him names, spit awful words at him and has even gotten into a physical fight before with him (the cops were called supposedly and they had to go to court). He does not appreciate anything my father does despite him being the reason he’s alive as he doesn’t manage his money, can’t cook, and doesn’t clean. He blows his paychecks on drugs (I hope it’s just marijuana, but I can’t say for sure if he’s not doing other damaging drugs like he used to). 
 
If anyone can tell me what they think this is, I’d greatly appreciate it. I’m not taking it as an official diagnosis to say the least, but if anyone is going through something similar and has advice on how they deal with it, that would also be nice. Thank you."

403,Anybody tried 5-HTP or tryptophan?,"Hello all I am a 26-year-old male with a history of mental health struggles. I am currently in a situation in my life right now where I have had some drastic life changes I had a falling out with a church that I worked at as well as a intense relationship that ended pretty heavily. I am currently looking to do what I can about some depression and anxiety that I have had a history with for sometime. Honestly most of my issues are just negative thought loops and habits in my lifestyle/relationships that I have not been able to break out of as easily. Just deeply rooted beliefs that cause my life to be more challenging than it needs to be. I’m currently paying the price for some decisions and choices and habits that I made while being very depressed and having anxiety attacks this past year. I currently am in the middle of restarting my life and career. I’m having to find a new career path make new friends and try to heal from past events that have scarred me the past couple years.

I am 26 I don’t have insurance and I don’t really have a strong support system. Do you guys have any recommendations for me as to where I can seek out and or practical things I can do to help my body."

405,Any help/suggestions,"Hi everyone here, so I'm having a bit of trouble right now and was looking for a way to cope or help the problem.

In the last 2 months I've put myself through a lot. I went to the school of my dreams (or so I thought) which was one of the military academies in the US. When I got there I found myself crying daily, sometimes more than once, for at the time I couldn't tell. After a while I came to the conclusion that the military was not for me, so I separated.  I came back to live with my mom in the mid-west because of the large social circle of friends that I love very much that haven't left for college. For being short I'll post the link to the problems with my mom that my brothers and I had [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/i3a06z/looking_for_advice3rd_party_commentary_reposted/). They moved to the east coast with my dad before I left for one of the academies. I decided to move from my mom's to somewhere else in the same town with family, who have all expressed support for me to do so. 

That's the context, so now I can get into the problem. When I moved my mom blew up, which I predicted, but it still hurt me. She had said several things such as ""I'm sorry that I'm not her (my stepmom),"" ""I'm glad you know how to treat women like crap,"" ""I'll see you when I die,"" ""Why don't you move down to \[East Coast State\] with your brothers,"" ""The truth is you're (my mom referring to herself) not worth the effort.""

I've been more stressed and anxious than ever right now. My entire life was flipped and the negative pressure from my mom doesn't help. I was on my way back from looking at cars to replace the one my mom gave me but still owned, and I just felt like I was about to cry the whole way back. I know it is better for me to have been out of that situation, but I feel like I'm dragging myself right now. There are times where I just lie down in my bed and don't get up for around 2-3 hours. School for me at the time of posting this starts tomorrow, so I'm hoping having something to do will help.

I'm willing to give more details or commentary if wanted, but I'm looking for things to help me with this, because with many of my friends moving away to college I can tell it will be a bit harder for me as they were the people I leaned on whenever something came up."

407,Are we all insane,Is there really any adult in America that doesn't have mental health problems. I think 2/3 of the world has mental health problems
408,I have no idea what to write here.,"Hey, I'm just here for a rant! Also I am new to this sub. So I (F) work at sea which is a very male dominated industry, I often struggle with being the only woman, feeling inadequate, imposter syndrome and low self worth are regular visitors in my daily routine. I've recently started on a new ship and though everyone has been nice and welcoming, the captain has decided otherwise.

A couple of days ago I was having lunch and he joined the table I was sat at. I made small talk and as I was about to leave I said half jokingly ""well, I suppose I should get back to work! Not that I can be bothered today"" now in the UK this is a normal things to say. However this guy took it as literal and had now been bitching about me to the crew.

My anxiety has been through the roof and I feel worse to the extent that I've not been sleeping and my mental health is at a low. It's hard enough being a woman at sea, having depression at sea, without the master of the ship telling people I shouldn't be here if I can be bothered and that I'm just taking someone else's job.

I'm desperate to have it out and tell him but I k ow it won't do me or my career any good. Even if I didn't have mental health issues, people are allowed to have a bad day. The guys just met me and had already decided I must not give a fuck about my job!!"
409,"Hey, beautiful people of Reddit. I've been going through something, but idk what it exactly is. Please help/give me solutions to stop feeling this way. Or atleast tell me what this is?","I'm 19 M. Since this morning I've been feeling really low. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Sure, online classes are stressful, but I log in and go to sleep so there's that. I've started to go to the gym, they opened here a week ago, not many cases here. I've been playing pool(snooker) and taking guitar lessons at home with my sis and my friend who I'm secretly hooking up with. Sounds happy enough, right? I have loads of people I can call and talk to. And/or meet physically. 

But I'm still feeling extremely low. I am very self aware, but I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know what to do. I don't know how this began, or why I'm feeling this way. All I know is I might never stop feeling this way. It's really saddening. I can barely feel my emotions. Like Dementors are sucking the life out of me. Please help. What is this?"
410,How to get help in the UK it's kind of important but not an emergency..?,"The NHS doesn't give a crap about mental health. That's pretty clear. I tried to get a doc appt in february because my compulsive skin picking, related to OCD was getting worse and beginning to get painful.

They cancel my appt.

My mum spends several HOURS making phone calls to get me another appointment, a phone consultation later that week early march.

She just tells me to move up to the max dose of my medication and that she'll refer me to mind matters for CBT/ERP.

I call again in june because I had a panic attack and i'd left a large cut, several centimetres wide and a mm or so deep. I was terrified it was going to scar, it still hasn't fully healed.

They said they'd call me back about getting me a prescription for something to help it heal and disinfect it.

They never called us back. 

Well now it's infected and I had another panic attack last night. My entire chest area is a bloody mess, my mum had to go and get me some extra large surgical dressings to cover the cuts and it's so sore I can hardly move without it hurting. She had to use the money we'd saved for a family meal out next week.

Sorry dad, mum and sister. I ruined our night out.

I can't bring myself to shower because it's going to sting like fuck. My hairs a frizzy mess and I need to shave and I feel gross, but I just can't- even a cold bath sounds too painful right now.

The blood ruined one of my favourite shirts. It's never going to come out.

It's going to scar. I'm never going to be able to wear a bikini. I'm never going to be comfortable going topless for a partner. 

I'm always going to have a stupid ugly reminder of all those cold dark nights alone when the only thing I can do to relieve the anxiety is to scrape at my skin.

 It's disgusting and while i'm not normally the kind of person to give a shit about appearances, I don't like the idea of having this for life.

Is your life in immediate danger? Then the NHS is amazing and we need it.

Anything else? Fuck you.

I still can't get an appointment util october. I need help, but it's not an emergency so nobody in the NHS is going to even try and help me. 

I don't even know what to do anymore, I can hardly move it stings so much.  I can't even hug my hamster right now because she doesn't understand not to walk on sore spots or pee on me or bite at the bandages."
411,Difficulty with trusting people close to me.,"
Idk why, but I struggle with trusting friends and family at times. No matter how little evidence there is to support my claims a part of me is convinced that they’re lying to me and want to ridicule (and potentially harm) me. Suddenly every normal body language seems to be a secret code, as if they’re mocking me in front of me. At its absolute worst I’ll believe strangers on the street are whispering about me— how I look, walk, (my thoughts?) and my very essence. I’m wondering if anyone can relate."
412,Depression SUCKS!!!,"Depression sucks. Yes I’m on medication for it but even with the medicine I have more bad days then good &amp; I feel like no one understands, not even the closest people to me. 
What sucks even more is... depression &amp; being pregnant!!! I’m having my third child in 9 days!!! I also suffer from severe anxiety... so right now I feel like I’m going to explode at any given moment. 

I feel like giving up. I’m losing hope. I hate this. I just wish people understood."
413,We all fall sometimes. And it hurts. So much. But let's help each other get back up!,"It accrued to me recently, that I was becoming unhappy. I was struggling with my relationships, my work, and my life. But you would never know it. From the outside, I have the ""perfect"" life. A nice house. Wife. Kids. Car. Job. Health. And to be able to say I have and maintain these things is unique right now. So many people cannot say the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely fortunate, and I thank God for what he has given me. But I found that I was still very sad. 

It wasn't until about a week ago that I realized why. It wasn't my life that was upside down, rather it was my perception of myself. Regardless of all my good fortunes, I did not respect myself. That disrespect for myself has continued lingered since I was a child 30+ years ago. While contained and tamed, it has always been there. I just now realized something. While I thought I had it under control, I did not. And it projected out of my voice, attitude, and actions on a daily basis. Over time, I learned to ignore it to the point where I didn't think I even had a problem. But those around me, closest to me, who love me... were the ones who were feeling it most. My selfish notions, and my ignorance that I had a problem, ultimately hurt the  ones dearest to me. Friends, family, and most importantly my wife and children.

 I see that now. I am only a week into my journey, but I have begun to love and respect me for who I am, and not what others want me to be. I will no longer compare myself to my peers. I will be happy with me. Content with me. Love for, me. In doing so, I am allowing myself to love and respect others as well. In hopes this will project something I have been missing for so long. 

I encourage you all, to join me in this journey. It will be long, it might be painful, but in the end, we will be liberated of this burden!

414,Feeling overwhelmed after big life change,"I just moved into a new house in another country after going back to living with my family for 5 months due to lockdown and I am feeling very overwhelmed by the fact that I’m alone at home and don’t have people around me to do things with. 
I’ve lived on my own before but it just feels weird being alone again, cooking for myself, making decisions on my own. I am able to see my partner once a week but that doesn’t take away the feeling of loneliness when he leaves. Any tips on how to overcome these anxious feelings?"

About two weeks ago I was quite emotionally controlled /stable, however over the past few days my emotions are all over the place and v. erratic.

But basically I'm cutting my arm whenever I get upset and i know it hurts my family and friends to see that I've been cutting myself and it definitely upsets me that I've hurt them but at the same time I don't know how to break this cycle of not allowing myself to feel my emotions and for my brain to allow me to feel sad"
417,How is it possible to be so fucked up,[removed]
418,I think something's wrong with me.,"I don't know where to start but please be kind to me. I think I'm starting to realize I'm messed up all along. 

- Ever since I was young, I was pretty passionate with my emotions. When I liked someone, I would do anything, not just that I would pour my heart out and give notes. Now I don't do that anymore.

- I think I have high expectations and is sensitive over how people treats me because I just felt like I was always there, I don't even have friends now

- I always fantasize about breakups and I don't know how to describe it but I just love the feeling of pain it gives me just by fantasizing it. The scenarios are mostly: Partner cheats on me/ did something wrong to me and I'd want a breakup and they would cry and tell me not to leave. These thoughts are getting out of hand because I'm almost daydreaming every hour even when I'm out with friends, sometimes I'd just wander away and especially now that I have my first relationship

- now this gets even worse, I have this anxious thoughts that my partner is talking/flirting/cheating and sometimes I even want it to just happen already so I can get over it. I don't know how and what to do. I really don't think I'm capable of being with anyone. Not just that I lie too so that my partner thinks that I have a life other than them for example creating scenarios that never even happened, I honestly think I have a serious codependency issue and my partner is the center of my world. How I see myself is like a dog wagging its tail when their owner comes home. 

- oh, and I am also a people pleaser. Sometimes I lie just so they won't think bad of me, I say things so they would see me in a positive way and like me. 

-I really hate myself when I lie. I feel like I have no goal in life too and no sense of identity, I am what others see me as but sometimes I am able to just be myself. 

I don't know how and where to start, I just want to be a better and healthier minded person. I can't even go to therapists in my country because we have not that much and the private ones are so expensive. I can't afford online one too. I just want to get out and leave myself, I hate me. I feel sorry for my partner and family."
419,How to find something that is worth living for?,"I don't feel like killing myself because it will make my family sad. So I would just like to know how to find something that's worth living for, so I don't want to kill myself. 

Don't worry there's no way I'm going to kill myself, but I still feel like I don't want to exist. 

Basically I won't kill myself because of guilt. I still want to though. What do I do about it?"
420,"I am having troubles when I'm on medication for depression and anxiety, but my doctor suggests I should take them (we've tried a couple of different medicines but nothing seems to work)","I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder for over a year now. And my psychiatrist/therapist prescribed medication to me in the second of therapy session itself (I did feel a little weird, as I could not accept that I was in depression and needed medication). But I was too much in distress to question or rethink anything and I did start taking medication, which was quite low dosage then. 

Now I need to mention that I haven't always followed my medicine schedule. I stopped taking them for longer periods of time. Mostly because I used to slip into depression, skip my meals and forget to take my pills. Sometimes when I couldn't sleep or had bouts of panic attack, I would take my medicines randomly as SOS measures. But I felt guilty and I always thought I'd change my habits and tried to be more regular in taking my pills, hence I never told about any of this to my doctor. 

Over the course of time my depressive phases and anxiety increased and my medication dosage increased too. And I started becoming more responsible in taking medicines daily, but I started experiencing side effects. (Extreme lethargy, constant yawning, insomnia). We have tried a couple of different medicines but nothing seems to work yet. 

A while back, I went complete medicine free for 3 weeks, due to certain unavoidable (and quite difficult) circumstances, and I did experience a low phase after that. My doctor knows that I didn't take my medicines for 3 weeks and she suggested that I immediately start taking them. But I feel worse after taking them, my brain isn't functioning at all. I am constantly yawning. And I want to stop taking medicines but my doctor insists that I need my medicines. What should I do? Has anyone faced this before? Also, is it normal to experience the side effects I'm facing? Please help.

421,I keep getting told that “everyone does” and to get over” the death of my friend and it sucks because it hurts me more than anyone.,"3 months and 6 days ago, my friend committed suicide. I’ll leave out the details, but I was the one who found her. She was only 16 and I was 15 at the time, and since then, I’ve had horrible nightmares and woken up with images of her in a pool of blood. For these last months, everyone tells me that we all die and I need to suck it up, but it isn’t just a death of a friend, I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. 

I finally took the effort to write a goodbye letter to help me move on and I put it on r/unsent letters because I wanted someone to see it to, I don’t know, I just needed someone else to read it even if they didn’t care.

I looked online to get support because everyone in real life is dissing my trauma like it’s nothing and now the only place I’ve ever gotten real advice from just made it worse. So thank you do that redditor who forgot rule 0: don’t be a jerk. 

I’m sorry if this seems insignificant, to me it’s huge, and that letter was supposed to help me cope and it did until I received that comment.

Which is why I have bad anxiety/depression as of today as a adult. I don’t have time for therapy. Anyways, my anxiety has been super bad this year, like barely feel like I can function most days. Mostly about health worry thinking stuff. Today I cried hard for the first time in a long time. It made my stomach feel weird from crying so hard, it felt like every emotion that was stored deep within my bones &amp; soul was weeping out of me. It made me feel like I couldn’t breathe from how hard &amp; intensely I cried &amp; felt. Felt like my inner pain was seeping out. That’s where my anxiety stems from. I feel a bit better now. Just wanted to share. Maybe you need a good hard cry today &amp; let yourself feel every emotion &amp; pain you’ve stored for too long."

426,Small victory!,"Just wanted to give a positive story. When you’re trying to heal from something or manage a disorder I think it’s important to really appreciate the victories no matter how small they may seem to others. I haven’t been around people socially in at least 2 years and had terrible panic attacks even thinking about it. Last night I hung out with 5 people who were all very nice and we’re going to start a book club together! It’s my personal form of exposure therapy because treatments can be extremely overpriced and hard to find. So many times I’ve felt like I’ll never have friends because of my disorders, I’ll never be happy and I’ll never be “normal” I guess I was wrong and it’ll be a long road but I took a very big step and I’m, dare I say....proud of myself."

So, post lockdown, due to being in solitude for months on, I realised I function best without any friends, absolutely none. I love being completely alone where no one cares what am I doing and stuff like that. Which is why I did not talk to my friends (over call or messaging) for some days at a stretch, however, they confronted me saying I am in some sort of state of depression which is causing me to plummet to such thoughts, and that it's illogical that some person thinks that having ZERO human contact (or rather friendship, since the job line I chose is solely based on human contact) is healthy or that they can live without it forever.

While I do understand that this kind of life isn't something they'd like but my question is that is it completely illogical? Can there be any human who hates any kind of friendship completely or is my brain has some underlying issues and is tricking me to believe that I want absolute solitude?"

Tried cooking, making music, going for long walks, gaming, looking into conspiracy theories, watching a lot of shows and some other stuff that I can't remember. I am just bored with everything. Can't seem to find anything interesting.

Used to game a lot with friends a  year ago. Now I have moved to a different country and can't seem to find a community where I feel like home. Tried a lot of different games in search of finding communities. They are really boring solo (atleast for me). Also tried games made for solo players (not fun after 1 or 2 hrs of gameplay).  And this has happened to every single thing that I like. I don't have a lot of friends so I can't rely on anyone to hang out with. Also, I always seem to think that I know how I can get out of feeling like this but I don't know what to do.

Currently, I am seeking shelter in a lot of memes on reddit, yt compilations, insta short vids etc. They have also started to get a little boring ngl.

I am working 40hr weeks so I guess life is going to be like this but I'm going to have a job that I like further down the road hopefully. I am trying to be sane and really pushing my head around as to not have mental health issues that I see in people around me. I know it is something to be taken seriously.

I have a lot to be thankful for. I am sure that I don't live the worst life out there. I feel like a bratty lil kid who has what he needs and still isn't satisfied a lot of the times.

This post doesn't cover a lot of stuff that I can't remember right now but hopefully I can make people understand the situation more when I'm asked the right questions. Thanks."
431,Some thoughts. This is what stops me from doing the things I love,"One of my earliest memories is sometime in the year 2000. I was at a book exhibition at school with my parents, which was sponsored by Scholastic. I remember being happy and excited, even though at that age I barely knew anything about anything. But I did like books, and was fascinated by the dizzying collection of colourful books there.

My favourite book as a kid was the Atlas. I loved poring through my copy, and to look at not just maps of India, but of the whole world. This atlas not only had political maps, but geologic and weather maps too. I used to play atlas with my cousin brother where he would name a city from a country and I had to find it. It is unbelievable how much joy I got out from one book. I used to look at the scale at the bottom and marvel at the sheer size of the earth, how 1 centimetre on a map could equal a thousand kilometres.

The appeal of geography is for people who find ‘what is the world like out there?’ an interesting question to pursue. There is another subject that poses the same question: Space &amp; Astronomy. That day in 2000, the only book I asked my parents to buy was one on the solar system. When I flipped through it and saw the pictures, there was no way I was leaving without it.

Books were my lifeblood. And I don’t mean novels. I mean the atlas, the book on the solar system, Tinkle comics, and Amar Chitra Katha. For my 11th or 12th birthday my dad bought me a collection of 25 Amar Chitra Kathas. To this day it remains to be the best birthday present I ever got. I was so hooked onto these books that my parents had to lock up my collection during exam time. And I of course sneaked them out and read them to my heart’s content.

Another gift I received around that age from my cousin brother, was Trivial Pursuit in the form of a small digital console. Every time I pressed the button for ‘Next question’, I yearned for the shuffle to land on Science &amp; Technology. Though I fortunately wasn’t aware of the word at the time, but I was a dork, and glad to be one.

What I love the most about my childhood was the certainty I had about the things that made me happy, and the determination to pursue them earnestly. Granted, books and games are inherently quite ordinary and not particularly challenging. But no act is small when it is towards something your heart truly enjoys. I never stopped to question whether these things made me a dork/nerd/geek, or whether my friends liked it, or whether my parents liked these things about me. I liked doing these things and that was it — end of story.

It’s 2020 now, and doing what I want has become incredibly hard. And it is not because of work or this pandemic or ‘a part of growing up’. Consider writing for example. Apart from a couple of long captions on Instagram, I haven’t written a word in the last 6 months. I had time, I had things to say, and I genuinely enjoy writing. It creates a coherence and flow in my thoughts like nothing else and there is a sense of adventure. It’s like you start drawing a fruit, which then becomes a part of a tree, at which point a nest emerges, and you end up drawing a baby bird taking its first flight to grab the fruit.

And yet this is how my attempts to write go: The moment an idea enters, my friend’s face pops up, smirking at me and telling me this is no good. I think of how certain people will react, most of whom never read what I post anyway. I picture them narrowing their eyes, flaring their nostrils, and just scrolling past my words mercilessly. I remember a friend calling my writing a ramble, and another one saying I don’t mean the things I write. And thus the idea dies before it even takes shape into words.

Rationally, I know I’m not supposed to care.

Should I care about what people say? No.

Should I care when my friend smirks? No.

Do I care anyway? Yes.

Singing is something I enjoy too. A few months ago I purchased a condenser mic to record better. But I have been falling into the same trap again. Instead of recording, I hopelessly go through songs and think “well, this won’t be well received.” “This one will make people call me gay.” “This is too niche and nobody will connect to it.” “I sound funny on the high notes so what’s the point recording, fuck it.”

I think this is what is known as compulsive behaviour. They’re kind of like these bad habits, that you know are bad, yet you find it impossible to break out of them. When I eat at home, I absolutely must watch something while eating. And 95 percent of the time I will be watching something I’ve already seen. A re-run of Seinfeld, It’s always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, the entire MCU movie list: it is just an automatic action, into which no thinking goes whatsoever. Grab plate. Open mac. Open chrome. Enter Hotstar or Primevideo. Click on next episode. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or even fruit: press play.

Breaking out of these loops is like going through withdrawal. Last week I was angry at myself for watching The Newsroom for a 4th time, so one day I just didn’t watch anything. It literally felt painful  leaving it mid-season like that even though I knew what was going to happen. The next day, I tried browsing to see whether there’s something that genuinely interests me. I searched for space, and ended up watching an Engineering Marvels episode of the International Space Station. The next day I found the show Cosmos, and it rekindled joy. The joy of rediscovering a lost love, of the mind actually having to work to decipher what was being said, and rewind, if needed. Planet Earth is the only other show to have had this effect on me. It is Cosmos in fact, that sparked the memory of the book exhibition from 20 years ago.

There are other more embarrassing instances of compulsive behaviours that angered me. The launch of reels on Instagram meant that whenever I clicked on the search button, I was forced to constantly see what is usually a teen/young adult woman prancing and dancing in a series of costumes. I somehow got hooked to this particular profile, and started obsessively loading it again and again till a new post came. I don’t know this person, and yet dutifully watch her and learn 5 different ways to style a black tee. I had to uninstall Instagram for a few days to come to my senses, then eventually block her.

Everyone wants to live their life doing the things they love, and everyone has the time to do it. Looking back, if I think about why I haven’t done (more) of things I like, even the easiest of things, the answer is simple. One, I have spent way, way too much energy on ‘what would people think?’ and two, I spent my free time on auto-pilot, instead of taking the wheel and driving where I want to.

Doing what you love is level 2. Level 1 is to be conscious of what you’re actually doing. Watch and study yourself. If you’re anything like me, you’ll be surprised at the number of things you do without actually consciously deciding to. Love can wait, I’ll be happy to take the wheel for starters."
432,Dating Apps have harmed me more than theyve helped me.,"I sit here all day swiping through an app expecting to find someone who cares or I don't even fucking know what I'm looking for. Then matching with someone just to send them a couple messages back and forth to be unmatched three minutes later. Like, why the fuck swipe if you are just going to unmatch.

Fuck these apps, I hope I never fucking use you again."
433,"[19/M] My subconscious tells me I'm fat, but my conscious knows I'm not.","Hey there!

In the past year, I've became extremely obsessed about pursuing my unachievable ideal body image.

I've started working out 2-3 months ago, I've achieved some great results, but I still insecure about my body.

What can I do about it?"
434,How do you stop feeling guilt so you can just do something you want to do already?,"
."
435,I don’t know what I feel,"I really don’t know. It’s hurts. It feels like I’m literally gonna puke. I’ve been with my girlfriend for over 4 years and I don’t think she’s trusted me at all. 
Like I said. I don’t know what I feel. I just know it hurts. I want to cry, vomit, or just do something. But I’m stuck at work. Doing nothing about it. I’m ending it with her today because I can’t take it anymore. We have lived together for over a year and I just can’t deal with the anxiety of having to deal with her parents, our friends, the things we do together. Our neighbors. I really can’t find what I feel anywhere. I want to cry but can’t. I feel like I have to vomit but it won’t come. I need something. This just hurts. I’m not thinking of self-harm. I just want this to stop hurting."
436,Where to find affordable help for Borderline and Autism?,"Hey guys, 
I’m a 29 year old male. I have a daughter as well as a wife who is very extraverted and bipolar 1. I recently found out I am that I am autistic and show a lot of signs of borderline. As you can imagine, communication is very difficult. I have been to therapy and psychiatrists, but I can’t afford anything right now.

Are there any great mental health resources for people who don’t have money? 

Thank"
437,Is there a way to look up all board certified psychologists within my area?,I know I can look it up using the names of individuals but is there a tool that just shows you everyone in your proximity who is?
438,Working with a former fuck buddy,"I trust my bf. I’ve known him for 10 years and I love him to bits. He works at a jimmy johns with a coworker he fooled around with and ended a few months before we got together. He “used” her as a guinea pig, not sexually but said he wanted to help straighten her life around. And she did. But she thought they were dating and then went a bit crazy after that when he told her they were never dating just hanging out fooling around. They currently still work together only once a week and says there’s always tension Bc of that history. 

Now there’s a girl who’s like 4 years younger then him and I’m worried about her. He says “she’s too young”. He’d bring that up maybe twice when he does talk about his coworkers and it’s like I didn’t even ask for that. She’s 19, her hair was so pretty and long and curled. Brown on top and blonde on the bottom. I assumed she was really pretty Bc she was well put together. Super skinny and super tall and id think her and my bf would look physically perfect together. Yesterday I went to his work unknowingly that both girls would be there. He was supposed to train the pretty girl but he slept in and he didn’t. I asked what the girl was with the pretty hair and he was was like “yeah I guess she’s pretty...” I became overwhelmingly sad and can’t stop thinking about that comment. Then I assumed the blue haired girl was the one he fooled around. I’ve told him before it bugs me you work with the gir still but it’s only once a week. He really likes the people at his work that he doesn’t want to leave.

This all stems from my own insecurity. I’ve tried improving myself . I’ve tried makeup. Mascara looks weird Bc my eye lashes are too long (it really does look weird). I’ve got some weight on me. 5’8”. 180 lbs 
I’ve saved so many videos on how to improve my appearance on YouTube and just have been overwhelmed to even try to make myself more prettier. I hardly ever get any compliments from him but yet I get attention out on the streets if I dress in basic jeans, a dressy shirt and a cute bag.

I’ve been giving him the silent treatment since yesterday Bc everytime I have brought up my feelings, he said once , “if you keep thinking like this, idk how long we can make it...” but he knows when’s something’s wrong and he’s just been asking but I feel like I can’t tell him any more"
439,Advice on not caring what people think?,"Theres some people that seem to be negative about me (laugh when i walk in a room or talk behind my back etc) for no reason really because I'm always nice, work hard and help them when they need it. Maybe its because I dont speak as much as others but thats just the way I am. Any advice to not care what people think especially when its out of your control like this? Hard to remember that there should be nothing to worry about when I haven't actually done anything just cant wrap my head around why they would act like that towards me rather than just let me do my own thing"
440,Is procrastination a mental illness or a symptom of one?,I procrastinate a lot and have been disappointed with myself because of the same. Would just want some clarity.
441,"My boyfriend ( 26M) is struggling with his mental illness and hurting me (22F) along the way, but I don't just wanna give him up or loose him","My boyfriend (26 M) and I (22F) have been in a relationship for almost two years now. We live in two different countries but have already spent a whole year together. So we first met in summer of 2018 as friends but quickly became a couple. Just before that summer he helped me through a really though time, got me out of my depression and kept me from taking my own life. So we had a really great time and met five months later. I went with him to his country to spend there three months. And they were really great, but it was just then, that I realised that he is struggling with stress mainly bc of work but also coping with it in general. Living with him in a room I got to see him being distant and not as happy and cheerful as he usually is. He also sometimes would get a bit mad and hurt me with the way he said things. But I kinda managed to deal with it even tho it was something that hurt me a lot bc I am a very sensetive person and always loved that he never yelled or got furious or anything. In that time I also struggled mentally a bit myself. Being away for the first time from my parents for such a long time, being on the other end of the world and still dealing with social anxiety, caused some break downs where my boyfriend had to take over and take care of me so I wouldn't run onto a busy street or pack my suitcase before leaving. He never seemed to have lots of issues with it but as I learned later on, he in fact did. So after that time we spent four months working and travelling. It was challenging for me bc I haven't really been working, since I got sick but I still managed to do it quite well. But again with the work he often got stressed out and living in a tiny caravan, kinda made it even worse. So I had to work on a farm for many hours which was already a struggle with a boss that wasn't always understanding of me taking time off bc I wasn't feeling mentally well. So all that got together and lead to me having a total nervous breakdown where my bf had to carry me to our caravan while i was crying and sobbing and couldn't talk or walk or do anything but scream and bawl my eyes out. I also struggled a lot with my body being sick where he had to take over heaps of hard work for me bc I had a really bad cold that later turned out to me mono. So we both struggled. Additionally the boss made me feel bad for letting my bf do all the work even tho I clearly couldn't do it. My bf is also someone that wants to impress everyone and do more than he has to or should do. So he was always exhausted and I guess my mental and physical state affected him too bc he cared about me and took care for me as good as he could. The whole work and travel thing was good and we had lots of fun travelling but at some point at another place I and all the others got treated so horrible that I couldn't stay any longer. We left one month earlier than we wanted to bc I was mentally broken. So we went back to my country and spent three months in my room, since I live with my parents. Since I still had mono and was constantly sick we couldn't do much so he was stuck inside and hated it. Sometimes he would go for walks by himself and visit two friends but other than that we would be inside. And I think that affected him a lot too. So he left early this year and has been depressed ever since. He has a history with depression, took medication and went to therapy. At some point he got better and quit both. Back when his ex broke up with him, he managed to not get into depression again and except for the dealing with stress thing he always was pretty stable. So ever since he got home I told him to go to therapy. It actually took me crying and sending heartbroken messages, for him to go to a therapist. He doesn't like to take help from others and isn't to keen on going to therapy. He only has been once and keeps telling me that he is looking for someone else bc he didn't like that one he met with. But that's now over a month or even longer ago. He does sport which helps him, but he doesn't wanna take medication nor talk to me about his issues or what's going on. I know a lot and what works or could work but I feel like he never really wants to take my help or actually work on it even tho I could help him. So since I am not really stable myself... seeing my boyfriend being down, not himself, not being able to answer my text or talk on the phone or video chat or watch something together or even playing a video game,really really hurts me. And this past year he has been hurting me. Not on purpose since the mental illness isn't his fault but his stubbornness and just not even being willing to bite the bullet for me. I also struggle with not feeling accepted or taken seriously or important. He always was the one that gave me the feeling that he cares and what I say is important and matters and is interesting. He always was there for me, understanding me, reacting to things and talking about it and being excited instead of just boring like all the others. He is so special to me and I have never met any one like him. We are just so similiar in every way and he means so much to me. Yet all of this is taking a toll on me and my mental health... I cried more times bc of this, than I can count and it's always pulling me down again. He doesn't respond to a message I get upset. He doesn't answer something I really wanna know, I feel rejected. I My boyfriend (m, 26)and I (f,22) have been in a relationship for almost two years now. We live in two different countries but have already spent a whole year together.

I know it's also in a way my fault bc I know he cares but I just really struggle to see that. I ve already distanced myself a bit but I cant fully do it yet bc I just love him so much and care so so much about him... I don't wanna loose him but I feel like I am loosing him to his mental illness... and there isnt much I can do bc I am already doing everything possible in my power. I am trying to focus on myself and my own health but it's just hard to do like this, especially bc he has always been the strong one, that's there for me, catches me, cheers me up and Picks me up. If I would be in a better mental state I could do that for him too but I just don't have enough energy for the two of us... And he told me that those times when I broke down and he had to take care of me like you do of a child, affected him a lot and forced him to mature and grow. He doesn't like to talk about what's going on inside of him and I just don't know what he is thinking or feeling or what he wants. When I ask he tells me that he doesn't know or I have to repeatedly ask the question till he finally answers it. He says it's all a big mess and he doesn't like to think about the future which makes me very worried and I insecure as well. I don't wanna loose him bc of the mental struggles bc we except for that get along perfectly... never have fights or arguments and just had such a great awesome time together. I know that he truley loves me but the distance and not knowing when we ll be able to see each other plus both of our mental states just makes it all so complicated and though. And I just don't know what to do. I feel like I ve already lost him in a way and I am not sure if it can work out...  if any of you went through something similiar or have any advice or idea of what I could do, I would really appreciate your help. I definatley won't leave him just bc it's though bc he is the most important person to me and just perfect in any way what so ever.


TL;DR! My boyfriend struggles with mental health issues, doesn't go to a therapist and I feel like I am loosing him and the relationship. It also affects my mental health and I just don't know what I should do"
442,Mental breakdown,Just had mental breakdown and I got so stressed I took it all out on my fishnet gloves I use for cosplay. Now I've got a ruined glove and a ruined cosplay. I'm really mad now
443,Struggling with the thought that I may be a pathological liar,
444,I feel like my MH is at an all time low and it's all because of my boss,"She constantly criticizes me and rarely offers any solutions or praise. She is very hypercritical of even the tiniest mistakes. 

I was put on a PIP but it's really insulting to call it a ""plan"" because it was all just a list of my failures and no suggestions for overcoming them. 

I looked up signs you have a toxic boss and she hit all of the characteristics. 

When she chews me out I feel like I wish I had never been born. The pain I feel is so intense it makes all of the good stuff I've experienced up until now or will experience later is not worth it. 

I am actively job seatchingto get away from her but I'm worried about how much time it will take. I have to survive without getting fired or killing myself until I'm gone. 

Aside from making me feel passively suicidal, it's starting to affect other areas of my life. She got frustrated with me on Friday and I've been obsessing with it ever since. Obsessing about finding a new job, fantasizing about calling her a c**t on my last day, fantasizing about murdering her, etc. I've lashed out at my fiancée a lot this weekend and I can only assume that my bad mood is related. 

How do I keep my mental health intact until I find a new job?"
445,I don’t know what to do anymore,"
I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."
446,Point me on the right direction.. please.,"Hey Reddit. So mentally.. I don’t feel like something is right.. I get angry quickly. My energy levels are down..like my life is just zzz tiresome. And Due to a big part of my memory being so shit. Makes me hate myself. I’m always forgetting shit. Like this morning. I live an 1 hour and 15 minutes from my jobs at an airport. Half way into the drive I realized I forgot my badge and my job won’t let me in without it so I had to call off... again.. and this happens with everything! go to my car, forget my keys, grab my phone, forgot who to call.. everytime i tell people about it “or you’re just not WANTING to remember” or “you’re just being lazy, make notes” 

Like someone always has some logical reason when the reality hits those type of thoughts just simple don’t run across my mind to help me.. I honestly don’t think “hmm let me make a note of this” and it’s gotten to the point where now I feel like I am lazy.. 

On top of that i just have real bad image of myself.. I feel like I’m way too skinny. Can’t speak in one fluid motion.. I can’t come up with the right words.. or say “ umm” a fuck ton..  all of this has given me social anxiety. I hate going out and speaking to people.. now my life is just quiet to myself.. forget a lot and smoke weed to calm me down. I have no genuine friends.. I’m 25 and I come from the hood. People don’t really show affection.. so i don’t really know how to ask for help.. or where to go. I wish having a therapist was free cause I would’ve done that along time ago. All I know is I’m tired of feeling like I’m in a dark corner alone.."
447,Im Probably Losing My Job,"I got in trouble a year ago for sexual misconduct for hugging a coworker in a way I didnt know they were uncomfortable with, from behind. I thought of us as friends and back hugs are one of my favourites to give. I never considered it sexual, but I got in trouble for it. As my first ever write up, it was a final corrective action.

I find myself in the same situation a year later for touching a coworker's back while they were mopping backwards to let them know i was right behind them in a corridor. Once again, I considered us friends but also, I touch everyone when I'm close to them from behind because that is how I would prefer to be let known someone is there. Verbal is probably better, but after an 8 hr shift of talking to customers, my throat hurts and 80% of my conversation is non-verbal. I dont have the best use of words outside of text to be frank.

So I'm under investigation again and in the time of COVID, I immediately fell into despair. I took my meds, took a nap, cried. But I also applied to 3 or 4 jobs and already got an interview for monday. I was a former employee at this job and left because it was just a season temp job, so chances of me getting hired for the full time position is quite high.

I'm doing okay. I'm still sad and get panic when I think about all my plans through my job I made. How I had a 5 year plan for attending school and work. How I like my coworkers for the most part and how I planned to get benefits. Because I'm not even sure I'll have this job next month, I'm going to be without health insurence after october 1st. I'm in so much debt up to my eyeballs but cant fet credit to open a credit card account so everything I owe is literal cash. I panic because I had plans, and now mynplans will change against my will and I have to adapt and I'm not good at letting go.

But I'll be okay. This new job is full time. They also have schooling assistance and benefits and I make $3.50 more an hour. I know this will be fine.

I just wonder if I should quit now, or let the investigation go on and let them fire me. Idk. I feel if I quit, I may be able to get rehired later on. But that isnt a guarantee and if I stay I can get as much money from them as I can. But I'll be okay.

If this happened before my medication, I would have tried to kill myself. I would have blew money out of spite towards myself. I would have hurt myself in so many ways as if to atone for my mistake like that would mean anything to the corporate monkeys. No, instead I have an interview, I havent even so much as relapsed in my eating disorder, let alone self harm. I didnt get drunk or buy anything.

I'm doing okay. I'll be okay. It'll be okay. I really think it would be. I just feel a little extra lonely now."
448,"Experience of keeping a journal has been so cathartic that I feel that perhaps writing is something worth pursuing. It keeps me going, it keeps me motivated, and beats the hell out of repressing how I feel about things.",Journaling has been a great way for me to vent. Hope this can help you as well. [https://app.goodnightjournal.com/public-journal/6df1c08f-fcae-4063-9817-947f2d7918a3](https://app.goodnightjournal.com/public-journal/6df1c08f-fcae-4063-9817-947f2d7918a3)
449,I've been anxious lately,"I've been having this bad heaviness in my chest and this overwhelming sense of doom for the past few days. My heart rate is normal, but I feel like my heart is about to explode in my chest. Or that I have a massive rock on top of me, lying in bed at night.

My friend died of covid on Thursday. She was 32, a year young than me. Up until then I've been thinking that I'd be fine if I get it, just mild symptoms. Don't get me wrong, I've been keeping safe and wearing my mask since March but I wasn't too worried. 

But now I feel anxious and helpless. I have a real fear of going out in public. I've spoken to my partner to not to go and if he has to, to be very careful. Her death hit too close to home. She, like me, has been living abroad, hundreds of miles away from home. She didnt get to say goodbye to her mum and dad. She didn't know she had underlying health condition until she was admitted to hospital with covid. The number of positive cases in my area is on the rise again, some people don't wear their masks and don't socially distance.

Here's me now, thinking what if this happens to me? 

Am I being paranoid? Unreasonable? Or is this normal considering the situation?"
450,pls help,"i dont know whats wrong with me  


i swear to god i have a strong mindset and ik how every life is important and that i should love myself and i truly do sometimes (or at least try my best to)  


bruh i have everything i could ask for: family, a roof over my head, food and water, close friends and a girl that i fucking love   


AND I STILL FUCKING MANAGE TO FEEL WORTHLESS AND  EMPTY AND HATED AND UNCOMFORTABLE  
i feel so bad for the ppl around me (especially my gf) that need to deal with me and my shit  


im to the point that i just wanna blow my brains out and die alone in a field and free every person that has to come across me"
451,I have symptoms of Schizophrenia?,"So, I've been hallucinating for ages. But last night, it got really bad. I stared at my window for around an hour and kept seeing things, was heavily shaking, was hearing things, terrible paranoia, and felt as though I was being watched.

What should I do? I've told my Mom and we have no clue what to do.

[ Sorry if wrong sub, if it's the wrong sub please tell me. ]"
452,How do you deal with the fact that your life is pointless?,"I was trying to study for an important test when the realization suddenly hit me very hard. All the people around me are doing stuff, they are leading meaningful lives with goals and ambitions. And when I look at myself, I have to deal with the fact that there is nothing I'm passionate about, nothing I'm striving for. There's nothing in particular that I'm good at. Nothing of value to this world that I could contribute. I'm having a really hard time going through college. I don't really know if any of my friends actually like me. And I'm pretty sure that I'll be failing my test tomorrow. How am I supposed to live like this?"
453,Watching the rain helped calm my anxiety.,"I have a history with depression and anxiety, and lately they have been acting up more so than usual. So today I just spent 30 minutes watching heavy rain with my room windows wide open, and I havn't felt this light in a while. I know this sounds very cringeworthy but watching the rain hit the pavement and drip from the tree in front of my window, with the cold air against my face, just made me appreciate how beautiful the world can be around you sometimes. It made me realise that due to our daily struggles and battles we fight within ourselves, we sometimes miss the little moments around us. I know my worries will come back soon, and my anxiety will pull me down but for now, for a few moments just watching the rain helped me be still just in the moment, that's a win for today."
454,"""You're not alone"" but how would you know that?","Sorry just a little vent. A lot of people say this and I know they mean well but I can never believe it and sometimes I get so... angry? frustrated? whenever someone tells me this. I often drown in overwhelming loneliness and it's so unbearable.

My family is good relative to a lot of other families but all my beliefs and my identity clashes with all of theirs so they will not support or accept me if they find out. I also want to get checked up for mental health issues but I feel like my parents will just spout some religious bullshit or make me go to church more often if I ask to go to a doctor. So I'm just here not knowing what exactly I could be diagnosed with and not having anything treated. All I know is that it hurts so much and it hinders my life almost, if not always, daily.

I have friends (though I think it's more appropriate to call them acquaintances at this point) and only have 2 actual friends but they live on the other side of the world. In all of my relationships, I always feel like I'm not cared for as much as I cared about them. I give so much in the relationships but I'm barely given anything back. I know I shouldn't expect so much but it just hurts to have everything be so one-sided all the time.

I have no one as my support system and I have no one to turn to when I'm hurting and crying or even when I'm excited about certain things. My mental health really plummeted because of the quarantine so nowadays I'm often left alone drowning in my negative thoughts, most of which peak during the hours when I should be asleep like right now at 3am.

I just want someone who actually cares long-term but I guess that's too much to ask. So here's another night of feeling incredibly alone."
455,Something traumatic happened to me. I just need to talk. TW blood and gore,"I have been making posts and deleting them. I don't know how to say this without sounding like a bad person. And I can't make it short.

So an accident happened. I was injured and our dog almost died (he is all right. I am so happy about that). Only I got ""hit"". I might have some permanent damage. My other hand feels just weak and I can't trust it. I don't know if it will get better. 

The fragility of life just got me. But other stuff too. I am bipolar and have aspergers. I have a suicide attempt in my past. But this time others were really strongly involved. In the situation I worried more about the dog and my flatmates/siblings mental health and we just waited for our mother to arrive because I couldn't leave them alone. It took an hour (because she took a bus and didn't drive because she thought it wasn't that bad)  and I was just bleeding in the sink. A lot. Trying to calm down my sibling who was just a crying mess. I just took some sugar pills because I looked so pale. They were panicking so bad I couldn't leave them alone. My injuries were just disgusting and dirty too. Stuff other than blood was coming out too. It was worrisome. I wasn't dying (I was bleeding a lot but not enough to kill me) but I needed treatment and my fatty tissue just needed to be put back in there where I can't see it. It was a perfect breeding ground for a serious infection. And I was bleeding a lot.

I am just so tired. Why must I always be the one who just copes alone and it's expected of me? The efford is actually pretty great, you know. And they still act like I am selfish. I must always be the voice of reason and supportive when everyone else just panics. Even later on. And if my family is there I get told I was ""panicking"" the most and others saved me when that was not the case. I don't blame anyone for how they acted in that situation. People can't control that. Not everyone is calm and rational when stuff like that happens. It was a horrible. But later on. Did everyones' memories just turn into something else or do I remember it wrong? I didn't cry or panic. Yeah, I wasn't able to go and buy my sibling some ice cream because I eas bleeding that much. I only cared about my siblings and the dogs' wellbeing.

All I got now is just "" You will be fine"" when I might actually have more serious injuries. And why must I endure insults by my mother in those situations? ""She just doesn't think"" But she always does it and I can't say anything back without sounding like a horrible person. My sibling just needed someone. I can cope alone but they can't. 

I have been alone at home for over a week. (I took a taxi to ER. Took caution to not bleed on the seats). I have been drinking although I managed to be sober for almost 2 months. My hand was completely unusable for 1,5 weeks. And it was pretty painful. Eggs were pretty hard to peel... I can't trust my hand even know, It's just weak and fingers don't work that well. The feeling is gone in some areas but it's nothing I can't deal with. People do manage with no arms at all so I shouldn't complain. Living alone with one hand isn't impossible.

I am just tired. Why must I just endure everything that happens and also everything they trough at me? Even when I was bleeding and stuff was spilling out I am the one who just has to be decent when everyone else has a reason to not be? Because I am always the one who is not hurt the most. I can handle it when it happens but why do they tell me I did poorly? It's all my fault in their eyes I guess.

This is eating me up. I wouldn't care but it's like this every time. Maybe I have had enough."
456,I feel so alone and changed,"So I(M19) have been in quarantine since March. During all these last months I didn't really went out much with the exception of groceries and stuff for my parents and myself. The first few months felt really weird being away from college and dorm and being inside my old room once again for the entire day. My house is very small and there's not a lot of places that I can go to during the pandemic so I've been living inside my bedroom for all day for the last few months, reading books and watching movies. I am kind of a shy person so I didn't really make deep friendships with many people while I was at college and as a result I don't talk to anyone now. My parents stay busy with their work for the most of the day and spend time with each other for the rest of the day which I don't want to interrupt. I just numbed into the habit of not talking to people anymore and as a result I can't really hold conversations with anyone anymore. I feel suffocated and terribly alone in my small room all day. I told my parents that my mental health isn't at it's greatest and they replied that many people have lost their jobs and their homes due to the pandemic and that I should be thankful about having a roof over my head in this situation and that I am a grown up man now and I shouldn't be acting weak or feeling bad for no reason. I kind of get what they are saying, and I truly am grateful that I still have a house to live in but this just feels suffocating. I am scared. It's like I am losing a part of my individuality because I don't talk to absolutely anyone anymore. I have not friends to check up on me and I don't have the balls I guess, to call them up and start talking. Umm, I guess I just want a friend to spend some time with, idk. I don't feel normal to what I've become adjusted to. Thanks for reading so far, if you did."
457,I no longer feel like my feelings are valid,"I'm suffering from an eating disorder and body dysmorphia along with general anxiety and feeling very low. I used to feel alot worse, until I was put on lots of medicine, I am on anti psychotics and the max dose of fluoxetine for someone my age. I feel emotionally numb, but at the same time I can feel all the thoughts going on in my head, it's like they're there but I just don't react to them anymore. I have cried once about the death of my grandma in the past 4½ months and i feel like a zombie, I just don't act the same way I used to. I used to be able to feel happy and have a good laugh, but at the same time I would feel intensely isolated and alone, unable to reach out to anyone and everything seemed grey and lifeless to me. The thoughts regarding my body and weight used to be alot more intense, I used to be severely underweight before my medication and the thoughts of how I looked would completely incapacitate me, I wouldn't leave the house or meet my friends for days on end. Now that I can manage most days with my thoughts I feel like they are no longer valid. I am feeling very suicidal right now, I don't know how to approach someone because I feel like they all assume that I am fine. This post is a shit wreck I am shaking and I can't type properly I'm sorry. I feel so alone and nothing matters anymore, I don't look forward to anything because i will never enjoy it because I'm fat and ugly and there's nothing I can do to change how I look, so what's the point? It's not fair for me to suffer when people want me to stay. I don't even believe I suffer from mental illnesses, I just think that I can clearly admit to things people don't want to tell me that they are true. I want to look forward to my birthday and seeing my friends but thinking about it now I don't because I'm ugly and don't deserve friends. I'm sorry I don't really know how to say this all I just need to vent and I feel like there's nobody else I can talk to."
458,My girlfriend lashes out at me sometimes and I don't really know what to do or feel,[removed]
459,I feel like my life is breaking apart and I’m struggling to hold to pieces together,"I’ve dealt with depression for the last eight or so years. Most days I’m able to handle it but the last couple weeks have been rough. I’ve lost motivation to do things that I normally enough. I haven’t wanted to hang out with friends, I’ve been eating less, and I’ve stopped going to the gym. I hate it and it just makes me feel worse but at the same time I can’t bring myself to do anything about it. 

I feel like my life is breaking apart and I’m struggling to hold the pieces together. It’s like the pieces are cutting my hands and making me bleed. I’m too afraid to ask for help because I feel like those pieces are going to cut them too. I’m terrified that I’ll get use to and become dependent on others to keep me together and one day those extra hands will leave me to deal with my broken brain and i won’t be able to keep the pieces together any longer."

The stress, the lonelyness and the dysphoria made me freak out last night and even dissasociate... After a panick attack, I decided to drink and when I was drunk, I deleted all my social media and texted my best friend saying that I was going to kill my self..
I fucked up real hard this time... If I find my dads gun I think I will end this once and for all...

462,How can I help my friend with an eating disorder?,"My friend has a body-mass-index of 15,4. He told me he knows he's not fat, the problem is that he's addicted to the feeling of starving. I feel so helpless, I don't know what to do to help him. We've had an extremely good relationship, I've been making him happy, but I don't think that's enough. He is in therapy but it doesn't help him that much. What can I do?"
463,Developmental Delay,"So idk when but apparently my doctor diagnosed me with developmental delay. I have no idea what that really means, Im 18 and recently just seen it on the papers they give after an appointment. Ik Im a lil different than most other kids my age (mainly drug addiction) and don't got a lot of friends (although Im cool with just about everyone I meet), but like I don't understand why my doctor diagnosed me with that. Not even sure it's a mental health thing or not, but didn't know where to post this. What does it mean if I got diagnosed with it so late?"

466,Please help me.,"I think I'm going into major depression that I've been ignoring for a long time without realising it. I don't feel good about things I usually enjoyed. 

I don't get good sleep (usually experiencing certain nightmares about things a normal person won't even care about. Like I feel bad about saying things that may or may not have affected others but have started to part away from me. My gaming friends that I don't even know personally have started parting ways from me and gaming was something I truly loved and enjoyed spending my time. I thought losing contact and deleting them is the best way I can find peace and not be treated like shit.) 

I don't eat well (basically loss of appetite). I've stopped enjoying food. My professional life has taken a toss for over a year and half now. I'm not finding a job that I would truly enjoy and been rejected over and over again for certain gap in my work experience. I have I've come to a point that I have started questioning my existence. I don't know what to do. 

I can't concentrate or remember sometimes, when my brain is a memory tank. I could remember any good or bad conversations I've had with any person if I want to. With that sometimes I feel it's a curse because I can't let things go and the stupid memory keeps haunting me. 

I'm a very simple man. I come from India and such a thing is usually laughed at and taken as a joke. I hope I can find some answers and suggestions that can help me lift up. Thank you."
467,Why did I have childhood trauma flashbacks after my Marijuana induced psychosis?,"I am no longer psychotic, but during my recovery process, and even now, issues that I thought that I resolved started reemerging in dreams and nightmares. Didn't get a chance to ask the doc because it didn't occur to me to ask. Do know you?"
468,I noticed very weird patterns in my behavior.,"So today i wanted to do something but a little problem completely made me reconsider and i was just like ""fuck this shit anyways"" for short i change my mind very frequently if there is an obstacle in the task, and the second, giggling/smiling in completely out of place situations, sometimes i think what just happened is randomly is funny and i smile uncontrollably, like not even in serious situations only, completely out of place and random situations, even little things not considered funny might make me want to laugh uncontrollably, i don't laugh hysterically luckily i don't laugh i control it enough to just make me only smile, anyone know what's wrong with me?"
469,I feel like I’m going through something. How do I figure out?,"If it helps for reference, I noted down Minutes-of-Meeting of a conversation with myself about my life. I want to know if something is wrong with me for real?"
470,Opinions?,"There’s multiple things that I’m unhappy with/concerned.
My anxiety. Dear god it’s terrible. I hate the idea of going to loud places with lots of people, confronting anyone about pretty much anything except for like 2-3 people. Which makes asking teachers about stuff a nightmare. I haven’t been diagnosed for anything, and before covid hit the US as hard as it did, there was talk with my mom about seeing a therapist. That was when she had a steady income for herself, and not relying on my dads job. Of course now I think it would help, but with her not having a good income I don’t want to add yet another thing for her to worry about. (And causing me to worry)
The random bouts of sadness and hopelessness that come with either something not going how I imagined (like a craft project- stupid I know) or how attached I’ve become to my phone. Or just not having motivation to do anything. That includes the sport that I do, or practicing the instruments that I play.
I’ve tried talking with my friend, but since he moved we now almost never see each other. And he has a f*cked up sleep schedule and doesn’t check his messages that often so I can’t just talk with him. 
Idk if I have an anxiety disorder, or depression or a blend. I want to see a therapist but I get nervous asking my mom for stuff. And now she probably won’t let me bc of COVID not that that’s a bad thing- I understand staying apart as much as possible is a must."
471,"Fear that friends I bonded with over mental health struggles will ditch me after recovery, and wanting to criticise myself for being slow and weak","This is basically an intrusive thought. When I was younger in school, some of my friends looked up to me as some sort of mentor for...reasons I don't understand. It placed a lot of pressure on me though. I would give them self-help, confidence tips, etc. Those friends grew in confidence and social skills, dated a bit; I had a nervous breakdown largely as a product of my parents' divorce and my Dyspraxia catching up to me. I've been stuck at home (currently my own apartment but in the same flat block as my mum) unemployed with helicopter parents and a bunch of mental health issues, they've moved on with their lives. I've been single for 6 years and with a flattened libido from antidepressants for much of it. They aren't bad people for leaving, which my illnesses say makes it my fault for failing to recover at the same rate or keep up with them. 

Lately the same fear has come up with new friends. When I meet, sometimes they're not doing great. We both have the mutual hardship in common. I do try and consciously make the relationship somewhat positive, not just 'misery loves company', but of course sometimes this is difficult as we're both handling a lot of stress. It's not even that we're not both in therapy or trying, because God knows I TRY to get bettter; they just seem to be more successful at either feeling better, or society validating that they are accepted now. Over time (I feel like) they grow more distant and it reaches the point where they're healthy enough to no longer need me. This happens with everyone but most commonly with female friends I made through social media etc. I'm left wondering what I have to offer and why I'm lacking the strength, the discipline, to be able to keep up with them. It's very much a feeling of me chasing people who like in a dream are always able to move quicker than me and eventually leave me behind alone."

473,What are some things you do to help keep your mental health in check?,
474,Telling people is the worst bit,"How am I meant to tell my mum, who loves more than anything, that I don’t want to be here anymore. My family are so supportive, my friends are really loving and caring and I know would answer my calls if I ever need help. I have a lovely partner who I now live with and is very caring towards me and my mental health. But I just don’t want any of it anymore. Everyday feels worse and worse, like a sinking feeling almost. I can’t see a time where it gets better and my favourite time of day is going to bed because that means my day is over. 

I know that telling your loved ones that you feel very down and need help is the first step but I need more than listening. And I don’t know where to start."
475,Why does it feel so tough?,"It all feels really tough, life... Even tho I know its not really that tough it just feels overwhelming. I have no idea why and what to do with it. I'm tired of going to sleep with so much on my mind."
476,my funny life up to now,"tw: emotional/physical/verbal/child abuse (its the whole cocktail), neglect, self harm and a whole lot of mental issues because life decided why the fuck not 

as the title suggests, my life for the past 20 years has been funny to live through. i dont know how to explain it other than funny. you guys probably know that feeling when someone asks if you're okay but all you can do is laugh because have i ever been okay? 

im the eldest child of many siblings, i've had severe anxiety as a child and instead of getting the help i needed, my family humiliated me to the point that i repressed any kind of emotion that would lead to me showing any type of fear. i had to raise my siblings from a very young age, i heard stuff coming from my parents that no child should've ever heard, threats and insults towards me that i only recently remembered because young me decided to write it down. and the problem is that my parents seem to enjoy the fact that i dont express myself that much, calling me their ""golden"" child and all that. 

to recall an incident, back in 2015, my mental health was an all time low (to the point of self-harm) and i found myself a support system through my friends and for a while it was good. however, a person that i considered a really close friend decided to tell one of my siblings and out of fear, the sibling told our mother. all i can say is that due to how much i was beaten up, i barely remember what happened that day. (yes you read that right, i got beaten up for being depressed and a few cuts on my wrists)

i went for therapy about a year ago and while it helped, i can no longer bring myself to trust my community and the society that i live in when it comes to mental health. and its depressing because i know that i need help but im too scared. its very hard to open up and living in a country where your mental health can get you locked up in jail, brain decided its better off being quiet. (for my safety, i will not specify where im from but ironically, its a very known country, just a horrible mentality that operates within society)

people say its gonna get better but fail to mention how hard it is to get there. my parents have gotten better but the pandemic is creating unwanted tension so no difference tbh. but nonetheless, even though i can never run away from home and live my life, ive found fun friends once again, i found hobbies, i found interests, i've listened to songs that remind me of those sad times and cried my eyes out but now i can listen to some of them and remember that once upon a time, i wasn't the happiest child back then and it didn't solve any of my problems but it helped soothe the pain and gave me a sense of happiness temporarily. 

it gets better, even if its not what you wanted, even if its not how you wanted it to be, it gets better. to every human reading this, it wasn't your fault and it was never your fault. what happened to you, you never deserved it, not even one bit. you deserve to be born, you deserve a chance to live your life, you deserve to be happy. don't ever allow anyone to tell or convince you that you don't deserve to be alive.

477,How do I get my mom to understand my anxiety?,"I'm 13 and live with my mom. The thing is I have really bad anxiety. I'll cry over pretty much everything, but I can't help it. My mom doesn't understand why I cry, though. She'll get really mad at me and yell at me to be quiet and to calm down. Which I cannot do. 

I walk on my toes a lot, and my mom realized that my feet were constantly slanted from me walking on the ends. She said that if I didn't stop she'll take me to go get surgery. I started crying. She told me to stop crying so I could listen to her. I told her that she was making me nervous, but she kept talking. I was pretty much begging her to be quiet. 

Another example is whenever I need to go to the dentist I'll have a nervous breakdown and start crying for 5 minutes straight. I was in the chair waiting to get my teeth cleaned, then I made the mistake of looking at all of the tools. It made me cry. I didn't stop until somebody came and calmed me down. When we left, my mom looked really mad at me. 

I'm scared to tell her about this because I'm scared she'll tell me that I should just be quiet. Or she'll completely overreact. She knows I have anxiety, she just doesn't know what I go through because of it. Can somebody please help me?"
478,I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind every day.,"I'm a guy almost in his mid 20s and i have never enjoyed life. Every year it gets worse. I feel like like there is no point to live other than to keep my parents happy. I want to die when they pass away. I have no passions. Nothing ever excites me. Sometimes I have a random burst of productivity where I feel like I have a lot of energy and I do get stuff done. But that only last for a few hours up to a week at most. Then it's back to having so little energy that I barely talk. Also during that period just hearing people's voices is enough to make me irritated and annoyed. Other times i have violent thoughts against my self or stuff that I would never act on, but it would put me on some kind of list if i said it. 

I get urges to bang my head against stuff and I do typically end up drinking alcohol and/or eating too much junk which has a negative effect on me. Beer is one of the few times my brain slows down but sometimes after drinking i just get even more angry. I think about dying and wishing I had the courage to kill myself all the time. 

I'm a loser. I'm 24 years old, poor, and still live with my parents. I've been trying to find a decent job that lets me move out for ever a year now. I have not found a decent job but have been doing shit jobs and now thanks to covid I don't have one at all. But seeing everything going to more shit gives me very little hope that things will ever get better. 

I do not enjoy being around others most of the time and i have accepted this life of solitude because I feel like I deserve it. I do not think high of myself, but people like me should suffer because I think i deserve it in a way because i am not good enough to thrive in the world"
479,Lack of Purpose,"Hi, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well.

This is my first post here and wanted to get some advice on what I'm about to share. Lately, I've been struggling with a lack of motivation and been procrastinating a lot on some things I want to do. For instance, when the summer vacation started I was practicing piano every day but fell off following my relapse after two months of being sober. I am back on track (two months sober again), but I have a lack of purpose and feel like there is nothing to look forward to. I wake up in the morning, make my bed, take my meds, take a shower, brush my teeth, etc. so I have no problem in terms of taking care of myself. I eat and sleep well. However, I lack any real interest in anything. I like music and been wanting to practice piano and singing again on a daily basis but have been avoiding it for some reason, maybe due to my perfectionist tendencies and fear of failure. Impatience is a big problem for me and turns everything into a disaster. When I was dating, I rushed things because I wanted to jump right into cuddling (not sex) and the lovey-dovey things. I want to master things in no time when I know it's not possible and I acknowledge everything is a learning process, but I can't seem to enjoy the steps leading to the end goal. I just want it now, indicating problems with instant gratification (I'm majoring in Psychology). I feel like I have such a boring life now that I can't really party (because I'm trying to stay sober). I am trying to stay single to ""work on myself"" because I know I won't find something serious on dating websites. Everything is just 'meh' and this life is just a broken record."
480,"Should I stop talking to my family, as soon as I move out?","Hey... I (15) have been thinking a lot about moving out etc., even if it are still two years until I finished school, and the thought of breaking contact with my family crossed my mind, but I don't know if this would be to extreme. 

I have always had a difficult relationship with my family. I am the only gifted person in the family and I never had a real relationship with any of them. My mum used to yell at me as a kid and she said some pretty bad stuff, f.ex. that she wished to never see me again and that she wished she didn't have a gifted kid. She also yelled at me if I didn't understand something immediately and I still can't ask for help without fearing to be mocked and yelled at. 

There have been more conflicts with her lately as I started seeing the school counseler because I am scared/extremely uncomfortable if someone touches me or I would be convinced that people are going to hurt me if I let them near me. It got to the point where I coudn't stand in qeues, go to town or hug people. I would start crying and felling as if I wouldn't get air if it was to much for me. I just couldn't deal with it anymore (there have been incidents where I broke down crying because someone approached me to fast etc.). My mom mocked me and fought with me because of it and forbid me to go to the school counselor or a real therapist. I have also got other mental heath issues (suicidal thoughts, problems to sleep, extreme stage fright...) so maybe seeing a therapist would have been a good idea. My mom has a very bad opinion on people with mental health problems in general, she thinks they are just doing it for attention or should just get over themselves. She also won't let me go see a doktor because I have got a constant migraine/headache.

For the rest of my family: My siblings only mock me if I have got problems and don't even try to understand me. My sister once annoyed me until I got a panic attack. My dad is nice, but he also rather mocks me if I tell him about something or says things like ""Just get over it"" than trying to understand.

So..yeah... do you think I am overreacting with wanting to break the contact with my family? I think that it is kind of childish and that I should forgive them, but they (esp. my mom) just hurt me to much to forgive them just now."

I’m getting angry and sad at very sudden moments and slight anxiety. I feel like small things make me tick and i don’t want to slip into depression. 
I don’t feel like myself lately. I’m not sure what I should do, since im doing what I should be? 
I workout, I go to therapy, I take my meds. 

I feel like I want to get away. I don’t feel ok."
483,I had a really bad night last night,"I had a really bad night last night.

I have schizoaffective disorder and I stopped some of my medication about a month ago. For a while things were fine. I was having some mild mood swings and a little bit of paranoia but no big deal to me. I had voices a few nights but they were mild and didnt bother me much.

Last night was bad. As I lay down in bed I thought I heard my moms voice talking to me. It sounded scary and threatening and like it was coming from the hallway. And then I heard voices coming out of my phone, really loud, telling me silly things like “remember you have a doctors appointment on the 14th” (which I dont). The room started to shake and spin and all the voices were chanting over each other and I was just begging it to stop.

Im afraid its going to happen again tonight. Usually I get these bad nights in spurts. Ill get 2 nights bad, and then Ill get a night free, then Ill get 3 bad nights and so on and so on. But sometimes I can go weeks without it happening. But once it starts... it tends to continue for a while.

I just wish it wasnt my moms voice that I hear. That makes it so much worse, makes me feel so much more vulnerable. 

My brain hates me and Im sad"
484,I don't know what's wrong with me," My family makes fun of me for being on my phone all the time or constantly spacing out. They where all saying I was lashing out at people and I'm not in touch with reality because Im always on my phone or listening to music ect. I started to believe them but didn't do anything about it because I didn't care. It's gotten to the point where i start getting super hyper or super depressed when I'm not on my phone. But now I just feel numb. I hate being awake. I hate reality. It's not that I'm using my phone as a way to hide from serious things that are happening right now, because I'm not. If anything I'm doing the opposite. I'm informing myself on a lot of important subjects and things. But I'm more trying to hide from the fact that I have a body and feeling and I'm a living person. I feel like I'm watching my body move through a screen. It feels like I'm in third person. When I look in the mirror I don't see me, but I still recognize myself and it freaks me out. I looked up all the symptoms and the first thing that popped up was derealization disorder but I don't think I have that because I've never had any serious trauma or anything like that. It could just be depression and I could just be over analyzing all of this but it feels weird and idk what to do anymore. Recently I have been ticking and impulsively doing random stuff but I don't think that has anything to do with this. I don't want to tell my mom about any of this because i know she's not going to believe me because I am pretty young and already have been diagnosed with depression and ""that's too many problems for you to have""."

489,My brother abuses me,"  I’ll give you the story of what just happened. I’m sitting out on my porch petting my dog that’s on my lap. He comes out and asks to hold the dog. I said no as I was on the phone with my mom who wanted to see my dog through the camera. He then elbows me in the arm hard. Hard enough that I was genuinely in pain. So I give him a little, tap on the forehead. He then gets up and starts chasing me so in response, I went in and shut the door, as he does this all the time and I knew he would beat me. So he then starts punching the glass in the middle of the door, cracking it. So I got scared and just ran into the bathroom and locked that door. He then comes in and breaks the door off of its hinges and off of the wall and starts viciously attacking me. He then yells at me saying that I broke the door. I try explaining to my parent that I didn’t and he just keeps yelling. This is an everyday occurrence. I can’t take it anymore. I want to end my life."

Before we got him my old pet died, and the new pet was keeping me together and happy and even gave me some of the happiest months of my life. Now that he is gone I just don’t wanna even be here anymore. Can anyone help"
492,Anyone experienced/going through this??,"Hey,  
I'm 26 yrs old (F) and I have depression + anxiety and I've been receiving treatment. Right now I'm only on medication, but I do see a psychologist when I can. The problem is, I feel like the medication that is prescribed for me makes me way too sleepy and drowsy to function. I have a really hard time waking up no matter when I go to sleep, sometimes I sleep for half a day or even more and still wake up tired all the time. Sometimes I just don't move at all that's how low on energy I am, I physically feel week and just can't.  
As to why I think it's the medication, well, not long ago I had to switch and while I was coming off the previous one I felt more energetic and all-around better, not a 100% sure on it, but still think it's a big factor.   
Right now I'm taking Asentra (which is basically Zoloft for the Americans), supposedly 50 mg but I halved the dosage after talking to my psychiatrist, I told her that it makes me sleepy. I had to take it in the morning before and now it has been moved to the evening. I am overweight btw and might have an eating disorder too. It's only been about a year that this has been going on and it's driving me crazy.edit: I did talk about this w my family physician and got blood tests done at least twice, they found nothing. My physician did say that I'm very slightly anaemic but said not to worry about that.

Is there anyone here who was/is in this situation? Did you find something that helped?   
Does it ever get better or should I just ask my psychiatrist if I could stop taking medication?"
493,"After doctors saying I'm perfectly healthy for years, I started thinking the fog was just a byproduct of age. Then, last week I had a day of clarity and felt totally like myself. Now I'm back to the fog and I just want to cry.","So, for nearly a decade now, I have been feeling just scrambled in my head, like I'm in a fog and can't find my way out.  I'm easily irritated and make mistakes.  Every doctor I've seen has told me I'm perfectly healthy. All my tests come out fine. Even had an MRI in July 2018 and it came out clear, with just an incidental note about a partially empty sella.

I gave up after having the MRI and just thought, ""Okay, I guess this is just how it is. This is what normal is.""

Well, hold the phone, because last Wednesday, I had a profound clarity. I jumped out of bed with energy, I was emotionally stable, I wanted to talk to people, I felt open and like myself for the first time in a very long time. It was like raising the blinds on a dark room and seeing the light shine on everything that was hidden away in the darkness. It felt so damn good.  All of this, despite the stress of it being the first day of school, even! (I'm a fifth grade teacher). I went to bed so happy that night, wondering what might have caused the change.  Perhaps it was that I've started eating salads more or that I started intermittent fasting a few months ago and losing 30 lbs that way has caused a switch to flip.  Whatever it was, I was so happy to have myself back again.

And then Thursday morning came.  Back in the fog. Back to having to work to focus on the task at hand. Back to the irritation and feeling constantly distracted... and I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream.  It made Wednesday feel like such a tease.  I had a glimpse into what I'm supposed to feel like and it was taken away from me just as fast.

494,Can this be caused by drug use?,"TW: cancer, illness, drug use

As a backstory, my little sister had cancer (medulloblastoma) when she was 3 years old back in 2014. I was fourteen at the time, already had problems with bullying at school and self harm and was seeing a therapist but I wasn't prescribed anything.
My parents had to move with her to Sao Paulo so she could have her treatment and so she did, thing is I don't recall most stuff about this year after I started seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds (Alprazolam, Flunitrazepam and antidepressants).

When I was 15, the beginning of the year, I began drinking and smoking cigs, weed, most stuff teens do. When I was 17 I experimented with coke and acid, never liked uppers. And when I was 18 I started taking morphine pills, snorting H and the rock bottom was IVing H. But inbetween those experiences, which I knew were bad, I took 500ug of acid and expected something out of it (ego death or idk), I just had a good trip and nothing else even though my grandma caught me in the peak but didn't turn out bad. Took shrooms, nothing again.
Last time was one year ago.

Now as of last week I started having vivid dreams about this period of my life, where my sister was sick, bald and fighting cancer and I'm afraid that I'm having some kind of flashback of those events (even though I don't remember or recall most of them, it seems like my brain suppressed those memories for good) and that my addiction or addictive personality have something to do with it. I'm 4 months sober as of right now.

If helps, I'm on Alprazolam, Flunitrazepam, Lithium, Vyvanse, Topamax and Brintellix."

However, the past few times I have had stages of panicking and I have really needed someone and gone to him. he has gotten annoyed at me and sent a message saying it's annoying and he is going to bed and then he will be active on social media and just ignore me completely which actually in turn makes me feel more anxious because I have annoyed the person I didn't want to annoy but it also makes me feel really alone and as if I honestly have nobody to distract me from how I am feeling. Maybe I am over reacting I don't know. I am never talking to him when I feel anxious ever again, but in a way I feel hurt and betrayed by the person I thought was always meant to be there for me, especially when he said he would be. But he makes me feel like I can't talk to him about things like that and the way he ignores me just really hurts me."
500,I had a very disturbing dream and I just want to talk about it,"TW: domestic abuse, nonconsensual sex

I (23F) woke up today from a dream where I had been held basically hostage for a week or so. I’ve never been in this kind of situation in real life, although I’ve read and empathized with many stories on Reddit. I just can’t believe my imagination pieced together such a horrifically vivid situation. 

I was in a school program and lived with a roommate. I had an acquaintance who struck me as an odd person, but I’m generally always friendly to oddballs so it didn’t bother me too much. One day after out work was over, she forcefully took me to her room. Within sight of many people, she yanked me by the hand down hallways, and being as averse to confrontation as I am, I was mostly just letting it happen or acting like it was normal and we were friends. 

I’ve been questioning my sexuality recently in real life which must have translated into the dream, because most people just accepted that I was moving in with her when she kept me in her room. I couldn’t go around the common area where her roommates were without her there. She also wouldn’t let me go to the school program and would leave me trapped in her room. At one point she showed me polaroid photos of myself from the night that she had brought me there, and I realized I didn’t have any memories between walking down the halls and coming to in her bed. It was like I had blacked out everything and been on autopilot. I didn’t know if it had been a day or five days. 

I acted like everything was fine and even had sex with her and kept up appearances by acting happy, but at the first chance I had to talk to her roommates alone I asked very seriously for them to get me out of there. They got in the car and waited for me, but in that awful way that dreams do, I nearly managed to leave but my captor showed up and took me by the hand and led me back to the house. She put my finger in a contraption built into the back of a pocketknife that had serrated teeth and dug small punctures into my hand while walking like normal. 

And then the roommates gave up and parked the car. I knew it was partially my fault because I had grabbed too many things and taken too long. When they came back in, I tried to push them out and tell them to get someone to come here. Then I realized I would rather run away with nothing than be stuck with her again. I luckily woke up from this dream as the second escape attempt was starting to go poorly. 

It was truly horrifying. The feeling of being trapped, that I had put on a lie for the world and I had to keep up appearances, the realization that I couldn’t just grab my stuff and go back to my old life, the fear that people who had said they would help me were going to give up, and on top of that realizing that if I had gone with her willingly a second time, I might have lost my will to escape. 

I don’t believe this is necessarily accurate to domestic abuse experiences, just to my limited knowledge from people’s stories and whatever hidden assumptions I have. It still feels chilling to the bone, and throughout the day I’ve have a hard time feeling anything but panic and the need to freeze when it comes to mind."

I’ve had trouble trying to find out what feelings are, and thats the only thing i can come up with. I don’t like having feelings, especially when i just came out of a really mentally abusive relationships. I have trouble trusting anyone, even my own brother. And the thought of just being with someone in that, way again scares the fuck out of me. I have a friend, she is amazing, she saved my life a day before i was going to take it, she inspires me everyday, and she cares for me in a way no one else does. We are in a fwb relationship and its going well so far, we both really enjoy each others company and we sort of trust each other. But i think i have feelings for her, and its only been like a week.

She says she thinks she bought it a different time (3 days ago) but I’m really worried she is just misremembering or telling me what I want to here. The internet says you should eat deli meat 3-5 days after getting it but one website said if it’s deli meat it should be no more then three days after you get it or you’ll get food poisoning. However, most sites say eat it within five days. I’m really worried I’ll get food poisoning and will v*.

506,weird brain dualism I wanted to share with yall,"It's my first time writing about this on a forum or frankly anywhere. Basically, what I discovered a few years ago is that I have a weird brain dualism what I call the normal brain state and a rare brain state (the II state). The characteristics of the rare brain state are: it happens at a maybe 1/8 ratio as opposed to the normal state, i can recall words much quicker, im more creative, brain fog dissappears, iq pretty much is the same or the difference is not huge, the thinking is visual, i can make wording choices on the fly, much more funny thoughts etc.. My psych doctor suggested it could be mania in a bipolar disorder, but my contention is im not irrational during that state, it feels like kick starting my brain and callibrating to the right position.  One notable fact is that once I enter the ""II state"" i will stay in it no matter what till I got to sleep, then it resets and when I wake up I will be back in the normal state."

Currently i’m going through mania. Its so exhausting having to move muscles to talk, walk, eat, or even type. I’ve sat in bed all day and the only joy I’ve experienced today was from playing my game. I’ve laid in bed all day and watched anime. I’m so annoyed and exhausted and lonely. living my life is a bummer. I’m 90% sure I have the following: anxiety, autism (Aspergers), bipolar disorder (or a form of it), and narcissism. 

Covid has made everything worse. My anxiety skyrocketed due to seeing people in masks 24/7. The world is disastrous and I just wish I could stop breathing sometimes. I wish I could just sleep through the rest of 2020 and wake up on New years.

514,is that normal?,"I know this might not be related to most of the subreddit's content but I wanted to ask abt smth
Is it normal for a mother to always mention how she'd have hated her daughter if she was with her in highschool? like always repeating statements like ""you're turning into girls I used to hate when I was at your age"" or whenever I'm doing anything she dislikes she'd go ""I'd literally be disgusted by people like you in high school I'd always mocked them too"".
It's smth that happened once or twice she almost throws statements like that daily for no reason. It's not like I even do anything out of the ordinary and it's just confusing to me"
515,Parent who thinks suicidal thoughts are my choice.,"I have multiple issues with my mental health, mainly OCD, BPD. Im in my late 20s and my life completely fell apart. I moved back in with my parents. My mom treats me and my dad like shit. After moving back in I realized she is the reason him and I never got along growing up. She has her own issues she refuses to deal with. I have no one else in my life, I don’t talk to my siblings nor do I have any friends. My mom knows everything that is going on with my health and mental health, financial situation and Life. If she is in a bad mood the smallest thing like just talking to her gets scary and everything goes down hill fast, she takes extremely low blows with insults that push me to the edge. I have issues with suicidal thoughts and she knowingly says things to really kick me when I’m down. When I try and talk about how I feel she just talks about how much harder her life was and to “just change my thoughts” and if I talk about suicide she makes comments like “Im so sick of hearing you say that.” “You sounds like a broken record.” While rolling her eyes. It feels like she is egging me on sometimes. She always tells me to get the fuck out of HER house and then tries to convince my dad to kick me out. If I left there house I’d be homeless and that doesn’t seem to bother her.  It’s a really complicated situation. I guess my question is, do other people deal with a parent that just doesn’t give a shit about you? In her words I failed as an adult, I don’t know what she compares my life too as all of my step siblings have issues that aren’t too far off mine. It hurts my heart to think me and my dad would have a totally different life if she wasn’t around, he’s literally the only reason I have to live."
516,Depression?,Honestly up to this point idk if I’m depressed. 💩 idk what’s going inside my head. I’m not gonna do anything crazy or practice self harm or anything or to anyone. I’ve been off my meds for my depression/anxiety/insomnia for half a year. Have or had idk anymore Psychological issues from my past. But I’m in control well that’s what I keep thinking to myself. I’m at the point that I’m just thinking too much and it’s just driving me crazy. Idk what to since this quarantine pretty much has me cut contact from everybody. Also can’t keep a job since I just be getting laid off from them well twice this year from the virus. So pretty much nothing to do. I’m just in the crossroads and it driving me nuts.
517,My girlfriend sometimes has bad panic attacks and I need advice on how to react and help properly.,"Let me preface this by saying I\`m not totally sure that it is panic attacks. I'm hope this is the right place to ask for advice, if not i would appreciate a pointer where to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

The attacks don't come often, I was present at two since March, when we started dating, but they seem quite severe. She will cower in a corner of her bed, cry and hyperventilate heavily, but most unsettingly, she is completely unresponsive. It's like she is in a trance, or a very bad daydream. I tried to hug her and get her to normalize her breathing, but failed to calm her down noticably - I'm not even sure she is aware I'm talking to her in those moments. I would guess they last from 3 to 5 minutes, until she comes down, but she is still very shaken after. They will repeat 3 or 4 times over an hour or so till its finally over.

&amp;#x200B;

She seems to suffer alot when this happens and I would love to somehow help her out. She doesn't like to talk about it and somehow is very scared that I will like her less, because of it. She is not fond of therapy, but I'm trying to slowly open her up to the idea, that talking to someone could help her. I know she was prone to self harm years before we met and I'm scared she could fall back during those attacks, when I'm not with her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd greatly appreciate any kind of advice, which terms to google, links to sources to read up on, especially how to deal with the situation, when it happens, maybe reduce her suffering at least..."
518,A little part of my life is a bit blank,"I am 15, struggling with some classic teenage issues like social anxiety, suicidal thoughts, low self confidence, but it's really not the problem here.

Might be helpful so just wanna say I never took any drugs, I don't drink, and I don't have any medical help for my issues

As said in the title, a little part of my life is sort of confused in my memory. Especially for one school year. From around June 2017 (year of my 13th birthday) to around September 2018. I have a pretty bad memory, but when it comes to my own life, my memory is pretty good. I have greatly detailed memories of my young childhood from before I was 12 y/o, and my oldest memory is from when I was around 4 or 5.


I just don't remember what exactly was going on in my life during this little period. I can't remember with who I was hanging out, who were my teachers, who were my classmates, what games I used to play, which movies I was into, what haircut I had, where did I went during holidays, what was on my mind during showers and insomnias, if I was excited about new releases of things, what YouTubers I used to watch, in what terms I was with my family, how was my personality at the time, etc... But I mean it would make sense to forget about those things when it's been a while, but I can remember most of those things for many older school years, and this is a pretty recent period, so why is it completely blank for this one ? 

From what I remember, a day from this period was just me going to school, working, working, working, getting to home, and then blank. I can't remember what I was doing of my free time, except for working. I can't even remember if I was happy, or sad. The only emotion that comes to my mind while thinking about this period is just a feeling of emptiness. It's so weird, it really feels like I wasn't alive or I just stopped feeling alive during that one period, and I was just waiting for the days to pass. But then I sort of woke up from this a bit before my 14th birthday (in October), because things start to get a little bit clearer from here. Nothing particular happened though. But I do remember that towards the end of August 2018 I started getting depressed, and that's when my memories start getting clear again. Guess getting sad helped me to feel alive again.

So my question is, does that sound like a normal brain thing, or is it a sign of some serious memory problems ?

Sorry if my english sounds weird btw, not a native"
519,My family thinks its so easy.,"Im bipolar, from major depressive disorder, i had insomia for 4 yrs.very serious insomia for 3
Had suicide episode at the end of college. Overdose drank pesticide and then drowned myself at a dock sea port.

Im from Philippines here in our country its normal for families to have both parents Abroad means mom and dad worked overseas for long periods of time. From childhood i moved from school to school every 3 yrs I always lost friends turned from extrovert to introvert. Back in highschool where most people have fun memories i only had friends after 3 yrs or the 3rd yr of highschool. Graduations were the loneliest i never had pictures with friends. The same thing happened in college. Engineering was a nightmare i never wanted that course and i learned to hate one of the best universities in our country. At first i had friends but most quit halfway cause it was so difficult. Same thing happened to me but i couldnt change schools because i was almost a 3rd yr student. I would have to re exam all the passing grades i got 70% marks. In the end i stopped for awhile lost even more friends and became even more introverted. At this point i stopped talking and escaped to anime and pc games, and just crammed everytime there was an exam, but was still able to graduate. I never copied from anyone and i made 99% of my homework by myself. Never cheated on exams. Catch is at the end of it all is there were weeks i had 3 days no sleep, still passing or getting 100 marks, or completely failing cause cramming didnt work. And then at the end of college i was 11 yrs depressed, had suicidal ideation for 2 yrs, broken hearted, had no sleep for 1 to 3 days at a time and was still topping my grad class even if im just cramming. But the mental damage wouldnt disappear even now 1.5 yrs after. Now that i eventually took life into my own hands my diagnosis changed to bipolar and i havr manic phases, existential crisis, loneliness, emptiness etc. I made a business in this pandemic and finally doing what i want. But they never understand how hard this is for me. They controlled me all my life. They didnt want me to play computer games, they hated my hobbies, they didnt like the way i drive the car, mom arranges my clothes the way i hate it, the way i speak etc. Life is no fun with them"
520,Feeling a little alone out here.,"I appreciate that people are becoming more open at about mental health issues, but severe mental illness is still so isolating. I have bipolar and just started a new job recently.  I was talking to a coworker today &amp; she brought up that she used to have a bipolar manager who was fired after choking someone out. After this I felt really desperate to not have anyone at work ever find out. I take meds so it’s not noticeable and I just generally have a very fly under the radar, don’t make waves, just here to get the job done type of personality/work ethic. Mental illness does make my job harder sometimes though, and I feel like it would have been nice to be able to disclose stuff like that to management if I was ever having issues or needed help. Stuff like this just reinforces the need to keep your mouth shut though, or have it come back to haunt you. Just needed to vent."
521,I can never get anywhere because I'm living too many lives inside of my head,"I've been trying to describe this to my social worker but haven't quite found the words so I'm trying to vent here to see if anyone here understands what I'm going through. 

I think this started because everyone always told me how smart I was and how I was going to grow up to do great things basically just because I used to read a shit ton as a kid. So I grew up imagining all these different paths that I would take but spoiler alert here I am a college drop out at 21 while many peers are getting close to graduating; unemployed and confused and tearing my mind apart. 

I've been diagnosed with bipolar and am in the process of getting treated for that but am currently not on medication but beyond mood swings, there's this phenomenon that's been going on in my head that is making it impossible for me to make any decisions or go anywhere in life. I feel as though I can envision with perfect clarity all these different paths I could possibly take. But it's not just like I could do this job or this job, it's like I literally feel as though I have to reinvent myself to live each of these lives, I am a different person entirely in each of these lives. What is so frustrating is my imagination begins going wild envisioning each life, it starts out with moving to a different city or country but then I can imagine a whole timeline of events that will take place. The best way I could describe it is it is as if  (damn 6 two letter words in a row) the multi-verse theory is correct and there are different me's in different universes all living different lives but I am the one who is just watching all of them do it. I cannot do anything myself except seeing all the different possibilities.

The thing is they all have so many benefits, it's like trying to choose a favorite parent or child except instead of someone else you're choosing your favorite version of yourself but they're all equally good. It's been paralyzing me. 

Does anyone recognize this feeling?"
522,Is it okay to talk to your S/O about your mental health?,"Recently, my mental health has plummeted. I have nobody to turn to about it aside from my girlfriend. I’m afraid it’s a bad idea though, I don’t want to stress her out or overload her with my issues. I don’t want to seem like I’m manipulating her or guilt tripping her in some way either. I cried on the phone with her a couple days ago and was concerned about making her feel sad. 
Is it a good idea to talk to your S/O about this type of thing?"
523,Is this a mental health issue?,"I'm speaking on behalf of a friend, basically she has issues with boyfriend, her boyfriend seems to get addicted to random things. It started when her boyfriend was on a site called discord 24/7 a couple of years ago she noticed a decline in their relationship as they were not communicating she confronted him and he admitted he was a little addicted but didn't realise it till the last minute then it happened again with various stuff including games and various activities her boyfriend suffers with depression and anxiety. In long winded words no matter what activity hes doing he gets too addicted he ends up in his own world he doesn't end up talking to his girlfriend she has tried to help him but he continues making the same mistakes. My friend is asking if this is a mental health illness and does he need to seek professional help. Note his girlfriend has mentioned maybe looking into getting professional help  he  gets defensive and dismisses that he might need help."
524,Brain atrophy??," Maybe this should be in [r/TooAfraidToAsk](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/). idk. Long story short: I fell and had a concussion a few weeks ago. ER read the CT scan and told me I had frontal lobe atrophy (not the exact words but you get it) I'm 52/F and have been on antidepressants and other random shit on and off since college. I asked the ER physician assistant (no doc available I guess) if it could be caused by long term depression, long term use of anti-depressants or similar. She literally said ""oh no one knows that"" with a smile and then something like... so ok, call yer PCP tomorrow bah bye. I finally have a face-to-face PCP appt in 2 days and I'm scared shitless. btw- He is a new PCP to me. The practice I went to pre-COVID 19 closed. So I'm even more fearful of blurting out my diagnoses to a new person, discussing meds, etc. I also don't have a psychiatrist right now. I've only told 1 person about the brain atrophy, if it's true - my boyfriend- and his perspective is pretty much ""don't talk about it or it will be real"". ikr? I haven't slept in 4 days; like 2-3 hour a night. Last night (this morning) I slept from around 0630-1000. I can't top thinking. There's so much more but I'll leave it at that. SO..... anyone who has dealt with anything similar, any thoughts, opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated! thanks. ps- I already wrote a complaint to the hospital about the PA."

527,I've gotte alot a say...,"Hello, I'm gonna start by wishing you all to stay healthy mentally as well as psychically or if you aren't, to get better as fast as possible.

I think I've been diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder, I always thought or seem to prefer refereeing to it as being in the spectrum, but even after researching intensively the differences I remain unsure. I told my mom I had a bunch of disorders and she somehow must've internalized this because after some reflection, I came to the conclusion that this is not a practical thing to say, to my mom it sounds like an easy way not to elaborate on anything when asked or hear me out when I'm trying to get her to cooperate in helping me get the right medication.

&amp;#x200B;

My psychiatrist wrote I have ADHD (but the most crippling diagnosis was schizophrenia which I don't have as far as concerned, but the label is crippling enough in my situation;) I kept complaining to her about it and insisting upon ADHD meds more, but she really really doesn't give a shit or understand anything about it as she only wrote it to humor me and she doesn't seem to really make reliable diagnosis, mostly relying on what previous doctors wrote, such as notes and observations, (None of them are able to differentiate acute psychotic episodes to chronic schizophrenia, I developed psychosis years after I first got anti psychotic when I was 16, I didn't know how bad these were gonna get, but they traumatized me more and more with physical assault from refusing them) medications does not seem adequate to disorders in this hospital, it looks to me like most of them are playing tags with diagnosis, sounds as though they're forcing alot of anti psychotic medication onto people who aren't a danger to themselves or to anyone, as they did with me to the point of frontal and violent confrontations, which is really despicable in our day and age, they will purposefully blur the lines and call out your anger and disdain as incoherent speech. They basically act on command regardless of what you've done. This is similar to police brutality but their hypocrisy makes it so bad. I went back to the place where they gave me PDD, I must've have really overestimate their skills as when I told them I felt I couldn't die, or y'know whatever was going through my head at the time and the lady took it so seriously, that's when I felt stupid for not mentioning I wasn't seriously considering I couldn't die, but thinking back to it makes me realize these people are complete fucking retards and should've never got any medical degrees with the way they approach these meetings or talk with their patients with so little objectivity in communicating with them. My practitioner gave me antipsychotic again even though he doesn't seem to even know what the fuck he's doing, I went for severe pain in my neck, shoulders and such (which actually was bad) instead of pain killers. I always mentioned how bad I can't focus or complete tasks but I haven't met one decent doctor to react accordingly. I had severe depression in the past, crippling anxiety and OCD, these has been taken care of with time and a lot of self-help and meditation. But you can't cure ADHD the same and certainly not with anti psychotic and physical abuse and mental manipulation."
528,acclimating to a normal life,"I used to partake in illicit activities, Im not going to say what for obvious reasons, but many of them would have gotten me a felony charge at the very least if I were to have been caught but after a certain incident took place I realized that what I was doing was kinda pointless and dangerous for no real reason.  that being said I have tried to take a step back and change my life and the people I associate with which has left me very alone because everyone I was close with was also into criminal activities and such.  I have had depression since a very young age and I think I went down that path out of sheer boredom and it made me feel alive to be 'rebellious' and protected in the streets for some reason, I liked the sense of power that I held over the average person walking by. but since trying to leave that lifestyle behind I feel completely alone.  and have fallen into a deeper depression than when some of my family members committed suicide, I feel like acclimating to a 'normal' life is impossible.  living like that was almost like a drug that I cannot shake and I wish I could just forget the past 5 years so I wouldn't have made the same decisions I had.  but I guess that is life, I guess you could say that I have learned a lot but at the same time I feel like I just have a more accurate picture of the darker side of things.  at this point I am so lonely and depressed that all I can think about is how pointless life seems inn the grand scheme of things, I have been finding solace in writing my suicide letters to my loved ones.  I have also never really been close with much of my family so none of them understand being the good typical christian family they are, not to say there is anything wrong with that but its just to say that the letters I am writing are more to people that are my family out of choice not blood.  the only person I could somewhat relate to i my family took his life 6 years ago and I haven't been the same since, I feel that I just want to join him. real life is just too mundane I dot fully understand the point of it all."

534,I'm having a mental breakdown based on what I just discovered.,"Hey Reddit!

So, I'll keep it short. I got academically suspended from my college before my (freshman yr) Spring Semester, but thankfully I got readmitted two weeks ago. During the spring I transferred to a CC and got a ton of credits transferred  back . Unfortunately, I'm one credit hour away from sophomore status and I've accidentally been telling my gf, family, and friends that I'll be a Soph this year. I feel like a loser and a disappointment. I've always been on track ever since I was a little tike in 1st grade.

Being a freshie for another semester feels.....wrong. I know what I did, but I really I earned enough credits to be a sophomore. My girl is a SO but I definitely not telling her or anyone. Only  my advisor and my roommate should know. If word got out that I am behind, I'll most likely isolated myself from everyone. Also, my girl may not want to be with me If she knew the truth. So, I'll have to keep this secret hidden until the end of the semester. (Sigh....) I'm so dumb."

I’ve had them for years and have not made a single new friend in years... I rely on these friendships and feel like I’m burning them out sometimes. 

I’m shy but I wouldn’t say it’s extreme, I like talking to people 1 on 1 or small groups, and I try to connect with people. But it never breaks the surface you know? then I just have “acquaintances.” I like to go out with my best friend, who is a social butterfly, and she makes new friends everywhere she goes. Sometimes if we go out and see some of the people she’s introduced me to previously, most of the time people never even remember me! Lol. I can’t help but be really quiet in social gathering settings because of anxiety and whatnot.. 

I end up feeling really lonely sometimes when I really want to do something fun or hang out with someone and my 3 friends are busy haha. Some people I’ve talked to about it say cliche things like, “just be friendly” or “just put yourself out there” and I guess those are quite literally the exact things I need to do, but I just can’t open up to people, maybe I just don’t have that personality that draws people in. How do some people make new friends so easily?"
536,I think I'm emotionally detached,I've noticed I've been very numb for the past year and it's slowly been getting worse. My uncle (we were very close) died a couple days ago and I cried legit for 5 minutes and someone came to check on me and I was fine after that. I already can't feel guilt or remorse and it's always been like that. But I can't even cry if I want to. It's like my emotions are being slowly drained away. I've been faking being happy because I don't feel happiness anymore. I don't want my loved ones worrying about me when my dad could drop dead any minute.

I noticed the more I learned about it, the more it really feels like the missing piece of the puzzle for me. I'm currently diagnosed with bipolar 2, which from my understanding has very similar symptoms to BPD.

Anyway, I'm just curious about how you may have gotten your dx and if there are ""casual"" ways to bring it up during therapy so that I can get a good evaluation as well.

Thanks in advance!"
540,How are you supposed to know what is a delusion/hallucination??,"people have mentioned that the things I've been mentioning sound like I'm having those things, and sometimes I do think sometimes I do get some weird thoughts, like shirts spying on me or something, but they're thoughts that seem normal for the first seconds and then I realize they're not.   


But lately I'm just not sure if I'm hallucinating or having delusions or what, like I'm fairly certain I'm grounded in reality, for the most part.  I admit I used to see and hear things as a kid/young teen, but that was years ago, and I'm 20 now, so that's in the past. The last time I really had a bad episode was when I refused to shower because I thought there were cameras everywhere and lately a few weeks ago I stopped eating and drinking for a few days because I didn't think anything was real, so why eat right? But then I realized after a few days that it wasn't really that ""normal"".   


But lately I've been struggling with knowing what's real and what's not real. Like, I feel like I know reality well enough but sometimes I just, don't feel like I exist in reality, and everything from people's faces to objects look so weird. I have no idea what counts as a hallucination or delusion. How am I supposed to know?"

My parents and I are looking into TMS, as well as some intensive outpatient programs, but I really think I need to do residential treatment. I have no structure on my days right now. I'm constantly suicidal. Just thinking about all the petty little inconveniences life keeps throwing at me make me want to die.

542,How to tell someone they are experiencing temporary mental delusions,"I’ve had them myself and the thing I hated the most was when people told me I needed to seek professional help.  So I don’t think that works very well.  I’m pretty close to the guy and he’s been my phone support guy or vice versa really for many years.  

Usually we’re just joking around but lately it’s just been bananas.  He talks about how he can predict things and how incredible his ability’s are.  Physically and mentally.  He’s lost most of his joking around and it’s become just a very serious conversation all the time which is exhausting kinda.

Today is his birthday and he was telling me he’s been crying because two of his friends are going to die most likely if he doesn’t put the effort in to stop it???  Also he thinks he caused the corona virus.  But he also mentions how he realizes he sounds crazy and all that.  

I’m kinda worried.  I just say things like “well I sure hope they don’t die” and stuff.  And he’s like “everything will be alright in the end” you know the normal dramatic things we go through when we’re having mental breaks.  

I guess I’m wondering how to tell him to chill the f out in a nice friendly way without upsetting him.  Maybe laugh at his remarks and redirect the conversation to humorous things?  

He said he’d let me know if his two friends die or not in the next couple days.  Yeah he put a timeline on a couple peoples deaths.  And I was like “well, I don’t know what happened or anything I just hope nobody dies”. And he’s like “I know you don’t, but you should just know regardless”. Stuff like that.  No details.  I imagine he’s just having delusions that are impossible to explain and I totally get that.  I’m not too worried but it’s ramping up with this situation.  Thoughts?"

This year has shown a marked increase in irrational, paranoid-delusional type behavior, no doubt in correlation to the election year. My folks are both nearing their seventies and I worry about their overall mental stability and health and those around them. My dad suffers from early onset Alzheimer’s. I can’t stomach anymore regurgitated political rhetoric or fear mongering and have washed my hands of them as much as possible lately. It’s regrettable, because I worry about their safety and the safety of others but my dad told me today that he hopes for another civil war and I basically said adios amigo. If thine right eye offends thee, right? When and under what criteria is it justifiable for me to have someone step into this situation? I feel like it’s potentially dangerous."
545,Stop Fidgeting?,"Sorry, I don’t know where to put this but I fidget and clench my teeth all the time. The fidgeting never stops and it gets in the way of going to sleep.

548,I have a comparison-focused mindset because of the way I was raised as a child. I’m in my 20s now and I’m having trouble breaking out of it.,"Growing up, my parents were very focused on academic achievement. Whatever grades I got, the first question used to be “Who scored the highest?”. They were good to me otherwise and they stopped doing that as I got older but I haven’t been able to break out of that mindset myself, and it’s making me constantly unhappy.

I’ve recently done an MBA and gotten a fairly decent job (money-wise), but I keep looking up my old classmates who’ve done “better”, and I keep thinking that if X can do that then why can’t I?

I know that the job isn’t everything and I’ve spoken to quite a few who are miserable in their “better” jobs, but I haven’t been able to stop comparing myself to them, thinking that I should have been able to do better.

It’s okay on some days, I just see a post on social media and I let it go, but other days it just completely takes over my mind and I end up spending hours looking up career options and job openings and it drives me crazy.

Would appreciate any advice on how to live with this?"
549,Gaining mental toughness. Who wants to join?,"Going to university in 7 days. I started a challenge 3 days ago. The goal is to gain mental toughness by working on the weakest parts of my body. I’ve got 3 open heart surgeries under my belt. The lungs work, and the rest of my body is fine. Through high school I worked, boxed, and learned knife fighting and earned Eagle Scout. I found through doing things I hated, i gained strength. Working incredibly late, fighting, spending nights outside in the woods. I find through conditioning the mind, it gets stronger. Strengthen your mind, do not medicate it. 

Until I get my degree I plan to run until exhaustion, do push up sets of 30 until failure and plank until failure, every day. Adding in cold showers and reading a few pages a day aswell. Although only 3 days in, I’m plowing through, it feels good. If anyone wants to join me, let me know! I would love to hear from other people trying this out and would be more than happy to motivate others to do the same."
550,I Just Want To Sleep,Trying to go to sleep while trying not to have anxiety and then a panic attack is the worse shit ever. I just want to feel normal. I’m so tired of this crap.
551,"I tend to ""word vomit"" when I'm anxious or excited and I often ramble and apologize and make no sense. Can't stop cringing. Seeking advice, support or perspective.","I hate myself so much I want to crawl out of my skin.

I did this around so many people, I don't even know how to convey how extreme it could get when I was very anxious. It was worse when I was excited but also anxious and embarrassed because my impulsiveness and desire to speak was at war with my ever increasing anxiety and the pressure got to be so much I would just ""trance out"" and basically babble. I couldn't after a while look people in the face because I began to anticipate their expressions of bewilderment, discomfort and exasperation as I'd try to say 15 things at once, contradicting myself and qualifying everything I said with an increasingly panicked, sped up and ungrammatical speaking style, not making any eye contact until it culminated after 3 minutes of nonstop talking in a mortified apology for not making any sense and wasting everyone's time. And then 3 minutes later feeling such a strong urge to do it again because ""this time I would make sense, I knew exactly what I wanted to say"" but then opening my mouth and everything going to absolute shit because suddenly my point which moments before seemed to relevant and integral to the conversation seems incredibly stupid and I as I speak I realize I'm not making sense and everyone is just internally cringing as nervously spew out the 15 things running through my head because I need to redeem myself, only for my face to become redder and redder with shame and the cycle to continue.

And yet I always brushed it off as a minor quirk. Only now am I realizing how many times I thought I was having a great conversation with someone I admired and adored, when really they likely couldn't wait for me to shut up. I feel so embarrassed. And it's worse around people I like the most. I feel like such an idiot. I am most embarrassed about how I spoke around one person, my professor, advisor and mentor, who I look up to and enjoyed being around more than anyone and who I thought also liked to talk to me. But as I think back to our meetings I see so many cues that he was bored and uncomfortable and irritated that I didn't pick up on. I thought the fact that he wasn't looking at me when I spoke, or that he was fidgeting just was part of his personality. I remember the time I word vomited in his office and hearing him sigh very loudly, as I walked out, as if in relief, or exhaustion.

I want to apologize to him, even though I already have too many times, for being so damn annoying. I wanted him to like so much that I sabotaged it. I keep doing this. I know there is hope moving forward but I'm still with the same professors and peers who know me and have witnessed my outburst. I can't get over how much I've annoyed people."

567,I just want to be able to hold on to a job...,"Hey ya'll. 

So, I had a major psychotic episode earlier this year (right before COVID) and had to quit an amazing job I had in a city I loved because of the delusions. I came back home to be closer to my boyfriend. I love him but I genuinely hate it here. It sucks the life out of me. 

Anyways, so since then I have had to quit two more jobs within two weeks of starting (well, I got fired from one because I told a coworker about my suicidal ideation) largely due to panic attacks I have whenever I'm at work now - which never used to happen before. I'm starting to think I have PTSD on top of everything else.

I'm pretty much out of money now so I haven't been able to go to therapy or see any doctor other than my psychiatrist (who isn't particularly helpful when it comes to the panic attacks) but I DID get one more job here a few weeks ago... Which is great but I also signed a two year contract so now I'm stuck in a place I hate for two years when I used to travel the country. Also I had dizzy spells from the stress last night and almost got sent home and I'm terrified I'm going to lose this job too and end up even more screwed financially than I already am.

I could really use some support and/or advice. I think the antipsychotics might be making some of my symptoms worse but there's no way my psychiatrist or boyfriend will let me quit taking them. I know this has been a terrible year for everybody but I'm almost friendless and on the verge of losing ANOTHER job and I need help. 

Thanks in advance &lt;3"
568,I don’t know what’s wrong with me but it’s something!,"Essentially the title. I have clinically been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety/depression. For months I’ve been feeling not numb because I still can feel happy sometimes. And most of the time my mood is meh to why am I trapped in the pain of existing or whatever. Essentially there’s something wrong with me and I know it but I don’t know what. I just feel so alone and disappointed in myself for wasting 4 years of my life in high school where I never learned a hobby, almost flunked out (even though I was told I had such great potential) and now am left with 1 friend ( I do have other friends but I don’t text or see them ever. This one I see more) who I rarely see.  And I don’t have anything I’m interested in that I could turn into a career and plus life is so short and I want to experience so much but I know I can’t/won’t.

570,Feeling completely defeated.,"I’m currently in the depths of hell in my mental health journey. severe health anxiety, depression, new medication journey, dermatological problems, physical anxiety, medical bills, 2 jobs, in school full time, waiting for my insurance to either accept or reject a MRI of my head, and to top everything off, my dog, who was my literal everything, died in my arms last night. I’m shattered. I honestly don’t know how to even move forward without him."
571,Everything feels like work,"So idk if this is a genuine issue or not, or if it's a symptom of something else, but for a very long time now, I've been feeling like everything feels like work and drains me, even things that I would normally be really interested in. Even things like watching a movie, eating, minimal cleaning, and video games have begun to make me feel exhausted. 
Is this normal? I imagine it's not, but asking just in case. And if it's not, what could be the cause of it and how can I work to gain my interests back?

581,My attention span sucks. What is wrong with me?,"I am currently in 11th grade and ever since 8th grade my ability to pay attention has gone down the drain. I feel I have ADHD, but someone with medical backround said if I can sit still for long periods of time then I probably don't have it, which may be complete bullshit but anyways. 

In 8th grade I was given something laced with hard drugs, and can't identify what exactly it was. The only detail I can remember is it being the size of a candy and it slowly kicking in over 30min to an hour and lasting a full 8 hours. Completely terrible experience. Awful hallucinations that made my head hurt, spinning objects and ghosting shadows with random objects in the corner of my vision. My control over my hands and legs inverted from right to left (I haven't found any description of a drug that even explained this) and while it was euphoric it actually made me sick because of how easily my mood would swing from restless to anxious to depressed to complete silence.

I wish I could go back and change what I did that day to stop me from ever going to that point. I haven't done any drugs besides this and before that didn't feel obligated to do them. I don't understand how it happened.

This left me in a very desperate and dark part of my life where I wasn't necessarily depressed but very regretful and burdened. I don't feel this way now but what I did notice after this was how my dominant eyes actually slowly switched back and forth (which eye you use for depth and to focus closely with) over the course of a couple months, also can't explain this. I have 2020 vision unless I am tired in which case my eyes can get lazy and strain, also what I noticed after this.

I don't understand how any of this could correlate directly to my attention span but I've ranted my troubles in hopes that someone can find something that matters in my cluster F of a post. My attention span before this also was just fine. I was great student while being a bit disorganized. I felt I was pretty smart but now my brain is so terribly inconsistent that it doesn't matter what my potential is. I tested for a IQ of 125 when I was in 4th grade in a specialized test for a program but I don't feel like I am anywhere close to that smart. I also have poor self esteem and generally am not very confident in social situations or in myself. 

I would just like some feedback on what I can do to better myself and how to apply it easily. Looking back at this post I probably need a therapist. No, I have not had suicidal thoughts. No, I do not have a abusive/damaged homelife."
582,How to support my friend with bipolar 2?,"I’m the friend who wants to help!

Hi,

A good friend of mine was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the beginning of the year but it really started for him about 2 year ago.

He went on medication which he described as making him feel flat and constantly ‘lightly’ depressed. He switched medication and it began to regulate his emotions a lot more but unfortunately gave him something called a death rash so had to discontinue it.

For the past month he has been on no proper medication and has been self medicating with marijuana. As his bipolar has gotten worse he is unable to spend time alone and spends every waking hour with friends or dating to fill the void in between work and sleep. Being social would usually seem fine but he has gotten to a point where for a couple of months he literally hasn’t spent time by himself. He told me he once had 2hrs alone a couple of weeks ago and couldn’t handle it. Also the social outings that he goes to he’ll generally be drinking quite a few drinks and that’s every day of the week.

He said he’s feeling great due to not being on medication because he can fully function in the bed. I have a feeling he’s feeling great because of that and also he’s going through a euphoric high.

Any suggestions for the best way to be a support for him? I was going to suggest jogging together so that he can get more of a natural high with no drink or other substances involved.

Thanks in advance!"
583,Possibly have BPD?,"Hi!! This is my secret reddit account &lt;&gt;.&lt;&gt;  


So, for a lot of personal reasons- no, I wont lie here. I have a problem with lying. I'll get into that later. I will explain later on why I am asking here rather than getting help, IRL. I am here to ask for thoughts and opinions on what you may believe is wrong with me.   
I'm not taking anything said as an official medical diagnoses at all. I just want some gental guidance.  


A lot of what I am saying may sound like Im talking dirctly to someone.... it's because I am. It's a copy paste to my FP(Favourite Person) who has me blocked...  


I will site this as a source  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPopjuKuweg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPopjuKuweg)   
It states I need to suffer trom at least five of the listed things. I experience all but one. I don't experience impulsivity that negatively impacts my life. I can impulsively contact someone, or super sexually flirt dith someone I know is a super bad influence on my life, but ihk if that counts.  


I'm going to list trough what I experience, the exxact, terminology may be wrong, as I am tryikg my best to explain my subjective personal experience. (This will be copy pastes)  


 I have 6 different ""episodes"" as I call it. As well as the thing that happens when I get overwhelmed with feelings for sexual situations.  


I've named the 6 different episodes: Hatred, Calculated, Loving, Self-hate, Self-Destruction, Chaotic Neutral.  
I can be triggered to go into and out of any of these episodes from anything from a song, to an anime character/tv character, to a random passing thought.  


And I will fully believe all the thoughts I have in this state like I know that I am in an extreme state of mind but I can't actually believe it to be correct? Like, it's like my voice is a background voice in my head, and it's there, but not really telling the truth.  


Hatred is me just hating you, I hate you, I think you are terrible and constantly hurt me.   


Loving is the opposite, I simply think that everything you do is fine, b/c it's only little things and you make me extremely happy anyway, so it's okay. (EDIT AFTER PASTED: This is still bad, bc I value others(my fp's) happiness over my own wellbeing, I enjoy it though)  


Calculated is where I look down on everyone, I just get a massive superiority complex and see people interacting with what I look down on as emotions, to be inferior to me. I see everyone as ants, however, it doesn't apply to friends, thus friends can always make me change back to normal.  


Self-Hate is pretty self-explanatory, it's normally caused directly after a situation where I go into Hatred and say something hurtful to you, or even just think of something bad especially happens after the overwhelming one where I disassociate with reality.... you know... the one where I told you to... yeah...   


Self-Destruction is where I do a lot of things that I know are detrimental to my health, or to relationships, but do them anyway, for no reason and justify it by saying I deserve it anyway.  


Chaotic Neutral is where I do whatever, idrc and I get hysterically happy about doing the worst things, I would consider myself to be bat shit crazy in this state, think Bill Cipher level crazy.  


Finally, the one I disassociate with, it kinda is like the other ones, except I am fully aware until I fight it too much (I'll get into that later). It's the one that stopped me from being direct about my feelings before when I was talking in the group chat, unlike everything else, it doesn't feel like an extreme thought pattern, or something I slip in and out of, it feels like a different being altogether, like possession almost, it can control what I can and cannot say even if I am not in that state if it believes me saying something will mean that it has less control, it won't let me, I believe this is a defence mechanism so I don't get hurt.  


I tried to fight it, and I can't do it alone, you have to appeal to the, me that is typing this now (like how I said say cute things? Or how I said talk about romance, yes that is appealing to \*\*ME\*\*, so I can gain majority control, or at least enough stop)  
If I fight it too hard, or I experience too much pain watching what it's doing to you, I completely disassociate even with my own mind, and everything goes numb and blurry...... I don't retain any memories during this... at all... I try to tell you this... I just don't have any memories or recollection of what actually happened, I know that it did, and I can remember that at one point I knew, but I just don't anymore...  


I only disassociate with it, if it's really extreme, like imagine your emotions right? Well imagine if you had an EXTREME emotion if I felt comparatively that same emotions of extremeness compared to my other emotions when I am in an episode, what would happen is I'd disassociate with it, I just can't take it and it's in control.  
   
\- End of copy-paste  


A little more info with the one I disassociate with. I feel like it is different. Like possesion almost.  


I call it my primal one. It NEEDS control, even if I am not in an episode it can force me to lie or not explain how it works in detail to friends, b/c it needs to be able to control them if they pose a threat to us. I think it wants to protect me, but also hates me for being weak and having morals.  
One time after it took control and hurt my FP, I cried in the shower and I heard it calling me a monster.... I physically heard it... not just thougts...  
It makes me lie a lot and lose my memories a lot, and it gets to the point where even though I know how I feel, and know what I am saying is the truth it makes me feel like I am making it all up or pretending, if I go to somone who could actually do something IRL if I explained.  


Its determined and manipulative and has far more control if I'm sexually aroused or tired. It knows that I want it in control and to be more like it (i just had a random negative thought about my former FP, so it's able to control my actions again from here on in, but probs dont care since none of you can do anything). I want it to be in control, b/c it doesn't get hurt by people, it dill indscrimenentally hurt people back who hurt me.  


Some extra info, I exibit OCD traits. Like I have to balance sound between left and right ears, or light between left and right etc.  


I have also sufferd from extreme delusions in the past, thinking, whatever I truly believe will happen most, is guaranteed to not happen. For example if I truly belieive the school bus dill come, then it wont. I use to think of this as my super power  


Final point, this time regarding the ""episodes"" during episods, I can be aware its happening, but imagine I came to you with evidence saying all your memories are fake. You would logically understand that.... but it wouldnt feel real, thats how my episods are. I logically know my thoughts are extreme and not hod I really feel, but I cant truly understand.   


  
Ask me any questions if you need clarification. I am able to control myself to not lie to you people. Please if you believe how I feel is better described by another mental illness, please elaborate."
584,"I feel like brain is degrading, advice needed","I’ve been very depressed and just out of it the past few months. In the past few weeks, I feel like my brain and body are just slowly degrading.  My memory is really terrible (both long term and short term) and everything is kind of hazy. My emotions are a mess. Everything’s a lot more subdued, I feel really monotone other than my occasional anger breakouts. Any complex work using my brain is really tiring (and this might seem like ‘oh I don’t want to do my schoolwork’ but it’s more like I get waves of exhaustion and my brain just isn’t making the connections it was before). My concentration is absolute shit (though it always was). Time seems so confusing now too. I’m never remember the days and hours too well and my sense of time is really bad. Sometimes I just can’t remember the past hours that well. Some days my body is so exhausted for absolutely no reason and I get dizzy from standing up. Breathing is hard too.

588,I feel sick,"(M16-Gr11) A lot has been going on the past few months and it’s all been adding up. I woke up yesterday and felt awful but this morning it’s even worse. My mother has been really dismissive of my achievements, especially A’s on tests etc. so that’s made me feel really despondent. My school has also been making us students work for the past 5 months now. We aren’t behind on any work yet we didn’t get a holiday between our 2nd and 3rd term (semester) since they merged the two so we just got last week off. The problem is that it didn’t even feel like a break. It felt like a slightly longer-than-normal weekend. 

Now I’m lying in bed, so anxious that I have abdominal pain. And my depression, which I’ve been managing well up until now is plaguing my thoughts.

I’ve taken off school today to try and relax a bit more."

590,What’s going on?,"I’m in the military and spent about 3 months in a very intense training environment, working along side doctors and residents in a Level 1 Trauma hospital in the heart of one of the most violent cities in America.. 

I really really put myself in It. Arguably a lot more then my peers, anything that was offered I was on it. From guys being jumped with machetes, kids being shot while at the gas station, cracking open ribs to provide direct CPR to the heart (open thoracotomies).. missing limbs.. anything and everything, people died daily and I had to wrap their bodies in sheets because we didn’t have enough body bags.. telling their families we did all we could. That being said.. I never wanted to leave, even after getting after it for an exhausting 12 hours straight. I just wanted more when my peers were dying to go home. It was like I was riding a high, I absolutely loved it, more then any job I’ve ever done.

Afterwards I had a huge crash, completely mentally broken, literally crying into my wives lap. No desire to do really anything, a major low point. Almost a year later, I’m still just not happy. I wouldn’t call it sad, but I’ve lost any desire to do really anything still. Mental heath has always been kind of a taboo in my family, “it’s just being a millennial”, “you can tough it out”, etc. I just don’t know what’s really going on and I don’t know where to turn."

I fear thunder because I automatically think  it might be a bomb. And sometimes I am just nervous for no reason at all.

593,Too much issues..,"Ok while i know that many people have it worse i still wanted to get this off my chest.

I have been in a mental spiral that feels like iam bouncing off a wall like a bouncy ball only to hit another one as soon as i get back to earth.

Firstly iam a diagnosed aspie and iam a hypochondriac to boot.
Iam a workaholic, starting an hour earlier than i should and basically the company means more to me than the owner at times.
On top of that i have a son from my first wife that i dont see anymore because my ex sent me into a horrible depression.

Enter corona.. we have been in lockdown almost since the start of corona in my country.
For me life is only work, eat, sleep and repeat for the last 6 months without any way to vent or relax.
My wife is on partially paid leave and continues to tell me how bad it is to be at home while i have to work my ass off everyday.
Yes i understand shes having a bad time but iam working my ass off untill eternity.

I have been on meds for a month now but i still feel trapped. I dont complain, dont skip work, am still functioning but feel emotionally empty.
I can not even describe my exact feelings anymore.
I spent the last night in a hotel with my wife and all i wanted to do was sleep and not move more than 1000ft from my room.

Even the trip in the mountains was an o fuck me what happens if the car breaks down? What if the brakes fail? Even though i have a good and well maintained car just the idea if anything happening that causes me more unrest will cause me unrest.

I know this isnt really a post that reads well or i dont expect someone dechypher my feelings because even i fail to do so.
I just feel so shitty rn."
594,How to hold off nostalgia and separation anxiety?,"Nostalgia can affect you at times positively but mainly for me, negatively. I just recently been into college and for my whole academic life I stayed in one school, this is where I met all of my friends, teachers and my girlfriend. I am an ambivert, I could be an extrovert when needed but mostly an introvert when I do not feel like doing anything. I feel like I the first mistake I have done is not fix this problem after middle school where almost half of my friends left. I was so disarranged that I did not particularly care about my high school experience until I have become close with my girlfriend on the last semester of my high school. 

The heavy and grim looking classroom suddenly felt light and colorful to the extent that I do not want this to end, I have become comfortable to the people around me and feel happy to socialize again since I really am stressed out keeping my A’s afloat. Now comes the end, and it ended abruptly because of covid, I didnt get to say my goodbyes, i didnt get to take pictures and i didnt get to move on. Now imagining what could've happen or thinking about the memories that I have taken for granted in my time there seems to be one of my biggest regret. If only I could have spent my days a little bit happy and looking forward to it. Nostalgia or rather my memories supposed to make me happy, not sad. Also, transitioning into college, me and my girlfriend luckily is in the same university but different blocks and its keeping me anxious. To be honest I really don't know what to think and do that I have developed my own comfort zone.

597,I can't tell if I'm anxious or depressed.,"***TW: ED, self harm, rape, abuse***

Hi all. 

Nervous about posting as I'm new here, likely will delete this after but I figure a wee emotional spillage is ok.

I'm currently struggling quite badly. A landmark birthday is coming up and it's highlighted the fact that I have accomplished absolutely nothing with my life. I'd hoped to have kids and a career by now. Instead I am stuck in a dead end job (a good paying one but still not what I want to do)

I have some past trauma and mental health issues that I had been doing ok with but the last year has been the worst. 

My partner, I have realised, may be emotionally abusive. He has refused to understand how bad my mental health can get. He is fickle with his moods. If he's in a bad one, I feel I have to overcompensate and be cheery. If he's in a good one, I'm on edge because the simplest thing can set him off.

I also firmly believe he has secretly had a vasectomy and refused to tell me. A few years ago, he had surgery on his testicles. Immediately after that, he changed his mind about having kids. When I asked why, he said he was done with kids (he has them already) and that if I didn't like it, I knew where the door was. The other night I was reading r/AITA and read out some choice ones to him. One was of a man who got a vasectomy without telling his partner.

My partner went red, very quiet, then excused himself from the room to go do something in the attic. When he came back down, he launched into a spiel about bodily autonomy and how nobody HAS to tell anyone about decisions regarding their body. This is the same man who mocked my involvement in a reproductive rights group.

That's what I'm living with...

I was ten years clean from self harm and relapsed last yr which makes me feel like a failure. My thighs are covered in scars which made me feel disgusting. I had some bad ones on my wrist but I had them covered with a tattoo. I still feel gross and damaged.

The man who raped me as a young teen reached out to me last week, begging forgiveness. He went on about how he had grown as a person, how he had accepted what he did and the last part of ""his recovery"" was for me to forgive him.

I told him to take a long walk off a short pier, that he was scum and I hoped he could ""recover from sodomising me til I bled.""

That interaction drained me completely.

I get these feelings of being overwhelmed. I'm constantly exhausted, both emotionally and physically.

I'm frightened of myself. I swing between feeling overrun with emotions or else totally numb. I have happy dreams where I find out I am going to die or else get into an accident.

Some days I feel almost electric with how on edge and tense I am. I've started to get panicky and last week during an unpleasant interaction with my partner (through text, while I was in work, because he never discusses issues in person) I got unbearably hot, light-headed and short of breath, to the point where a colleague slapped on the air con and made me sit out the back with a cool drink. He thought it was cos of the heat. 

At the moment I don't know if this heaviness is anxiety, which I've never been diagnosed with, or else my old friend depression flaring up in a new and scary way. 

I hate everything about who I am. I don't like to look at myself, either when washing or when doing makeup. I use a tiny pocket mirror to throw eyeshadow on because I just cannot bear to see what I am. 

The big thing I'm fighting right now is my old ED rearing up again. It's not even a conscious thing. I'm nervous and upset so I don't eat cos I'll throw it up if I do. I just see no point in eating and wasting good food if there's a chance I'll get sick later. I AM eating, just to clarify, just irregularly, which is actually ok as I could definitely stand to lose some weight. I've piled it on recently and the comments from my partner made me realise just how much I've put on.

I do not like myself. Physically, personality, I'm not a very nice person. I have some lovely friends but this shit is ridiculous and I cannot pass this on to them. I have been very guilty in the past of venting to friends and making them feel used, I am trying so hard not to do that again, especially since they have their own stuff going on. One in particular is a fantastic guy who is going through a rough time right now. I'm trying to make the effort and focus on him and not slip into my old habit of venting to him, or indeed my other friends.

But that's where I am right now. 
Currently in work, actively avoiding the mirror anytime I go to the bathroom, dreading pissing off my SO somehow.

TLDR: got the big black dog howling in my head, needed to rant."
598,I can’t take it anymore,"So I just want to vent,I’m sorry for bothering anyone,just to get this out of the way I’m a 14 year old male and I’ve been really really depressed lately,I honestly want to give up,nothing is fun anymore,video games aren’t fun,my friends aren’t fun,life isn’t fun I just can’t take it everything feels like a burden and that I’m just ruining it for everyone I don’t mean to be like this I don’t mean to be how I am I’m sorry.i recently was diagnosed with adhd and ocd so now I take meds. on top of that my pet died and she really meant a lot to me,I’ve also been dealing with CSA(child sexual abuse) almost all my life and I haven’t told anyone anything about it,everything is just one after another I don’t get any time to relax without feeling like I don’t belong here I don’t want to be seen as weak but at this point it seems like it’s my time.  I’m really sorry I rant a lot and I don’t want to make anyone bored by reading for to long so I tried to make it shorter,I’m really sorry I just wanted to know if it’s even worth it anymore"
599,i’m afraid of getting an official diagnosis,"i’m 21m and i’ve had a really rough day today outta nowhere and i feel like i should give therapy another try (about six months ago i stopped going after having bad experiences, being given super basic, unhelpful advice, getting passed around, ect). i’ve spoken to a psychiatrist before but i never actually got a proper diagnosis and i know that’s important for treatment. my problem is though, that i really want to permanently move to a different country soon (i live in australia now, i’m thinking canada maybe but i’m not 100% yet) and i’m worried that if i have a diagnosed mental illness on record that it’ll impede my chances of getting a visa approved. i also have no idea what i want to do for a career yet either so i don’t want to end up restricting myself in that regard either in case i end up wanting to work in a field where they don’t accept people with mental illness.

i’m really lost and i don’t know what to do right now, i don’t have a support system at all and i don’t want to need help from anyone but after today i think i need to at least try something different because i just feel so shitty."
600,I don’t know what’s happening to me,"For most of my life I’ve had this thing happen fairly frequently to me where I totally lose all sense of reality and connection with the world around me when I become stressed. My thinking during these moments becomes panicked rapidly firing fragments of embarrassing and painful memories of times where I felt like a complete outcast to people around me. Such as times where I was bullied or made some stupid mistakes. After enough time in this crazy state I start questioning everything about my identity, how horrible of a person i am, if I’m a complete fraud in whatever I’m pursuing and every time without fail feel like shell of a human being by the time my thinking starts to return back to normal by eating way too much of sleeping. It feels as though I’m completely numbed out and retreated into myself. This has slowly been happening more and more throughout my life and at its current state during this pandemic I basically live in my head all day with maybe a couple hours when I force myself go out and do something to get some sort of temporary relief from it. Over the years I think it has ultimately instilled in me a belief that there’s something pretty wrong with me with no real idea of what it is or how to go about fixing it. I’ve been to multiple therapists about these feelings to see if there might be some diagnosis that could possibly put me on track to some kind of recovery but the only “diagnosis” they’ve given me is low confidence. I haven’t done anything long term in my 21 years but play video games and it’s starting to feel pretty damn pointless and depressing to keep trying to pursue things and pick up any responsibilities only to face these constant self defeating identity crises whenever I do. I’m terrified I’m going to be like this my whole life and end up homeless or something because of it. Can anyone relate to this? Am I way too emotional? I know this is a lot. I feel like it’s making me crazy though and could really use some perspective and insight on all this. Any help would be awesome"

607,Mother from hell,"Looking back my(19f) mom(39F) was emotionally and verbally abusive and could even be physically abusive. I wish I had known that then, but to this day that pain still hurts, that all that pain came from my mom. We have a better relationship now as long as we don't spend too much time together its not a bad relationship. But I still remember so much abuse and I dont think i could ever forgive her for that. Its like I closed off from her and never opened up to her again after she went too far. 

My mom has always been a bit hurtful when she talked to me as a kid but after my parents got divorced, she was even worse and thats when she got more physical. During that time she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and she later told me her doctor thought she might be bipolar, she never told me if she was or not. My mom started lying during that time. No matter what I did I could never be the perfect daughter and she told me it was my fault,  I remember trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. She would embarrass me to family and friends and would make up stories of how bad I was being to get attention from others, even if it wasn't true. I would take care of my siblings and help make food for them and clean and she still would lie. 

I remember this one time where she was mad at me and she told me to get out of the house and she had my little brother and sister shouting at me, to get out of the house too. To this day when I think about it, it still makes me cry. I dont understand how a mother could make her daughter feel like that? 

The first time she got physical with me she grabbed me by my coat and shoved me. When I asked her why she did that she said ""you pushed me i never touched you!"" 

Another time on a disneyland trip when I was sixteen, I was talking to my then boyfriend on the phone I'm in the hotel bathroom. My mom told me to get out of the bathroom so I did and went outside to talk, she came out and yelled at me while on the phone. I hadn't done anything wrong so why she followed me out to yell? I dont know. I was embarrassed because the boyfriend on the phone heard my mom scream at me to get off the phone and come back inside. I ended the phone call quickly, I walk back into the room and didn't say a word to her, she tried to talk to me but i was really annoyed and didn't want to talk to her I snap at her a ""what?""She takes my phone out of my hands and said I wasn't getting it back and physically hit me. I snaped and hit her back. And it turned into a big altercation, my aunt and uncle got involved and my cousins saw and I took off because I couldn't deal with my mom and the police were called to bring me back. It was hard not having my phone and why I was so upset when she took it away, my mom verbally abused me the whole trip and I felt like my boyfriend was the only person I could talk to while I was stuck on that ""vacation"" or aka trip from hell. 

My mom told the story that she asked me to come back into the room, i came back angry and i assaulted her. No one believed my side of the story. Every chance my mom got to bring attention to herself and make me look bad she did. It turns out she wanted me back in the room so I could watch my siblings while she went to a cassino with my aunt and uncle. I was the live in babysitter. She used me as her punching bag and nobody said anything about it! Not my aunt or uncle but automatically took her side. Its like she purposely pushed me to the edge so I looked like the crazy one. She would tell me to leave the house I would and then the cops would be called to look for me as a ""run away"" after she told me to leave the house. 

She once had a neighbor come over who was a police officer and she started crying in front of him she told him I got physical with her. Which wasn't true she  punched and grabed me and I'd only get physical to get away from her. He then told me ""why are you doing this to your mom? Do you like seeing her cry?""  I felt so powerless, like i was going insane. I was basically blamed for everything.

If i ever dared tell her how I felt she would say I was ""being manipulative"" or ""playing the victim."" 
She also told me that because she was my mom she could hit me but because she was my mom I  could never ever hit her. She was abused as a kid and she would tell me ""my mom would beat the crap out of me, but because she was my mother I would never hit her back.   ?? 

Even to this day she'll say that I acted crazy and i was so awful. Without acknowledging anything she did. Although her mental health is better I don't trust her and never will be super close with her like I was before my parents got divorced. I just dont know how to handle my feelings. She damaged my self esteem and im still scared to cry infront of people or open up because im worried they'll think im being manipulative or playing the victim. Even by myself I feel bad for crying or being upset. 

I just want to know im not crazy because all those years she made me feel like I was the messed up one. 

Has anyone gone through something like this? How do you deal with it?"

609,Life feels boring,"You go to bed. You sleep for eh, 2-4 hours. You wake up, you try to go back to sleep for the next hour, you know you aren't going to though. You pick up your phone, scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. You can't even tell the difference between them anymore. You think that you should go back to sleep. You don't. You never do. You stay up for the next 3 or 4 hours. It's 4 in the morning. You put on some music to try to help you fall asleep. You end up crying for the next hour because the music triggered something. You fall asleep soon after you're done crying. You wake up pretty early. You're still tired. So you go back to sleep. You wake up, surprise, it's noon. You feel like shit and all you want to do is sleep the day away. But you can't. You have things to do. You get out of bed and go to work out. Not because it makes you happy. But because you'll feel like shit if you don't. When you see the numbers go up on that scale you get such terrible anxiety. So you starve yourself just in case. You waste your days away playing video games that you fucking hate. Why? It used to make you happy. Why doesn't it anymore? Why doesn't anything make you feel happy anymore? Why does life feel so mundane? You see a therapist once a week but that just makes you feel like another crazy person in a sea of fucked up people. Then you go home and repeat the cycle. Every fucking day. You may have those rare days of being happy. But they don't last. You see things that should make you happy but you see them and feel nothing. People you used to love don't feel the same. Everything feels so played out. So boring. The whole world is covered in a hazy filter of gray that never leaves. What you would give to feel something. You would kill to even for a second feel that pure happiness and bliss of being alive."

I don’t really have any support system, no family and only one friend who I speak to maybe once a month. I don’t want to tell her about it though, because she already had to support me after a suicide attempt last year and I don’t want to put her through anything like that again or make her worry, especially when they’re just thoughts, not something I’m planning on acting on. I also worry that she thinks I’m pathetic enough as it is and I don’t want to keep seeming like I’m always needing help from her, especially since we aren’t even that close anymore.

618,What do I do about my best friend judging me for taking medication,"
Hey guys 
Just wanted to get some advice on how to deal with this situation.

I was with a friend this weekend and she made a few comments that really have rubbed me up the wrong way. I was diagnosed   6 years ago with bipolar type 2 so not like they don’t know... 

1. Comment on how she “would rather eat healthy and exercise than be reliant on meds,” after I mention something annoying about a side effect (VERY TOXIC thing to say to someone w/ bipolar imo) 

2. When I rejected doing LSD at my friends birthday when camping (something they all know I can’t do lol) she came and sat out with me and tried to tell me that it’s not as bad as I think it will be, insinuating I’m over reacting, and when I told her to google lithium and LSD and to tell me what it says, she replied with “yeah I know you have all the science and stuff but ...”

3. Then when I went to go to bed due to being tired due to taking my meds that normally make me sleepy, she tried to say that it was an excuse and that they don’t really make me tired ?? 

However she followed up the last two comments with something along the lines of “i hope we can support you ect ect...” but honestly I just zoned out because I couldn’t believe one of my closest friends was outwardly making comments like this. 

This has made me not really  want to speak to her anymore, if this is her view of mental illness. However am I being too brutual? Should I sit down and talk to her?  What do I say? I haven’t got a lot of friends so I don’t want to cut her off if I’m just being too sensitive 

Thanks!"

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

623,Spiraling Down,"On top of all the things in my life that has been making me unstable, I just found out that one of the guys I dated in 2017 passed away in May. I was in utter shock - still am. I tried checking on his friends' and family's socials but none of them posted about what happened. I guess, at this point it's best not to know. He was a good man even though we didn't work and the relationship was a bit toxic because we can't meet in the middle. He was one of the few men I've met that was actually good to me.

My heart hurts a little more now. I am going to disappear now, I'm so tired. I can't stand all of this anymore. I would say I wish I was still on therapy and medication if it actually worked 🙃"
624,Child trauma,"Is it possible that watching a man get his head cut off would cause psychological trauma to a child?  I was around 10 when I saw a reporter get his head cut off online.  I was shocked, but I think this may have contributed to being a normal weight boy to the next year being really fat.  I also feel it was around that time I lost a bit of spark for life I had.  I got bullied and I never had the carefree joy I had. 

I may have gained weight due to puberty, and the resulting bullying from being fat and subsequent loss of some joy in life may have not been due to watching that, but I'm wondering what you think. 

I have some anxiety that I'm trying to point out why I may have.  It may be due to the severe acne I had in high school and being embarrassed, or the bullying I experienced, or because I watched the video.  It may be a combo of everything.  What do you all think"
625,Does anybody seemly have a on and off switch for their emotions?,I don’t know if I’ve just been hurt so many times that I can just turn them off now. I was just crying arguing and I just turned them off? I can stop myself from caring scarily easy. Soon as the emotions start to come back I can just get rid of them again. Is this a thing? How comes I can do this
626,"Long time listener, first time caller.",[removed]
627,How do I explain to social worker - for someone else I manage to do things but for myself I really struggle?,"Okay so let me try to explain it’s weird.

If I need to go to X place for some reason to do with myself or generally. Then my anxiety makes it really really hard and near impossible.
But if I needed to go to X for someone else with a valid reason - like to pick them up (as they don’t know the area / visiting) OR they need me to get medicine or something for them... Then it’s much easier although not perfectly easy and my anxiety doesn’t override my ability to *function enough to help..?

But again, if I needed to go there for myself I would really really struggle to leave the house to do that same thing.


Does that make sense?

An example being: If I needed to put the rubbish out I’d have really bad anxiety and it would mostly prevent me from doing it. 
But if I needed to go outside for someone else I would manage to do it without too much anxiety and definitely not crippling anxiety that I become stuck inside?

628,I am struggling to deal with animal abuse.,"I love animals. Especially dogs. I also harbour the hate of an old god who was thrown from his throne and receives no more sacrifice.  


When I hear about animal abuse, anywhere from someone kicking a dog to fucking torture cults I well up with unbelievable anger followed usually by tears. Because I want to help, but I don't know how, it's especially frustrating. I feel sometimes if you put the person responsible in front of me during one of these fits I would kill them. I have a deep and profound sense of justice and empathy, but this doesn't extend one bit to people like this. I have nothing but contempt for whatever it is they are. I want nothing more than to see one as afraid and broken as they make the animals they torment. The eye for an eye mentality extends to nothing else in my life but this.  


I'd also like to say this extends to child abusers, though what spurred this post was animal abuse so that's my main focus in my mind right now. I am struggling to deal with the anger. Just recently I have been in emotional pain for 3 days over seeing one of the worst things I've ever had the misfortune to see. I've signed up for therapy because I know I need it to learn to cope with this, but the NHS is very slow, especially now.  


How do I cope, knowing this shit is going on in the world? Knowing that I can't do anything because I don't know the people responsible? Knowing how weak they are that they need to exert their 'power' on things that can't defend themselves, but there's nothing I can do about it? It's driving me to tears. Animals, kids, kidnapped people, the vulnerable. They don't deserve this. If only they were with me I could keep them safer. And I can't do anything. I feel like a fraud for caring so much but doing nothing.  


This has turned into a bit of a vent. But I really could use some coping advice."

630,is it annoying for someone to not be selfless?,"as a person with mental health issues and a really bad childhood, my only form of self expression is talking about myself,? all i tend to do is talk about my dyed hair and occasionally an interest. i’ve been left by multiple people and all they’ve told me is that i’m selfish and only talk about myself. 
i didn’t have a really good childhood and was put down every chance possible so its hard for me to develop interests and have deep conversations. so most people tell me to shut up ? i really put all i have into friendships and i try my best to make something interesting but wouldn’t you think having a friend thats talking about themself after a struggle you’d be excited to hear ? maybe i just had bad friends but this still happens to me and i don’t know what to do. i really do my best. what do y’all think ?"
631,I hate myself tbh,"I have so much to say that I can't be bothered to type it. There's something wrong with me but I don't want to go to my family because it's awkward. All I do is over think 24/7, and I'm constantly occupied with these thoughts. Every time I'm not doing something to distract myself, I just over think. I beat myself up over these memories and whatever else in thinking about. I constantly want to confess about things I've done but I'm afraid that people will either think I'm a bad person, I'm acting strange or that I'm just being dramatic. I actually can't stand this anymore tbh, I need to go back to school so I can get my mind off things but that's two weeks away. I actually feel stuck in my own head. Does anyone know what's happened to me?? Maybe I am just being over the top, and it's just lockdown that's made me like this, and if that's the case I apologise for wasting your time reading this. Hope you have a nice day :)"
632,"I'm not accustomed to English, but I'll try to do my best at explaining my situation."," I(16m) am a Korean 10th grader student who seems okay on the outside, but I feel empty nowadays. After being bullied by friends on 6th grade, I kinda lost belief on my fellow schoolmates, and started to feel very stressed to talk with strangers, assuming they have very ill intentions to me. So I started to slowly get accustomed to the English Internet as my hideout.

 As a result, I became too distant w/ normal people to start a conversation with strangers. Also I think I barely became mature, and I feel unmotivated by nearly everything. I'm not finishing the homework that I should do, and I'm not doing the extra studying that I should do to improve my grades. Am I playing games that I enjoy or doing my hobby? No. I'm not playing rhythm games that I used to enjoy months ago, and I'm not practicing to draw anime that I feel attracted to now. I'm not improving my health either; **I just sit on my damn phone and watch YouTube that I don't really enjoy too much.**

 What I might possibly guess is that I don't want to think about anything. When faced to life problems about my future(e.x.) ""What's your dream?"") I get REALLY pissed off and become extremely toxic. I feel like I'm doing everything wrong despite the fact that I'm not feeling the urge or guts of harming myself. I'm not using SNS to communicate w/ my friends anymore by my own will. I have the urge not pay attention to life. I just feel nothing. Yet what I want is to have a hobby that I like and be productive like when I was in elementary school, how contradictionary.

I can't feel my mother or my friends' love to me anymore despite the fact that they still love me equally. I hope I can return to my normal life of studying and having hobbies instead of not desiring anything and feeling so void about it.

TL/DR: How do I try to feel interest about something even on the situation on losing hopes and interest on everything and starting to feel void? 

This is the first time to ever post something like this in the internet. I feel really sorry to all the desperate persons on this subreddit by possibly reducing the counselor's reach, or for the possibility that I might be on the wrong sub, or that I might be giving not enough information."

634,Should I end my life. That's all I can do,"All I have is toxic people around me. I had a toxic father (mentally, emotionally and financially abusive to an extent you can't even imagine). He used to beat the shit out of my mom which kinda impacted me. But he's no more. Now I realize that even my mother is toxic. She's ranting all the time. Talking shit about everyone which I just hate. I want to focus on the non-existent positives in my life but she won't let that happen. She keeps on reminding me how shitty my dad was and how shitty other people around me are when in reality she is no less than others. Friends? I'm a hardcore introvert, so I just have one close friend. Friend would be a wrong term actually. Just one known person I shared stuff with. But even she's no less than others. She disrespects me, now that she knows how messed up I'm. Her family invites me to their home so that they can gossip about my life and trust me it sucks. I confided in her and I all got is her making fun of my vulnerabilities. Whatever I share with her, she shares the same with her family. Her family knows everything about my life because she passes everything that I share with her to them. 
All in all, I'm a fucked up person. I was in the most toxic relationship you can ever imagine a few years back. He was as abusive as my dad. So after moving on, I didn't have the courage to even think of a relationship. 

Professional life is as fucked up as my personal life. It's been 2.5 years that I'm not working, so I don't earn a penny. I can't finance my needs. Can't do stuff that makes me happy because I don't earn. 

There's a lot more to talk about but who cares. 
A fucked up 
Personal life 
Love life 
Family life 
Professional life 
And guess what? Despite all this people expect me to be happy all the time. To act as if nothing's going wrong and to accept that I'm the bad person in my story when in reality, I'm not. 

Would it not be wise to put an end to all of it for once and for all? To end this misery because it doesn't seem to end before I die? All that comes to my mind is negative thoughts. I feel depressed and anxious all the time. Can't sleep at night. Can't focus on anything good even if it's non-existent. I feel so pathetic."
635,Therapist doesn't want to give advice/guidance,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a handful of bad therapists in the past for severe depression/PTSD during childhood, but finally i took the dive in late  adulthood to try and reach out to get a therapist. I finally landed one, male, who seems genuinely friendly and cool about talking about my problems without jumping to conclusions/standing me up/pressuring me for information. Hooray!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem: I'm pretty sure I'm on the spectrum, and have serious trouble trying to figure out HOW to solve my problems. For instance, there are days when severe depression sneaks up OUT OF NOWHERE and I go from really happy to a crying mess for at least \~hour. There are also anger issues I would absolutely LOVE to know how to handle, but that is the problem. I literally don't KNOW why I feel these things and I don't KNOW how I can solve them.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day when I talked to him, I casually asked if he could offer guidance and or/advice on what I could do (since, up till that point, it's just been me spilling my problems to him and him saying things like ""That must have been hard to deal with"" etc.) and he pretty much shut me down at once, saying that 'it isn't his style of his work' or something like that. I've been pretty bummed/anxious ever since that day. My question is, are all therapists like this? Are they now allowed to give guidance/advice on how to handle certain emotions? I just wanted to ask him how to not focus on all the negative in my life, because like I said I literally don't know. But now I am at a loss. I don't know how to handle my emotions, and now I know that with therapy, I can only spill my emotions and not have any knowledge on how to solve the problem, so it is an endless cycle. Is this a loss cause?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for any advice given!"
636,Should I be concerned for myself?,"I know the question seems really stupid. But recently I have had a decrease in appetite and have lost a fair bit of weight. I am living off 4-6 hours sleep because I dread waking up in the morning and starting a new day. 
I have become really absent-minded and forgetful to the point of randomly repeating sentences without even realising, or thinking I have done things I haven't. I dissociate a lot. I just live in this weird state, almost like a trance where I feel or maybe even convince myself it isnt real or that it is all just a dream. I get light headed and even see stars. My hands get shaky sometimes. 
My dermatillomania suddenly picked up after weeks of being free. I have tinnitus that randomly comes and goes (I had ear troubles for awhile though I know stress can cause it too). I just feel worn out and tired all the time. 

But the worst thing of all, is I can't cry anymore. I will feel so empty and upset. My throat will ache but there are just no tears. I know it sounds so stupid but I want to cry, I almost need to. But it just isnt there anymore. But what scares me even more is I can smile. I can only smile. But I don't want to."
637,I am 1 month free of all forms of self-harm today!,"I feel kinda bad for celebrating because my self-harm was never too extreme but honestly I am so proud of myself for making it this far, honestly I don't think I would have been able to if it wasn't for all of the support I got from my newly found friends that basically just adopted me when I needed it the most, I owe this success to them for sure."

639,Should I be worried,"My mental health has never been good but always somewhat manageable. Lately it’s been going downhill slowly, and I think it’s reached a new level of low recently followed by me doing drugs. The past three days have felt like a dream to me, I can’t really remember them properly but I’m also having trouble remember things from further past, I remember events but the timeline feels really distorted in my head, for example last week feels like it’s happened years ago etc. On top of this I keep getting these episodes where I get really bad tunnel vision and can’t distinguish between reality and my thoughts, for example I keep convincing myself my boyfriend hates me and is cheating on me and I keep breaking up with him then taking it back which is unfair on him I know, but in the moment I feel like something takes over my thoughts and I can’t tell what’s real. I also started to feel suicidal again yesterday because I’ve convinced myself everything was so awful in my life when that’s just not the case, it’s really scaring me because I lose control of my thoughts and actions at least a few times a day and I don’t know how to calm myself down. I feel so many things but mainly confusion, another thing that I’ve been feeling which sounds strange, is this feeling of loneliness but not the way I usually feel it, it reminds me of the way I used to feel when I was younger, I just cry uncontrollably and I can’t calm myself down because I feel like I need someone to be there with me, I just feel like a child that’s been abandoned and is crying for help, it’s really scary because there’s nothing I can do to stop any of this, it just takes over. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do?"

642,Cause of the pain inside me,"I just remembered that when my dad was young his mum hit him in the head with a two by four. And somehow that damaged DNA got passed onto me. Could that be the cause of my depression/anxiety and negativity? 

I've tried to figure out why I'm like this. I've also done things in my life that probably made it worse. And there is a photo of me when I was young in kindergarten where I have a painful sad look on my face. I am holding hands with other children. I think I was sick or something. I don't know why I have that sad look. I do know that feeling is still inside me to this day. I've asked my mum why but she says she doesn't know. I sense that she's not telling me the complete truth.
Also I don't really like people. I've been sheltered most of my life. And I've kept to myself as much as possible. I think it has something to do with what happened in that photo. But since I have no memory of it, or I've blacked it out I don't know what I've buried. And I'm scared to find out."

 one of the reasons for my depression is that i was sexually assaulted when i was 16. but i don’t want to tell my therapist/ doctor because i am scared that he will tell my parents about it because it’s kind of a big deal. and i don’t want my parents to know just yet. i’m not ready to tell them even tho i’m 19 now. 

that’s the reason why i don’t want to see a therapist.

Next year is supposed to be a stressfull year for me. I'm running low on funds, so I HAVE to finish my failed courses this year at uni or else I'm forced financially to leave after 3 years. All my friends are more worried for me about this than myself. I have great supportive friends, I can talk about everything with them. But lately I just can't bring anything up. Sometimes I freeze up during social interactions and I don't contribute to the conversation at alI. I'm not socially inept, but I can only act as a social person for a couple hours before I'm drained. The last year my social 'battery' has been declining. Sometimes I don't even want to talk to my best friends anymore.

I'm a 22 year old in a wealthy western country who attends a business university. I'm privileged to just be born on this side of the Earth here and I have no right to complain.  I bought and read a lot of mental health and self-help books and I know what I'm supposed to do. But still I can't see myself following up self-made schedules consistently. I'll just relapse and lose motivation again like always. I'm in such a fucking loser mentality. I have no future goals, because I just can't envision my future self. Every lifegoal I would think of right now would just feel fake and dishonest. I'm not thinking about suicide, but sometimes I wish I had an option to just 'erase' myself."
651,"I fell in love with a guy with autism, psychopathic tendencies, and misanthropic features. How can I be with him?","This is the story. Some time ago I found these beautiful drawings of beheaded girls on an art discord server, I really liked them, I even felt some kind of attraction, so I decided to start a conversation with the artist. I found out this guy was from the US (I'm a girl from Mexico), he was 5 years older than me and had really well-developed fetishes, the first thing I noticed was how smart he was, how his mind was the most special mind I had ever known.  Everything was kind of normal until we started trusting more and more in each other, he admitted he had **autism**, which I really didn't mind, the problem was his **cruelty tendencies** and his **problems when he had to follow the rules**, he had never been in a relationship and he had **no social interaction** with no one but me and his other discord friends. Then, more **racist and genophobic** features appeared, **radical opinions, aggressive and destructive** thoughts against others, and most of all the **egocentric and narcissist** comments he made all the time, I fed his narcissism with compliments and admiration I really felt, and the snowball began to grow. After a few days, he confessed he liked me and loved me, and he had never felt that before, I do love him and like him too, but I think he's manipulating my mind because it seems like all he wants in the world is himself. Every day I try to be nice to him, and some days he's also very nice to me, but suddenly he changes and he rejects all my help and even my compliments. 

I also have my problems too, it's very difficult to help him while I have serious mental issues. From my severe social anxiety, depression, and self-harm to my eating disorder, and my record of being in abusive relationships.

He calls himself ""misanthropic"", and clearly has a **lack of empathy**, I haven't found something that can help me know more about all these features he has. I want to know, **what do you think? What should I do? Is autism related to psychopathic and misanthropic features? Does he really like me or is he just trying to use me?**  

He wants to meet me in the US, **Should I go?**

654,How can people watch shows like Snowpiercer?,"I'm not even sure if this is were to post it, but I honestly hope someone has dealt with this and has tips. 

Please let me know if I should delete this post. If You know a better subreddit for this, I'll be thankful if You tell me it. 

It doesn't matter if it's Snowpiercer or any other show or film that shows human injustice. I can't watch them.  I know that it's fiction, but it hurts. I can't understand such a severe lack of empathy. Whenever a show/film portrays people being inhumane (cruel to other humans or animals because they're rich, or because of some other reasons that aren't logical (like abuse) - I cannot physically handle it. 

It makes me anxious, uncomfortable, angry, sad. I cannot control these emotions. I end up sulking and feeling even worse and worse. I know this isn't really just fiction because people act like that in real life too. Even in kids shows when they portray someone being mistreated (usually because they're different) find it difficult to watch. 

I always keep asking myself ""why are people like this?"". I have this issue in general which is why I avoid any news, so I wouldn't have to deal with anything negative that makes me realise that every issue we have is because of ""us"" (some of us just lacking empathy and not viewing others as equal). 

How does one deal with these thoughts? If not in real life, how does one at least enjoy a piece of fiction without feeling miserable, without the physical pain that such things bring? I can't disconnect the fiction from the fact that it's also a reality just in a different context. Heck, I can't even watch comedies, because the ""funny"" scenes are just generally uncomfortable and feels like everything could be avoided if people just talked instead of making fun of someone (most comedies I've seen like to use second-hand embarrassment a lot). 

I know those shows are good. I just can't stomach them. 

Does anyone have tips? Or guesses why the hell I feel this way? Or maybe a suggestion for a book to read? I really want to at least learn how it would be possible to manage such feelings, because right now I feel like a small child whenever faced with such things in media. I can't handle myself. And everything ends up spilling over to every other aspect of my life then, affecting my relationships with others, because my suffering (if I can call it that)  from fiction (and similar events in real life) isn't understood by others."

I heard some knocking but I wasn't really sure if it was for my apartment due to a double door.  I didn't answer the door, but I saw the ambulance turn the emergency lights off and leave with the car.  I'm pretty sure it was for me bc I told someone I wanted to kill myself.  But I'm glad that all the lights were off and I didn't answer the door.  I am still free."
656,How do Coexist with a Difficult Coworker,"How does one coexist peacefully with a difficult coworker? 

I have a coworker who is both mentally and emotionally taxing to be around. Her behavior embodies the “**angry (*****ghetto*****) black woman**” stereotype. I work in a small office, so avoiding her is impossible.

 Despite others complaining about her (*including management*), I’m the only person in the office who actively opposes her. As a reference, she was originally hired in the customer service position, however, they had to reassign her due to her mannerisms making our company come off as unprofessional. Also, our positions mandate that we must interact, and so this only builds the negative tension between us. 

I’m not looking to show her abundant kindness since this seems to feed her ego and implies that her behavior is not only tolerable but condoned (*as witnessed by my manager tolerating her the most*). I’m decent if not indifferent toward her, however, I’m looking to establish peace of mind for myself more than putting on a façade to make her feel as though I tolerate her toxic behavior in any way."
657,Is is just me or... anyone else struggle really hard with this too... work / anxiety,"So I been struggling for the longest time... 

I just canceled work today, thankfully the manager was understanding. And I asked someone to fill in for me.

People can call it lazy or whatever, for just not being able to understand how it is.

Working gives me terrible anxiety, some days I manage fine. But I would literally have to spend hours in my head mentally preparing. 

And even before the day comes... I just kinda have this edge of the seat anticipation. Just knowing it’s around the corner and just filled with instant anxiety and dread.

Lately with everything going on in my life (not so much the covid thing for me the isolation is kind of the usual stuff normally have to go through on a day to day basis, it’s getting to be too much. I don’t even know, how to get help or get evaluated for getting help. Or some government support?

Money has always been an issue.

Family situation is pretty garbage. Not as in pretty, like flowers pretty (of course that was a joke... trying to lighten the mood over a really serious situation... as a way of coping? I don’t even know honestly...)

Went to a lot of abuse physical, mental, emotional, verbal, gaslighting growing up, and I never had anyone to ever to really ever turn to.

People and socializing gives me anxiety, socially awkward... more so now than ever... never knowing if what they’re saying is what they actually mean it. If it’s sincere or genuine.

Never been able to make friends, really :/ like zero luck... it’s like I’m (censored) cursed of something? Every time I do something happens or never works out... just a nervous wreck at this point. I don’t ever do anything to try and insult them, or be mean...

Most of the time really 99.5% of the time it’s just one sided... and other people are also falling apart sooo... fun my life...

I’m just a nervous wreck at this point. And at the verge of just imploding... (some people I normally talk to, I just don’t want to be a burden / liability...) back in the past I was fine I could keep it all to myself, I don’t tell anyone anything... but now I fall apart so easily. It sucks... to come apart, and be unhinged... 

Then there are people who avoid it, or are distant... pretend their ok... sooo what now...

It makes conversation just that much harder, back in the bulk of my preschool/kindergarten - college days... I would just say “I’m fine...” then to just “I don’t know...” I don’t know how I feel... or rather... I’d rather not try to think about it because... in my head I’m screaming and repeatedly hear my brain telling me, “It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, this hurts.... this hurts... I want to die, I want to die, I want to die...”

There’s just so much I want to do, But I look at my life and where I’m at and I just don’t know how to get there or the means to get to where I want to go/be. I’m tired of life keeps pushing and beating me down... 

Things one way or another never working out... so what gives, does it just come down to a fact that some people will always have it worse than others? Sure, I am more than a billion to the billionth power sure that there are others have it worse, who’s life is much more horrible and worse going for it than mine... but, I know, it could always be worse..."
658,I’m pretty sure people can read my thoughts ?,It’s just hard to think and focus because I’m very sure people are reading my mind.

660,"Let your light shine out! It is there, I promise!","From 4th grade to about the time I was 20, I fell into a very deep depression. I was overweight, bullied, made poor grades, never dated, felt like a disappointment to those I loved, and frankly didn't have much will to live. I thank God there was a light deep down inside me that always wanted to be that better person. When I went to college, I had the same ill mindset, but something changed. When a new roommate, busted into my life and didn't take no for an answer. I declined his advances to befriend me dozens of times, and one day, he just didn't take no for an answer. He picked my up from in front of my computer game, and walked me out the door while still sitting on my chair. It was at this moment, I realized that my life had value. This at the time ""stranger"", had no reason to show me this kind of affection. But he did, and changed my life. While I will never completely get that voice out of my head, I know now how to fight it!"
661,Numbness after extreme stress,"My husband and I moved in 2017 and 2018 for his career. I'm an attorney, so it was 2 bar exams in 2 years. On top, the second move was 3,000 miles from any of my support systems. I quit 2 jobs I loved to land at something tolerable, which I recently had to quit because I couldn't take it anymore.

6 weeks before the move, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. We hurried up and planned our wedding while I was sitting for the bar, which was HORROR. My husband didn't step up until way after I needed him, and I didn't want the wedding anyway. 

10 days after our wedding my FIL had open heart surgery, so my husband and I got 2 days together before his family NEEDED him to be home for 2 weeks. The whole time his uncle had been dying of cancer (he died in march) and his mom was depressed and leaning on him. Then we moved to another apartment locally and had Christmas with my family (probably my dad's last). Then COVID. We had to cancel the actual honeymoon we planned for May. It was going to be our first break in 2 years that was longer than a weekend.

This is all while trying to figure out how to live together and manage our life together. My husband really resisted the transition. So for close to a year I did everything at home while he worked out that he had to take his own trash out and I was not a maid.

I broke last July from the stress and ended up in the hospital. Then nothing changed. This July I was close. I quit my job and my husband said we needed go take a honeymoon. It was awful. Just a comedy of stressful errors. So much so that we ended up getting 3/4 of our money back for the whole trip. We ended up spending it in a pool house in the dessert in August while the landlord did mold remediation on our rental.

I'm just toast. I can't feel close to or connected to anyone. I feel the pain when my husband is absent because I love him, but I don't get the relief when he's here. It's like my heart just snapped shut shortly after we moved (he refused to buy me an engagement ring, which after all id done hurt me really deeply and made me feel totally unimportant, especially because I asked for something WAY below what we could have afforded. Now I don't care about the jewelry, but the fact that he refused still hurts bad).

He also didn't want to put in effort in helping us settle and make friends. I was WFH for the first 8 months after the move. So I was super isolated. He was coming down from his grad program and wouldn't do things with me. We have lived here for 2 years, and made a total of 2 friends because he went from being super social to never leaving the sofa.

I just want to have fun and feel happy. I just want to feel positive feelings. I'm so numb."
662,Anyone else live in a continuous Dissociative state?,"I feel like I've been in a dissociative state for all, if not most of my life. Never connecting with the world, looking in from the outside. Constantly having random spouts of amnesia. A distorted sense of reality. All the good stuff that goes along with it. Mostly, feeling like the main character of the Truman show.

Anyone else feel this way or have suggestions? From what I can surmise, this likely stems from various traumas in my childhood/life and I've always wanted to get therapy/counseling but besides all the petty excuses I can muster, it's most likely that I'm scared."

665,Dealing with suicidal thoughts and life and death,"tw: suicidal attempt

So I was honestly never going to post anything like this but now I really feel like I have to share my experience.  I apologise for the long post and if my formatting is messy-I just hope maybe this could somehow help anyone with these issues. Sorry if it doesn't. Perhaps it'll enlighten you at least.

One of the main burdening thoughts that I have is about my privilege. I have a home, financial support, healthcare, education and generally good living standards. Problem is I'd rather be dead. So I'm missing out on the chemicals in my brain I guess, which kinda sucks because that means I'm still privileged but also not-in a sense that I want to die. And so every day I tell myself ""why not me"" as in ""why can't I have {disease} instead? why can't I trade my life with someone else out there who is living in a worse (physical) state/enviroonment who may have so many dreams and aspirations in life that they will not get to achieve when I **literally do not.** To this day I still can not find a purpose for my life that isn't for anyone else. But I've overcome this. (more on it later)

As a teenager, my generation constantly makes jokes about the idea of death (me included, though I try less to these days-it comes naturally still), whether as a coping mechanism or whatever else. Now I've never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness but my whole life has been this exponential growth of me wanting to die. For many reasons but ultimately because I feel like the life I was living was never for **me** personally (like I'm a robot (?) for society/family/humanity). 

These two factors (generational and personal) eventually lead up to my what I call 'casual' attempt of suicide a few months ago. Only recently (last December), did I begin to seek treatment for these feelings. As the days, weeks, months progressed I felt like my medication was starting to 'wear off' and I was making no progress at all with my psychotherapy despite being told multiple times that I was. One day, I just woke up and told myself ""yep this is it. This is the day to die."" out of **nowhere**. I didn't even think much of it. So I planned everything. The time, technique. Did research on the best ways and other morbid stuff I don't think I should expand on. 

The important point is I **didn't think much of it**. I was like let's just do it. ""You've always *accepted* the idea of death anyways so."" that's why. The idea of dying just seemed like another thing I could do. ""The pain won't go away so just end it all and pain will stop."" I guess perhaps my brain was just thinking logically: how can I stop this suffering? Like I said I felt as if all my other options were failing, so my mind just went straight to the last resort. I carried on the rest of the day as usual. Watched videos on Youtube and whatnot. It's really messed up as I look back at it.

When I attempted it, I panicked immediately. Suddenly, my brain was shouting at me ""what on Earth are you doing?!"" and idk how to really explain it but my life and the people in my life suddenly just appeared and flashed in my mind, as if my brain was pulling out every good memory or part or reason of my life to keep living. But even more so, I knew that I wouldn't die. I messed up the attempt and therefore panicked for those two reasons. For not being able to die and for wanting to keep living.

Now, I am in a better state. My life (mainly academic which has been 90% of my life's worth) is still in pieces and I've been neglecting my responsibilities around it but at least death doesn't pop up in my mind anymore every day. I still have thoughts of ""It would still be better if I was dead"" but I don't think I'll act on it again, though I'm not sure.

What I want to share is this new view I've had recently. **Why not me?** Why am I not in this bad living situation instead of this other person? Really, it does suck, but we don't get to choose our lives. We don't and it's taken me a long long time to accept this fact. We just have to deal with the situation we were born in. So what I've come to is **live for the others who can't**. At least until you can live for yourself. I know it's unfair that we have this whole life ahead of us even though we don't want it. Consequently, you gain this guilt and burden you for it. But we can't choose our situation and that's just life. As mentioned earlier, I still cannot find a purpose for my life. My outlook on humanity as a whole is pessimistic (Though I say realistic) and I'm sure there are other people who feel the same way. It may not be the best solution but it's helped me largely with my stubborn mind. I can't find a reason for me to stay alive so I'm living for all those people who were not able to. I don't know how many other people out there deal with the same 'why not me' issue mindset as I do but I hope maybe I could help out someone? 

I would like to say I am not in anyway qualified to give proper scientific advice but this is more of a last ditch attempt reasoning that helped me out when nothing else could change my outlook. Thanks for reading guys \^-\^"

667,Did my ex (19f) break up with me because of her insecurity/anxiety?,"I need some advice about my ex. This is a long read but its an interesting situation and i would love different perspectives

I think my ex broke up with me because of her anxiety/insecurity? (This is a long post but i would love advice)

Hello everyone, i need some advice about my ex. A little context though- we have both struggled with anxiety however i have more or less overcame mine. She struggled with it the whole relationship.

Because ive experienced it before i never gave her a hard time about it or anything- i was always supportive. Id skip classes if she was having anxiety attacks just to go to her apartment and be with her. She also struggled with thinking she was never good enough for me. One time she tried to break up with me but i was there with her and helped her realize that i loved her for her- despite the things she was insecure about. It didnt help that her mother flat out told her i was too good for her...

So now to the breakup- we were together a year, but sadly a few months ago we had to transition to a ldr- which was tough but we made it work. A week before the breakuo i actually surprised her, drove 4 hours to her house and she was INCREDIBLY happy. She had no idea, it was a great weekend. But a week later she called me at 2:30am and said she couldnt be with me, she said she had a “gut feeling”. The next day i tried to talk to her about it, and managed to get that we had different goals for our future. This would totally make sense for a breakup- except we didnt have different goals? We both discussed marriage in the future, wanting a big family, living arrangements etc, even pets. We had a true connection and always talked about the future. 

Well ive given her the past month and i havent reached out. But like i said this cane our of the blue- and as her friends and family have found out multiple of them have contacted me asking what happened- or telling me that they had nonidea what happened either. And well her best friend called me yesterday and said that the reason she broke up with me was because she didnt think i would be happy with her long term, and she thought se was just leading me on (we are very different but we have discussed our future and we have the same goals) so i just dont understand why she suddenly decided i wouldnt be happy with her. I suppose its possible she just fell out of love with me and is using this as an excuse? Or is it possible that her anxiety got the better of her?

However i would like advice about what to do. I love her dearly and i know she loves me. Weve had a healthy, great relationship for a year (prior to a month ago)  and now she has moved back to college. How should i ask her to meet up without stressing her out? I would love to get back together, and i would forgive her for doing this. And at the very least it would help to get closure if she had just fallen out of love with me. I just dont know how to handle the situation. Weve been having no contact since the breakup. 

Sorry for such a long read! But i would love advice from other people that struggle with anxiety or insecurity because im slightly biased to the situation."
668,It really annoys me when people mock your mental illness in private. Then pretend to be an advocate in public.,"I cannot count the amount of times that I get into discussions with people who think that a good argument is using your mental health conditions against me. Asking about my medications and asking if I'm having a manic episode, just because I may not agree with what they are saying. Its ignorant and rude, it bothers me so much."
669,"The war zone in my head, intrusive thoughts or ????","Hoping I’m not alone, not sure if normal, or if it’s anxiety, ocd, bipolar or combination but here it is....

4 years ago my father was misdiagnosed with a stroke in the ER, found out it was actually MS...
That triggered “intrusive thoughts” for me but I dealt with something similar 6 years prior (2010) when my ex wife overdosed on pills while 6 months Oregon, then 2 months after my daughter was born but admitted into NICU for opiate withdrawal...
She was in there for 3 weeks. My first child, I went through things in my head that I never thought possible. I wasn’t sure if this little girl was going to make it, I also wanted to end my wife’s life for not giving up the habit and putting this innocent little girl through this.
My ex ended up getting clean but 4 months later we split up cause things didn’t work out. My daughter had her share of medical issues as expected.
At 5 months old she dropped my daughter on her head into concrete and fractured her skull at a “state supervised visit” while outside on the sidewalk walking.
The amount of homicidal thoughts I had were very extreme towards my ex wife. That was the last time she was allowed near my daughter (that was 9 years ago)
So let’s just say my “intrusive thoughts” were ramped while my daughter was in the ER, I kept picturing in my head my daughter not making it or all these crazy thoughts even though DR said she would heal just fine. I had a scenario in my head of the DR telling me something different and how I would react (in my head) and how I would deal with the situation at hand with my ex, even though it was already said my daughter would be ok....

Now back to my father...
Ever since his diagnosis of MS I have these vivid thoughts of him passing away (mind you, my father been best friends past 30 years, past 5 years he lived on my property and still very close)
I picture how his funeral would be, what songs would play, how I would be in a drastic state of mind....
I have same thoughts that I’m going to get a medical diagnosis from my dr’s dr that is life threatening, same as with me.
All 3 of us have a good amount of medical issues but nothing that has been told is life threatening but my thoughts make it much worse then it is.
Daily I wake up having thoughts of death (not suicide) but one of us passing for any amount of reasons or incidents.
I even play out in my head how it affects me and how if my daughter did pass that I wouldn’t be able to go on in life but I never plan if Zi would actually take my life but that I just couldn’t go on if that ever happened.
I picture how my fathers death would affect me and how it would destroy me and be hard to be the parent I need to be.

I think these are called “intrusive thoughts”??

I even picture or “wonder” how others would feel or what they would say about me (good or bad) if Zi ever passed from normal reasons, natural death or some type illness.
I’m also always thinking the worst when I have abnormal lab work, same with my daughters blood work...

Is this anxiety?? PTSD, ocd??

I been living with this for years and the only break my mind gets from this shit show is right after I smoke some weed right before bed. That 20 min is my “free time” and escape from reality.

674,No faith in myself...need a few kind words,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for at least 10 years now...probably longer just undiagnosed. I was also diagnosed with adult ADHD a couple of years ago. I had mostly learned to manage these things without medications but around a year ago I just hit a wall.

I was working in advertising for 4 years at this point and hated it. The job wasn't a good fit and the people at the company weren't my kind of people. I was offered another position at another advertising agency in May 2019. I accepted, gave my notice, and then was given a competitive counteroffer. I ultimately decided to stay at the awful job for more money. I thought if I made more money I could leave sooner. 

In the year I stayed after that, I really struggled. I was almost fired and really lost a lot of my self confidence. I think almost leaving and then not leaving was pretty hard on me. I stopped caring and wasn't doing a good job.

I tried to talk to my fiancé about the depression I could feel creeping in around the edges but he didn't understand and didn't know what to say.

Finally, a year after almost leaving that job, I left it for real. I enrolled in our local university to get a second bachelor's degree in economics. It's not going well. I have really been struggling to stay on task and as a result I have failed 2 of my 4 classes. Luckily this won't put me behind to graduate but needless to say my fiancé is pretty upset.

He's not even that upset about the wasted tuition money....just the lack of focus and care taken with this term. The whole reason I left a well paying job was to seek a career better suited for me and that might pay even more. Right now, I think he questions if I even want to do this.

I don't blame him for feeling this way. I know I want to do it, but I am struggling to be motivated right now. I don't think he understands why this failure isn't motivating me further. It's just making me sad. It's been a long time since I've had a win professionally. I know I need to get back on my antidepressants. I'm just disappointed. I had kind of been telling myself I was doing okay without them... and clearly I am not.

No need for advice (unless you have some tips for staying focus and pushing through the disappointment). Some words of encouragement would be appreciated though. Deep down, I know I can do this. I just need to find a way to snap out of the fog and stay on task."

Now, I dont know when this started but Ive noticed it getting worse recently. Lately, whenever I get into a Stressful situation I start ""panicking"" and start feeling extremely overwhelmed and thinking how I am not worth anything and how I dont matter. (Its hard putting that feeling into words tbh.) I feel extremely alone and vulnerable, and think Ill never achieve anything. The weird thing is though, that this is not a permanent state it only lasts 10-60minutes and after that I cool down and it starts getting better real fast, however thoses moments are really starting to effect me even after they are over and I dont know what to really do, since it has gotten worse recently. There were few times where I turned to self harm, but nothing really major though it helped with the stress a lot. 

I cant pinpoint an exact cause for these ""episodes"" though stress from school and unfinished tasks (Like that one application that needed to be done months ago.) However I also had those episodes during summer break when I didnt have anything to do really.
My parents are supportive and care about me, even though during my weird episodes I feel like no one does I know they do. I also have a great group of friends who I know I can trust but I lack the courage to tell anyone in real life.

I’ve recently been thinking maybe there’s something else that was missed/not noticed in the original appointment when I was 15. I’ve been running with the idea that I only have anxiety/depression so that’s what I’ve told all my doctors. I’m thinking about getting a psychological assessment to get another opinion from another doctor but I’m curious if it seems like a waste of time. I just feel like nothing is working. If anyone has any experience with this, I’d really appreciate the help."
685,Why don't I eat enough?,"I (17M) am way too skinny. I don't have an eating disorder, because I want to gain weight. I just don't have much of an appetite, and I think I'm very spoilt/lazy when it comes to what foods I do eat. Like a child, I don't eat all of my dinner/never start my dinner and only make foods that can be prepared quickly. My sister does this too, one reason she goes to her boyfriends house is because he makes a lunch for her.

I also get distracted from eating often, like I know I should eat something but someone is talking. I think it's because before I eat a food, I kinda imagine it as more disgusting then it is, and then I actively don't want to eat it even though I know it tastes good. When I'm hungry, I go for junk food. Usually I don't have any at home, so I look around and see nothing that appeals to me. Then I eat food later when I become hungry again and need to eat something. It doesn't help that my house constantly runs out of food.

Like I know who I am and I know who I should be, but I feel... muted? 

It feels like I have an aversion to anything even remotely related to sex or violence in any way, I feel like my emotions aren’t... working right? Like I know HOW I’m supposed to feel about certain things, but I just don’t. I have memories of before, when my emotions felt genuine. When I felt connections with other people, but now I don’t, or at least, it feels muted. Like I know I’m still in here, I’m just.. faint. 

It feels as though nothing is real, like I’m dissociating. Like I’m not a person. My school therapist said it’s because I’m dealing with depersonalization. 

A month ago I wasn’t like this. A month ago i was fine. Not perfect by any means. But I knew who I was, I knew what I liked, I knew what I didn’t like, I had strong opinions, was very emotional, hell I even had a crush and fantasies about falling in love and stuff like that. I was creative, I had stories in my head that I wanted to share, a good sense of humor, but now that’s all gone. Or at least muted."

688,"My anxiety and insecurity will ruin my relationship, please help...","My boyfriend is literally the sweetest, kindest, most patient person on the planet. He deserves the absolute best.

I am just a mess of insecurity. My last relationship was super unhealthy and I got put down by my parents a lot, so I've struggled with my self-image and also expressing my feelings in a healthy way. Like I switch emotions so quickly, and they usually feel so out of my control. 

Despite being together for a long time now, I constantly need to be reassured by my bf that he still loves me and finds me attractive. I cry at the slightest thing, I overreact incredibly easily. I always apologize and try to do better, but in the heat of the moment I can't seem to control my emotions at all. I just want to be calm and gentle and confident, not this perpetual mess that needs constant care and support.

My self-image has improved to the point where I no longer have disordered food tendencies, but the insecurity is just exhausting. I feel paranoid and distrustful towards someone who has given me no reason to be. I get stuck in cycles of insecurity, lashing out, feeling guilty, and then feeling insecure even more because acting like psycho is pretty undesirable. 

I live in Ontario. Idk how therapy works or how to access it during covid. I need some advice at how I can better control my emotions and become more confident before I ruin something wonderful."
689,"A new day, or a new nightmare?","Something happened to me today and I really need to talk about it, which is why I'm here.  I woke up this morning and turned on the TV to watch the news like I do every morning, only to see more stuff about the protests.  Something was different this morning, though.  I don't know if it's because my kids are going back to school soon amid this pandemic, if it's the hard liquor I drank last night until I passed out, or if I finally reached a threshold of tolerance with these analogs I've been experimenting with for the last few months.  Whatever it was, I thought, something felt very different.

Just as I grabbed some Kahlua to put in my coffee, I heard a loud, booming voice coming from the sky.  I shit you not.  I looked up, out the window, thinking maybe somebody was pruning the trees outside near the power lines but nobody was there.  I paused for a second but didn't think a lof of it.  Moments later I heard it again, clear as day.  That's when it occurred to me: it was from God.  It had to have to been.  It said to me, and I swear: ""Lewis, this is about YOU.  YOU specifically.""  My eyes got wide and a wave of panic washed over me.  I took a deep breath and replied, saying gently: ""What's about me, God?""  Time seemed to stand still.  It could have been microseconds or hours that passed and I wouldn't have been able to tell.  But, He did eventually reply, saying: ""These protests, these riots, these people in the streets, they're here because of YOU.""  The ""YOU"" he spoke seemed to shake the ground, the windows, the walls, as if a large truck had driven by in that moment.  I again asked: ""What do you mean, God"" but heard nothing after that.  Just then the ringing and thumping in my skull stopped and things went very, very quiet.  Quieter than I've ever experienced in my life.  I couldn't hear the TV or the cars outside, I couldn't even hear my own breathing or heart beating.  It was as though I was in a place of complete stillness.  No thoughts, no hangover, just complete emptiness.  

I thought maybe I'd had a stroke or something but as the moment passed it occurred to me, a realization more apparent than any understanding I'd ever come to before: He's right, this is God's truth.  When I'm truly honest with myself, my friends and I have done so many terrible things to people.  Some unwittingly, but some very intentionally, hurting them unnecessarily to satisfy our own egos.  Seriously abusing our positions and connections in law enforcement and government, often times on behalf of the status quo.  We're not the heroes I thought we were, we're the demons in this saga, the cowards.  And, further: God knows it.

I went to the bathroom and quietly began to cry.  I just couldn't take the profound sorrow that came over me.  Not a feeling all too unfamiliar to me.  I pulled the Marion County issued pistol from my holster, touching it's coldness to my lips, nibbling gently on the tip like I'd done so many other mornings.  But, this time it felt real.  I really wanted to do it.  Then the thought of my kids left without a father came into my head.  My psychotic, crackhead ex wife being left to fend for herself with no support.  Even if I am a monster I can't just leave my kids without a dad, can I?  In that moment I put the gun down and began writing my thoughts.  This story.  The more I wrote the more the pain left me, leaving me with a singular thought: the pen is mightier than the sword.

But, what was I to do?  Where was I to go from here?  Then it hit me: I can just quit.  It's just a job.  The illusions of grandeur are all in my head.  The philosophy of honor, courage and warriordom were all just lies somebody told me, to manipulate me into being what they wanted me to be, to turn me into a slave for somebody else's agenda.  I don't have to continue this legacy of terror like my father before me.  Hey! I could become a chef!  I CAN seriously decorate a cake!  I can cut hair!  Well, all I know how to do are buzz-cuts but I can learn!  Fuck, I could join the circus or even become a priest!  Well, maybe not that last one, maybe one of these new age cult deals.  But, I don't have to keep on living this nightmare or creating it for other people.  I can change, not just myself, but an entire branch of history going forward.

Anyways, what do you guys think?  What does it all mean?  Am I losing my mind?"
690,I was asked to start coming into the NYC office twice a week and immediately had a panic attack. Need advice.,"I’m an executive assistant for a nonprofit in NYC. Although my boss might think differently, I would not classify myself as an essential worker.(Quick thank you to those who are essential workers!)

Currently, I’ve been going into the office one day a week and working remotely the rest of the days. I’m diagnosed with GAD among other disorders... Going into the office involves a lengthy, fatigue-inducing commute as well as severe anxiety and fear of contracting COVID-19.

694,There Is Hope &amp; Light At The End Of The Tunnel," Hi Everyone!

I want to encourage everyone in the midst of a struggle or a tough season. I've been there. I can't tell you how many days I've spent crying at my husband's bedside due to his mental health issues wrecking our marriage. 

Keith and I have been married for 13 years. Throughout the marriage we have had experiences with inpatient and four intensive outpatient programs, thousand of counseling hours, medication trials, Ketamine infusions, multiple disorders, multiple job losses, two separations, a jail incident and more.  

Today, we are happily married despite living these daily struggles. It's not perfect. But it's progress. He sought treatment and I educated myself on his mental illness/conditions. 

I promise, the struggle is worth it. I told him, ""As long as you don't give up on yourself, I won't give up on you ever."" 

You CAN have a successful &amp; thriving marriage despite mental illness. Stay the course, get professional help, get plugged into a support network &amp; stay educated with your partner. 

Love,

Erin Ramachandran"
695,Creating an open resource,"Hi all,

I work as a therapist and am constantly running into the same issue of people not understanding why negative emotions come up and how to respond to them in a way that makes them get better rather than worse. I am creating a kind of how-to manual for them, introducing each emotion, what it's for, and the Dos and Don'ts. So far it includes mild, moderate, and severe sadness, anger, grief, envy, jealousy, and anxiety. I plan to add guilt, shame, and resentment. 

It's just a resource that I think everyone should have, it's nothing I will be selling at any point. No one has seen it yet so if you think it would be useful I can send you the word doc-- it's under 20 pages. If you want to tell me whether or not it's helpful to you I'd appreciate that and will send you the complete version when it's ready if you like. 

I know mental wellness is a slog sometimes but if you're on the journey you're doing great, keep going!"

The problem is that I am caught in all of this because my father is not young and I'm scared that one day he'll flip on her and get a heart attack or something.
Everytime they fight about something I get this weird feeling in my chest and stomach and all the will power I had untill that point just goes away.
Add all of this to the fact that we are quarantined for almost 6 months now, it's just too much...
On one side I'm with him and on the other I'm with her, she tries to hide stuff from him and he always tries to know what she does.
It comes from a place of care, I know that for a fact, but it doesn't help much when she yells at him and he yells back.
I know I need to get out of there, it will happen in a month or so, but I can't stay calm with the thought of me not being there to put out the fire that can burst over nothing.
It bothers me everyday and I have no idea what to do..
She's not willing to go to therapy (due to past bad experiences) and he doesn't have the money to go to therapy with my mom.
I tried everything to try and stay calm and handle their fights but I can't do that forever and I can't see my dad go through another break down like he had before when my sister came out.
I need to note that me and my parents play a huge role in the behavior of my sister, when she was younger we didn't treat her right, but that was a long time ago and we passed those times.
My sister also tries to make them mad on purpose, and I don't know if it's conscious or subconscious..

702,"Dad with brain damage, anxiety, and deep into conspiracy theories","Looking for advice. My dad (65 years old) has brain damage due to laser radiation from a few years ago on a tumor. The tumor is fine and not growing, but he has physical side effects and his mental health is really suffering. The brain damage has affected his hormones and his adrenal gland does not work properly causing his stress levels to stay elevated. He sees multiple doctors to try to control these hormones and side effects as best as possible, but it seems like these things will never be perfect. He has very high stress levels especially now with the pandemic (we live in the USA). He has dove deep into conspiracy theories and is very stressed about them and thinks he will die soon and needs to move. He stays up late watching YouTube videos that are very obviously conspiracy theory videos but he still thinks some are legit and gets really worked up about them. I think he is pretty much brainwashing himself every night watching these videos. He has had physical side effects from his elevated stress levels and it also has affected him financially as he buys gold or silver due to conspiracies and fear mongering about the world or economy coming to an end.

This has all negatively affected his relationships with his children, probably will affect his grandchildren (as they get older), and is affecting the quality of life of my mom who is unfortunately stuck in the house with him during this pandemic. She is stressed and anxious around him and also worried about him. My siblings and I are also worried about him. 

I really want him to see a mental health professional on top of his usual doctor's appointments. I think my mom should probably see somebody too to help her handle the situation better. He is now trying to convince her that they need to move before some world-changing event happens. He has been to a psychologist or counselor before, but was able to ""act normal"" and just told the counselor that he was there because ""his wife made him go"".

I really want to help him, but don't really know how. I want him to at least have someone to talk to about all this who can handle the complexities of mental health issues caused by brain damage. Any advice is welcome.

Thanks in advance!"
703,Should I Get Diagnosed?,"So throughout the years, I’ve always wondered if I’ve had an actual mental disorder. I’ve had friends, family, exes, and (for a while since she doesn’t do it anymore) even my current girlfriend tell me that I seem to have a plethora of mental disorders when I just act the way I do. Mood swings of bipolar, obsession with perfection like OCD, really bad lows that drain me and make me feel lost for months at a time like depression, and one that I get a lot is the attention span of ADHD. I discussed this with one of my exes years ago and she said it wasn’t smart to get diagnosed because if I did that, it’d be on my record, and since I’m only 20 (and was only 17 at that time) that could really affect my opportunities for further schooling, a day job, or even my one day career. I guess what I’m asking is: are there any downsides to being diagnosed? And if so, do those cons outweigh the pros? Would you recommend I get diagnosed?"
704,"Please help! Why am I so weird about kissing, and how to get over it??","Hello! I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this sort of thing, so let me know if there’s a better place for me to post it!

Let me give you some background:

SHORTER VERSION OF THE BACKGROUND FURTHER DOWN

I’m a 16 year old girl, and in May I started dating my girlfriend, also 16. We were already good friends and knew each other well so I’m generally pretty comfortable with her usually. In May, we were hanging out when she told me she liked me and I told her I liked her too and after talking a bit more she tried to kiss me (with consent) but I kind of freaked out and froze up and kinda dodged the kiss and she ended up just kinda kissing my cheek and it was so incredibly awkward and embarrassing but we laughed about it. But then, like 3 days later, before we could hang out again, she had to leave to go across the country with her family to their grandparent’s house in Minnesota. We’ve been texting and talking on the phone the whole time she’s been gone, but of course I haven’t seen her in person since.
Well, now she’s coming back on Wednesday. And one part of me is so excited, because I missed her and she’s awesome!!! But another part of me is actually dreading it because I know when we hang out we’ll probably try to kiss again and I really don’t know how I’ll act. I really hate that I can’t just be completely excited by seeing her the first time in over two months but this has been bothering me. The idea of kissing is just so weirdly foreign to me and doesn’t really sound very appealing and I really can’t wrap my head around how to act and kiss her back and stuff, and the idea of it all, of our mouths touching and stuff and me not knowing what to do makes me really anxious. I have a few things that I think could be causing this:

1. I’m asexual (or I currently identify as asexual, because I know since i’m still a teen I could grow out of it). I’m romantically attracted to people, but i’m not sexually attracted to anyone and I am not interested in sex at all. Since this is my first ever relationship, i’ve never really had the chance to explore exactly what i’m comfortable with. i’ve always been kind of clueless about how to kiss and it definitely doesn’t come naturally to me but i had always assumed that in the moment i’d figure it out and it would make sense. but i guess not? i know some asexuals don’t like kissing and some do, so maybe i also don’t like kissing? i really hope this isn’t the case but i’m afraid it is, because my gf is not asexual, she’s just gay so i’m worried about whether or not we can have a healthy relationship when she can’t kiss me or interact with me how she wants to. For the record, she knows that I am asexual so she at least understands that sex isnt on the table.

2. I have ADHD and I have been wondering if I might be on the autism spectrum because i’m pretty bad with social cues in general and a little weird about some forms of touch (i’m fine with hugging my friends and stuff and like holding their hands (platonically) but i really don’t like anyone touching my face, and i don’t like when my parents touch me) and sensory overload/overstimulation causes me to dissociate. But I don’t have all of the symptoms of autism so i’ve never been tested for that (i’m not trying to self-diagnose, just letting y’all know why i’m wondering about it, forgive me if i misrepresent something). for the adhd though, my gf also has it so that probably isn’t it?

3. a few other mental health issues over the years, my depression was pretty bad a couple years ago but it has improved since, and i think i could have some sort of anxiety disorder, and if that’s the case it might just be because i’m in an unfamiliar situation and i think first kisses are probably stress-inducing for most people, right??

4. I have issues with my perception of myself and i really really struggle to accept that i could be perceived as attractive or that anyone would want to kiss me or be in a relationship with me at all. i kind of perceive myself as gross so maybe it’s because i think it’s gross for me to act in a romantic way and generally just too weird for me to imagine

5. maybe it’s just because i’ve hardly had physical contact with anyone since march lol, the only contact i’ve had is my parents hugging me (against my wishes) and i’ve been socially distanced from my friends whenever we hang out, except for when i hung out with my gf, before we were dating, and even then it was just like, playing rock paper scissors or something like that where it was just our hands touching. so maybe i’m just unnacustomed to any sort of touching besides familial and that’s why it’s weird?

SHORTENED/SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

I’m a 16 year old girl, and a couple of months ago my then-crush tried to kiss me after we talked about how we liked each other, but i freaked out and froze up and almost kind of dodged it so it was a really awkward kiss on the cheek. then she left for two months and she’s coming back this week and i’m almost kind of dreading it (which i really hate because i missed her so much!!!) because i’m scared to kiss again. i really just can’t wrap my head around kissing and can’t imagine how to act at all, it just doesn’t make sense and thinking about it makes me super anxious.

possible reasons why:

1. i’m asexual, so i only have romantic attraction but not sexual attraction. maybe the sex-aversion extends to other forms of physical intimacy

2. i have adhd and have thought that there’s a chance i’m on the autism spectrum, so i’m generally bad with social cues and am weird about touching especially on my face/head.

3. depression and maybe anxiety so i could just be generally anxious about it

4. it’s really hard to perceive myself as attractive/desirable and i really just see myself as gross so imagining myself being romantic sounds kinda weird and gross and it’s hard to imagine

5. maybe it’s just because i’ve had very little physical contact with anyone in the past months because of quarantine

Alright that’s about it, please let me know what you think or refer me to other sources because i really like my girlfriend but i’m worried this will cause problems with us and i wish i could just kiss like a normal person!! i’m getting really stressed about this and i know there might not be a solution but idk, it would be nice to at least maybe figure out what’s going on so we can talk about it together. thank you so so so much!"

706,Are those onlike shrinks any good?,"I've seen ads for online therapy and stuff like that. Is that a legit thing? If so, can anyone recommend a good one? Been looking to get a psych eval, just to make sure everything is in order."
707,I Am Struggling with my Extremely Narcissistic Mother.,"Ok so this has been starting since last week. (I'm  Bipolar II with PTSD, ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder).

I was having a video session with my therapist and my mother was eavesdropping. Mind you, I'm in my early 20's and I find it to be a complete invasion of privacy. (She's even eavesdropped on me when I would have conversations with my father as well). Moving on though, she was listening in on my conversation with my therapist and I was talking about my problems with her. As soon as my session was over and I started to process, my mother swung open my door and snarled at me for talking about her in my session. Usually I'm chill and cam be patient with her but that day I was annoyed about her always telling me what I should and shouldn't talk about, that it turned into an argument.  

She said things about slapping me, biting off my finger, and really immature comments like me not being able to tell her what to do when I'm trying to tell her to not raise her voice at me or yell at me. So i got mad and called her a bitch and to leave. She tried to slap me but i ducked and basically had to push the door on her to get her out. She's basically at war with me and my brother because my brother and I love her but we both agree that she never likes to admit her wrongs, faults, gets defensive and acts fake around her friends and people besides us in general. Eventually we made up and everything was fine until today.

Today, everything started normally except for 15 minutes ago. I just decided to make some lemonade but I didn't have enough sugar. So i went to my neighbour's house to ask for some. She's a very nice lady and brings me baked goods and sometimes I share my cooking with her as well and we talk. I got the sugar, came back and finished the lemonade and went upstairs. I come back down and my mum said that she loved the lemonade and I told her that i had to go the neighbour's for sugar. My mother looked at me like i just killed someone in front of her. 

She gave me this speech about she isn't my friend and never ask her for anything, even though my mother already asked her to take her to the store to get some milk for something she was baking. So i brought the milk situation up, and she said that that was an emergency and that it was different. (Every situation about me vs. her is different to her because she does it). And when i tried to tell her that i disagree, and told her in the future that I might do it again, she got mad, put her hand in my face and stormed upstairs. 

I was livid because she disrespected me in my own house and blamed me for drinking a lot of juice when I went to visit her at hers, last Saturday. Nevermind that she and my brother and her husband live in that house full time; yet when I go there for one hour, me drinking maybe 2.5 glasses of juice is a problem. She and her husband kick me out sometimes from their house when her and i have a disagreement, but now she's in my house that I pay for and will not leave. Her reason? Because she is my mother and i cannot tell her what to do. 

Oh and she threw my past abusive relationship in my face and said that i deserved to get my ass beat because I was stupid. Something that made my previously diagnosed PTSD even worse. He almost killed me and put me in the hospital and my own mother tells me that i deserved it. 

So yeah... Would really appreciate some support.
Am i wrong for asking my neighbour for sugar??"
708,I don't deserve to be here,"I don't fucking deserve to live this live. I should be happy, I mean, I have everything and more to live a good live, but still. I don't have the right to be depressed all the time and have other mental issues. I should be gratefull and happy to be born in such a secure country, and family with enough money. I have no ground to stand on when it comes to my ""problems"". Other people have it by far worse than I have. I should just shut up, and suck it up like every goddamn time. I guess I'm too much of an asshole to do so.
I hope that I don't wake up anymore."

710,"Feeling heavy with the thought of winter ahead, and being far from S/O","Maybe this isn't the right place to post this. I read quickly through a few posts and saw that everyone seems to have longtime, serious issues. So sorry if this comes off as trivial and stupid. Maybe it's better for r/weather....

All day today I've been missing my boyfriend. We're doing long distance at the moment; nevermets. He's in Brazil, I'm in Ireland. We're both in high school. And it fucking hurts that I've no idea when I'll get to meet him, touch him, be with him. Nevertheless, I was powering through, telling myself that at least we get to video, etc. So while I've kind of been holding it together on that end, the weather changed today. Any British/Irish people, you know what winter is like here - constantly rain, low temperatures, no even heavy snow or anything that could specifically say ""storybook winter."" But just a seemingly endless period for seven months of the year where it's cold and dark and depressing. It's never bothered me that much, but we've had beautiful weather the past two weeks and it's clearly coming to an end. 

And for whatever reason, this has gotten to me. Add to it the missing-boyfriend aspect, and I want to just curl up and cry. I thrive in sunshine and the thought of spending the next several months in the cold and dark is exhausting and I just don't want to do it. I'm not the most sociable person and don't exactly have a friend group - one close friend, an exchange-student friend, the boyfriend, and that's it. Couple people I chat to online, but they're not close acquaintances. I'd never talk about this kind of thing with family members. I have nobody I really can express this to and I just need some advice on how not to break down and stop doing everything - schoolwork, learning, violin, etc. and how to keep going when it feels like the universe wants to keep me as far as possible from the person I love, and do it in a state of utter miserableness too. Please help."
711,My absolute worst living nightmare continues,"I posted this (https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i9t66c/update_autistic_blood_test_anxiety_literal_worst/) a while ago but I’m not sure if the automod removed it? 

The blood results have come back FINE. Absolutely NOTHING PHYSICAL IS WRONG. That was my worst fear because it means it is MY fault for letting my mental health get out of control and that’s it! There is no physical cause for any of my symptoms! I had another breakdown and slammed the doors to the car and house and screamed a lot at home. I am physically not in control but no hospitals will take me because I’m not suicidal. My therapist can’t see me for 3 more days.

However the doctors also want to put me on two medications, one to make me feel hungry more often (I am underweight) and a weird type of laxative to basically make my intestines cramp up all the time. I already have digestive cramps to begin with. This is not good because I just started a job and I cannot be too hungry to focus, having serious abdominal cramps and leaving to go to the restroom every 5 minutes, not to mention if I’m on a laxative that is as strong as they say, I won’t be absorbing enough nutrients and won’t gain the damn weight they need me to gain! Both of the meds also have a side effect of making me sleepy which is not good since I will be working late shifts. 

I might refuse to take these but I don’t know yet. They said if these meds don’t make me healthier they will have to do an endoscopy and I know I can’t emotionally handle that. This is just the worst case scenario, it actually exceeds the worst case scenario I could have possibly imagined"
712,Please help (OCD),"I have quit all compulsions but have “promises” (compulsions) from the past that I have to do a certain number of times over the next few days and then “I’ll be done”

Should I do it or not? In one way I’m like 

“It’s only a few more days for peace of mind”

But another part of me is like 

“This is going to morph and change / I’m perpetuating the OCD cycle”

What should I do?"
713,"Anyone else so hyper-aware of themselves (""hyperreflexive"") and their feelings that they aren't sure if they are batshit crazy or just ""creative,"" dramatic and extremely sensitive to their internal world?","Various doctors and psychologists over the years have diagnosed me (always tentatively and sometimes with reservation) with a myriad of illnesses over the years. There was never any doubt about the ADHD and the anxiety. But beyond that it was really a crapshoot. Severe depressive episodes, erratic behavior, even a prolonged paranoid delusion (never acted upon). 

Doctors disagreed with one another about diagnoses and medication. I was diagnosed first as Bipolar, and given mood stabilizers though I didn't have some of hallmark manic/hypomanic symptoms like a decreased need for sleep or increased confidence/grandiosity. Another doc thought it was PTSD, but almost none of the PTSD symptoms described my experiences I thought. Another thought it might be the beginning of schizophrenia (my mom thought this too). Yet another (highly respected, semi-famous doctor) believed that although I was clearly suffering a lot, I did not actually meet the criteria for any of these brain disorders, except for anxiety and ADHD. He wanted me to go off all of my meds, except anxiety meds as needed (Ativan) claiming that the trauma, chaos and abuse I experienced for so long, combined with my ""extreme"" sensitivity (he said I was what he called an HSP, ""highly sensitive person"") as well as my intelligence and education could sufficiently explain what I experiencing. He believed yoga, meditation and most importantly, finding a support system outside my family, to be the most important ""medicines"" for me. Deep down, I am inclined to believe him, as much as I wanted a ""real"" diagnosis.

Yet so many other doctors disagreed. It's all very confusing.

For reference, here are some of my behaviors: I was behaving erratically and obsessively. I was isolating. I became delusional at one point, paranoid mostly. I thought people were going to rape or kill me. I became a hypochondriac. I fell into deep depressive episodes and spent inordinate amounts of time fixated on certain obsessions and ruminations (like  reddit). Or sleeping all day and browsing reddit all night. I'd wander around at night listening to music and felt weird and sometimes special, sometimes miserable . I would check out (or steal) up to 20 books at a time on different arcane topics of interest. I'd leaf through them, intend to read them all but usually not be able to concentrate enough to read any of them, still I'd keep collecting these books. I would stay up all night writing poetry sometimes, or fantasizing. Some assignments I completely ignored. For  other assignment, I spent hours gathering and poring over outside research determined to create the most sophisticated and magnificently original argument even if no research was required and the paper was supposed to be quite short. I'd have 30 pages of notes scrawled on a legal pad in preparation for my paper but couldn't seem to actually begin writing. I received awards and glowing feedback from professors about my comments in class and the work I turned in, in between exasperated emails and low grades for extremely late, missing, or incomplete and fragmented assignments. My papers were almost never finished. Somehow I managed to still win a writing award every year. I was ashamed and self-loathing but grateful and exhilarated at the same time. Most of all, I felt like a rotten and despicable person and my self-loathing seeped into everything I did. I couldn't make eye contact and apologized incessantly. I felt worthless, even as a indulged in my favorite, most thrilling distractions and obsessions (sex, research, obsessions, wandering around listening to research, stalking my ""heros"" online).

I was secretive and afraid of my parents. I refused help from anyone and started to fail my classes. I took time off school (twice) and landed myself once in a psych ward.  It's been an uphill battle since then with lots of stops and starts. I'm in a better place but it's hard to be hopeful about the future. It's hard to not have a diagnosis I believe in. I don't know what to do sometimes."
714,Weird sick fantasies,"Ever since my boyfriend cheated on me a few months back, I have started having some weird fantasies. I had very few weird ones earlier, but these days they're pretty sick and disgust me once I'm done fantasizing. 

It started with me fantasizing him cheating on me. I still fantasize about it and masturbate to it. And now it's slowly growing into weirder ones. I masturbate to rape scenes in movies. 

The recent one disgusted me quite a bit. I fantasized about someone who'd abused me when I was a kid. I imagined they were dead and I was touching them before their final rites when I was alone with their body. This grossed me out way too much. Not sure what's wrong. I got over the episode otherwise and have moved on. But the fantasies have gotten so messed up. Not sure about the way to go ahead. Just ignore? Or do something about these?"
715,I’m probably just dumb or something but...,"Does anybody get contradictory thoughts and feelings? This sounds really stupid but, but for example, I feel like I want to do something and then I’ll enjoy it, but then suddenly I don’t want to do it. Or when I don’t want to do something, but I’ll do it anyways and turns out, hey I actually enjoyed it. Basically, I feel like I both hate and love the things that I do and I’m so confused and not sure what my brain really wants. I also felt this way in a relationship, but now it’s effecting my hobbies.

How do you deal with contradictory feelings? I try asking myself questions, but I still get confused."
716,Did I have a panic attack or was I just crying really hard?,"I finally went to the dentist after hellish pain that had gotten worse in just a few days and the doc told me my tooth had to be pulled out. I was okay with it. I just wanted the pain to stop. So I was given local anesthetic and – let me tell you beforehand, I've had it before and I've endured it fine – I couldn't stop the few tears from spilling. It was just water coming out of my eyes, but then something inside of me just snapped and I started crying. I was trying to pull myself together, but then I started to hyperventilate. All I remember is that I was shaking (my body was really tense) and breathing really loud and the doctor kept telling me that everything was okay. Meanwhile I was just trying to breathe and in my head I kept repeating 'breathe in.....breathe out'. 

I really don't know why it happened. I know that I'm really nervous when I have any kind of doctor's appointment, but it never got this bad."
717,Apathy,"A while ago one of my grandpa’s who I adored a lot passed away but I didn’t feel sad. In fact, I didn’t feel anything at all when I heard the news. I also purposely didn’t attend his funeral, because I wanted my last memory to be of him alive. What are your thoughts on this? Is there something wrong with me mentally?"
718,How do you trust people?,"Not sure if this is the right place for this but I am in need of advice. I have had trust issues for as long as I can remember stemming from just about everything you can imagine (bad parents and family, rough childhood, cheated on in relationships, lied to and stabbed in the back by friends etc.) this in combination with pretty bad anxiety (although I have improved over the years) and previous drug abusing issues has put a wall on my current relationship with my girlfriend. We have been together for about a year and every moment of it has been wonderful. However she has just recently moved across the country from me for schooling. I am struggling with this a lot as I can’t figure out how to put real trust in someone again. We’ve talked about it many times and I do believe that we both love eachother and just as I wouldn’t ever do anything to hurt her she wouldn’t to me. She tries everything to help calm me but I still have anxiety attacks over it daily now that she is away and is making new friends and hanging out with new guys. All I want to do is make it work but Im struggling greatly with it and Im not sure where to look for advice or what else to do. Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated."
719,brainwashed,"there's probably a better term for this but it's the first word that comes into mind. when I was a freshman in highschool i was at my lowest and my mom would just brush away anything i told her and she'd constantly tell me I'm mentally stable and healthy. because of her telling me this all the time, i ended up completely believing it. it made me feel lost and confused and i constantly judged myself because i felt like i was faking it. i started self-harming and just scarred my entire arm. my parents found out a year later when i took off my jacket and my teacher saw my (healed) scars. you wanna know what they said? they said i did it because it was a trend. my dad told me that maybe one of my friends was doing it and i decided to do it with her, and my mom said the same thing today. she told me I'm completely mentally stable and healthy. oh yeah, totally. i totally didn't butcher my arm because i felt like ending it all. i totally just did it because i wanted to live in long sleeves and never wear shorts. i totally did it so that i could never wear a swimsuit even though i love swimming. I'm completely healthy! looking at myself in the mirror and not recognizing who it is is totally healthy! feeling like my body's being controlled by something else and I'm just watching it happen is totally healthy! almost downing an entire bottle of advil because you were brushing off my problems as if they were dust caught on your coat is something every single stupid teenager does in this shitty world! there's no reason for me to see a therapist because I'm not a crazy person! there's no reason for me to compare myself to my sister even though you forced the things she was good at onto me and judged me for not being as good as her! of course not! I'm completely fine! wanting to get ran over by a car or get shot at point-blank range is something everyone feels! feeling like the only way it can stop is by dying is completely normal and every teenager ever goes through it! completely and utterly normal."
720,Is it possible that I permanently traumatized myself?,"Look at my previous posts mainly [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i6sa8v/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me_anymore_21_male/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) anything related to violence, death, or murder, as well as anything sexual, has started making me uncomfortable, sometimes to the point of panic, ever since I had that one panic attack. (Or maybe a bit before or after that event, it’s hard to say for sure). I’m hoping this is just a temporary thing and I can get back back to my life. But I feel like I’m either numb or panicking, with very little in between. I’ve been trying to just ignore it and go on with my life, but it’s hard. I keep having thoughts and memories to when I felt normal and I very much want to get back to that."
721,i want to cut everyone off,"i feel so selfish because i’ve been refused therapy for so long and i just want help so badly and no one cares about how i feel which is understandable because no one owes me that everyone has their own shit 
i just feel like such a burden and i’ve deleted all my social media now and i’ve been doing that a lot lately but i don’t want to redownload it"
722,How to support my husband with adjustment disorder?,"My husband has chronic adjustment disorder. I recently changed religion, triggering an episode. I have absolutely no idea how to support him in this, and h doesn't either. Does anyone have any advice? Suggesting he see a pastor or talk to trusted family members makes the anxiety worse, and I can't just not change religions. I'm fully at a loss"
723,I suddenly feel euphoric... music sounds like gold dust,"Okay, I’ve been out of a very dark, anxiety ridden place with touches of depression for about a week. I’m super proud of myself! I’ve also shedded a few pounds from eating healthily and stuff. I’m good at the moment. I don’t even like acknowledging the time where I was at my worst, so yeah... for now... let’s not mention her. But yeah. I’m just laying in bed with my ‘pods in and suddenly music is literally like liquid gold!! So cringe and dramatic I know, but I don’t know how to put it without understating. It’s crazy looking at how dramatic of a mind-set shift I’ve head - everything looks different! Colours more vibrant, more varied thoughts, can watch anything without the fear of it triggering me. I’m good. Hopefully this will be nice for someone to read who’s in the thick of their mental health crisis of whatever and ins-till some hope. When I was at my worse it felt like there was no escape, that I was falling through a bottomless-pit. Now I look at that person and I’m completely differentiated from them. Mind-set, completely different. I hope all the people who are reading this know that you’re not signed to a death sentence. Research and research. You’ll find your answers.

My best wishes to EVERYONE reading this, truly."
724,Mood swings and more,"Hey guys, I'm a 16 year old teenager from Poland. For around 1-2 years I've been experiencing some mental problems which make it difficult for me to stay happy. Despite achieving many scientific successes, having a loving girlfriend and mother, deep down I feel empty, filled by inner void, just simply unhappy. While at school I'm usually joyful, I laugh a lot and joke around with a smile on my face. However as soon as I get home, I return to the state of feeling depressed, apathetic. I'm almost constantly tired and lack vital energy despite sleeping quite well and being physically active. I've experienced lots of domestic abuse and even though I managed to get over it, the negative consequences still remain... I just do not know what is wrong with me. I don't want to commit suicide, but oftentimes I would rather simply not exist. I'm so tired of myself and everything else. Unhappy without a reason. Constantly stressed, easily irritated, impulsive, emotional, very sensitive. In my own eyes, depending on the moment, I can be great, intelligent, kind, and another day I might be worthless, pathetic, disgusting. Because of my unhappiness and stress I excessively masturbate and eat sweets. Even though these things give me quick pleasure, they make everything worse. Since a couple of weeks I've been also facing more mental breakdowns than usual, even for my own standards. Such small problems like my girlfriend not having time to talk with me can trigger a horrible reaction within me - I feel like my head is going to explode, I want to cry and intentionally hurt myself. I having had such a problem before and I'm confused. The worst thing is that I am unable to control myself because of how strong these emotions are. So strong, that I would just like to instantly fade away. During this reaction I am a very mean person, capable of saying terrible things. Once I calm down, regret hits me and, again, I feel worthless... I do not understand how my mind works and I want to finally get rid of my problems. I'm afraid that these are symptoms of a mental disorder (actually I sometimes think that I would want them to be, because then I would eventually understand myself and know, what to do). I tried talking to my mother about my emotions, however she told me that I am overly emotional and should get over it. I think that I should visit a psychiatrist but at the same time I'm too scared to talk to my mother about it. I want to be a happy and good person, but do not know where to start my road to improvement.

I'll appreciate any kind of support and advice from you. Thanks in advance."
725,Can anxious attachment and dismissive avoidant attachment couples ever be truly happy?,"What the title says.

I'm the anxious attachment and he's the dismissive avoidant. I feel like I never say anything right. I feel like I'm always losing when I'm trying to resolve an issue or express something. 

Can those two attachment styles ever work? Or will there always be tension and issues? Is there tips from anyone out there on how to cope with a partner like that and communicate better?"

I'm trying to get a sense of what might happen if I was to tell them. They might panic and do something which I don't want them to do. They could do even worse things which will make me regret telling them. 

So basically I don't know of I should tell them or not If anyone has had a similar experience or has some knowledge that they would be willing to share anything would be appreciated. Thanks"

729,My life is getting fucked left and right.,"I cant sleep and bc of this pandemic it really placed me on a halt in studying uni. 

Heck i dont even know what im going for in life as this point bc my country has the shittest wifi, education and health system. Even getting a psychiatrist is a LUXURY. my mental health hasnt been healthy since entering highschool. I know i need help but i cant simply afford it so a google online is my only help and also talking to a friend but even their health is just as bad as mine and it would be bad that im adding weight to their weight. 

When i say education here is shit also the financial system where students cant get a student loan and pay later, no. Its upfront spending thousands and students really cant balance school and work because even in uni you'd have to face at least from 7am til 5-6pm so you could get out of school only to study and vise versa while fucking adults would have the nerve to say we should manage our time. Everyone i know is suffering from education, family and life itself and my country isn't helping esp with the pandemic rn. My life is fucked left and right giving me no hope for my future and my dreams. I could only cry til my head bursts from the pain. There's no other ways i could do something to save myself from all this. I could only dream for a life that i wish i had with the privileges people in first world countries have. 

Thanks for listening. I may seem rude but im just tired from this mess and still trying to fight every passing day..."
730,Is it normal to experience physical pain while in recovery from Trauma or PTSD?,I’ve been working with a therapist for about 2 years now and am noticing every time we work through a huge trauma that happened I experience debilitating physical back pain a few days later.

734,I can't stop thinking about death,"Every time I'm not occupied with anything my mind reverts to thinking about my mother's death, father's death, afterlife, my own death, and my pets health. I've been getting these thoughts for 3 months and Everytime it happens is when I'm about to go to sleep since I'm not occupied, these thoughts get worse, today at 2 am I was about to dial 911 while tears were rolling down my eyes because I heard something in my living room, even thought it was my cats knocking over a pen."

I can't communicate with other people, because im self conscious of the very concept of communication.

736,I fucked up,"3-4 years ago I nearly died cause of an episode. I was lucky to survive it and I have permanent lung damage from it. I thought I was ok now and I had been since then, not a single slip up other than maybe a slight outburst. Then a girl from a group of friends asks me to talk online on a game, I was hesitant at first... because it was a change and I was comfortable with how I was but it was a group of online friends who all spoke in mic and I was just sorta left out in that sense. So I start talking to them and at first it's only this girl talking to me... and I start to really like her, nothing sexual, this girl is too young for me and I'm not a weirdo in that way. But I started getting weird again.. I thought this other guy whos been my friend for 2 years was tryna groom her, then she starts to think I'm a creep.. I send the stupidest messages I've sent in my life.. trying to prove to her I'm not and just making myself look worse... results in me getting blocked and deleted by her and only 1 guy still has me added on the games we play but I don't even dare talk to him now. Basically they said she thinks I'm a creep, the guy I called out hates me now and the other dude says he's lost all respect for me. All this only happened because I wasn't sleeping and because my mind was slipping again, I like these people and I said some nasty things, some creepy ass things looking at it now even if I didn't see it like that at the time and I don't even know what I'd say to them now... I'm literally a harmless person, I wouldn't do a thing to harm anyone, but I know how I came across..I miss them and it's still getting me down, this was a week or 2 ago, something like that. I'm so depressed about it because these are the people I would talk to most in my day and I was happy, I have other friends real life and online but I don't talk to them like I did these guys, I felt closer to them we would play games together every day. I ruined it. I have probably no way to fix it, I just have to forget them now and not contact that or I'l just make myself worse and it seriously hurts because I know I'm not the person I made them think I am."
737,Tips to get out of a major depression?,"I’ve been treatment resistant on medication for 14 months at this point. Failed 4 SSRI. 

A lot of my anxiety initially started due to a skin condition, and depression soon followed.

I’m to the point of not showering, going anywhere and neglecting my work. I just kind of piddle through the day, play video games for a few hours at night and sleep. 

My skin condition keeps me from exercising which is something I did regularly (marathon runner). I have cholinergic urticaria which is basically rashes and hives whenever I sweat. 

I have been in CBT for months. At this point I’m in a lot of physical pain daily, emotionally numb and mentally checked out. Life feels very pointless when only a year and a half ago I was living a great life and thriving. 

I see all the posts about eating well and exercising. I do eat well, but it hasn’t “helped” in the sense of lessening symptoms. Exercise is obviously my big challenge given my skin condition. 

What else can I do?"

740,Paranoia,"This was posted on a couple of Facebook groups by me earlier so had been edited 

Also other then the extreme paranoia I’m not experiencing anything else, no stress or anxiety, no physical symptoms so I have no idea what’s going on 


Good evening please don’t laugh at me

This is a post I posted in a group earlier so il edit it to make it more relevant 🙂 

I feel like I’m losing my mind with paranoia, I’m convinced people are following me in my car and watching me, since Thursday every time I’ve parked my car, a couple of minutes later someone’s pulled in front of me and then they just sit watching me, they also have dash cams which I know are normal but the one today looked like a proper camera, it freaked me out and I moved my car, in now convinced they’ve put a tracker on my car and I’ve booked it in the garage later to have it checked for one 🙄 edit I took it to the garage and he looked for a good 20 minutes and didn’t find anything, but told me if it’s not the car it could be my phone 

Other ones, I’ve been convinced for the last 2 weeks that I’m going to have a speeding and emissions ticket come through my door, it’s been 2 weeks and nothing 

Every time I go past the police I think their going to turn around and come after me, even though I’m doing nothing wrong and the cars all in order

Also when I’m half awake at night I feel like someone’s going to take my son whilst he’s asleep next to me, and then I can’t sleep because I’m scared he will get taken. 

And then yesterday I was supposed to sell my sons ride in car to this guy, we put the battery on charge overnight but it was to dead to charge, so I messaged him at 7am apologising that I couldn’t sell it to him, and didn’t hear anything he didn’t even read it, he was due to come at 11, 11 came and I heard someone pull on my drive, and get out, and I freaked out thinking it was this guy and he was coming for me, I went out there and it was just my partner coming back from his boat club 

What the hell is going on with me, I’m going mad, I’ve even reversed my car on the drive and installed a dash cam so if there is anyone dodgy they won’t come near my car 🙄🙄 I do have BPD (borderline personality disorder) so I’m wondering if it’s related to that, but I’ve been well for ages now and have never experienced this before, I called the Drs and a Dr is going to call me back after 1:30 which is in 15 minutes. Edit- I missed the drs call as I was driving to pick up my son and my phone doesn’t ring when I’m driving, he did leave a message though, with a number for me to call, which I will do tomorrow as it was gone 5 when I got home 

Has anyone ever experienced this? And found anything to help them? 

Thanks guys 🙂"

742,How do I learn to accept that things take time to change?,"I'm not where I want to be in my life, but I'm at least in a stable place where I, when the time is right, should be able to move on from, but my head want to move NOW, and the fact that I can't move right now is causing a lot of negative thoughts.

How do I learn to tell my head to wait, that the time and conditions to towards where I want to be isn't right, and avoid all the negatives thoughts?"
743,reaching out,"Hi, so I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a long time and for the first time I reached out to get help. Its a first step for me. I made appointments for anxiety and depression and for an ocd screening. Ocd is the main issue. I get a call on wednesday to talk to someone about my a&amp;d. I don’t know what to expect or what I’m gonna say though. I’m nervous"
744,How do you take the first step to finding a therapist?,"I need someone. I dont feel like myself ever anymore. I get happy often, but I don't even remember what actual joy feels like, or what it feels like to be content. I can't bring myself to do anything that makes me happy or feel fulfilled. I feel like i was worked to the bone ages ago, and now I'm reaching the marrow. (Not gonna lie, kinda proud of that line) 

But holy fuck. I need things to change. I moved back to my parents basement to save money which has become a nightmare. I'm fucking 26 with a midnight curfew, told that ill be kicked out if they find any sort of alcohol (fuck me if they find anything weed related), and was told I NEED to keep my bedroom door open if I have a girl over. I mean, Jesus christ. I'm twenty fucking six. I'm not going to fuck anyone in my parents house

Not to mention my mom (a trump supporter with very Christian values who thinks masks are useless. ) and i have opposite views, beliefs, and personalities that are like 2 cheese graters against each other. While my dad just sits and reads all the time. Only butting in to support my mom if things get too heated. 

I've got adhd which makes me feel like ill never be able to function as a normal adult. And makes it near impossible to get my thoughts into words that make sense. So arguing about anything is just a battle uphill in a storm, with boulders falling towards me. 

I've tried so many times to find a therapist. But every time I look it up on Google, i get overwhelmed by all the different places, and then get anxious about finding the right one. So I give up. Willpower isn't shit if you can stay focused long enough to finish a simple task. 

I'm just so fucking tired of everything and need to talk to someone who may be able to help. But I can't get past that wall thats stopping me."
745,Why am I this person?,"I am going to a rough time right now. I'm feeling like absolute shit, I can't find happiness in anything and I just push forward in my life that I hate right now.

I hate myself so much.. why am I even here if I nobody cares. Even my own boyfriend called me fat and thinks I'm not that hot anymore like 2 years ago..

I am so miserable mentally and physically and nobody helps me.
I'm so fucking ugly inside and outside."

I'm just a wreck, Idk what I'm doing with my life. I don't wanna self diagnose myself with depression but can't go to a doctor to get proper support

idk why I made this post, I just wanted to tell someone... I just need help I guess"

749,How do I avoid going back,"The last months of my(16m) final years of high school have been pure hell. Even though I got good grades and have a good life, I always thought I wasn't good enough. Each day I would worry and have anxious thoughts, what if it is just luck or chance? I don't work hard for anything I get in my life, what if one day my luck runs out and people see me for who I really am a lazy, anti social boring human? I used to cope with these feeling by listening to music constantly and wasting my time in front of a computer. 

It didn't feel like it at the moment but it was definitely a ""fake it till you make it"" kind of deal. Every day I woke sit down at my desk and not talk to anyone and try to be as invisible as I could as to not bother anyone with my nonsense. Needless to say I did not open up to anyone and I'm still afraid of doing so. Every day I had this pressure on me to meet the expectations of other, and what if in this essay I get a horrible grade and everyone makes fun of me? Will I even matter to anyone at that point?

And it just so happened that the quarantine started and suddenly with the online classes I had no expectations to meet, I had no one around but myself and it helped me a whole lot. Now I'm feeling great, but I'm very scared that if I return to this kind of environment these feeling will return and it wears me down completely. What should I do to prevent this? Are there any actions or practices I can preform? Thank you so much for reading, and any comment is highly appreciated."
750,Why do I not feel relief when I should?,"I have been noticing that recently, when something is really stressing me out for a period of time, and that one thing gets resolved, I still don’t feel relief. Instead of relief I tend to feel even more anxious or tense. 

Some recent examples:
I have been trying to sell my car for a few months now, it finally sold yesterday for the price I wanted to and I don’t feel relief. 

I came in contact with someone with coronavirus, I had been around my elderly parents before I knew I came in contacted with it. Once I found out I got tested and waited over a week for results, stressed out of my mind the whole time. When I got the negative result back, I still didn’t feel any relief. 

Can someone help me understand what is going on internally to why I don’t allow myself the feeling of relief when I should?"
751,is it okay to be selfish after an emotional breakdown?,i got out of a very dark space mentally and now i feel like focusing all my energy on myself and my recovery. i don't feel like interacting with my friends the way i used to. it's not that i want to distance myself from them but i only want to be present for me. is that a bad thing? do you think i should let them know to avoid any kind of misunderstanding?

753,Should I see a therapist for my social anxiety?,"For a bit of background: Mental health problems run in my family, my older brother is schizophrenic and I’ve been through traumatic events like his multiple attempted suicides. I’m not entirely sure I could just have anxiety or if it’s something else. 

So for all my life I’ve been shy, I’ve never been the one to raise my hand to answer a question in class- but when I had to speak aloud to this class I did fine from 5th through freshmen year (this is the year my brother attempted many times so I worry that this could be a result of that) Ever since whenever I give a presentation or even have to say “here” in class, my chest tightens, my hands get sweaty, and I sometimes shake. I freak out everytime. 

Recently, I’ve started xc and we’ve been doing some team bonding. I’m a senior now &amp; have been on the team the longest and am good friends with many of them. But when we did some icebreakers, I had the same “symptoms” I get during a presentation. But these people I know and trust and thought I was comfortable with.         During it, I’ve even drifted off in thought about how no one sees me &amp; they wish I wasn’t there... today I had to fight off tears thinking about how I should just quit. 

It’s so bad that we’re doing captain speeches soon and although it’s been the goal of mine for two years and I know I would get it, I’m thinking of not trying out for captain because the thought of giving a speech makes me feel sick. 

Are these signs I need mental health help? Any advice would help. Thank you in advance :))"
754,Staying positive in a negative household,"26 &amp; due to personal reasons Ive recently had to move back to my mothers house with my 5 month old daughter.  Its not an ideal situation the environment is miserable, my mother is very critical, negative, loves telling me how I did this that, and whatever next wrong, and how I “should have” do it everything turns into an argument and there no sense in having a heart to heart about anything because my mother is never wrong nor can she handle handle any type of emotional conversation . I’ve always had a rocky relationship with my mother but living here and dealing with it again idk what to do I’m trying my best to stay positive and not let the negative energy affect me but I can feel it slowly getting to me and I’m slipping into a depressive episode. And advice for keeping it together and focused so I can get myself and daughter out !?"
755,Music and mental health,"Hi,

I have never posted here but I have had my share of problems with my mind. 

Just over three years ago I started self harming (as well as other issues). It was my first year of college and I never went in to class. For a long period I drank too much and let my problems spiral and ended up spending two months regularly self-harming. It has been about a year since I last hurt myself intentionally. 

When I was first going through my problems and my issues started to manifest, I was listening to quite a specific set of songs. I won’t go into the genres as I don’t think that’s relevant. When I first sought out help I stopped listening to that music. It was almost like a soundtrack to one of the worst periods of my life (Sorry for sounding cheesy, but it’s the best way to explain it imo) and when I tried to listen to it again those bad feelings I had and scary thoughts crept back into my mind, so, I completely stopped listening to it. 

Recently, after about 2 and a half years, I have started to listen to some of those songs again. At first, the bad thoughts and feelings came back and I was able to deal with them. However, I am starting to notice some things in my mind that aren’t good and starting to worry me. I think I should probably start therapy again lol. 

I was wondering if people have any thoughts on this or have had a similar experience to me, and if so, how they dealt with it? I could be totally crazy but hey, it’s worth a shot. 

TIA"
756,Just venting about my childhood and not remembering my childhood&amp; stuff :/,"So growing up i had undiagnosed adhd. I literally couldn't tidy up my room and got screamed at a lot by my parents for it. My room was messy to the point you couldn't see the floor for months. Even if i wanted to tidy up, i couldn't. 

My parents tried every thing:
Screaming at me, shaming me, taking pictures and threatening to post them online, pretending to film me so i would tidy up,saying they'd tell my friends and family about it and more. They also got angry at me for crying or trying to defend myself when getting screamed at. I now feel very uncomfortable talking about my emotions and its very hard to do.
The worst was usually getting slapped or something along the lines.

My mom and i had a great relationship outside of it and we still have to this day.I still have trouble coming to her when i have a problem or want to tell her something that's bothering me. I have to work up the courage and mentally prepare to tell her for a long time before i even attempt to. My mom is the only one i talk about things with. I don't so that with my dad. 
My dad was emotionally unavailable and we have a REALLY awkward, distant relationship. I don't want to spend time with him. He's also not an amazing father. He makes fun of me, often let's out his emotions on us by getting angry at us anf and being annoyed and the most praise i get is a neutral ""good job"". He screamed at me though when i didn't get school stuff or got bad grades. In high school i was extremely scared to tell him about my grades since they werent good.even though he didn't scream anymore when they were bad. He also screams at me for doing shit like accidentally breaking stuff or other small things. He starts getting angry, screaming and saying things like ""you mess every thing up"" 

In middle school i was pretty suicidal and self harmed. I talked about it with my girlfriends since they were in the same situation as me. But both relationships ended after a while. I only told my closest friends this year even though i knew they were in the same situation and i had helped them with it a lot in the past years. I thought since my problems didn't seem as bad as theirs i shouldn't talk about it, they seemed so small and ridiculous. I also was afraid. 
I told my mom about the suicidal thoughts and selfharm recently and she just asked why i was suicidal and said she knew i selfharmed before. She had too in the past, everyone tries it once. She never mentioned it or asked about it again. I don't know if she just doesn't care.

I recently noticed i don't remember most of my childhood up to middle school. I don't know if it was because of my parents screaming at me all the time. Can that cause trauma or am i just being dramatic?
Did something i don't remember happen that caused this?
I remembered a suppressed childhood memory during a meditation recently. It felt like a heavy weight was dropped on me, i couldn't move and was scared. I remembered this vivid memory of my uncle stepping on my stomach, laughing while i cried.

Up until now i knew that i had this memory at some point but i thought i made it up. I have memories of me running away into my grandparents garden crying because no one believed me. I asked my mom about it. Apparently i never told her about it personally. My grandma apparently told her i was ""making up stuff, and what if she says he molested her next or something"" i know that i distanced myself from him after this and that we kind of lost all connection. 

I always ask myself what my grandma told me, what if my uncle did other things i don't remember? This is so scary to me.
I don't know if i have any serious trauma i don't remember, if i lost so much memory because of the conflicts between me and my parents?
Sorry for the long post. I just needed to vent. Feel free to comment, give advice or vent yourself :/"

760,Any practical advice for someone who probably has Schizoid Personality Disorder?,"Long story short, I've noticed recently that I display a majority of the symptoms/behaviors for Schizoid Personality Disorder, if not all of them.
If I'm right, this has been my behavior for a very long time but social isolation has brought out the worst of it.
It's starting to worry me. It's getting in the way of daily--and important--social interactions. I miss my friends and I'm turning into even more of a hermit-to a highly unhealthy point."
761,Tips to powering through existential crisis/ suicidal thoughts?,"From the time I knew what it meant, I've always been on and off with the suicidal thoughts. I was so sure that I was going to off myself before I became an adult that I didn't plan very well and now it's coming back to bite me. I'm 22 years old, high school diploma, tried college and working but it was way too stressful for me at the time, and now I'm just working at a retail store that I don't want to spend the rest of my life at, however being raised in poverty I never got the chance for a full blown scholarship to finish school. I'm stuck and thinking about it makes me feel like I'm worthless and just another pawn in the great scam that is America. At this point I just need advice, if there's anyone out there who can help."
762,Cat licking herself is wearing down my mental state,"A bit of background: I believe I have Misophonia. I don't have an official diagnosis but I'm going based on what I've researched. 

I can't stand mouth noises like chewing, swallowing, licking, and kissing. My cat, who we know has allergies but she fights us when we give her medicine for it. She. Licks. All. The. Dang. Time. She is always around me, too. I feel like a butthole when I chase her out or make her stop, but my mental state can't take it anymore. If I close her out of my room, she pouts and does what she can to get in. 

I've tried to get my mom to get her tested, but no. She won't listen to me anyway.

My grandma has it too I believe, but everyone says it's just in her head. If they think that of her, what of me?

Is there anything I can do? I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I'm in the US."

764,People that ignore you when you need support but post a status mentioning depression awareness are the worst,There was this girl I met and she always shared posts on Facebook saying “it’s okay to talk” and how there should be more support and awareness for depression. I assumed she would be great to chat to however I was ignored multiple times and given one word answers
765,What’re some good self help books &amp; mood journals/diaries that you use?,"I was thinking of writing everything down and getting some self help books to try make a small change to my mindset, what would you guys recommend?"
766,Is my new psychiatrist right?,"Hi, I use this account to be anonymous.

I just got a new psychiatrist. The old one was great, really supportive, told me all I needed to know about my issues, and validated me. She treated me for anxiety disorder and panic attacks. Gave me some advice and prescribed me some anti-anxiety drugs. We were trying to find the right ones for me. Told me about other people with this disorder and supported me in my journey. Of course, this  treatment was combined with therapy. Sadly, I had to transfer to another one. 

I have not been able to get therapy for the last few months so things have been hard. Because of scheduling problems I also have not been able to see the new psychiatrist for months. Today I finally met her and I am so confused. 

When I came I was already really anxious because of the new situatuon. There were some issues with my appointment, which resulted in me, sitting there for over 2 hours, panicking out of my mind that I fucked something up again. When I finally got to her office, I was overwhelmed with anxiety, shaking, crying, rocking back and forth like a crazy person. 

When I tried to explain my issues (she had my medical history data in her hand, so she knew) she interupted me, and told me that I am very sensitive soul, but I am not ill and I have to stop telling myself that. I was really confused about this, because that is not what my old psychiatrist and my psychologist told me. (Plus I really don't think I am sensitive, most times I am the most practical person, then anxiety  hits and all the logical thinking is gone) 

She told me that if I really had the issues I claim to have, I would not be able to come in today, and that I managed the situation amazingly for someone who claims to be ill (all this, while I was still hystericaly crying). She said I need to be have more willpower and there is nothing to be cured.

I told her I cannot live like this. Stressing or absolutely panicking over anything. Fearing to go out of my house. She said that that is absolutely normal, and everyone thinks like that, I just need to get over it. Then she said something I thought I would never hear from a profesional. She actually said, that people have it much worse than me, and that I should realize that. That I don't really have a bad life. Which I know I don't, but still?

I told her, I am seeking treatment because I want to live a normal life and my psychologist recommended it. She said that I already live a normal life. That all I need to do is be stronger and learn breathing exercises.

I did not told her that, but if this is normal life, if everyone feels like this and if it's gonna be like this forever.. Then I can't do it. The pain and the exhaustion is just too much for me. I thought that seeking treatment for this was the right thing to do, I had hope, that I could be cured. If not, how can I manage to spend so many painful and exhausting years here?

Do you guys think she is right? That everyone lives like this and I should just learn to manage or give up?  That I am not really ill, I am just sensitive? I would be very greatful for any feedback. 

Sadly, there are no other doctors here, that admit new patiens, so for a while I am stuck with her."
767,Is this normal?,"So lets start from the beginning, so the day we had to physically be at school for the first time in 3 months it was pretty chill, no stress nothing.
When school was over i noticed myself being really short tempered. Later that day i had all these emotion building up and i thought i was going crazy. Eventually i cried really hard for 20 minutes straight. This eventually was occurring at least once a week.
(I also cried over the slightest things)

When summer vacation started and school stopped my wierd cry thingy also just vanished

Today i had to collect my books from school and i had to be at school for 5 minutes, and the same thing repeated again. I cried really fucking hard for 25 minutes or so. I dont know but its like i'm scared of school


Is this normal?

Should i get professional help?

(I'm 14 btw)"
768,I’m so angry it’s ruining my life,"I don’t know what’s been going on with me lately but i am so angry. at everything. starting at age 6 i was in therapy and on my first antipsychotic drug, not even for anything specific, they didn’t have a diagnosis. i was just an angry kid. we never knew why, at age 4 i started bashing my head into the walls just screaming my head off and my parents had to put a football helmet on me. age 6 was just the start, i have been on probably almost every single mood stabilizing and anti anxiety drug there is. i lived in 4 different residential treatment centers from age 12-15. i have had 100 different therapists and they’ve all given me bullshit diagnoses and bullshit meds that would make me feel like shit constantly. and then one day i just grew out of it all. i was 15 and decided to stop taking my meds and seeing my therapist. and i had never felt better. i was literally just a normal teenager again. (i know this is all over the place but i’m so upset right now and just typing like crazy.) i felt completely fine. i went to school, i had friends, even got my first boyfriend not even a year later. then i hit another bad patch. started partying a lot, ended  up getting arrested and addicted to coke, ruined a lot of friendships and destroyed my reputation. (i live in a town where people TALK), ended up on probation and kicked the coke habit. fast forward to now. i’m 18F. i’ve been in a relationship for almost 2 years now. i love him so much and he’s amazing. but i’m ruining it. i don’t know what’s been going on with me but for the past month i have been a raging fucking bitch. everything makes me so mad. i feel like i felt when i was a kid. this same uncontrollable and unreasonable anger. i thought i had grown out of it at 15. from the day i stopped taking my meds up till this past month i haven’t had any issues with my anger. i keep thinking about my life and all the shit i’ve had to deal with. i’ve had a lot of trauma and death in my life from a very young age and it’s made me so bitter. i don’t want to be bitter. my bf tells me it’s my mindset. if something bad happens i just need to shake it off and think positively. he’s a huge optimist. i am i huge pessimist. (i like to say i’m a realist but that’s bs lmao), it’s really hard for me to think positive because i’ve been shit on a lot in life so i protect myself by not getting my hopes up for anything. i want to be more positive and not let one little thing ruin my entire day but i don’t know what to do. my boyfriend is at his wits end with my anger and i don’t wanna lose him. but i’m having a very hard time controlling it. i don’t even know why i’m posting this, i’m sure not a lot of people will read the whole thing i just needed to get this out because i didn’t know what else to do with myself."
769,I think i'm at the start of a downward spiral,"Maybe I just need to vent, maybe I really need help, i'm not entirely sure. 

I took quarantine pretty seriously and was fairly isolated for several months. There was an adjustment period where I had to sort of re-learn how to speak and be sociable and what have you, so i'm not sure if this is just part of that adjustment or not. 


I was chewed out a lot today by a superior for something I felt was unfair, and for some reason it's really sticking with me. I'm replaying the situation over and over in my head and I feel a pit in my stomach because  of it. I had to speak to a lot of colleagues today and I noticed I was reading more negativity into their words than I usually do. More than this I'm finding myself upset with more of my friends. I'm finding myself not wanting to speak to my friends. I want space from them even though we're just barely reconnecting from quarantine. I feel overwhelmed with workload to the point i'm actually not wanting to work at all. I'm just starting to feel out of it. I'm feeling like I just want to be alone for a little longer before doing more work or speaking to more people. Everything feels like its too much and i'm finding myself pacing a lot and pushing things off. I don't know how to describe it other than i feel like somethings wrong with me but worse than that I feel like its only the beginning."
770,I feel worthless.,"I feel unwanted by my friends and family. I feel as if all I am is a gap. People know I’m there, but I’m easy to fill. I feel distanced and unable to talk to anyone. Everyone I turn to doesn’t take me seriously. I feel as if I’m playing a character. Who the fuck am I? I pretend to be so eccentric when I feel so alone and empty. I don’t even know if my friends even like “me” let alone the real me. But who the fuck is the real me? I don’t know. Sorry if this is scrambled and nobody can understand what I mean, I just wanted to vent."
771,How do I get help after having a bad experience before?,"Tldr: a counsellor told me I was copying my mums mental health issues and that I didn't have any issues myself. Still feel the same/just as low 4 years later but can't get over the possibility of the same thing happening again if I seek help now. 

I stopped going to school for a year at the end of secondary school as I couldn't bring myself to go but couldn't open up enough to anyone, so my parents and the school forced me to speak to someone from mind (mental health charity in the UK). I ended up being guilt tripped into going by being told my parents would receive a large fine if I didn't, and as money was tight, I had no choice. Two things came out of the allotted six 1hour sessions; the first being that the counsellor pushed so hard and made me feel so stupid and pathetic that I went back to school to get away from having the sessions anymore. The second being that they told me that I didn't have any mental health issues myself but instead, I was copying my mum who has depression and anxiety. She had been off of work at the time for around 2 year due to these and rarely left the house unless necessary. This all sprung from the question ""do any family members have any mental health problems"". I have been so scared ever since to get any help but my boyfriend really thinks I should and due to experiences himself, says that the system is better now and it will be fine. How do I get over this?"

773,Romanticizing mental illnesses pisses me off so much,"I was just talking to this guy who claims he has a crush on me and also says that he's bipolar. We've been talking for a while and he knows i've been struggling with mental illness bc he saw me taking pills and knows i have a psychiatrist and stuff. So he's been going on my nerves for the past month to talk to him more about my problems. I just hate talking about it. I don't mind people knowing or anything but i just hate talking about them. My psychiatrist is enough i don't need any more people. Finally i gave up and told him i have depression, social anxiety and OCD. Then he went silent for a moment and said ""oh well.. that's disappointing."" I asked what he means and he said ""nothing. I guess i was hoping you were as crazy as me.. like something more than just that you know, i like psychos and i can't help it"" oh god i lost it when he said that.. I've been going through hell and he was hoping i'm even more messed up? Why would anyone want someone else to be fucked up? What's so cool about fucking up your life and not being able to do anything about it? I don't even know who to blame. I feel so angry and oh man i wish i could slit his throat open when he said those things. Like i know i have the most ""basic"" mental illnesses and i can't be as edgy as y'all but i don't even want to be cool and edgy if that's what it is so stop trying to get me to talk about my uncool problems ffs. And it's not even the first time i've been called ""normal"" by our other edgy nutcase friends. I actually do want to be normal and I'm sick of them trying to make it seem like it's a bad thing when i'm trying my best to be as normal as i can and i wish people could appreciate my efforts instead of being disappointed in me for only having ""basic"" mental illnesses like it's a positive thing to be as fucked up as you can."
774,How to seek mental help from doctor during pandemic,"I know I have lots of mental problems.. I'm positive add is one but growing up my parents didn't believe it was real so I was never tested as a kid, but it makes a lot of sense (I cannot stay focused to save my life). I also have other stuff going on that's very hard to explain.. I was diagnosed with depression but it's so much more than that.. I think I may have bpd or something. I feel like I have different personalities.. It's like I have different outfits that involuntary change. Right now the one that makes me feel depressed. Counseling in the past hasn't helped because I automatically go into a place of I must show I'm fine to win. I don't even know where to begin with the doctor or how to explain what's going on in my head. Plus there's all this could crap happening so I really don't want to go to the doctor. Idk what to do or where to begin."

I want to see a counsellor or something similar but i was too anxious to go to an appointment before so i emailed asking if it was ok for me to go back next week and no response ive emailed them months later asking for help and its as if they have blocked my email. I just need someone to get my life back on track, i live in Scotland if anyone knows any organisations i could go to or anything like that"
776,My life is a failure,"I am an average guy who has no reasons to exist.
Coming from a middle class family had always played a part in my life. Though my parents never let me feel like that way, but there are few things life that will always haunt you back.

As a person I am not talented or skillful. I haven’t achieved anything significant in life. Mediocrity has always been my abode.
I failed my parents. They always wanted me to succeed.But my mediocrity along with my stupidity is the reason behind me failing them.

I always have had this anxiety while interacting with new people. Though I got over this problem, but people back then found me weird and still treat me like as if I am a zombie among them. I don't really mind that as I have become habituated with it.
I had never dated a girl in my life until I met someone special. We became friends and from there my feelings started to grew.

I knew that I would get rejected still I tried on her with a false hope. Eventually I did get rejected that too badly.
She made fun of my feelings, didn’t stop me right way when I was hitting on her. She already had someone in her life, about which I was completely unaware of.

She made a mockery of my emotions among her friends. 
I was sad and broken but I had nothing to do like every time.
I am neither good looking nor rich. I was even made fun of for being a virgin and called an incel for staying away from women after that trauma.
I have tried to keep myself calm but it isn't just working.

I can't even afford to kill myself, as I have the responsibility to look after my parents who are ageing. My mother often remains ill and father is having tough time running the family. 
It would be very selfish of me to end my life and risking their future. 

At this point of my life, I wish I never really existed on the first place."

778,Depression can kiss my A**!,"So I’m currently in a depression episode and doing my best to keep to a normal schedule, I also have bipolar 2 disorder. I keep pushing away friends (well what friend I do have) all because he “lost track of time and wanted to reschedule”. He doesn’t like hanging out with me when I am depressed because I’m just sad mainly and sometimes b*tchy and he wants me to just be happy all the time. So I call my Celebrate Recovery sponsor and tell her and she tells me “hey, I’ll call you right back” and that was an hour ago. I absolutely hate this feeling of pretty much being rejected and nobody is really listening. The only people who have stood my me through all the ups and downs are my parents and have lost friends over the last 3 years since my bipolar diagnosis. I can’t seem to find someone my age (26, female) that is willing to stick around. Does anyone have this issue??"
779,Should I seek help?,"Let me start out by just saying that I (34M) have no intention to harm myself or anyone else.

My issue is that I have personal issues that appear to be getting worse but don't seem related. I'm currently married but my first wife committed suicide a few months after we were married (5 years ago). I went into a slump but had a lot of support from others, traveled a lot, eventually remarried and live in another country.

Over the past few years, I've noticed that I'm more afraid of certain things than before. For instance, I can't sleep without some type of light and/watching something on my phone. Also, I feel like if there's a dark window something/one might be looking at me.
My wife says I snap more often than usual, but I don't see that, personally.

781,Struggling,"Hey guys, I’m in an amazing relationship with what I can comfortably say is the most amazing woman if ever met and have every intention of making this the final one. We hit a roadblock recently where I let an insecurity get the better of me and it brought a lot of true feelings from her. She feels smothered sometimes, she doesn’t want to be the girl who is constantly being lovey and cheesy, she needs time alone and I respect all of that but am having a difficult time with it. I want to be better for her because I want to show her what she deserves and I know my insecurities are somewhat childish but I’ve never had separation anxiety like this and find myself struggling to not ask her if she loves me(we’ve already said I love you and all of that) but I don’t want to smother her. I don’t want to turn into a chore, I can already tell she’s lost alittle of the spark and enthusiasm but that’s not her fault. I unknowingly was trying to turn her into someone she’s not. I literally don’t know what to do with my hands? Please help."
782,"Help! Night time panic, Heart pounding, Can hardly sleep, Any suggestions appreciated!","I am a 30 y/o American Male living in Oregon and I don't really even know where to begin...  
A little under a month ago I quit my job after my supervisor ""lost their mind"" and after a month and half long period of verbal and emotional abuse turned my buried anxieties and traumas into a full blown disorder. To say I was a wreck is an understatement, I had to deal with that trauma, all the crap it dragged up and the burgeoning disorder. I was filled with non-specific fears, about the video-conferences with my new psychologists - the first turned out to be a complete quack - about my future, my traumas, and about the my decision to quit for my mental health and the trial of finding a new science lab job in the midst of the pandemic. It wasn't fun, but I was dealing, I was sleeping, It wasn't great but livable? Probably due to my already daily doses of Sertraline (small does in the morning, big dose in the evening) and Clonadine (in the evening) as part of a long established (\~15 years) ADHD regime (though perhaps not a good thing it hasn't been overseen by a Psychiatrist in 5-6 years) - I also take Concerta in the morning. I can't say exactly how it felt back then since the present eclipses my memory of those days. Though I can say this a few weeks ago I had a really good week, things felt great, I was able to play a video game and enjoy it, I wasn't happy per-say but I was doing well, I had found a therapist who seemed like a nice guy who started me on some mindfulness and meditation in addition to helping figure out my anxieties. I had also joined a therapy group overseen by a CTB therapist specializing in Anxiety and OCD. The next week wasn't as good, but heck I figured I'd have good days and bad days and good weeks and bad weeks. Well if that was a bad week then last week was one from the depths of Hell. It started Tuesday/Wednesday with sudden feelings of generalized apprehension, pressure in my chest/over/in my heart and just a feeling of perhaps ""fight or flight""? On Thursday it had spread to most of the day and the afternoon had gotten worse. By Friday it was pretty bad in the morning - my morning calm ritual a tea tree oil bubble bath with scented candles and a documentary - wasn't working well and by that afternoon my heart was pounding even as I tried to relax and find a ""happy place"" though my sleep wasn't really disturbed much - I was able to get back to sleep. Saturday was a different story, my coping methods had lost most effect and I wasn't able to keep any food or water down, Saturday night I woke at two with a throbbing heart and just a sense of tremendous unease and flight or fight panic and could not get back to sleep. Sunday was even worse, I didn't get hardly any sleep, my heart just pounded, I wasn't keeping anything down. I went to the ER today, they checked over my heart - and didn't even consider COVID a possibility (which given my aunt and uncle are helping me out a lot and are in the 70s is a relief to me) - and it was fine 2 EKGs good no elevated enzymes, they checked my thyroid it was fine and in the end gave me a proton-pump inhibitor and suggested melatonin for sleeping. Honestly I'm both grateful that my heart is okay, and pissed that there's no quick fix to this sudden and horrible change in my already major suffering. Right now I'm praying that I at least get a decent night's sleep tonight, long and free from fear, because I'm really uncertain how many more I can take. I probably need a strong(er) anti-anxiety drug, perhaps a beta-blocker against the physical symptoms - I'm scrambling to get a Psychiatrist who can see me. My close family thinks I may have started a panic cycle or else caused myself harm by overdoing therapy last week - I attended 4 group therapy sessions, one each day, and that I might have been overall trying to move way to fast and basically injured myself. I just would love to learn that this will probably get a little better as things move along and that I won't be paralyzed waiting for psychiatrist before at least some of these horrific symptoms improve so I can at least sleep."
783,I’m so ashamed of what I’ve let my mental illnesses due to my oral care.,"For some reason, the number one thing I’ve always struggled with most when it comes to my mental health, is hygiene. Specifically oral hygiene. My teeth aren’t rotted out of my head yet, but they’re not in great shape. I don’t have insurance, either, on top of it. 

I found out a while back that I need a root canal on my left side but even at my low-cost clinic, they quoted me at $2,000.I didn’t get that done bc money so I haven’t been able to eat on my left side. Now a filling came out of one of the molars on my right side, leaving a hole, and I’m pretty sure I need a root canal on that side, too. Leaving me unable to eat on both sides of my mouth.

I feel so ashamed of myself and that i’ve let this happen. My boyfriend encourages me to take better care of myself all the time (especially bc i recently overcame an infection), and i /want/ to do better. I don’t know why i don’t and i hate myself for it. 

I feel disgusting, worthless. Embarrassed. I don’t want to lose all my teeth and i’m terrified it’s going to happen, and it’s all my fault. I did this to myself. but i don’t know how to change. And part of me is scared it’s too late to change."
784,I’ve thought about suicide a lot recently..,"Out of nowhere when I’m playing games or just laying on the couch, I get this voice in my head telling me to kill my self, then I get all panicked and then calm down and then panic again and sometimes I’m fine but other times it’s so many things screaming at me in my head that I can’t take it. I don’t know how to stop it, I don’t know why it’s gotten this bad. I don’t think I want to die, I don’t know anymore. I don’t know what to do. I wanna give up so badly but I don’t even know if I want to die."
785,How do you combat your own social withdrawal?,"My depression has been flaring up again recently, especially over the past week. I feel myself withdrawing from people and being resistant to reaching out. I know this is common with depression and is a vicious cycle that just makes the depression worse. But I don’t know how to fight it. Have any of you dealt with this in yourselves? If so, how did you combat the urge to socially isolate yourself?"
786,I want to get help for possible OCD and ADHD and whatever else may be wrong. How do I go about this and would a psychologist or psychiatrist be a good start.,I’ve been noticing symptoms in myself of the above mentioned disorders and I’m about to get insurance to afford help but I’ve never gotten help and and don’t know exactly where to begin.
787,a struggle with altered reality,It’s just overwhelming to have to carry this weight of schizophrenia. Everyone says they can help but what I need is for someone to understand and relate to. I live in fear and doubt and depression and I can’t do this anymore. I feel so alone. I need help badly.
788,How do you stop feeling guilt when you know you may emotionally hurt people to do something that you want for yourself?,
789,I’m not in danger so don’t worry,"I’m not in any immediate danger I just wanna know people opinions about this topic
So I occasionally get suicidal thoughts but whenever I get into that mind set it’s always like if I were to try to kill myself id fail and then I could go get help and people wouldn’t think I was “faking it” but even I kinda look at that mindset as inherently crying for attention and over dramatic. So I guess my question is why can’t I just ask for help? Like if it were that serious surely Something would have happened by now,  do I not actually need help?"
790,What’s wrong with me,"Hi so I’ve asked advice on this before but it’s gotten much worse. I’m about to start college in a couple of days and my mental health is not ready. I’ve lost all motivation to do things. I just want to be alone. I’ve tried medication but I haven’t tried therapy because I honestly don’t think it’ll work. I just want to disappear and come back as someone with a normal functioning brain. 

I honestly don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore. I’m supposed to do some tour thing for college but I just can’t do it. I can’t see myself making it through the year. I’m not suicidal or anything, but I’m in the brink of a breakdown where I just want to crawl in a hole and be left there. 

For reference, I’m 18, F, from the US, and have diagnosed depression and anxiety and I honestly think it’s much more severe than that. Every time I see myself going two steps forward I get scared and jump ten steps back. I don’t know what to do."
791,quick question,"for like 10 years everyone said 
“be strong someday you’ll be okay”
why hasn’t it happened?"
792,My life seems to be crumbling,"For god knows how long now maybe 2 years. My life has slowly just been falling apart. I have stopped trying with stuff and now I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. I just somehow slept 18 hours through an entire shift of work and a meal with my family. Now it’s 2am and I’ve got to hope I wake up in time for work. My sleeping has been so awful for so long I can’t even remember feeling refreshed and/or happy in the morning. Every day starts as a struggle and then from there continues to be one. I feel like I really need some sort of break or release from all this. Thing is my mind is so busy it’s hard to see solutions to problems. I’m failing uni, work, losing friends, can’t sleep properly, can’t look after myself, I’m either eating barely anything or loads of shit food and I’ve got a cannabis dependency. Great"
793,Which should I delete for my mental health?,"I use all of them the same amount (TOO MUCH.)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ibrjyk)"
794,anyone?,"I relapsed and self harmed today. I came back to reddit knowing I need support and maybe even a friend. If anyone feels like they could use a friend, too... I’m here. 🖤"
795,My psychiatrist and parents are trying to put me on anti-psychotics,[removed]
796,I have been [mis]seeing/hearing things,"Im sorry for the possibility confusing title but it exactly as it sounds. Ive been mishearing things or thinking Im hearing something. Sometimes I'll see an object out of the corner of my eye and it'll look like a human figure but it will really be something simple or once in a rare while nothing at all. Okay that sounds vague still, so an example is I was at a friends house and there was background music but I heard it slightly louder than it was and sounded much like ice cream truck music. Or at work there was a back, a purse, and a work apron lying on a table and out of the corner of my eye I was convinced it was someone sitting there (happened a second time even though somewhere in my mind I knew what it was). Another time was I swore I heard a stomach growling in my room other than mine. These are specific examples just to make sense of what Im talking about. I am graduating with a psychology degree this winter so Im knowledgeable but I did want other people opinions. Maybe Im just tired and doing alot or maybe its something to keep an eye on and give my mental health a bit more attention?"
797,I fucked up my high-school career.,"This school year I am a senior. My whole high school career I haven't had 1 friend, nor acquaintance. No relationships. Nothing. I didn't go to any events. I never felt like ""man i wanna be his/her friend"" but I feel like I fucked up my experience by saying ""fuck friendships"". I don't know why I did that. I go to a really small school, just under 500 students in all so everyone pretty much knows everyone. My sister (who graduated last year) and brother (sophomore this year) are very popular and I'm just known as the ""quiet"" sister. I feel like I didn't make friends because of my identity.

I'm gay with a very homophobic mother. Her fiance isn't homophobic but he doesn't like telling her how she should treat us. I guess I felt like if I made a friend, I would have to hide myself because if I told them I was gay, my siblings would find out and they might tell my mom. I doubt that they would tell her but man it would be awkward between us.

Now I'm definitely not the poster image for straight. I'm called ""young man"" a lot by old strangers. I have piercings, short hair, small stretched ears. I'm ""tall"" (taller than a lot of the boys at the school) and recently got glasses that make me look even more masculine. So I doubt that the people at school and my siblings think I'm straight but I don't think my siblings considered me being gay. At the school I go to being gay is pretty much the norm. I've had crushes and I'm pretty sure this one girl kinda liked me but I didn't do anything cause... Yeah.

I've never been at a school by myself. Except 8th grade and the beginning of elementary. For elementary my sexuality didn't matter. I knew I was gay but I wasn't trying to have girlfriends I was trying to have running and climbing contests. And for middle school, my sister was there up until she went to high school, so I was only there 8th grade by myself. It was again a small school. People found out I was gay cause I didn't log out of a computer and they went through my Hangouts messages. I was teased for it, some people may call it ""bullying"" but ew. I'll never make myself the victim and I kinda thought it was cool to be the subject of focus. After 8th grade I was back in a school with my sister. So I had to go back to quiet. 

I've had to suppress my identity for almost as long as I've been alive. I fucked up by hiding my identity and not letting myself make friends or make the most of my high school experience. Now I'm gonna do my last year of school completely online because my mother doesn't want me to go to school physically. It's sad that lost of my teen years have gon to waste.

Can't wait to be able to be myself somewhere but now I gotta work on reversing my anti-social-Ness."
798,Had the most solid and emotionally consistent day in ages!,"Today felt honestly like the first day of some whole other experience of living, that sounds maybe overly dramatic, and it probably is. But this feeling is just so nice. Went to work first thing in the morning after being up studying for a my written driving test, did my shift and everything was great and smooth, went and passed the test, finally have my learners!!! Did a bunch of biking around, finally cleaned my room top to bottom and remembered why I love the things I have and who I am as a person and now I’m just chilling and I feel just so at peace. Often these things can be temporary but I am very much stoked about the solace I have found today, and that I didn’t have to deal with constant anxiety or thinking of the past or bringing myself down over and over... I really hope I can maintain this sort of mindset. ❤️"
799,"I’m terrified of young people, especially when they’re in groups, and it’s starting to take a toll on me.","I’m 22 years old, so these guys are all around my age. I was bullied a lot throughout elementary-high school. I’ve also been extremely shy and socially awkward for as long as I can remember. I’m not sure if this is a play in who I am today, but I wouldn’t rule it out. 

Nowadays, whenever I see a group of teens or young adults, I go into panic mode. My heart starts racing, I get defensive, self conscious, and so on. I start thinking about if they’re judging me, if they’re making fun of me, and sometimes, that “if” becomes “they are.” Even if they aren’t picking on me at all, my mind tells me that as I walk past them, they’re judging my every move and hating on me. 

I can’t live like this. I don’t hang out with anyone, I’m very lonely, I have no luck with women, and feeling this way about people around my own age doesn’t help at all. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to die alone, sometimes I feel like a loser, sometimes I don’t even wanna live. Are they really judging me or is it trauma from my bullied past? Are they really making fun of me or am I just mentally sick?"
800,My mental health struggles being used as a tool against me,"For quite a few years now, I have been very open with most people about my struggles with anxiety and depression. It has helped me heal, and quite often, when I share with people, I find that most can relate to what I'm sharing. It is empowering for me and the person I am sharing with, generally. 

But I have realized that there are a few people in my life who feel that it's ok to use my struggles against me, for their own gain. I have recently recognized this as gaslighting. 

This makes me so angry. It feels like a new level of violation. One person, in particular, has also struggled with depression and has been through therapy. She frequently tries to use this shared ground as a way to manipulate me. 

The most recent example has come about because of the pandemic. My immediate family has been following government guidelines very closely, when it comes to distancing and wearing masks. Most other people in our family are not being careful, and they don't understand our decision. This particular person has been trying to convince me that I'm overreacting, that I'm paranoid, that I'm overthinking. They have gone as far as to suggest that the best way for me to combat my ""anxiety"" is to just give up on social distancing and start living my life again. 

I don't know how to handle this. It hurts. It makes me not want to share about my mental health or mental illness with anyone. I know that this person is very close with another person who has used other people's mental health struggles as a way to put them down, and she has also tried to gaslight me this way.  

I just don't have the tools to deal with this. I'm feeling broken, in a way that I haven't felt for quite some time."
801,How do I stop overeating and destroying my body,"I never thought that I used to be someone who ate to ""fill their emptiness"" like those people on my 600 pound life, but I think maybe that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm those people. I've had problems with overeating for waaaaaaay longer than I can even remember and recognize and I think I've occasionally had binging episodes too. In recent years I've been slowly getting over that, just in pursuit to being healthier. I'm at a serious low rn, and my eating habits are so abysmal, I just wanna make it stop. If you look at webmd or other google blurbs for depression they always describe some symptoms to be either overeating or eating very little. Most times I wish I was at the other side of the spectrum, I hate doing this and I know it's no good. I haven't spoken to my therapist about it yet but it's ridiculous after how far I've come in terms of fitness and weight how I'm just gonna throw it all away."
802,I honestly just want everyone to go away,"I really don't feel like I can trust anyone anymore. The couple of friends I have left only seem to give a fuck when they're actually just waiting to turn the conversation over to themselves at the first opportunity. They present themselves as actually caring about me and being there for me, but if the conversation drifts further into my mental health than ""I'm good, you?"" it promptly gets directed back to their amazingly eventful lives before they have to actually give a fuck. Yet I'm just somewhere they can vent about every detail of their lives, 24 hours a day. If I stop replying to messages, they start calling. 

I'm exhausted. I don't have the energy to listen to what some person one of my friends doesn't like dared to say on Facebook today, or check their ex's social media page for them, or deal with whatever other bullshit is going on. I'd much rather sit and rot in my own company than spend so much energy on people who obviously don't intend to make any effort for me.

I honestly feel like somewhere along the line, I got transported into some fucked up mirror world, where genuinely contemplating suicide is boring and insignificant, and having burned a hole in your leg is just dull evening conversation, much better replaced with gossip about an old friend's love life. (And definitely not deserving of help getting to the hospital, according to my parents)"
803,What is this symptom/mental behavior and how can I get it to stop?,"I've done this for most of my life but recently it's been getting really bad.

I'll zone out and hyperfocus on traumatic things from my childhood or current life, such as emotional abuse from my mom, suicidal ideation, moments of grief, etc. I'll constantly create these scenarios in my head in which I stand up to my mom/whoever and list every possible thing they will do to prove I am lying or wrong. If I'm not creating these scenarios, I'll go through vivid memories of my life and try to pick out every detail, most of which are very negative.

This is probably the most mind-numbing and distracting mental ""thing"" I do. During quarantine and without as much support as I usually get, I've been doing this behavior a lot. Sometimes it's so bad I'll look at the clock and almost twenty minutes have gone by and I didn't even realize it. It's so distressing and when the scenario-building gets really intense, my body feels like it's going through fight or flight. Snapping out of it is difficult and I'll drift back into it if I don't play loud music or do something really engaging.

I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, currently not in therapy/on meds due to financial reasons and I'm 29F if that helps.

I just want to know if there is a term for this so I can do more research on how to stop."
804,I can’t describe how I feel,I really want to give up I don’t want to wait around for something good to happen. I want my mom and sister to be happy for sure. I don’t know but I just want out so bad. I know I need to keep hanging in there but I’m to where I wish I could sleep all day for days on end. I hate everything about me and this world. I wish I was never here. I’m tired of thinking about the past. I want to let go of it all. But I don’t want to talk to people about how I feel Bc I can’t really describe it and what’s the point anyway.
805,Why do I see and hear things that nobody else can see or hear?,"sometimes Im working out for example And  I will see a black shadow or people at the corner of my eye,even today I swear I saw a man across the street and he just vanished. sometimes at night I Hear noises like people whispering and its really bizarre. I get weird thoughts but they dont bother me,I guess I learned to not let things get to you. sometimes I feel like im being watched or something its really bizarre. Besides these symptoms im fairly normal in everything else,im 19 years old and a man btw."
806,Toxic family,It been 28 long years and I finally realized that my family will never understand or support me through my mental health struggle. I have tried to open up and tell them plenty of times about my struggles with depression and anxiety and recently my ptsd. It just sad to know that I am going to have to walk away from them in order to get better. I love my family but I love my self more
807,I think I might be bipolar,"I know I have some sort of mental health issue, but I think I might be bipolar. How can I be diagnosed or at least looked at?"
808,How to mentally move on from abusive relationship,"It’s been a while since I’ve had a full blown panic attack. I saw my ex move on in life. He was mentally abusive to me. While I know it’s best we’re apart. I always go down a deep rabbit hole of thinking I was never good enough for him. He was always an outgoing person, while I was more shy and reserved. I struggled with social anxiety at the time and I still do. The fact that i wouldn’t go out or party with him always made me feel like I just wasn’t good enough for him. It really dug into my insecurities, especially when I knew he’d go out partying and dancing with other women while we were together, while I stayed home  . Nothing i did was good for him. Anyway it’s a lot. But I keep thinking that he’s happier with someone else and treating them better than me because I could never live up to his expectations. He saw me at my worst with my mental health . A part of me feels like if I would’ve been different , he would’ve treated me better and we’d still be together. I saw he moved on and it made me so depressed. I’m having a panic attack as I type this. I don’t know how to come down from this. Seeing him, just triggered me and  brought me back to one of the hardest moments I’ve had In my life . I was suicidal when I was with him and he saw me at the lowest point in my life. It’s been about 4 months since we last spoke and I still feel the same way. I don’t know how to get over him. How can I get through this and move past this relationship that brought me nothing but pain."
809,"I finally cut off a toxic friend, but they were also my only writing partner","I'm in such a horrible place mentally right now and I need someone. I'm literally typing this while sobbing in my room :'D fun times 


I'm suffering from major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety, as well as ADHD and OCD. I have bad abandonment issues and I get attached to people so easily. Recently I had been dealing with someone that'd fallen in love with me, and they have depression too. I'm not mentally ready to be in a relationship. Im afraid. It's so draining being around them because I feel like I have to be a therapist. 



Writing has been my coping mechanism. Specifically, writing with a partner. You'll see some of my other posts are in roleplay communities if you decide to look on my profile. I rely heavily on writing to cope, and I think that scares some people away. 
This writing partner, the one who has fallen in love with me, had extreme depression like I do. Their bad moods made my mood bad. They brought me down. They need a therapist and I coudlnt be that for them. I'm not equipped to deal with someone else's depression on top of my own. But they were all I have. The only person writing with me. And to cut off this toxic friend meant losing our stories. 



As a child I think I messed up and relied on fiction too much and now it's such a big part of me that I can't go without writing with someone because that makes me so happy. There's so little right now that I'm living for. I'm not suicidal but I'm not happy to wake up in the morning either. All of my hobbies? I draw, I make plushies. But they all revolve around fiction, characters I write as or write with. I can't do them without wanting a plot on the side. Nothing brings me joy anymore. It's hell. It's horrible. I can't stand it. It just keeps going on and on and there's no end in sight. There's no point in anything anymore. 
 I have no reason to get up. Nothing makes these days worth living.
It's so stupid but like, I rely so heavily on fiction to cope. It's one of the few things keeping me going. If I had someone understanding who could write with me without judging, idk. I'd be grateful. 



So I guess this post is kind of just me venting, then asking for some help or just a friend to talk to.



I really like It right now. Stephen King's It. It's like my main fandom. Strange that I find a horror movie comforting, but I love the characters. I wish they were my friends ;w; I even like Pennywise. I think he's cute. But that's enough of that, I don't want to make this post too long. But in terms of fandom I also like lots of anime, and I have cool OCs too! I'm trying my best to be positive but it's really hard.

My one request is that you keep any criticisms to yourself. I just need to heal."
810,My mother thinks she’s psychic and “feels things” and doesn’t believe me when I tell her they aren’t true. Why does she do this?,"My mom has dorm undiagnosed mental issues and I won’t get into every specific, but I’m wondering why she does this because it really drives me insane, and I would like to know how to talk to her and get her to be rational. 

Apart from thinking she’s literally psychic and knows things no one else can know and knows things no one else feels, she will tell me “you’re going through something I know you are, I can feel it” when I’m completely and 100% fine and happy. So when I tell her that she dismisses me, doesn’t believe me, and basically laughs at the fact that “she knows” and that I’m pretending that I’m fine and not telling her. Nothing I say convinces her. 

She’s currently living some odd states away with my sister and just texted me asking if my brother is okay. I say yes? He’s fine, and she doesn’t believe me, and when I ask her what makes her think that, she says “I just know” and she will not take reality for the truth, only her truth is the truth. She hasn’t even seen us in months and I think I would know if he was fine, I’m around him every day. Why does she do this?"
811,I feel like i’m losing my sanity,I have only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and can not afford to go to a mental health professional yet. I understand how important it is to get diagnosed and treated by a professional and if my symptoms sound   concerning i’ll move around some extra money and try and get myself an appointment. I’ve been dealing with unbearable amounts of stress lately. I’ve noticed it’s taking a toll on me in ways that I’ve never experienced before. I feel detached from my body when I look in the mirror I don’t feel familiar with the reflection looking back at me. My soul and body feel like two separated units at the moment. I’m not able to form thoughts normally and my memory is increasingly getting worse. I often space out and am detached from reality for long amount of time and it takes a lot to snap me out of it. The worst new experience is whatever the hell is happening to me at night. Slipping into night terrors and presenting physical reactions. All I am aware of in these episodes is trying to verbalize and wake up trying to say “help” so that my room mate can hear me  and help me but no words will come out only a hitch in the back of my throat. She says my entire body shakes violently at night teeth chattering as well. This lasts a few minutes and I suddenly jolt awake after freaking out because I couldn’t speak.  I really just needed to vent. I don’t think anyone in my life takes my mental health seriously and I don’t feel comfortable vocalizing. Has anyone else experienced any of these things?
812,"Imaginary Partners, lonely","
So... I have been rejected each and every time i have tried to form a relationship between me and any other girl i found attractive.

I'm ugly, a bit overweight and, umm, how to say it?  Really so damn ugly that a dirty rotten shoe looks better than my face and body.
I have had some suicidal thoughts but nothing serious happened, but thats not the topic so...

Each time i look at the mirror i cry, its like a hell for me, i am so ugly and no girl would want a stupid worthless piece of {Censored} like me as a boyfriend.
It hurts me each time i see a couple walking together or spending time together, it makes me feel that something is wrong with me and i don't deserve to be alive compared to these perfect shaped, sized and mentally people i see everyday.


I never had the chance to be in a relationship or even feel what love is.

From one time to another, i imagine having a girlfriend, a normal one, she would be less than normal (ugly just like me, but nobody is as ugly as me though) and with a bit overweight body so she would fit in the role of being a girlfriend of such a loser like me.

I sometimes -when i feel really lonely- i go for a walk and imagine her with me, we speak and vent out to each other (i have even gave her a name).


I dont know whether this is good or not for my mental health, but whenever i do it it makes me want to cry as i feel bad for myself and how bad is my situation so that i had to make an imaginary girlfriend.

I wish something happens to me and i fie because of it so earth would get rid of such an ugly piece of garbage like me."
813,I have lost all trust in people's ability to make decisions in regard to myself. Why am I like this and what should I do about it? (16m),"I don't trust anybody to make decisions that effect me. I believe I am the only one who can make decisions around my self effectively and with my own intrest in mind. I have no faith in anyone when it comes to this, from government to family: literally anybody. Why am I like this and what should I do about it?"
814,Seeking volunteer therapists to join a Discord community,"Hi r/mentalhealth!

I hope you're having a nice evening. Recently, I've created a psychology and education discord server that has rapidly grown in the past 72 hours (from \~400 users to \~1000 users). I’ve noticed that a lot of users allude to mental health issues (e.g., self-harm, clinical depression) that really require professional help. I've listed resources out already on the main page and in rules, though many people still appear to require more help. It really breaks my heart to see so many individuals struggling, and I'm simply helpless in terms of offering credible support (I'm a neuroscience graduate student, not a mental health professional.) Hence, I wanted to create this post to discuss with the community about what I should do? 

In addition, would there be any licensed therapists by any chance who would be able to volunteer time to help out some of our community members? Thank you for your time."
815,Lonely high schooler,"Hello, I will be a senior in high school this year and am considering whether I should do remote or in person(hybrid) classes.  I've always been a pretty reserved/quiet person and don't keep contact with too many people.  However, I like being around people and will feel depressed if I'm not interacting with someone for a very long time and will get depressed if I'm not really talking to anyone.  I don't know if many seniors are going back this year I dont even know if people will be allowed to talk.  Is it unhealthy for me to do fully remote learning"
816,Having headaches because of lack of a partner,"I don't have a lot of friends to hang out with and I am feeling lonely every single day. I am begging to god for a relationship. I just want a partner who I can be sexual with as well (not just friends), a couple. Porn and other stuff doesn't help. I feel like hurting myself for getting a fitter physique but that also deteriorates my mental health. I'm stuck in a loop here and I don't know what to do. I have also asked out some girls but they all seem to have boyfriends. I also used Tinder for a while but had literally 0 matches in 2 months so kinda done with that."
817,What you do to manage your tinnitus?,"Hello everyone
I hopes everybody is well
People who having tinnitus, what you do to manage it.

Because some time it rreally cause anxiety and depression.

Now Day I started exercise to manage it, but sometimes it burst.

Yap Doctor can't help here, for treatment."
818,Am I Depressed,"It seems to me like all the joy I have ever had is gone. Nothing is fun anymore and I get bored really easily, I can't concentrate. I have done some research but I still can't figure out if I have depression or I am just a boring person."
819,"struggling with self-forgiveness, need advice :(","i feel like everyday i’m always finding a reason to be mad at myself/disappointed in myself about some thing i’ve done in the past, even if they’re really little things that probably aren’t a big deal to others but i always make them seem like a huge problem. i care a lot about what other people think of me and i hate upsetting others so i feel like that’s also a major reason why i overthink the way i do. i’m trying to learn to accept my mistakes/flaws and move on from them, but i feel so stuck in the past that it just gives me so much anxiety and constant worry. it’s just frustrating because i know it’s all in the past and learning from them will make me better, but i’d be lying if i said that it doesn’t bother me anymore. is there any advice on truly learning to forgive yourself?"
820,Why am I still afraid of woman,"Ever since I was a kid i’ve always been afraid of women, I think it might be because my mom, She was always verbally abusive towards meI think she has said towards me has stuck and stayed with me and I can’t get past it, every woman I ever talk to or met, I am always afraid to talk to them, and I can’t even talk to my teachers without not paying attention or trying to get out of class, And I have been to a psychiatrist/psychologist, and they have barely worked, is there anything I can do about it ?"
821,I’m a role model for my younger family members with mental illness and I’m about to fail,"I’m the oldest cousin in my family with mental illness. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 15 (20F) and I’ve managed to get into a really good college and get really good grades. I am a neuro major planning to apply to med school. A few of my younger cousins were diagnosed with depression and were also hospitalized. But they always say that they think they can still do well in life because I’m still doing well. Especially one of them who also wants to be a physician. 

It sounds great and all but it’s torture. I do it for them to show them that they can also be successful. And I haven’t attempted suicide in a few years because I don’t want to let them and everybody else down but I think about it all the time. Schizoaffective disorder is life long. The psychosis is terrifying, and the depression sucks, and when I say it will never end I’m not being pessimistic. It’s just a fact of the disorder. It won’t. I don’t want to do this anymore but I feel like I’m killing them by killing myself. 

You might not understand the mechanics of the disorder but for those who do:
I’m in a depressive cycle and it’s the worst one in years. The schizophrenia cycle is what I’m assuming is to be next because I’m already starting to show thought disorder symptoms and cognitive decline. No hallucinations or nightmares just yet. Slight delusional ideas/compulsions and some paranoia but not bad yet. If I were to guess I’d give myself another week and a half before that cycle really sets in. 

This summer I switched antipsychotics and got off two antidepressants so my doctor wants to reverse all of it because it is probably what’s making everything so bad right now. He wants to pull me out for the semester and if he hospitalizes me the school will make me leave for a whole year. Plus it will be on my adult record and not sealed like my other hospitalizations.

I don’t know what to do. I want to give up, but I don’t want to make them feel like they’ll fail too."
822,I really want to normalize being sad over past insults,"It’s okay to feel hurt over someone’s past words to you. It’s okay to still be mad at them. It’s okay for you to have boundaries around them. It’s okay if you haven’t forgiven them, especially if they haven’t sought forgiveness in the first place.

We focus a lot on healing and moving forward which is all really important. But I really wanted to stress how important it is to let yourself be mad. Someone hurt YOU. Someone upset YOU. Someone made YOU cry and question your worth or your importance and didn’t apologize for it. There is nothing wrong with being angry or sad about that from time to time. There’s nothing wrong with still holding onto that.

As long as you still have the intention to at some point heal and let go, you are okay. There is no rush here. Words and actions can sting, especially from those you thought could never harm you. Be sad. Don’t feel bad for being angry. You weren’t in the wrong. You’re a human being and someone was an asshole to you. You’re allowed to still be sad."
823,Need advice for a child.,"Hello, I've never been to this sub but I need some advice on how to help a 10 year old girl. I'm her sister and our mom has become mentally ill. She talks about things that don't make sense, and thinks drones are following her. Without getting into much detail, I need help. My sister was with me for 4 months before my mom made her go home and now cause of covid I am not allowed to have her back. We have never stayed in one place long so even now my sister goes from house to house (between cousins). Either way, my sister is scared to be around our mom alone because she talks about random things. I explained that she is not being violent and I know it doesn't make sense, but told her not to get into fights with her and just to be passive I guess. 

But, I really don't know what to tell her, she understands she is sick and mentally ill. She has a lot of family around her always ( mom lives with her 2 sisters) 

I really need some advice on how to help my lil sister with words and what to tell her and how should she act? Can anyone tell me anything?"
824,What to do?,"What do you do if you have no friends to confide in, no money for help, and don't trust apps or internet help because its common knowledge that data is stored."
825,How do I stop feeling like guilty when I find out someone I looked up to is a bad person?,"I'm not going to get into details, but I recently found out that somebody I looked up to is a horrible person, and I feel guilty that I ever supported them. This is far from the first time this has happened, and every time, I feel extreme guilt. I know it's ridiculous for me to blame myself for something I didn't know about, but I don't know how to not do that. My brain just automatically starts screaming ""You're a horrible person!""

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."
826,i need some advice about myself,"i have anger issues, i dont let people disrespect me.  because it makes me super mad and i get crazy thoughts if i let it happen.  so through my actions ive made that known at school and everyone shows me respect at school now since 10th grade.  but the only person who still disrespects me is my mother, i dont ever disrespect her, be she totally disrespects me.  ex: i told her my computer stand is junk and it made me drop my computer, she tells me “you shouldve done a better job shopping”, i tell her “what!? it wasnt my fault!  why u gotta say rude stuff like that for huh?” she said “i dont care”.  so boom my blood starts pumping, but i have a lot of self control towards my mom, because shes my mom.  so i hide my anger with her so she doesnt know how crazy i really am but i get thoughts about just grabbing her by her neck and just shaking her or full on strangling her when she says shit like that to me.  but what i did was i walked upstairs when she said she didnt care, then i walked back down and said “thats why i dont respect you” and walked back to my room but she got super mad at that, and marched to my room yelled at my called me disrespectful little shit and stuff then my dad came out the bathroom and she started yelling at him like “YOU KNOW YOUR FUCKIN SON U HEAR HOW HE TALK TO ME,  TELL ME HE NO RESPECT ME”  but im 100% not sorry for saying that because its true, thats exactly why i dont respect her.  so am i wrong for that?  i just have a hard time showing her respect when she talks to me like that.  and i also feel like she makes a really big deal out of nothing.  if i could go back i would just not bring up my computer stand to her or not make the comment i made about not respecting her.  but im still upset and i never know what to think after these situations.  i think its just my own problem of me demanding too much respect from everybody and my problems of not being able to take disrespect.  but thats why i smoke weed because when i high i give less of a shit abt those kinds of things."
827,Not looking forward to next therapy session. Any advice?,"So long story short I’ve had a hell of a two weeks since my last session. I dread having to sit in front of her and recall these things because I feel like I’m going to be thrown into some kind of delusional fit because honestly I can’t even think about it for very long, and at the same time I’ve halfway convinced myself it didn’t happen and I don’t want someone to confirm that it did or pity me or really say anything to me about it anymore. Also, my brain is trying to convince me of some strange magical thinking related things that probably aren’t real, and I feel like if I get any kind of validation on the topic of the event that disturbs me will throw me into full blown delusions.

Sorry if that doesn’t make any sense. Any advice is really appreciated."

I feel super sad, can hear those voices again and just can’t stop over thinking, i want to cry and just get rid of this disgusting feeling that has woken up again!
Help me."
833,At what point do you accept that you’re an adult?,"Through visiting home this summer I just got really depressed about not being a kid anymore. I’m only 23 but I miss the days of growing up. It’s like an overwhelming sadness too where the only cure is to cry myself to sleep. Maybe it’s the financial instability, maybe it’s the fact I’m so far away from home where visiting often isn’t really an option, maybe it’s my dog I miss, I don’t know. What I do know is that when I’m at the house I grew up in I can’t seem to enjoy it because I’m so stuck remembering all the good times there. I just have an unbearable pit of sadness in my stomach all the time when visiting home because I know I’ll have to leave at some point. I know I couldn’t stay forever but I wish I could. Things were so much simpler and everyone was happier."
834,How do I stop letting people affect me so much?!,"I’m so fucking tired. So fucking tired of letting my anxiety get the best of me. This one friend has been fucking taking her anger and stress out on me and I’m fucking tired. We’re both in medical school right now studying for an exam and it’s like I try to help her, and EACH AND EVERY FUCKING TIME, she literally shits on me. No matter what I say to help, she turns it around. 

She started off this study period saying that she didn’t want to hear about the exam from me because she didn’t have time to listen to me worry about it. This hurt a lot guys but I respected it cuz I know she’s got her own stuff to worry about. Her dad passed away last year so I know it’s been a rough year but she shares with me about it since my dad died too several years back. 

Then she doesn’t do well on an exam and texted me about it, upset. 

Then me: you can do this, we have so many weeks left. me repeatedly texting her asking her if she’s okay and what not and then saying ”I know you don’t believe in yourself l, I believe in you. And I’m here for you if you need anything just let me know! I’ll keep my phone on me.” And she never responds so I make sure to repeat my well wishes and offer to bring food or whatever she needs. I also emailed about different strategies we could maybe have her start on to do better. 

Her: would you listen to your own advice if you’re in my spot?! I wasted so many hours last year helping you and now all you said “well okay if ya need help then I guess let me know”. 

Needless to say I was shocked. I literally could not sleep cuz I was worried about her and sent her so many texts and strategies and offered to email a tutor for her. She also knows I’m going through a lot of health issues and had been suicidal just recently. It’s taken me so much to get to this point and I feel like her words are pushing me back down. 

I feel like even with all of my health issues, I would never hurt her like that. I never dump my shit on someone if I’m upset. 

I ended up driving to see her 40 mins away and talked her down and it’s fine now and I can tell she feels guilty. But I was so drained after; it was an emotional rollercoaster and I was only trying to help her! I hadn’t said anything mean, it was me being supportive and she somehow turned it into something else. I’m just tired. I couldn’t even go back to studying after."
835,Proud of myself,"I’ve been going through some really really rough shit and it’s just been one thing after another after another and I’ve had really really strong urges to cut but instead I’ll do something to keep me distracted, like crafts or playing cards or something. I’m also over a year clean and I feel like cutting again would just make all that go out the drain. I’m proud of myself for not restoring back to it though, because I know I would regret it immediatly"
836,Mental abuse?,"Sorry I can’t type well right now I can’t stop shaking. I was in this incident that I ranted about in abuse. I couldn’t stop worrying and my heart keeps racing. I feel like it’s anxiety I tried to tell some friends but they’re no help at all. I just want someone to talk to.

837,What are the best ways to stop overthinking?,"Today I’ll tell you my stories. I used to be somebody that was identified with negative thinking, and it would make me very anxious.

I went through a lot of pain and bad situations in the past. I was an extremely shy and introverted type of person. I was bullied at school. My communication was terrible. No one liked me at a point in life, too many enemies. I know how the feeling is. 

 I always thought about why this happened to me and continuously beat myself up about it. I was still thinking about what the person feels about me. Why didn’t she reply to my text? Am I doing something wrong? It was constantly killing me.

Someone told me. Try to control your mind and feelings ?? How do I control my thoughts or feelings ?? 

I started meditating. But none of this worked for me. I found that the more I tried to control what I was thinking, the more that it actually was me vs. me…

But fortunately, I learned how to stop overthinking. I learned this the hard way. Now I am going to share all the secrets that make you a better person.

## SECRET 1: ASK YOURSELF, WHAT’S THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN? 

📷

(Pic: After Amazon’s rejection📷)

I remember the final semester in college; constantly worrying about my placement, was overthinking. What was I going to do if I didn’t get any job? Well, surely, my life would be over; all my friends and family will laugh at me. 

That was seriously the thought process going through my 20 years’ head.

Now fast forward three years. I found my bachelor’s degree certificate in some weird place in my house, and I was thinking about my placement. I rejected the final round of amazon’s interview. But today I just thank God for that rejection 

That is the perfect example of what your brain does to you. It starts to freak out with uncertainty. If you don’t clearly define the worst things, your brain will find a way to equate you to getting “no job” to you completely ruling your life. 

Seriously those are your either conscious or subconscious thoughts. What is through? The worst thing that will happen to you is ‘You try your best, and you fail” that’s it. First of all, why should you invest so much money? 2nd you try your best and learn so many things that your friends don’t even know. 

What if someone told me right now.. Go on stage and tell the same story in front of 1000 people. I have basically no public speaking experience. So if I gave a speech right now, it would probably suck. I might be awkward, but I would never, never refuse to do that. Why?

📷

(Pic: I worked really hard for this. But now what should I do with this certificate ?)

Because what’s the worst thing that can happen? It’s not the whole world is going to make fun of me; it’s not that people are going to try to kill me everywhere I go after the speech.

 What’s the worst thing that can happen? They will never ask me for a speech, and the crowd may think that the guy is not a good speaker. That’s it.. but who cares ?? 

So.. in this chapter, you learned, you always need to ask yourself what is the worst thing that can happen? And then, try to analyze your answer, and you will understand how ridiculous most of your worries are. Follow this step if you really want to stop overthinking. 

## SECRET 2. STAYING BUSY

Staying busy is another way to stop overthinking. Now I don’t mean the average working person. Actually, the people who over-analyze things most.

The guy who worked 8h days in the SEO industry, and then started thinking, what if SEO will die or what if my company fired me or what if AI takes full control in the SEO industry? 

I am not talking about that kind of busy person. Here how I like to stay busy… 

Read a book that I like

Doing any online course

Cook something new 

Work on a project I am passionate about 

Now here’s what happens when you do that, your brain can’t think two things at one time. It just doesn’t have the capability. You can try right now. You can’t think about your new project and at the same time, think of how much you eat pizza. 

📷

It’s not how your brain works. So the best way to get rid of the[ negative thoughts](https://www.mindspeace.com/can-you-cure-depression/) from your head, you need to put positive thoughts in your brain. 

Get busy with what you love, and your brain simply won’t even have the ability to worry.

838,Eating disorder advice,"Will going to a therapist be beneficial for an eating disorder? I feel so unstable with food all the time and it seems I only know is extremes: starving myself or binging constantly. I feel like I know what works for me and what doesn’t but obviously I know nothing bc I still struggle so heavily with food!! I just feel like a therapist wouldn’t help but I know that it will help at the same time but ahhh.

Does anyone have any experience in therapy for eating disorders who could give me some advice?"
839,"If your brain is tricking itself into thinking you are a ""faker"" how do you cope?","Sorry if this is the wing place, I'll take down the post of so.
I'm looking for help on how you guys cope with your brain trying to convince you that you aren't valid. I've been struggling to get help for a while, but am having trouble justifying it because there's that stupid voice in my head that's invalidating the issues I'm trying to address. 
Any help is appreciated, ya girl is having a really tough go at things. 
Thanks in advance."
840,Good made up excuses for multiple bruises on arms and legs?,.
841,Need excuses for multiple bruises on arms and legs?,Mainly the wrist area. Ideas anyone?
842,Anyone else beat themselves up,Whenever I make a mistake I feel bad for ages sometimes even days I find it hard to forgive myself and I think others will remember my mistake and not forgive me for example If I  made a mistake at work and the customer gets made because it can't be fixed i don't forgive myself for days and feel really bad i can't anyone else find it hard to forgive yourself and worry others will remember the mistake and like you less for it
843,Ideas?,[removed]
844,The spiritual significance of protecting your seed and why you must if you wish to manifest,
845,Has social media devolved us and made us more tribal than ever? Do you ever take breaks from the internet and/or social media because everything seems crazy in the world?,"Logically speaking, I try to be as objective and unbiased as I can be when I have moments of reflection. Right now, it just feels like social media has made humanity more tribal than it's ever been in a very long time. It just seems like you're either on one team or another and that you can't think for yourself or have views from either side.

I have to admit, it's become pretty depressing. I've done a little experiment where I've taken breaks from social media, and it does help a bit, but eventually main stream media makes its way to me via phone, TV and what not. I feel like I'll just have to use my internet for shopping and the weather, and just log out at this point. People are tribal, riots, racial tension is increasing, I just can't help but lose faith in humanity and I just stop caring so I become lazy and out of shape because I ask my self what's the point.

Have you ever taken breaks from social media? Did you recently leave social media altogether for good? How do you deal with everything that's going on right now? It just seems like nobody cares about being unbiased or truthful, they just want you to follow your narrative or you're automatically the enemy and I hate it. I thought we'd evolve past this animalistic tribal nonsense by now and find a way to colonize and reach other worlds much faster. It just feels like in some ways our technology has out evolved us and in some ways made us more tribal."
846,How do I tell my parents I think I need help,"Excuse me if I’m using the wrong flair. It’s my first time posting here. 
So I’m a teen and as long as I’ve known I do terribly in situations where I don’t know anyone or where I am. This can include in real life and online. I’ve always had a very difficult time with social interactions and it can sometimes force me to get in trouble (once I freaked out in an online class and got in trouble because I didn’t attend it).

I’ve tried to bring up the subject of my mental health multiple times but they brush it off. I really can’t take it anymore since my grades have started to fall a bit. I honestly do think I need help but I’m not sure how to tell them.
 
I’ve only been able to vent out my problems to a close friend but I really do want help. So if anyone has any tips on how to ask your parents about therapy I’d be glad."
847,Could this be anxiety?,"Whenever I'm under lots of stress, or in general just really upset about something I just can't help but give myself hits in the head, scratching myself, or just punch a bed or a pillow and cry. Do you think this could be anxiety or any other disorder?"
848,how do I like things like a normal person? at this point the things that make me happy end up being my only reason for wanting to be alive and i know that’s not healthy,"My brain is a fucking mess and I hate it. Everything that I love turns into one of the only things that makes me feel alive, whether it’s talking to my friends or playing D&amp;D. I don’t have any healthy coping mechanisms and I genuinely don’t know how to feel alive without relying on a hobby. I know that therapy is probably the only answer but all of my therapy experiences have been negative, so I feel like I subconsciously reject the idea of it and believe therapy makes things worse. I just.... don’t know what to do."
849,How do you feel when your actually suicidal?,I feel like to me its like an inevitable void that just hits you hard as fuck with negative emotions and overwhelming thoughts but what's your take?
850,Please help,Someone please help me. I need something to release my brain. I want to smoke really badly but cant. I want to cut but know i shouldnt. The voice is still telling me to slit my wrists in the street. Someone please help me i dont know what to do. Im going to hurt myself tonight i think :(
851,I’m starting to think I am legitimately just crazy (F23),"Was born 3 months early.
My mom tried to get me into mental health when I was like 3, for anger issues, they didn’t agree to see me until I was around 7. They told her I’m either bipolar or autistic.
I’m really loud as a kid and emotional and get bullied.

By the time I am 12 I develop an eating disorder and quit talking, also have a severe fear of insects and quit participating in things like gym class.
Refused to go to school more than 30% of the time. 
Self harm and depression.

Then I get sent to a social worker. She spends a year trying to say I’m autistic. The psychiatrist disagrees because I was “making eye contact” therefore just have anxiety.
Was diagnosed with anxiety, ocd and depression.
Put on anti depressants.
Was referred from the social worker to a psychologist. Psychologist spends a year trying to convince me I’m bipolar, psychiatrist disagrees because I’m not “going on shopping sprees, sleeping around, etc.”

Imo his reasons for thinking I don’t fit those diagnoses were kinda dumb. But they took me off the anti depressants because the psychologist kept telling them I was manic... ok.

Moved to a city, worked at mcdonalds(it was awful), was really weird around my roommate, got depressed, called in sick a lot, slept around, got taken advantage of, bought what I wanted, got suicidal multiple times, went to ER and got put on suicide watch, cycled through 3 different eating disorders, eventually got violent with a sibling. Had to move back in with my mom.

Now after I got into an apartment of my own I finally agreed to take meds and go to therapy again.

My dad was abusive and in therapy I was just talking about how shocked I was realizing I could have told the social worker or any psychologist because it wasn’t normal. Just really airing out everything I felt about the things he did.

I took lithium for bipolar disorder but as soon as I gained weight on it I quit. I was pretty deep in an anorexia relapse when I started taking them and two weeks later I was as heavy as I’ve ever been in the last 3 years. I was on and off lithium over the year and picked up alcohol so I haven’t been able to lose the weight, but I know I can’t make myself take them.

In the amount of time since I moved home and started seeing psychiatrists and psychologists I feel like they made my mental health worse..
I never would have started drinking if it weren’t for the lithium weight gain. And in my last visit with the psychologist she actually made me cry and when I walked out I knew I wasn’t going  back. She pissed me off and she wanted to pretend it was something else.
They made my health and motivation worse!

One of the visits with the psychiatrist he said “Oh I don’t think you’re bipolar.. I think you’re ADD with PTSD from abuse from your dad and maybe the bullying in school.. and maybe a few borderline personality traits.”

I just thought this was such a load of bullshit, that they just go “idk everything’s fucked up, you have everything.”
I got a call from mental health asking me one final time if I was going to schedule a new appointment with any member of my mental health team and I said no but I asked for my mental health file. I asked for a copy of my file. I have every right to a copy of my mental health file and it should be given to me.

I asked them if I could have a copy and they said they will close my file if I won’t see someone but that they will call me back in regards to me getting a copy of my file. I even asked them that if closing my file meant they couldn’t have a copy then not to close it.
They told me they would call and get me a copy. They haven’t called so far. 

For kicks, I decided to take one of those online screenings since I might not actually get my file. And I fit not just the borderline traits to a severe degree... but also 7 others, as in 8 of the 10 possible personality disorders.
I can understand where certian pieces of my personality point towards all 8, while I don’t believe I literally have 8 personality disorders I wonder if I could have 1. Because they all involve things I need to work on, things that might tie back to ptsd, pretty much all the reasons I can’t keep friends and have never had a boyfriend, all right there.
The reasons why I feel like my life is meaningless sometimes and I should just end it, not because I’m actively suicidal or sad but because my life might not be cut out for what I thought was my life’s purpose (to be an artist) 
I’m starting to think I’m delusional about who I really am, what I’m capable of. And whether I am far underestimating or far overestimating my potential is completely unclear to me.
All I know is that there is so much going on in my head constantly, I struggle with a bunch of different mental health issues constantly, I have fucked up self image, can’t control things I used to keep very controlled like my eating and feel extremely lonely.
I have a lot of mood swings and I feel like I need to do art/music the fact that I am not stresses me out a lot.
I also feel like I need to find a man, one who will take care of me and I don’t even care if the relationship is strictly sexual attraction as long as I feel wanted.
Anything that gets in the way of those two things just seems to make me mad.

I do love my family and enjoy being with them no that my father is out of the picture, but I can’t even express anything without feeling like everything would be better if I wasn’t there anyway. 

So it’s a lot. Everything is a lot."

853,loving myself (or trying to),"so, I recently found out that a ""friend"" of mine has been involved with a group of people who, with nothing better to do, spent their time making fun of, and making up rumours about, me.  Including but no limited to: ""her clothes are so ugly"" ""a guy liked her but she turned him down. she's a jerk"" (not true btw I heard rumours but none have been confirmed and he never confronted me) and so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

at first i thought ""I don't care I'm above that. And i kinda feel bad for them because they have nothing better to do"" but as time moved on.. I have started to feel more self conscious.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been informed that they made fun of the way I dress, and I usually pride myself in my colourful, fuzzy, and cheery outfits but now I feel just a little apprehensive about  the way i dress.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is nowhere near as important as many other people issues, but I just needed somewhere to vent. Thank you so much for reading!!

854,I feeling like I am going insane,"Every single day I feel like I am being watch and I just have to stop and stare at my surroundings, I hate talking to anyone about because I feel like they will just say I am faking. I feel like I am always being watched and that everything I have written down will be used against me. I don’t even know if I should post this but I feel like someone is always trying to get me.

Whenever I write stuff down I take this metal trash can I have a burn it. I have 4 encryptions on my computer and use a version a Linux so it will be harder to get into but I still think people are reading all my stuff. I don’t feel like I have anything that private. I have to convince my self that everyday people are not listen to my thought . I feel and believe some times that my thoughts are being read. I can’t keep going on like this I just feel so paranoid that it’s making me suicidal. My friends have been getting mad at me for not wanting to play online games with them or going and doing things with them because I feel like I am always being watched.

It’s gotten to the point were I carry I knife everywhere I go because I swear I see people coming for me and it may just seem like they are their but they are their to watch me and I know I am being delusional but I am still terrified and I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I am scared to be put on pill because that what they want me to do I mean do they really even know what in them and what they do. I am sorry I just start to ramble and get scared thinking about it an I don’t know what to do"
855,Why do people ask to be my friend because only because they pity me??,"I'm so tired of people who pity me. Whenever I'm in class or just any time at school, people always ask to be my friend, or they ask me to sit with them, or to hang out. I think they assume that I have no one to sit with or to hang out with, so they offer it to me to make me feel included and better about myself. I wish people would just stop talking to me because I know that they're only talking to me because they feel bad for me. But the sad truth is that they're right, I have no friends and they have the right to pity me. My mom is the only one who understands. She doesn't treat me special because I'm lonely and have no friends, she just goes about her day and makes me food. How do I make people see that I'm not a sad and lonely boy even though I am? I don't want to be, but I also don't want to be given attention because of it either! I want to say this to anyone I've ever met besides my mom and grandparents: don't ask me to sit with you or to hang out or to be my friend when you know I dont deserve it and you just feel like youre doing charity work for good karma"
856,I don't know help,"I don’t really know where to start. Currently Im going through it again and I can feel myself going to a rather dark place. Im okay right now but I know that it wouldn’t take much more. 

I wake up crying, I have terrible dreams, Im forcing myself to do anything cause Im starting to feel comforted in the sadness again. I can feel all the progress I made in the last couple years slipping through my fingers every second of not being able to escape this. I am scared of myself cause I know what Im capable of. Right now I don’t wanna see myself go deeper but I am very much aware that I cannot hold myself to that. It’s like playing with fire. Every little change I make could get me over the edge. In a good or bad way. I don’t know what the consequences are anymore cause I’m so confused and unstable. I cant talk to the people here cause they’re a big part of the problem. And I know that I should be able to pull myself out there, but you can only help yourself so much and Im far past that point. My friends don’t know. Every time I tried to tell them I stop cause I notice that they don’t understand what Im talking about. I guess this is why Im writing this here. I don’t know"
857,Life is totally GrEaT,"Life is awesome. I mean who wouldn't enjoy this pile of sparkling beauty? It gives me so much joy when I start thinking about living 40 or 50 more years like.  I mean could have died and not have suffered through the last 29 years. But hey, who cares how I feel, amirite? At least my therapist, who gets paid a lot, and my family, who hates mentally ill LGBT people, is happy that I'm here. When I feel like rewarding myself I go to a therapist. It's an euphoric feeling to have someone look at you with a mixture of shock and feeling unable to help. I also have a doc who prescribes all pills I want because he's not sure how to help. Awesome."
858,Things are getting worse,"(21M) i can tell something is wrong... ive been in therapy since i was about 10, mostly for depression, anxiety and trauma from a cancer diagnosis i received 2 years prior. I stopped going all together when i was 16 or so, not long after i was diagnosed as bipolar. But recently my issues have gotten a lot more.. Frightening.  
I cant sleep anymore... i lay still for hours and sleep never comes. I can actually hear television static when i try to sleep or when im stressed out.. i can hear knocks and bumps and creaks all through the day when i never used to... it always feel like something is in the room with me. I lose entire chunks of my memory. Like entire hours of the day where i have no memories of what said or did. I find myself going to the bathroom or leaving the room and coming out again compleatly forgetting i had people in my house. I feel like im losing my mind but i cant bring myself to discuss this with my family"

860,Why do I constantly live like someone is watching me?,"Not like in the sense that a stranger is following me, but more like I have a camera on me, kind of a performance in a way.

Most of the time I'm imagining a specific person watching me. Sometimes it's a new coworker, sometimes it's the cashier I just had at the store, sometimes it's a youtuber I like. 

Logically I know nobody is actually watching me, and I don't talk to myself, but it affects the way I carry myself, my facial expressions, the music I listen to in the car. I hyperanalyze everything I do, even completely alone, because I want this nonexistent viewer of my life to think I'm cool/pretty/interesting.

I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year, and after researching and learning more about it I'm thinking I probably have Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria as well, so maybe it comes from that? Or something else entirely?

861,I (23F) can’t stop slapping myself in the face,"I’ve been unsuccessfully applying for jobs since May and I’m stuck at home with my single-parent family. As the eldest without a job, I feel absolutely useless, worthless, and just plain horrible. At the same time, I don’t feel comfortable expressing how I feel with my family since we’re not used to being emotionally vulnerable with each other. When I did have a breakdown in from of them a few weeks ago, my parent basically told me to shut up and pull myself together.

I do want to be strong. I hate that I feel all these negative feelings and can’t control them. I don’t know exactly how it got started but I started secretly slapping myself in the face a few days ago. Maybe I wanted to train myself to feel numb to pain. It has been growing steadily in frequency and intensity. 

On one hand (haha) I’m scared that it might lead to worse types of self-harming. On the other hand I feel like it’s working and I am starting to ween myself off of my emotions. I feel so conflicted about this. Please help"
862,I can’t focus on anything.,"It’s pretty simple but I can’t really focus on anything at all. About two weeks ago I used to be an avid drawer, I’d be able to go into an ultra-concentration-more where I can just sit there and draw. Same with doing school work, I was always fast efficient and good at it.

But for about two weeks now I can’t focus on anything, I used to love reading but now I can’t get through half a page. I can’t watch an episode of my favorite series without wanting to do something else. 

I moved to a new house about two weeks ago and that’s when it began, the first two days in the new house were normal, I was drawing, reading, just kinda being normal then suddenly one day I couldn’t focus. It’s not like anything changed. Just everything’s boring now. 

I’m not sure if it’s relevant but I’ve had anxiety and panic disorder for about two years now."
863,Hey guys I’m looking for some help,"I honestly don’t understand what’s happening to me and it would be of great help to understand what’s going on. I feel as if my thoughts have gotten extremely quiet almost to the point where I can’t hear them. It’s kind of hard to explain so let me give an example. A normal conversation between 2 people would go as such person 1 says something, person 2 would hear what the other person says, think about their response then say their rebuttals. While conversations for me end up like this, person 1 says something, the I say something without thinking about it whatsoever almost like it wasn’t me saying it. Ik it jus sounds like I have a lack of a filter but I know that’s not it, anyways this sensation has lead to a lack of emotions, and a lack of short term memory. Probably the worst part of it all though is that a lot of times my thoughts will just scream for no reason. I’m seeing a therapist but that doesn’t help, so if anybody has any info on what could be happening to me that would be greatly appreciated.

Things are actually going relatively well in my personal life, but I’m just constantly weighed down by this cloud of dread and worry and I’m struggling to cope with it more and more. I’m not sure I’m even well informed enough to put the blame for my worry on the state of the world, as ninety nine percent of my news comes from Reddit and facebook.

One morning I woke up and didn’t have that same drive anymore. If I could describe my state right now it’s kind of like I’m in nothingness. I feel very numb, and it’s almost like I have no desire for anything. But at the same time, I am not depressed. I have been depressed before but this doesn’t feel like that. I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated because it’s like all my desire is gone. I WANT to be passionate about self improvement, but it’s like there’s this mental block preventing me from doing that. All the things I have been working towards for the past two years of my life suddenly make me question why I wanted them in the first place. I don’t even crave the good tasting sugary food I would never refuse. I don’t feel sadness, inspiration, joy. I don’t feel anything right now and it’s freaking me out a bit.

How do I get my excitement back? I always thought I would never lose my love for self improvement, but now it seems like such a neutral topic to me. My birthday is in five days yet I do not feel anything. I earned a good amount of money this week yet I do not feel anything.

Does anyone relate to this?,"When I was real little, give me fish, greens, tea, what have you and I’d put up no fight. But by the time I was 8-10 years old, I was already a chubby little sh*t. Somewhere along the line, I became very selective. It wasn’t texture, I couldn’t tell you what it was. Now a days, people online tell me to just “be an adult.” But I had favorites, and things I wouldn’t touch. The main veggies I eat are corn and potatoes, maybe onions if they are virtually invisible and tomatoes in sauces and the like. I usually eat things that are a combination of things I already like put together, or assembled in a different manner. I’ve started trying to taste new things here and there in the past year, and I even blow up significantly less of you bring me the wrong version of something I like. I still like sniffing things before I try them, though. I also tend to get fixated on certain foods (one summer it was chicken quesadillas, another it was cherry mt dew, so on and so forth) for weeks or even months and then completely get burned out. I’ve always hated tap water, couldn’t stand it, drinking too much at once makes me want to hurl but I do consume sugar free sparkling flavored stuff from Walmart on some occasions now. I stopped losing the will to exercise or play as much when I moved out of the city as a tween but I think my medications were the big bulk gainer. It’s also super frustrating because my body is already hard to fit into clothes properly without 350 pounds of fat to work around."

I don't have that spark that brings that permanent joy to my life where other people I see have who is not as fortunate as me. I am also an impatient person, I want to do things but time is too slow and too fast at the same time. So I guess it is depression + lack of motivation + tired of living, some of you may understand me. But I am young I should be joyful and active and passionate. (I have 0 passion). This makes me sad.

876,I think I might be bipolar? But I might just be projecting,"So I have definitely struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. 

But, I’ve noticed my medication (after trying a few over the last couple years) seems to be fairly ineffective on my depression, and I’m worried it’s because I’m actually undiagnosed bipolar.

My mom was apparently diagnosed bipolar when I was 2. Being the way she is, she never saw the doctor again and said they were full of shit and she was just overworked from having a new baby. 

Whether or not it was bipolar, my mother was pretty severely mentally ill with something. She was close to completely dysfunctional and only really survived because my dad was a huge enabler. 

Because of her illness and my dads denial of it, she was able to create a really controlling abusive environment for my brother and I. 

From a young age I showed signs of depression and anxiety. I would become terrified in elevators, worrying about all the things that could go wrong, like getting trapped having it fall to the ground floor etc. and sometimes I would suddenly be struck with intense sadness (like I would suddenly think about the fact that everyone I knew would one day die). 

And this was happening starting at age five or six. I often felt like I had no control over my thoughts and my brain was tormenting me. 

I would also sometimes feel very energetic and happy and other times very tired. (Which could be normal kid stuff but it always felt strange, like mild euphoria and mild exhaustion just from normal daily activities). I would also have either intense mental clarity or heavy brain fog. 

That pattern of intense anxiety, depression, energy and exhaustion continued for years until I began taking anti depressants.

Then the anxiety mostly went away, as did some of the more severe bouts of depression. Although sometimes they do still happen. But I still feel tired really frequently, and unmotivated. My brain also feels foggy still.

The thing is, I started taking medication around the same time I left home, so I don’t know how much severe mood instability is naturally me and how much it was just a result of my mother’s abuse. 

I will be discussing this with my doctor soon, but any input in the meantime is appreciated. Even alternative potential diagnoses  
Thanks :)"

I need to get this out and I feel like I can't talk about it with the people in my life, and the Reddit community is just so amazing, so I'm hoping it will help to just vent to you guys.
I feel like I'm losing my footing and my mental health is suffering because of it.
I just feel like I lost direction, I don't know where my life is going and why I'm doing what I'm doing.
I've been having a lot of sex lately, but I just feel used afterwards, even when we cuddle and talk I feel it's just so shallow, like they don't really care about me and my well-being. 
Basically, I feel used, like all everyone ever wants from me is sex. And I love sex, but I also need more. 
Note, I have multiple Lovers. Maybe that's the issue. But I just can't find anybody who is willing to commit and offer more then just casual sex.

880,Unable to enjoy life due to paranoia,"This lockdown has been the worse for me because I've recently started thinking that both my computer and phone are being are being remotely controlled by someone. I already reformatted, changed my password, hell even bought a different computer, and swapped to an iPhone and yet I still feel like they compromised those too. 

I never installed or downloaded shady files, never visited shady websites, always had an adblocker. Hell, even had Arch Linux with strict security controls. My Android phone barely had apps besides my favorite game and some open source apps.

I can't enjoy playing my favorite mobile game nor be able to do college work. I can't even use my phone for more than 15 minutes. I'm using my dad's computer just so I could do some work and browse the internet. 

I feel like they know my passwords, have my personal information, and all the shebang, but for some reason they aren't blackmailing me or breaching my accounts yet. I don't know the goal or purpose. I am a literal nobody with almost no money to my name. Maybe they want me to become like this because ""it's funny"" or some shit.

Just yesterday, I was deleting some emails. Initially, I only wanted to delete sensitive stuff but there was one email that I considered sensitive but changed my mind in the middle. I know I selected it but for some reason when I went to the Trash folder to delete the emails completely, my mind suddenly registered that I didn't selected said email. I then started blaming the hacker that he/she selected it remotely.

I do know that I'm becoming more forgetful but I don't know if I could link it to that because I'm not that forgetful + there are other different triggers. I'd like to explain fully in the comments what started all this + other things that triggers my paranoia if I had the permission to. It's too long to explain in the post."

Everytime I talk in real life, or on a different platform or account online, I feel like there's always a distinctly different personality in me. It's as if I'm playing a character role which is very different every time I talk but still identifies as my own name.

Like not even a small difference, it's always completely different. It's stressing me out and making me wonder if I've lost myself, or never even had a personality in the first place. I also enjoy just talking to myself while portraying my different personalities, it's cool and all but at the same time frustrating.

but i am also very passive about all this. i have suicidal ideations and sadly think about this nonstop somehow, but i don’t plan on really committing it any time soon. i think i really just couldn’t bring it and do it.
often times i do wish i were just dead, or that i could just somehow die in anyway, to get finally fucking peace and quiet, because this mind of mine is driving me fucking nuts. really. but i don’t have actually any plans to commit suicide in the end.

885,My parents f*cl with my head,"Oncw your down, your down for good until you break.

It can be the smallest of things, the tone of your voice, how fast you are walking, the way you are walking, literally anything he dislikes and he'll tear you apart, same with my mum.

I've suffered years of depression because I didn't do well in school. I'm 30 now and only just addressing why I don't feel at home and feel negative when I'm at my parents.

I'm back at my parents due to COVID.

We've addressed everything and things seems like they are getting back on track, but the smallest of things can go wrong, like I'm indescisive, use my dad's toilet (through his office), forget something and come back inside - THATS IT, that's your whole day gone and you are their b*tch and nothing will stop until I break.

It's brutal. Last Friday, I stepped out the door and remembered that I left something for my brother inside so went back to get it. As soon as I did they came down on me like a tonne of bricks.

Now my dad won't drop anything and treats me like a disease.

As a result I feel very emotionally f*cked up. 

He's just gone to bed acting like a little child because I have him a 'one word answer'. He asked if I had cheese with my meal, what do you want an essay?

He basically destroys my self esteem and then complains that I don't talk.

It always turns out the same way, I basically have to beg to get his respect back. It's a vicious circle and then they complain that I'm not getting on with my life.

They NEVER admit they are wrong and it gets to such a point that I either break or get severely depressed because they deny my emotions.

When I break my mum gets involved and gaslights me saying that I need to see a psychiatrist and get counselling.

I've had years of this.

They get off on it, it gives them power and the only time o have fully addressed it was recently and it felt sooooooo good. I felt so good, so content and myself again after all these years.

But my mum didnt like it, not one but, she stayed in her room from when I addressed it until Friday when the 'incident' happend.

When I came home after my brother's on Friday she brand up a load of things that she considered 'abnormal'; the fact that I'd eaten half my chocolate bar and put the rest back in the fridge. The fact that I was indescisive and other very minor things, that looking back, aren't abnormal. Like if I cough too loud.

When I asked her to back off a little, she brang on the waterworks and said she was only.trying to help, making me feel guilty, she then locked herself in her room.

This angered my dad and gave him ammunition to continue treating me like dirt.

And so the cycle continues

FUCKING TWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTSSSSSS

The first incident a week ago I saw two in my kitchen. I went to the tallest point in my house, cried, couldn’t breathe, screamed and quivered for ten minutes. I told my mom but she isn’t taking me seriously and tells me to get over it. To make me feel better she set up a couple traps and we got this sonic sound thing in the wall and that thing isn’t doing anything.

A couple days later we caught our first mouse. I was uncontrollably shaking while my mom threw it in the outside trash can. 

A couple days later right before I went to go brush my teeth before bed I saw another one scurry away in the corner of my eye. It shook me up.

About 15 minutes ago I was in my bed. I was about to fall asleep and started hearing loud scratching I immediately climbed out, took my phone with me and as I looked back I saw the end of a mouse going into my closet under the door. 

Right now I feel on the verge of throwing up, I’m super pale, crying and shaking. I feel so helpless. 

Other things I’ve been doing is every step I take I look around and make sure I can’t see mice, it takes me about a minute to get across my small kitchen. I clear out the floors of every room I go into to make sure they aren’t hiding in plain sight. 

My mom is going to take a picture of a hole we found on the foundation of my house and get the landlord to hire someone to patch it up. 

Do I have a phobia? Also I’m in Alberta so there aren’t any rats here, just mice."

I feel like i want to hurt people not particular people i just want to kill people it would be so satisfying, and I know that this makes me seem like a horrible person and that's true I deserve to die and I'm a disgusting human being.

892,I feel terrible if someone criticizes me even though I know they are wrong.,"Has anyone else goes through it.

I got a negative message like 1 hours ago. I know it was completely false but I my chest immediately felt sunken. I am anxious and like fever too since.

Does anyone else go through this? How would you deal with this?"
893,Every year I feel like I’m becoming a little less human,"I don’t know. I’m trying to post these thoughts different places to find some way to get them to go away. Giving advice helps. Helping people helps. But talking to people...doesn’t help. 

Whenever someone gives me advice it’s not like,”Oh! You know what; that’s great advice! I’ve never thought of it that way before; thank you!!” It’s like, “Yes...while that may be a rational perspective on the current situation it utterly fails to encapsulate the essence of my problem...” Of course I don’t say it like that. I say thank you and politely end the conversation. 

I feel like I’m always saying thank you and politely ending the conversation. Even when I don’t really mean thank you and don’t really want to be polite. Even when your unsolicited advice both begged the question with reference to knowledge or skills you are assuming I didn’t already have. Even when your questions revealed a deep underlying ideological incompatibility with me. Even when the very words you used to ask the question were enough for me to decide I never want to voluntarily engage with you ever again in my life. 

It’s not that I’m smart. I’m not smart and I don’t really think in those terms anyway. I happen to have a fair understanding of basic formal logical arguments. Not even fancy math stuff just basic syllogisms and fallacies. But the basic knowledge, despite getting me nowhere closer to actual objective truth, really just pulls me farther away from other people because I can see the mistakes they make. And there’s always mistakes. And no matter how many times you prove other people wrong it will never convince them that you’re any more likely to be right. 

I don’t ever want to interact or engage with another human again...It’s fine when interactions are ephemeral, singular, thanks for the coffee I’ll never see you again...but the second somebody wants me to engage or god forbid be vulnerable I want to get the hell out of dodge. It benefits me fucking zero. There is absolutely no wisdom you will be able to offer me that will do anything other than ruin this day for both of us more than it already has been. 

I don’t want to be this way. I sound like an insufferable prick. But I don’t want to deal with other people...more. 

When I was 17 I took a set of vows to try to give me like a code or something. Man has to have a code. It was supposed to be about protecting life and saving the world, if it needed it. I’m satisfied with most of the work I did to try to get that to happen. But at the time, I justified it to myself with a girl I was in love with, who had ghosted me. I told myself “I’ll save the world for you. Wherever you are. Even if I never see you again. That’s enough.” 

Well, as romantic and sweet as that sounds, I eventually realized that what she had done to me was traumatic and not okay and she really wasn’t ever somebody worth sacrificing a single second of my life for. I didn’t immediately revoke my vows, because I’m better than that, but now I’m in the awkward position of having vowed to save the world for someone that never really existed. Or, alternately, trying to save it just to prove a point. Let me tell you, it is much less fulfilling than it was before."
894,Why doesn't it feel like I earned it?,"I recently got into a relationship with the person I've wanted for literal years, but they were taken, so I never had a chance, we've been together a few weeks now, and I'm happy I think, but I also feel like I didn't do anything to deserve her, or to deserve being happy."
895,We're all so scared,"I'm starting to get tired of my reluctance, my second guesses, my ""oh but what if"". Have you ever done something so radical, so spontaneously, so freeing, that you know you'll never do it again because of that little coward in your head?

I'm waiting, I feel like I've wasted time, I know someone like me will never make it, so why not have some personal time? I really want to do something that will get my heart pounding, something REAL. I'm sick of being told to distract myself with TV, video games, ""the great outdoors"", why should I? Ignorance is bliss maybe what I'll think, but I'll live knowing I tried, isn't that what really matters? 

I think I might do it soon though, something worth my time. Something worth MY time, not something that has to benefit anyone else, just me. I've always been a little selfish. 

We're all so scared of doing that thing we really desire to do, maybe I'll be the one that does it. Thoughts?"
896,I wanna isolate myself again. I'm at a point where I don't feel very special,Idk I'm so privileged and I don't like complaining but tonight is different.
897,I'm seeing things,"Hello,  
I would like to learn a bit about what I'm experiencing.

There are periods of time in my life where I wake up in the middle of the night and for a couple of seconds see stuff. I'm 100% conscious during that time. I'm able to tell myself ""oh, again... boring, gotta keep looking for it to go away"" and it always vanishes in front of my eyes (not even after I blink, it just blends with the background) after about 10-15 seconds.

The things I see are mostly my phobias or stuff I'm currently (more or less) afraid of. Most of the time I'm seeing a giant spider hanging above my head (I have arachnophobia). It's always a different looking spider, most of the time they are unrealistic (have mounds of dirt on the back or are covered in webs sticking out like needles etc.). Once a smaller, normal looking spider ran through my bed next to my head and vanished, so normal ones appear as well.

When it first started happening a few years ago I actually kept jumping out of the bed with fear (especially once when I looked down at my sheets and it was all covered in black, spiky cobwebs).  
One time it got so frequent that I asked my mom to buy me a blindfold to sleep in.

I know it's not just a dream, because my girlfriend experienced my ""condition"" first hand. The weird thing is that when I'm sleeping with her I'm less conscious when it happens. I have less control.  
So I saw bugs (flies and other insects) on the ceiling of her room once. I woke up, looked at it and said unprompted: ""Look, Look at all of them, can you see them?"", it scared the sh\*t out of her of course. Next day she told me I was looking at an empty ceiling, mumbling for a while (saying the above words), then lied down and went to sleep like nothing happened (which is totally not what I used to do when that happened).

Since we're living together now, I'd like to stop scaring her.

There are many other examples. Mint saplings growing out of our bed (after I drank a bit of mojito). A lump of pine needles and moss levitating above my head. A lump of tiny, moving spiders lying next to my head. 

What may be causing this? I know it's not sleep paralysis. It happens very rarely now, but still - had it last night.  
Thanks for reading."

903,HAE skimmed through and read chapters of the DSM-V and/or the ICD-10??,"OK so OBVIOUSLY there will be plenty of people in this subreddit that have had a level of psychological education, therapists, psychologists etc. 

Sorry but this is not about you guys 😉

I'm talking to the regular people out there that maybe just have a general interest in psychology or mental health. Maybe you or someone you are close to is suffering, told you the symptoms they experience and you are seeking further understanding..

Personally, mental health has played a part throughout my entire life. Whether it was my own or someone else's, I have always seemed answers.

On my journey to understand my own mind and what may or may not be contributing to my thought patterns and behaviours, I learned of these two books. Of course I wanted to find the most accurate information, so what better to use than the manual actual professionals use!! This has lead me to find several books to read through on CPTSD and childhood trauma, along with having a MINIMUM of roughly 12 separate tabs on my phone relating to mental disorders, coping mechanisms, personal experiences... 

It has reached the point that a few people in my life has told me its a slightly obsessive level of research. Particularly as I am in the process (thankfully near the end) of being screened and tested for a number of disorders, and it may be exacerbating my mental state on days im struggling more. I now make a point to not overload my brain, specifically on my lower days.

Now I freely admit that i have not read them both cover to cover, Im fairly certain that that would be too much and too complicated for me to truly understand and appreciate, but I have to admit, the more I learn, the greater the urge to delve deeper into the workings of different types of minds becomes. Having had counselling from the age of around 6(?), it is an area of work that I have long dreamed of doing and I hope to one day actually follow through with going back to education and going down that route.

So, has anyone else  NOT with an educational background in the field, gone and done research this extensive AND what were your reasons behind it??"

905,I'll most likely die young,"Ik the title can seem a little dramatic but i really dont see myself living to an older age, ive been through some stuff and stress is starting to overwhelm me again im 17 and university applications are starting and i never even thought about it ( i have no idea what im gonna do and i dont have a passion for anyhting) , idk what im gonna do with my life and in all honesty i've always had in the back of my head that if things didn't work i out i would probably just kill myself.

That sounds really insensitive to say but its something i just think about alot, right now my life doesn't have much meaning in and ive learned to go with the flow and have started really ignoring everything that once bothered me. I dont even feel like im here alot of the time. The only things i really enjoy is anime and painting. They let me ignore everything else. Ive just really detached myself for whats going on and just gone with the flow, quarantine and completing school at home has only enabled that more.

im not sad and in all honestly quarantine is helping me (?) but i know that when i have to make big decisions that pave the rest of my life, im just being sucked up into something i dont even want to do, but i have to theres no other way.

That will just spiral me into a hole of depression and i know ill be stuck and will struggle to get out, i know myself to well.

Ive had suicidal thoughts before when i was in a really dark place (i don't have depression nor have i been diagnosed, i dont want to self diagnose but earlier this year i was stuck for 3 months ) but im in a good place now because i pulled my self out of it after 3 long months because i was scared i was actually going to do something really bad that i would regret and my parents started talking about a doctor.

Its just when i think about my future im not excited and in all honesty im just going with the flow, ik that i'll fall into a pit again, its just a matter of time. And once school ends and i get sucked it this uni shit i'll most likely give in, ill try but ill give in.

What im trying to say is that i didn't plan to stay around for this long and in the back of my head ik i probably wont last very long when things start getting too real and im left to my own devices.


Just needed to get this out, im not gonna do anything now but i can feel the weight piling up again. sigh"

907,Past child abuse and gas lighting from mother.,"Hi,

So I’m a 20 yr old female and I haven’t been living with either of my parents (split when I was 11) for about 3.5 years. I now live on my own with my partner and my youngest sister who I look after in a different state away from everyone. I lived with my grandparents for about a year while I was still in school. 

Being away from everything has sent me into this weird mental state. I was advised to get away if I could from mental health professionals. Putting distance in between abusive parents and yourself is a good idea if you can manage it. I totally agree, and now I find myself questioning everything. I’m so confused and so depressed. I have body pains and chronic fatigue despite doctors finding absolutely nothing wrong with me.

The pandemic hasn’t really affected me too much, however I empathise with those suffering with it. I live in Australia and was already super depressed anyway. I have GAD and major depression. I’m starting to question whether I have PTSD.

I was physically, emotionally, verbally and mentally abused as a child and especially as a young teen, not to mention being bullied at school mainly as a tween/young teen. My father pretty much only physically abused me sometimes, although his subsequent partners I’m sure were narcissistic or sociopathic. 

My mother has done some horrible things to me, she would constantly scream at me every single day all the time, swearing, calling me names, throwing things at me, etc. when I didn’t do anything wrong. I was a quiet child, shut down, hated confrontation, never dared go near drugs, alcohol, parties, etc. and yet she told everyone I was a horrible child who was out of control. I used to get strange looks walking down the street which made me afraid to go out (small country town). She then would proceed to tell me that she never did anything like that and it was all me and all my fault. This continued for years and really took a lot out of me.

I was also a high achiever at school but that went downhill in my later teens when the abuse really started to affect me physically.

I don’t even know what to do with myself. Does anyone have any suggestions? Obviously I haven’t put everything in this post because it’s long enough as it is. Anything would be much appreciated."

909,How to casually tell your parents that you’re struggling?,"I’ve battled mental illnesses for more than half of my life, and my parents have never been supportive. 

They’ve known that I’ve struggled with self harm since I was 10, as well as anxiety, depression and eating disorder behaviours. 

They have never listened to me or pushed me towards getting help, they’re always sceptical and dismiss all my problems. 

I’ve seen multiple psychologists before, but they always freak out and try and recommend me to another psychologist, and with restricted work hours I can’t afford therapy at the moment. 

I try and get support from my friends, but they always get scared and step back saying they “don’t know how to handle it”, which I can’t get mad at. It’s very scary and I can’t blame them for not wanting to be involved. 

As scary as it is to admit, I’m really not doing well. I’ve grown used to the persistent suicidal thoughts, but recently it’s been a whole other level and I know I need to act on it soon before it literally kills me. 

I have no one to talk to, no one supporting me. I have absolutely no one. All I have left are my parents. 

I need them to listen and take me seriously, but how do I just casually tell them how much I’m really struggling? When they’ve never believed me or actually cared about my mental health?"

911,How do I get my brain back,"Im 17 years old and I’ve dealt with MDD and ADD my whole life. I’ve essentially done nothing with my teenage years, I flunked out of school, pushed everyone including my family away from me, never had a girlfriend despite having had the opportunity, and either Slept up to 20 hours a day or spent days awake during fits of what I can only describe as “mild psychosis” (not diagnosed). I had a few phases where the depression wasn’t so bad that allowed me to teach myself basic human shit people usually learn when they’re young. Now that I’m ready to move forward I find that my brain still hasn’t recovered from all those years of shit, my memory is abismal and my will power, which used to be so powerful, is pathetic. I try and I try and I try but I never seem to be able to progress anywhere mentally. All I want is for everything to be in working order so I can finally put all of this behind me. I don’t have anybody to really talk about this kind of stuff with so anything is appreciated."
912,Is there a possibility that I might have ADHD?,"'ve always ignored the possibility of me having it because people have considered me as someone who is intelligent and ""book smart"" and I've always had average to great grades throughout elementary school to university. However, I do possess certain symptoms of ADHD that are of particular concern to me. These symptoms have been present ever since elementary school (I'm almost 24 now)

 • I am very forgetful. I've been locked out of my apartment 3 times in the last 5 weeks. I've been late in paying my rent often as well. When I go grocery shopping I keep finding out that I've forgotten to get some important things after I've gone home even though I've compiled a list of things to buy before I leave home. This happens quite often. I also run around in circles aimlessly a lot in the grocery store.

 • I have difficulty concentrating in conversations sometimes. I do hear what the people are saying but I fail to listen on some occasions. Instead of processing whatever they say, I might have a random song playing in my head. I space out even more whenever the conversation is about something that I have no knowledge/interest in.

 • I daydream a lot and I don't know why. People (friends, family and teachers) have often made remarks about how I am not ""present"" and that my mind is always somewhere else. My friends often think that I'm on drugs because of how ""spaced out"" I look to them. I also have some instances where I feel like I'm experiencing life in the 3rd person and I don't feel like I'm really experiencing things.

 • I'm almost 24 and I've never held a long term job. Past employers have made remarks about my lack of work ethic and initiative. I can't seem to take action unless someone orders me to do something. My tendency to daydream might have something to do with it.

 • I hate to do lists. Whenever I compile a list of things to do I start off strong for a little while before getting distracted by a certain thing/s and ignoring all the tasks that need to be done and I decide to do my own thing.

 • I have difficulty following instructions. I'm in culinary school right now and we cook meals everyday. A lot of the times when I'm given a recipe to a certain dish I forget to include a crucial ingredient, or skip over an important step of creating the dish and it has affected my performance in the kitchen. 

 • I love to fidget. Whenever I'm sitting alone in my room or even out at a restaurant i have restless leg syndrome often and love finger drumming on my table.

 • My friends, family and teachers in culinary school have all thought that I have problems with being organized with my tasks as well as time management. I generally agree with them. I'm a very messy individual and whenever I wake up in the morning I am always clueless as to what I should be doing during the day.

I've taken a blood and thyroid test and everything seems to be normal. I just don't know what's wrong."

914,A few questions about getting mental health care.,"What is the most cost efficient way to get therapy?

How do you begin to get mental help and medication?, for example do you go to a general practitioner or straight to a psychiatrist or specialist or some kind. 

Can you go to an urgent care and receive the desired results for this kind of issue? since going to a regular doctor takes very long (at least where i am) and only operate at standard work hours.

How do you make meditation work, if you have failed to do so on prior attempts?

How do you form therapy sessions around a work schedule?

How do you make yourself more susceptible to help, since most aid sounds impractical?"

Training was online so it was easy to pass that but now they're sending me emails about clients and I haven't prepared. Its going downhill too quickly.

Also a couple of weeks ago I got referred to a psychiatrist because my GP thinks I might have bipolar, but I wasn't able to get an appointment before September 24th. So now I'm just waiting. I was diagnosed with major depression and social anxiety 3 years ago.

It feels like this is the first time my effort has really mattered, and I just can't pull through. I felt a plummet like 3 hours ago, it just feels like a spiral.

Any tips on self-meditating? Something that might work for someone with bipolar 2.

I am so angry. So frustrated. 

Ive been waiting to make plans with psychologists  for a year now (sometime it was my mistake bc I didnt went to psychiatrist, most of the time theirs) for appointment.

So I finally went  today  and oh my good. I dont know if I imagined but this was like not the person I remember from the last year(just went there once). I did some big test and then we talked for a bit. I felt patronized. She asked me what I want from therapy so I told her to process things from childhood  (trauma), to work on my relationship  and to be a better person. Also I added that I don't  want to just talk bc Ive been talking my whole life about traumas and It's not helping rhat much , I would rather process. 

Lol so here's  problem, she told me I have problems with authority (um?lol?),also she made some kinda jokes  that were  like she was a big joker and i felt very uncomfortable, also it looked so unprofessional  to me. 
Then she started to told me  i am smart and intelligent, i felt it was not sincere and asked her is she's  making fun of me and being sacrcastic.she said no. And I accepted that.

Just general feeling was very uncomfortable and weird  being there, I feel so small after this. I dont know if I'm  imagining  this all or if she is not my best fit. Bc I didnt sleept well so  maybe I was more irritated then usual. I will need to go few times more to see, I guess."

923,I can feel myself slipping again and I’m terrified,"I (22F) wouldn’t class myself as a social person, but I love being around the people I care about. Crowded clubs? No thank you. Drive to the beach with two of my good friends? Paradise.

Obviously lockdown has made seeing people impossible, but as the restrictions in my country are lifting I’m realising that I have maybe one person near me that I could class as a good friend and she has a wide circle of friends that I don’t get invited into. 

I suffered with depression in my teenage years which mostly stemmed from anxiety and serious body issues. I managed to overcome that, but recently I’ve noticed my mental state slipping and it is terrifying me.

I live with my partner (25M) and for two years it’s worked out that if I am in a social mood I go out and see my friends as he is not a social person in the slightest, but talks to his friends constantly while playing games on Discord. 

Recently, it might be my mental state, and the fact he is still furloughed and all he does is wake up and play games while ignoring me until it’s time for us to settle into bed, it’s become really hard for me. I feel like I’m not getting the attention I deserve, and because my one good friend is always busy either working (no problem there) or with her other friends, I sit in my house and have absolutely no one to talk to. Not even on messenger or text. No one. 

I spend time with my family because we are all extremely close, but if they are busy for whatever reason I’m left alone again. And this is when my mind starts reeling.

I am so so SO lonely. My partner doesn’t have the empathy to realise just how much it hurts me, and sitting on my own hearing him have a good laugh with his friends in the office hurts even more. Because of lockdown as well, my body image issues has Claire’s up again because I’ve gained weight, and that’s just another edge of the sword that’s being stabbed into my heart on a daily basis. We haven’t been physically intimate for a month now, and while he assured me it’s because he has no sex drive because ‘he’s lazy’, he doesn’t articulate his points very well and my mind always goes back to ‘we aren’t being intimate because of me.’ 

No one texts me. No one bothers to check up on me. I have made an effort to text first and catch up but the conversation goes stale because of their lack of response. 

I feel like a nuisance because I’m always trying to hang out with my friends, but they’re always busy and end up not seeing my messages until hours later even thought they’re online. To clarify, I don’t blame them, we are adults and have adult lives etc. But when I’m in this state, it really hurts knowing that I am always the one who makes the plans. No one makes an effort to see me, or hang out with me. 

I know lockdown has affected a lot of people’s mental health, me included so I know I’m not alone. But I’ve not been this bad since I was a teenager, and being aware of that is so scary to me."
924,Mind constantly going to the worst case scenario,Even about the smallest things. My thoughts always go towards the worst case scenario and I can't ignore or rationally think my way out of it. It's been like this for years and it always stresses me out. Do any of you experience this? Does it have to something with anxiety or wtf is it?
925,Brain scans should be invented to detect mental illness in patients,"For most mental illnesses, doctors don't use brain scans to detect a mental illness in a patient. Rather, it is detected through psychological testing. I just want there to be a brain scan that is open to the public so I can prove to myself that it's ""not all in my head"", and also to prove to my own parents. I sometimes feel like it's all in my head and that I'm making excuses for myself to be a miserable piece of shit even though I have been diagnosed and hospitalized. Plus, my parents don't believe in mental illness and they blame me for it. I mean, I know that brain scans exist, but they aren't used because it's not always accurate. There's no brain scan that tells you ""you absolutely have this"". That's why they are only used for research purposes. I wish there was a brain scan that is used for psychiatric patients. I feel like I will never be able to come to terms with it until I see my own brain on a brain scan."

now im frozen with anxiety and self-loathing. i cant do shit to save my life.

fuck it."
929,"No idea what to do, my BF probably has OCD and it's ruining everything","We've been together almost 2 years. I thought we were perfect. He is deeply in love with me, has been since the first month we met and has made it clear. He is a dream BF- *always* puts me first, always wants to see me, respects me, let's me use his phone/laptop whenever and willingly shared his passwords and bank details! He is a very anxious person and this became clear to me 8/9 months into dating when his mental health took a nosedive. 

It started with him obsessively confessing to any bad things he has ever done or said/thought, most of it was really stupid, like making a mean joke when he was 12 or reading weird erotic fan fiction at 13/14. Everyday for WEEKS, there was a new thing for him to confess, he couldn't relax until he cleared his conscience. Then he became overwhelmed with the fear of being in the wrong relationship and being a bad person for staying with me if he finds other women hot and sometimes wants to see his friends instead of me? Then it morphed into the fear of ""what if I'm a pedo because I can find a kid pretty/cute and what if that means I am one, even if I never thought I could be until now, unless I'm so in denial I never noticed for 19 years?!?!"". It's this *one* theme that makes me think I need to leave. He freaks out he is one in denial and looks for signs he is one, like finding Emma Watson hot despite her flat chest or  finding me hot depsite being short? I ask him to reassure me he isn't over and over again and have asked him trick questions for months. 

We are deeply unhappy- me because the perfect guy might be a p, and him because I make his OCD worse by doubting him so much when OCD is essentially ""the doubting disease"". I am consumed with guilt because Im either worsening his OCD OR I'm entertaining a p in denial? We haven't had sex in a month and we haven't been able to meet for more than an hour without me getting triggered and asking him yet again or testing him or crying? He isn't *officially* diagnosed but has been using online therapy for the last 2 months and she said he probably has OCD since the first session and has sent him resources for it and treated him as if he has it? I feel like maybe dropping it and seeing if he gets over it in 3/4 months and then catching him off guard, but it feels so dishonest to stay when I'm not 100% sure he is innocent and we'll have been together over 2 years by then, ending a 2 year relationship sounds so much worse"
930,I just....😭,"I need someone I could talk to who can understand my point of view and do not discriminate me just because I seem normal from outside.
I would suggest if to look at my older posts for better understanding.

I need some...no I neeeed help!"
931,"This is for everyone who thinks about suicide, struggles or wants to help others to stay alive","I have talked to countless of suicidal people. I have known people who did it. A cousin of mine just died that way. They had the same combination of diagnosis I do.

Please, reach out. And please, be someone who graps someones' hand when they reach out. So many people have been lost. Please, if you can talk to people just say it. Come here or other places sometime and talk to a suicidal person who posts about it. Mental illnesses kill. Be there and help another fighter.

These people I know were always misfits. The society couldn't see their value and they couldn't see those who valued them. I have attempted suicide and survived. I was never happy because I survived. I don't like myself. But these people are needed. I hope I have helped someone. I hope I have helped people to survive the night. I live for a girl who survived at least for a while and thanked me. J, I wish you are doing great! I wish you are out there! I think about her when I feel that way. I take it personally when someone kills themselves. Another fighter fell. The next one could be anyone. Even me. 

And just being here we are fighting. Not just with our own struggles but for others too. Others who struggle with the same thing. You always feel alone but you aren't. If you find a way out or a way to survive you can help others. A consept of a wounded healer has existed for a long time. It's not bullsh*t. It could be you. It's not something you get praised for but it saves lives. It's a silent job but you can save lives just like a firefighters can. 

One woman I kind of knew is propably dead now. She had a blog about the issues we both were dealing with. She has deleted her blog and disappeared. She never realized how important she was to the community. It is her choice if she is dead and I don't blame anyone who went that way. She struggled so much. But I don't think she ever saw her own value. She was always surprised when people came to her and thanked her. She thought they lied. She propably saved lives herself.

What connects these people who I know and who ended their own lives is being a misfit and feeling like they aren't appreciated. Most were intelligent and talented too. They didn't realize that. They never felt that way. They had weaknesses but it wasn't their fault. It was something society didn't appreciate but there are people who don't care. The greates people in our history have mostly been misfits. There is a reason why these genes have survived. 

It's always more complicated but people who survive tend to have others who see their good side. This family member of mine was artistic. Talented too. So many people could have helped. She was (mildly) authistic too (I also am). She had much more issues with finding words for things. It was difficult to help her. Please tell these people their worth! Even when it's embarrassing. Being embarrassed is a small price for someones' life. I wish I would have sent that freakin post card I thought I should. She had no friends. I should have send her many even if she never responded.

It doesn't matter if you are talented or not though. Some great painters and professional mucisians aren't. They just practiced and learned. You can fucking learn. Step by step. 

Even if you have no energy to learn you can experience. Drop everything bad society tells you. I once walked into a lake with my clothes on and all that. Ice had just melted. It was cold. The endorphine rush came and I changed that day. People are always telling you how to live your life but those rules are bogus. Made up. If you do what you need to do you are actually pretty free. People will always judge you. You might just as well have fun. 

And please, if you feel suicidal just think about everything. Make a list of your issues and divide those issues into doable parts. Start from the easiest one. And try everything. Hope is there. If you try many times the luck can strike. Come here, tall to people, talk to anyone. I wouldn't mind it if someone called me in the middle of the night if that was the case.

Think about people you care for. Would you say things you tell yourself to them? If not you are too mean to yourself. It's hard to stop. But imagine a child you once were. They are actually the one who hears those insults. That part of your brain is still there and feels like you did back then. Feelings get filtered but it's the kid who feels them. You are the adult who could be between that kid and that negative demon that's your illness. Protect that kid.

And if you are going to die anyway just go crazy. Spend your money, go to places, talk to people, have sex and all that. If you are going to die it does not matter. 

Also, if faith could save you just go for it. Let religious people try their stuff on you. It can be ok. If it saves your life just go for it. It has saved my friend.

Please help others and reach out when shit hits the fan. Good times are worth fighting for. I have lost 13 years of my adult life for mental illness. Actually 32 right now. But every good day is worth it. Every sunrise I can enjoy is worth it. Every time my cat comes to sit in my lap and I can actually feel good about it is worth it. I got nothing. But I can see the blue sky and feel the wind on my face. Fight for that. It was worth it for me. Humans weren't made for modern riches anyway."

934,Friendship problems,"I haven’t spoken to my best friend since may. I’ve always felt like I asked about her more and that it was mostly one sided. We’ve had rly good times and we never rly fought. During school, wed hang out everyday. But when summer comes we don’t speak. This bothers me since she has so many friends and I depend on her. I don’t know what to do, every time she posts something on her story I just start crying. We used to be really close, but I just don’t think she cares enough o be friends with me."
935,Anyone need a pen pal?,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post, but might as well give it a try.

I have quite a few mental issues. Some of them really get in the way of having friends I can connect with. I've found that the few people who were the exception were similar to me in this regard. Nobody can understand my bullshit unless they're living through something similar themselves.

Since I've lost the last person I could talk to about my experience of existence openly, I guess I'd like to meet someone new. Someone who's also fighting hell in their own head every day, and would like to be understood by another human.

Text me on Reddit if this makes sense to you :)"
936,Trichotillomania,"Hi everyone! I (28F) haven’t seen many posts about it, so I’d very much appreciate your advice/suggestions/stories. 

On top of my depression, ED &amp; BDD I’ve got this a-hole of a mental health problem - trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder). We’ve been coexisting for over 15 years, with shorter periods of remission and longer periods of pulling. 

I’m pulling out only eyebrows (had to have permanent makeup done - I’m the chick with obviously drawn brows) and eyelashes (I’ve ditched the falsies about 3 years ago). Not a single therapist could figure out the triggering event which started it all in my teens.

I’ve just gone through a nasty heartbreak and boom! no more lashes for me. I’m a grown ass woman and I’m tired of drawing finger-thick wings...

Any tips on how to cope with this enemy/ eyebrow-eyelash growing serums/ anything else you found helpful are warmly welcome! Thanks a ton and pandemic-appropriate virtual hugs to all of you :)"

- Side effects that may happen on a daily basis
- Your general experience
- What may happen if you have alcohol, if you have to limit yourself etc.
- Sleeping patterns

941,Why do I keep denying my mental health even after diagnosis?,I was diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder as well as depression. I was also prescribed meds for both which I don’t really take due to the side effects. I have constant panic and anxiety attacks yet I convince myself that it’s not real and i’m “faking” it. My brain works differently. While everyone around me can  handle situations and minor inconveniences I convince myself everything is the end of the world and my anxiety is spurred on by absolutely anything and everything yet I still deny my mental health. I convince myself I was wrongly diagnosed. There’s people worse off than me and THEY have anxiety and depression but for me no no I can’t possibly. I’m extremely stressed 40 hour work weeks 5 college classes and having to pay tuition and other responsibilities all balancing at the young age of 19 and I tell myself I shouldn’t complain or feel stressed and anxious because I’m fortunate enough to have a job and to go to school. But at the same time it’s killing me. I feel like if I wasn’t in such denial maybe I could cope better but I can’t help but feel that it’s all fake even though physical symptoms are present as well as feeling like i’m batshit insane. Why am I in denial? How do I get out of this and accept my mental health issues?

944,Best Mental Health Podcasts,"Hello all. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Wherever you are in the world! I hope you’re all doing well and keeping safe. While we are all in a middle of the pandemic, millions of people around the world have to **listen** to strict orders. That order is lockdown, no leaving your house/apartment. I understand that some of you are struggling with this. Because of that, I will try and make your time at home a little better by suggesting you different PODCASTS you can listen to while in lockdown. :) 

Whether you’re struggling with Mental Health or trying to support someone who is in need, listening to podcasts can help you find support and a sense of community. In my opinion, podcasts are brilliant. They are relaxing and you can listen to them all day long. So, the podcasts I will recommend covers a range of different topics on Mental Health, from anxiety to bereavement. 

- **Happy Place**

This podcast is terrific for everybody, especially if you’re from the UK. It is a British based podcast. It is hosted by Fearne Cotton. Fearne has managed to get herself a range of different celebrities on her podcast over the years, with the likes of Tom Daley, Stephen Fry, Matt Haig and much more. So, what’s the purpose of this podcast? This podcast focuses on celebrities that open up about their very own Mental Health issues. The podcast series is very light-hearted and often quite moving. If you have any time during the day, I suggest you give it a listen!

- **WTF With Marc Maron**

Personally, MY favourite podcast. It has nothing to do with the fact that Marc Maron is one of my favourite actors.... Ha! WTF with Marc Maron doesn’t necessarily go deep into the world of Mental Health, but it does pop around here and there. But, Maron is very open about his upbringing with anxiety and traumas he has experienced. Maron has held many big name celebrity interviews on his podcast, from award winner actor Kristen Bell to former U.S. President Barack Obama. During these discussions, Mental Health often pops up. Highly suggest!

- **Bryony Gordon’s “Mad World”** 

The tagline for this specific podcast series goes “It’s totally normal to feel weird”. During each episode, this is what Bryony Gordon intends to do. Just like Maron, Bryony Gordon has had many big names on her show, including Mel C and Gizzi Erskine. 

- **The Dark Place**

Hosted by Joel Kutz, this podcast series aims to break the silence by talking to ordinary, normal people from all around the world about times in their life when they have felt really low and in a dark place. While listening to this podcast, expect stories about anxiety, stress, depression, trauma and of course, Mental illness. This podcast is there for anyone in the world that wants to break the silence. It’s a great concept to get YOUR story out in the open. 

- **The Hilarious World Of Depression**

Last in the list is “The Hilarious World Of Depression”, hosted by John Moe. This podcast aims at anxiety and depression. This is a series of funny and moving conversations with some of the top comedians around the world, such as Andy Ritcher, Jen Kirkman, Paul F. Tompkins and much more. The postcast goes deep by talking about the comedians about their depression and how they are dealing with it. This podcast series attempts to break the stigma and to create a sense of community through these conversations. 

These are just some of many Mental Health podcasts that are out there. If you have the time, give them a listen and let me know what you think! Cheers guys. :)"
945,Hand twisting/fidgeting.(Idk what to call this) PLEASE HELP!!!!,So i’ve never told anyone this but i’m pretty sure my parents know of it and I start therapy in November and was planning to tell the therapist about this. In 6th grade I started to twist and play with my hair a lot but it started to get bad and it would knot up so I would pull it out. Because of this I had some bald spots so my mom took me to a barber to have him help cover them up. They’ve healed up now and I don’t really do it to my hair anymore but I know that my mom knew I did it back then. After that I started tearing off small pieces of napkins and toilet paper and I roll them up into very small balls. It’s a little gross but I would even do the same thing to my leg hair. I’m a freshman in college now and I still haven’t been able to stop. I can go periods of time without it but I still do it daily basically without even knowing. I won’t really even realize it and the next thing I know I am doing it. What would cause this? I think that I have some anxiety but would that cause this? Sometimes I think maybe adhd or autism but i’m pretty sure I have neither of those. Sometimes I even do it in public like in the cafeteria a college or at my friends house but it is basically automatic at this point. I try my best to be desecrate about it but sometimes I worry that other people have seen me doing it. I would really like to stop not only because it is really embarrassing but I also feel that it is having an adverse effect on my fingers like i’m getting early arthritis or something from balling them up so tight. I definitely feel like this isn’t normal behavior for a 19 year old but I still do it. Why? What could cause this and how could I stop it? Please help me out. I will read ever response. Thank you!
946,My parents don’t believe I have ADHD,"My brother got diagnosed with ADHD and he received proper medical treatment but my parents are completely ignoring me. I show almost all symptoms of ADHD and it’s affecting my academics massively. When I tell my parents that I think I have ADHD they simply say: “You have to have the correct mindset...” or “You need to eat healthier...” My dad expects me to get a bursary or do extremely well in school otherwise he’ll take me out of my current school and send me to a cheaper school but I just can’t do anything in my current state, I NEED help. What do I do?"
947,College,"Hi everyone, I just started my freshman year in college. I’m moved in but my roommates don’t really talk to me and I feel so isolated and alone. I feel trapped and I miss my family so much. I see everyone around me transitioning to college so well but I just feel scared and overwhelmed. I’ve been having panic attacks, and I’m just so anxious and sad. I just really need someone to vent to. I feel like because of my social anxiety it will be impossible to make long lasting friendships."
948,Living with D.I.D and Bipolar Disorder is such a damn pain to put up with!,"I have D.I.D. (formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder) and I also suffer with Bipolar disorder as well. I know where the alter personality comes from. I had a very strict, domineering mother and a few very mean abusive female teachers from Kindergarden up until 4th Grade. So, I know that all five women had influenced (created) this evil, mean abusive old bitch within my head. I had suppressed a lot of school memories and didn't start to remember that stuff until I was in my late thirties. The voice of the mean old woman didn't really come out til that time either. Psychiatrists kept telling me that Multiple Personality Disorder didn't exist. I know that's what this is though. It is not Schizophrenia, this is a second person in my brain/mind that is worse to me than ANY of the women who abused me when I was a kid. 

I have no alters that are children. Only the mean ass old bitch and her ""friend"" (another old  lady who is mean) who is there to boss me around, make fun of me, scream at me to hurry and do things, everything has to be done right and 100% perfect. And on time. There's no excuse for taking forever to do something. Everything must be done fast and perfect. No making messes in the kitchen. If there is a mess made, the two bitches scream and yell at me about how sloppy I am. I hate having this damn disorder. I have wondered why I only have the two women personalities instead of a child alter too like a lot of people do with D.I.D.? The only ones I have is those mean old bitches. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on this would be helpful."
949,I made a YouTube video about my experience in a domestic violence relationship. Please watch 🥺♥️,[my toxic abusive relationship story: how it affects me](https://youtu.be/w7-wOvrcS_c)
950,False memories in my head making me believe its true and being confused.,"I know my diagnosis and i know what diagnosis this falls under,im not looking for suggestions of what i may have,i already know.
Im so frustrated every god damn night is a battle against my mind that i cant handle.
Ill have an intrusive thought then if its worrisome enough ill start believing this happend or that happened and even though its impossible,ill still think it happen until i move on to the next worry. I cant handle this all every day.

My stupid dr made me abruptly stop my medication 3 months ago because shes a fucking idiot. My baby is going to be born so stressed. The moment i give birth,im starting the medication again. Why do pregnant women have to suffer in everyway."
951,My existence is pointless,"For so long I’ve had such a low self worth, and the feeling that I’m no good for anyone and that people’s lives would genuinely be better if I weren’t in it is growing rapidly. I don’t know if these thoughts are causing the nonexistent self worth or the other way round buts it’s a viscous cycle. 

When I was a teenager especially around 15 I self harmed a lot, eventually I sort of grew out of it and haven’t don’t it in about a year, but recently I keep thinking about it more and more, I haven’t done anything but the thoughts are making their way back. 

I think all these thoughts are here because I genuinely feel like I’m either a burden or hard work for people. I don’t feel like anyone actually enjoys my company or wants to be around me, more just that they put up with me because of some other reason. I have this deep feeling that my SO doesn’t care for me that much and all I do is irritate and annoy him and he’s only with me to entertain his boredom. 

I feel like my existence is no good for anyone and that there isn’t a true reason to be here."
952,My head scares me,"I've been super sad lately. My mom just tried to plan a lunch for next week and all I could hear in my head was, ""we'll have to miss it as well be dead"" :c why does my head say mean things"
953,I think I'm weird,"This is probably not the right place to put this but...

I have these random moments almost all the time where I just realise I exist...which I know is really strange but I don't know how else to put it. Sometimes I'll just be sat or lying down randomly thinking that I exist and it brings dread to my heart; my heart sinks and I feel light headed then begin to cry. (I just reread this and ngl it's kind of funny but in the moment it isn't)

Another thing is I think (not saying for definite) I have death anxiety. it's not really how I die that scares me but what happens after. I think about what if I go to hell (ironic since I'm not really religious) then I'm tortured for all eternity, I think what if there is nothing but I'm still conscious,...and so on. That also brings me a sinking feeling then I struggle to sleep due to that fear, my dreams where I'm dying and sometimes I stop breathing in my sleep. 

Lastly, time is so weird in my head. For example, events that just happen will immediately feel like a distant memory and one that I didn't experience at all so I question if it happened or not. Then I struggle to think about what happened in that situation or if I made up some aspects of that memory. 

So yeah...just needed to get my strange behaviour off my chest a little. Does anyone else have these same moments? Or am I just out of it? Might delete this later. 

Sorry for the horrible grammar and punctuation"
954,Being angry at myself,"Hello. I play football. And im okay at it. But say i do 8 things good and 2 things bad, ill then go on to think about the two bad things alot and get angry at myself to the point where i cant sleep. How do i stop this from occuring every time i play football?
Thanks"
955,I keep fucking up,I keep procrastinating on the task on hand and it's seriously messing up my performance in school  My muscles are tired right now and I want to sleep but the more I take a break the more I have a tendency to lie down and do nothing but imagine instead of acting. This has been a cycle to me since the start of my school and I don't like it and now I have this constant worry of restarting the school level. I regret making this loophole even happen and I feel like this is just the start of my downfall.
956,Is going to the psych hospital worth it?,"Considering going in. I went once when I was 17(I’m 20 now) and it was a good experience. But I went to a kid one. As an adult, is it worth it? Do they help you?"
957,How can I overcome my concerns and have a dating life?," 

Full disclosure: I am on the autism spectrum, so I may say some things that may come across as rude. That is not my intention. Just as some people struggle with maths or reading, I struggle with social cues. I genuinely intend no harm.

So I am 22 and have just graduated from college. I have never kissed nor gone on a date. I have only had two sexual experiences.

My main insecurity when it comes to women is that they will find me boring and too nerdy. On more than one occasion, I have been attracted to a woman who was actually interested in more aggressive and stereotypically masculine men (muscles, tattoos, bad attitudes, etc.). These were attractive, intelligent, well-educated, women who I had good conversations with. I even know one woman (27), who has two very good degrees, is somewhat nerdy, and is pretty good looking, who risked her job by flirting with a student at a college she worked at because he was muscular and riddled with tattoos. I cannot imagine a woman risking her job for a man like me.

The reassurance I get is always along the lines of 'Oh, well women may like bad boys in college but once they get tired of them they will want to date guys like you.' The reason that is not very reassuring is that it makes me feel as if they are settling for me. It is like when I choose to have a fruit cup in lieu of some chips when I am trying to lose weight; I still want the chips, and there is something about the fruit cup that is not satisfying. So when I see women gush over say, Jason Mamoa or Billy from \*Stranger Things\*, it makes me worry that even ones who date me are just going to be settling with me just as I settle with the fruit cup.

I have been working out to lose weight and build muscle, partially in the hops that it will make me more attractive. However, I worry that even if I attract women, they will lose interest when they realize that I am actually a bookish nerd.

These feelings of self-esteem were certainly exacerbated by the toxic 'friendships' I had in college. Many people would go out of their way to be jerks to me, which I something I never actually understood."

959,"Hi, I think I became scared of mornings? Waking up, in general","The past few weeks have been rough to me and I haven’t gotten enough sleep for 2 weeks because of school requirements. I go to sleep at 2am, wake up at 6-7am (at first, I set alarms but the past few days, I just wake up at 6am automatically) and then, I chug a mug of coffee, do work the whole day and sleep again at 2am.

This week, I got really tired already. I feellike I couldn’t force myself to work. I became afraid of mornings or even just waking up. Yesterday, I started crying just after I woke up because I know that i’m gonna work again and write. I thought that I wish I just never woke up at all since I’m really really tired already.

Maybe you guys can help? What happened to me? :( thanks"
960,My mum absolutely can't find out about my flunked semester,"My mum is not a good mum, she can be emotionally and psychologically abusive. She used to have huge anger issues, she still has (as she first gets angry then thinks and never apologizes later) but it's not as bad as it used to be.

I was in an extremely dark place in highschool. I almost got expelled as I missed almost 50% days. I barely studied and then completely stopped because my depression, anxiety, and social phobia got so bad. 

I was scared of my mother then. We didn't live together but she would come every weekend and often would randomly come during the week when I missed school again. Because of that, I lived in constant fear of her bursting through the door, even when I was completely clean. I even once cut myself, very deeply, solely to avoid her anger as she would scream for the whole apartment to hear, wreck havoc in my room, and beat me. She would threaten me then with more serious beating telling me that I wouldn't be able to do anything about it because I have self-harm scars so no one would believe me. She has a good reputation. She even told me once to get a knife and butcher myself or to jump out of the window because she can't deal with me anymore.

She's a person that made me have a panic attack because I took a nap long before I started being chronically tired. She explained later that it was because she thought I could be outside meeting new people or something. To this day, it's the worst argument we ever had. It doesn't matter she didn't beat me then. I felt so cornered by her, that if I could I would have jumped out of the window just to make it stop. I was literally, and figuratively in the corner with her shouting at me, not making any sense and bringing up past stuff that was unrelated. All the while making a martyr of herself and telling me it was my fault I was bullied in elementary school. That she's not surprised they didn't like me. 

She did and said a lot of vicious things even when I was a perfect child. She always overreacted so I developed a habit of lying and denying everything without thinking. So of course, I always did everything I could to hide the truth from her. And to avoid her. 

I started going to the basement on weekends. I would sit in the darkness alone just to get away from her. I had a sleeping bag there (I used to be extremely exhausted, just like my older brother, in highschool but it subsided a lot this year) so I went there to sleep whenever I couldn't bear it anymore as she wouldn't allow me at home. I did everything to be able to spend as much time as I could there. I even pissed there just to avoid going home.

Then everything got better as I passed my exams with above-average scores and the longest vacation of every student in my country started. I chose university far away from home on purpose, so she wouldn't be able to visit and so I could make up excuses for not coming home. 

And it all magically got better. I stopped being as tired, my mental health dramatically improved and I was doing great at uni. When the first math exam rolled around and only 3 people passed in my course, I was one of them. It wasn't perfect but day by day it got better and better. I started eating better, cleaning my room more often, and studying more regularly. For the first time in years, I even got a bit outgoing. 

But then the pandemic happened. I didn't want to go home but after weeks, mum finally convinced me. I didn't go home home, but to the place, I lived in highschool as nothing in this world will be able to make me go to my hometown. And so the weekly visits started again. I got depressed again. I lost all motivation to study. I wanted to study abroad but I couldn't go because of my mental health so I chose this course as a substitution. It wasn't as international as I hoped. Half of my course dropped out even before the pandemic and more started talking about switching courses due to different reasons. 

Time passed, I cried a lot because I couldn't focus (partly because I overworked myself during exam season) and couldn't keep up. I was getting more and more behind. Then two professors wrote me particularly rude emails, I tried to salvage subjects I still had chances at but ultimately I gave up. I couldn't make myself work even with this much pressure and stress. I know I haven't tried hard enough then, but I seriously couldn't make myself study at that time. And I'm a person that can study 12 hours a day, all breaks substracted when I feel good.

My mum doesn't know about this but she's going to find out soon. I told her I wanted to resit my highschool exams and try for university abroad months ago and it wasn't going well, but now I have no hope for it to ever happen. I knew beforehand, that she doesn't want me to stay in my country and she was disappointed a year ago because she couldn't brag about my university and kept talking about her friends' kids and my past classmates and how great they are so I thought she would be more on board with the idea. 

However, she wasn't 100% against it so I persevered. It's my dream after all. Recently she made me agree to ultimatum but the next day it turns out I misunderstood her. It wasn't ultimatum but conditions. One is impossible and the other extremely difficult. One is to pass my first year of university and the other to find a job, which I've been looking for the past month and a half. COVID really made that difficult.

The issue is, she can't possibly find out that I haven't passed my first year of university. My life would go back to how it was in highschool but 10x worse. I can only imagine the stuff she would do. And I don't have confidence I'll survive that again. My life will be completely over. Could be because of what will follow or that I'll kill myself. 

Please, I need some advice."
961,Opinions please... do I go for it...,"First post here... quite nervous... but am starting to have to make decisions and would like some opinions.
My dream since a child was to be an author and later this year I will get my first book published. On a whim I sent a diary to my publisher as I wanted to see if I could use my story with BPD to help others and she is willing to consider publishing it in the future which is quite scary to think about... so:

Would people be interested in a book that is a diary, following a year of someones diagnosis of BPD and initial treatments, alongside emetophobia, anxiety, depression and physical conditions, and plenty of challenges, but whilst still maintaining life and pushing to achieve my childhood goal and get the first book deal."
962,I feel so numb,"It’s taken me (M28) too long to have a simple conversation on this matter but I’ve felt numb for too long now. Like, I feel as if I don’t have authentic emotions anymore, and that it’s just a series of expected reactions. I first noticed this when I was commenting on a subreddit topic about getting over exes. I realized that I’d get over them really easily, as if I never cared. My family? It seems like they’re just other people living in the house. Friends are the bulk of my livelihood, and I KNOW I love them, but it just doesn’t feel that way. I don’t even know who I really am. I don’t feel depressed. I’m not sad. I’ve just been numb for too long and I don’t know how to get out of it."
963,I’m tired of being judged for having to isolate myself to cope,I’m currently staying with my parents bc of the covid situation. They always have guests over and my mom always scolds me for not coming to join them. But I simply can’t. Lately my mental health has been deteriorating and the last thing I want is to go be social. I just want to be in my room by myself but I feel so judged for it - by my parents and by all of their guests. How do I explain that this is the only way for me to cope?
964,Need Help,
965,Being dismissed by your parents,"I just wanted to let all those parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, teachers, siblings, basically everyone how serious mental health issues is. 

Way too often do you push aside how your loved ones, friends when they try to seek out and show you that they are indeed suffering. It may not be physically and cannot be easily seen, but it is there. You know yourself that you’ve seen the signs they show but you chose to ignore it and pretend it doesn’t exist. All the way till the unfortunate happens and then what? You sit there dwelling in your own self pity in why they didn’t seek for help. Well maybe they did. I’m pretty sure they wanted to live much more than you wanted to, but they just wanted all the pain and suffering to stop. A hurting person will almost always try to reach out for help before ending it all. However, nobody looks. 

This hurts a lot. Especially when the ignoring comes from someone the person loves. Yes, I’m talking to you parents out there. Do you know how much your own child crave for your validation and love? You think I wanted to have these issues that make me literally hate life? I wanted to be the perfect child for you too. 
I understand that parents have their “face” to protect. Especially being in an Asian household, you mustn’t do anything that disgraces your family. Having mental health issues included. But is this really as important as your own child’s life?

I’m just venting after trying to have a conversation with my mom about mental health.."
966,Keep getting introspective,Quite frequently I get in these states where I can be like “why am I this way” with lots of different examples. I will try and problem solve but then I’ll fail at trying to self improve then I’m back to square one. I have tried setting myself goals but this seems to cause more damage than anything. I am quite high functioning but I just have low self confidence I guess. I am always trying to diagnose myself with other stuff. I need to try and learn self acceptance and just be happy without getting self critical. I feel like I really bore people when I’m in these states as I want to share everything. I feel like I’m really self exploring and it can become quite addictive. I don’t know why I do this or if anyone’s got any tips to stop this self reflection almost on a daily basis. I don’t know if it’s rumination or not as I seem to just be analysing my negative traits and I want to explore them but I remain hopeful. Sorry if this sounds weird or you don’t understand. Perhaps others can relate?
967,HELP! Ways to relive anxiety/panic chest pain/pressure.,"Firstly, to clarify I've already been checked out at the ER yesterday. 2 EKGs, Ultrasound, Chest X-rays and Heart Enzyme tests among other things and being seen by three doctors assured me that my heart is healthy and that I'm fine, and that it's almost certainly due to anxiety. The Chest tightness/Pain and the anxiety that accompanies it/comes with it can be anything from annoying to debilitating and interfere with my sleep - it's probably contributed to the insomnia that has stopped me from sleeping well - if getting any sleep at all for several days. The pain/pressure comes and goes, sometimes at a whim and sometimes due to me triggering myself/causing myself anxiety accidentally - or occasionally on purpose to test the waters. In fact right now as I type this I'm in some measurable but bearable discomfort. I have an intake appointment for a Psychiatrist the Friday after next (which is absolutely forever in my current situation) - unfortunately it's with a LSCW who has to process me before I see the Psychiatrist, which means it might be who knows how long until I can actually get medical help for this. I suspect I'll be prescribed a beta-blocker for the physical symptoms and maybe new antidepressant - I currently take Zoloft - for the mental ones, maybe even a Z-drug for sleep. Anyway, what I want to ask is if anyone has experience with symptoms like this and how they manage them? Does exercise, help, meditation? Any help managing this so I don't go any more insane would be appreciated!"
968,The medical system in the United States is awful.,"I have been diagnosed with seven different things throughout my life.
Borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia, EDNOS, psychosis, and most recently ADHD.
I had most of these conditions for all of my life, but due to my parents never believing i was ill, and the shitty medical system in America, i haven't gotten the proper treatment.
My ADHD is my biggest struggle right now. It's only gotten worse and worse as i've gotten older, and now, the hyperactivity and inattention is destroying my life and makes me feel like i'm crawling out of my skin daily. 
I was finally able to start looking into therapy and medication options for my ADHD all the way back in March. It's August, and i still have not been put on medication. I did start therapy recently, and it can be helpful, but seems like she doesn't give a fuck about me most of the time. 
My treatment has been consistently put off and scheduled to a later date. Obviously, due to my mental problems i'm very impatient, so this has made it ten times worse.
It's like the fucking medical system is mocking me.
""Oh you have a severe case of ADHD, as well as other unmanaged mental illnesses? Let's make you wait over half a year to get treatment, that'll be great for you."" 
The only time therapists, psychiatrists, and doctors seem to care about you is if you are dying or about to kill yourself. Otherwise, nobody gives a ahit about you, and i absolutely hate that about the medical system."
969,do you feel like that too ?,"hi, i frequently have anxiety attacks and actually i am in my car to see people. honestly, i just want to lock myself in my room but my parents forced me to meet people i seen 3 times in my life and it makes me really really really anxious. i had a panic attack in the car and my father laughed at me so it made me feel more alone than i felt before.
i feel like i ruined my life but i’m fucking 14 ???
someone told me my feelings weren’t legit because of my age and it reminds me my dad sm.
i just wanted to know if someone feel the same because i feel like my psychiatrist don’t even understand how bad i feel.

970,I made my therapist a gift....,"I made my therapist a gift. I’ve only been seeing her for about 2 months, but I literally searched for over a decade to find a therapist I finally clicked with. I’m so grateful to have found her and she’s already expressed that she’s in this journey with me, for as long as it takes, to help support me to my goals.  

My question is, is it acceptable to give her this gift, to show my appreciation? Or would it be weird or cause problems? Is she even allowed to accept it? It’s homemade; I didn’t spend a ton of money on it (just supplies to make it) but I spent hours and hours making it. 

Thoughts please? TIA!"
971,My guinea pig died and no one cares,"My guinea pigs (Täpi and Triibu, Täpi died in 2016. They were brothers so Triibu has been alone for 4 years) have been my only friends for 7 years now.

 Täpi had a tumour and died at 3 years old. My mum was the only one to even acknowledge that I had the right to be sad but others were literally saying ""it's just a guinea pig, it's not like a dog or anything so it doesn't matter"".

I was really depressed after that and since he died in his sleep I got this habit where I have to check every 10 minutes if Triibu is moving. Their cage is in my room.

2 days ago I wole up in the morning and went to check on him but he wasn't moving. I rattled the cage cause even if he's sleeping he usually reacts to that.

He didn't.

I went downstairs and told my mum. I went outside. In a few minutes she came back and said he wasn't dead yet bus close to it and that I should go be with him. When I got there he was dead.

I couldn't even say goodbye.

And I had to dig the grave and bury him while everyone else was laughing and just chilling in the garden.

 And I can't sleep. And I'm sad. It's too quiet in my room, and all the noises are wrong.

Today my mum's been yelling at me all day to clean the cage and take it out of my room but I can't even go near it without crying.

No one cares. They think ahh whatever who cares about it but I do. He's the only one who's ever been there for me. And they just act as if he didn't exist."
972,i’m still traumatised and i don’t know how to overcome it,"I had a childhood friend of over 11 years and she’s changed to be a toxic social justice warrior and gaslighted and emotionally abused me for my mental disorder. she left me recently which had me feeling really betrayed because apparently i was childish to her when i didn’t even do anything wrong. 

i’ve never once had any beef with her, but she was always against me and it was all petty things such as me not talking to her often, me not being able to turn up to her birthday party because i was sick, or few years back when i was going through an abusive relationship, i used to vent on my instagram because i didn’t know how to cope well, and she just scolded me and called me immature and childish rather than encouraging me.

right now she’s left me. great. i am fully aware she is toxic for me and i shouldn’t be friends with her. but right now she starts advocating for mental health on social media by posting all the therapy quotes and pretending as if she’s never harmed me or anyone else, and i am annoyed, frustrated and upset because of her hypocritical actions.

it has been months and i still haven’t got over it. i would get nightmares and panic attacks whenever i remember her emotionally abusing me and then advocating for mental health on social media.

i don’t know what to do. please help me. i just wanna be in peace again and not let her bring me down, but it’s so hard.

tldr: childhood friend emotionally abused and gaslighted me for my mental disorder. left me afterwards, and then proceeds to advocate for mental health on social media pretending to be a nice person. till now, i still can’t get over the trauma."

&amp;#x200B;

for me its the little things like using paper towels instead of toilet paper when I run out (because I cant be bothered.. then my toilet gets clogged lol), ignoring people like my friends and family simply because I'd rather not be around people, taking way too many naps during the day to kill time... etc

anyways, what do you do? i need ideas bc i feel like i’m just going to shout and scream at this point."
976,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I've barely lived for sixteen years and I cant take anything people say in as a grain of salt. I know it's normal to be sensitive, but it is so draining to take every bit of criticism to the heart and I don't think I can take anymore of it. I have no access to proper help, although I do see a counselor- my therapy is quite limited as mental health where I'm from is not taken very seriously.  I can't even look at people in the eyes anymore without feeling like they're judging me and criticizing everything I do and I understand that is inevitable but I hate myself for it. 

Everybody here is so carefree and happy and I'm just the kid who blows up at everything and nothing. I have a great supportive family but I still feel misunderstood. It's been like this for the past four years and my mom said she wouldn't be sure if I'd be able to go to university outside of the continent since I can barely handle anything on my own for too long. 

I'm constantly comparing myself to my sister because shes so happy and bright and everybody loves her and the difference between the  two of us is so massive and its hard knowing  that everybody can see it. I try not to have these thoughts, but they just keep on coming, and I don't think they'll ever go away I feel like I'm alone and I just don't want to keep living a life always feeling like I'm on the edge and that everyone hates me. I hate the way that I feel this way to start with and I'm afraid all of these feelings are evolving into something much greater.

 I'm burdening my family with these thoughts as well, and the occasional outbursts, and I think they're eventually going to get tired of me. I don't think I'll ever be able to find love or do anything because of this, and my little sister told me she doesn't think of me as a role model. I'm just a mess and I don't know what to do with myself. I just don't want to be here anymore. I can't even eat or drink anything because my mind is so occupied with these negative thoughts that simply just won't waver. Please can I have some advice, or just anything, to let me know that I'm not alone?"

My gf asked me what I'm doing and I told them that I'm still helping my parents.

I never wanted to lie to her, she is the most important person in my life and she doesn't deserve it. I don't know why I lied to her, I just did it without nearly any thinking.

985,I sometimes feel like I am loosing touch with reality...,"Hello everyone,

I'm sorry for my english in advance, it's not my first language...I'll try my best to be as clear as possible ! 

I am 28F living in Canada. I have a weird rollercoaster of a journey in terms of navigating my mental health, but to put it briefly: I was misdiagnosed with BPD at 19, which was reevaluated recently to SdPD, OCD and Generalized Anxiety ; with indications that there might be a neurodevelopmental issue (to which order I am unsure...I need to meet with a neuropsychologist soon to confirm this diagnosis or establish if there is something else).  I was always very iffy about the diagnosis of BPD, and felt like my concerns were often brushed aside or twisted to fit some sort of narrative I could not relate to. However, I was adamant to get better and thought maybe she was seeing something I wasn't. But after a bad accidental poisoning with my prescribed medications, I thought it was time to adress this with a new doctor, which explains the gap in between this diagnosis and the new one.

To my knowledge, I have no issues regarding psychosis or any of the sort. But I am feeling constantly confused and I have a hard time decoding social situations, my own emotions and those of people around. So, I'm very happy with the fact that I have very few relationships, and my main source of socialization consist of my parents, my brother and my significant other.

Now, to my concern : My family is a weird bunch...My parents had my brother and I very young, and we grew up in an household where respecting your parents was required, affection was earned and where punishments could be issued for the smallest mistake (Didn't score a goal at your soccer game today ? Here is a punch in the knee kind of things). They always repeated to us that it wasn't abuse, just discipline and that they would ""show us what abuse is"" if we continued to disrespect them. However, I do have a few good memories, which makes it hard for me, even to this day, to really figure out what happened in my childhood.

I wouldconsider my relationship with them today as good, if only in small dosage.

Their humor mostly consist in making fun of each others, which can be very surprising to outsiders. Most often, I don't understand they are joking and end up feeling very bad about myself (my SO also pointed out that their jokes were sometimes a bit cruel). My parents and brother, despite being well aware of my mental health issues, also have this game together which mostly consist in making me believe things (Im very naive) and telling me years later that it was a joke, or to make me doubt my own memories by saying it never happened.

 I am really not proud to say this, but to use as an example that came back recently, I punched my brother in the face once years ago : a classmate lent me an instrument for pictures in high school, only to find him in my room basically mistreating that instrument. He had an habit to go into my room to find things I could be punished for and I guess it was the final straw when he decided to mess with it, even after telling him time and time again to not do that. My mother and brother were reminiscing this ""funny"" moment last Saturday in front of my SO and his new girlfriend, but everything out of the story was changed : there never was any instrument (despite me having pictures with it), I was never in the possession of said instrument, and it apparently didn't happen this way . My action was described as totally free and out of nowhere because I was mad I could not have this new gaming console (?). Now, i had an interest in video games, but not that much... But funny, right ? 

So, when I came back home after this visit, I had a panic attack : What if my memories are fake ? Did anything that ever happen to me was just taken out of proportions ? Was I just attention seeking or clingy ? Why can't I understand these jokes ? Am I just dumb ? 

I'm so lucky to have such a supportive person as a partner, but he wasn't in the picture back then so he can't say for sure. After all, there is 3 persons backing this story...

So, I thought about having an outside perspective, to try and to look at it with a bit of distance and  find a logical explaination. I'm scared I might be losing it... 

Thank you for your help and perspective."

I’m scared to tell people about what’s going on and don’t feel like I can deal with any of this. All I want is a new start. I don’t like getting in trouble and I feel like reaching out for help will do that. I don’t really know my minds so messed up right now. I bite my fingers whenever I start to cry and scratch my neck when I can’t bite them anymore. I’m so scared of everything. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know what we’ll do. I’m worried about not being able to do the stuff I wanted to do. I’m too scared I keep overthinking, all the things they’ve said and what going to happen. Everything’s such a blur. Is our situation even bad? I feel like my heart won’t stop racing, I just want to stop worrying. My parents aren’t the worst, but my mind becomes so foggy with them.

989,I can’t cry. . ..,"For almost the entirety of the summer I have been bombarded with my friends problems. I guess I thought it more convenient if I just didn’t cry. So instead I took up boxing, push my emotions out that way. Since then I’ve discovered something. . . I can’t cry. . .. it’s apparently very common for people to not be able to cry. Not being able to cry is also very relatable to depression. I’ve been able to cry on command since 7th grade (I’m going to be a freshman in high school this year) but it just isn’t the same. I don’t know what else to say other than that. . .. I just kind of wanted a place to. . . vent. . . I gusss. . .. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
990,Do you ever feel like there are some specific moments in your life that made you realize just how fucked up you are?,"I feel like whenever I look back at my past there are certain moments in my life that are more prominent than others. I feel like there are moments that made me realize that something was truly wrong with me. I don't mean that in a bad way, I'm using the word wrong because that's just how I felt when I first experienced some of those things and to some extent I still believe that. 

There is a particular incident in my life that I consider to be one of the most significant moments that made me realize that I seriously needed to get some help. It was a few years ago, somewhere around the time when I'd first realized that I was depressed. I had called a national helpline because I didn't know what to do about these feelings that I'd been having for quite a while, they told me to take a test and asked me about my score on that test. They told me that I was depressed and needed to talk to someone about getting some help so I went to my mom. I told her that I thought I was depressed and she was surprisingly supportive.

During that time I was undergoing some treatment and she told me to tell that doctor about this so that he could maybe help me with what to do about this or how I could get some help but when I told the doctor he told me to delete that test from my phone and that there was nothing wrong with me. He told me not to look at such things and not to contact that helpline again because these people would find a way to get some money out of me. Of course I didn't believe any of it and tried to argue with him but my mom believed him completely. 

After that day my mom started treating me differently as if there was something wrong with me and the smallest  thing could make me explode. This lasted for a few weeks before things went back to normal but a few days after everything went back to normal, me, my mom and my best friend were talking and my mom kind of broke down about me being a bit distant and not talking to her about the things that bothered me.(Now what I did next might sound shitty but I have a reason for doing that.) I walked out of the room and let my best friend handle her. I didn't do it because of some petty reason but I did that because seeing my mom cry made me feel uncomfortable. This is where the part about me realizing how fucked up I'm comes up. I didn't feel uncomfortable because my mom rarely shows such strong emotions or because I'm generally uncomfortable when people cry (which are both true statements). I mostly felt uncomfortable because I didn't feel anything, I know this sounds contradictory but the thing is that when I saw my mom cry I was supposed to feel some sort of empathy but I didn't feel anything I didn't feel even remotely sad or bad for being the reason that my mom cried. I didn't feel any empathy towards her and I freaked out which led to me walking out of the room. A while later my best friend calmed my mom down and she came to me and asked me if everything was okay and I said I didn't feel anything. She was obviously confused by this and asked me what I meant and I told her what I was feeling or not feeling really.

This is one of my most vivid memories because to this day I remember every emotion I felt. After that day my mom and I grew more and more distant. Now I'm at a point in my life where I can't stand any sort of physical contact with her, granted I don't like physical contact with anyone but with her it's ten times worse."
991,I just don't want to try anymore,"I've recently ended a relationship because my bf got somebody else pregnant in a one night stand when we broke up last year. He chose the baby and decided to erase me in his life completely. I quit my job because it was too stressful for me and it's affecting my mental health. And now, I think I want to pursue an entirely different career but I'm scared because I might fail and going back to school seems to not be a great idea. I barely passed my subjects and I'm not the brightest student back in college. I honestly think it's better to die than to live with all of these problems I have. It seems like there's no point in living anymore because I'm constantly hurting. I'm tired of people saying that everything will work out just fine because it won't. I'm tired of people comparing their struggles with mine and how they make my feelings irrelevant and invalid. I don't want to hurt my family but I really just want to disappear."

994,Could this be associated with some sort of a disorder?,"Hi! I'm here looking for some advice regarding my mental health.

I have an awful habbit of planning certain events or things in my life very far ahead to every last detail. I always presume things to go exactly the way I imagined (my dreams are unrealistic and almost impossible to achieve in reality) but that is never the case. Once some detail gets out of place and the rest of the plan starts suffering because of this is freak out. I don't lash out at others or anything like. I  lose all my motivation to carry on and have a break down.

My life in general is all over the place and I am awful at planning but very chill about everything. The only things fixed my life are these dumb dreams about certain events and once the only fixed things in my life aren't so fixed I freak out.

I am talking about some dumb details like my mother setting my appointment onto another day and to another place or the fact that some piece of clothing can't be worn to the event I wanted to.

Am I just a spoiled brat or might there be a reason for this behavior?"
995,Currently terrified about something I did as a child.,"So I’m an 18 year old guy with OCD and it’s made my life hell so this situation is even worse for me than it might be for somebody else. So basically, I’m very much the opposite of a psychopath... I’m vegan for the animals, I go out of my way to save moths in spiders webs and actually cried for hours after I accidentally killed a crane fly when I was like 12. But I’ve recently had a flashback and remembered something I did when I was like 10, and I remember that I was really angry about something my mum did (not sure what, probably something petty since I was so young) and I remember picking up a knife when I was by myself and stabbing the air with it because I was so angry and probably imagining stabbing my mum. I don’t understand why I did this... I love my mum and the thought of her being hurt makes me want to throw up. Why did I do this when I was a child? It’s freaking me out."

I even filled out a form so that my mother could sit in with me and they said it was okay, until we actually got there and they said “patients only due to the pandemic, no exceptions” 

So there I am, a kid who can’t speak his mind to save his life, all alone with a guy who seemed to not care. I told him my school therapist said I might have depersonalization and OCD, and tried to inquire about a diagnosis, but he wasn’t having it. I even tried to show him my journals and previous reddit posts because I said it was easier than speaking, but he was having none of it. “I don’t look at journals, save that for the therapist”. I was looking forward to finally getting some help, but nope, all I got was some asshole playing 20 questions with me about things I didn’t understand. Now I’m even more confused and angry and upset and I hate myself even more.

I texted today and asked what I did wrong, if there was anything unrelated to the incident....basically, she said she doesn't want me around her son and asked if I would want someone around my daughter who ""has to have medicine and therapy to be normal.""  I know she's entitled to her opinions, and we weren't close anyways, but I feel like that's such a low blow not just myself, but to anyone dealing with mental health issues.

1000,Anxious attachment and being mired in guilt.,"This is a rant, I suppose. On mobile, please be kind.

I'll keep this vague because the situation is deeply complicated, but basically, I'm in a situation with a couple of people and there are a lot of hurt feelings. I can't contact either of them to straighten things out (via Discord, if it matters, and no other way of communicating right now). 

I can't shake the feeling that whatever is going on, whatever caused them to be unreachable, is my fault, that they have both seen through to my core and decided to no longer put up with me. It would be fair, as I've ghosted one of them out of pure anxiety. The other person is one I'm deeply attached to, who you could say I love. We've had a very intense friendship. He's seen a lot of my ugly and embarrassing side, and hasn't run away, and I want to stick by him no matter what. The thought of losing this person breaks my heart. I'm terrified this is happening now.

I had a panic attack about all this this morning. I managed to work a full day after calling the crisis hotline, but now I just feel tired and numb. I'm scared I'm going to have another panic attack.

I'm not sure what my question is except ""how do I extricate myself from this horrible, torturous guilt?"""

I’ve been staying away from it and stone wall. So now they have started making up stories and things to make me a part of all that drama between my girlfriend and them. I feel like part of it is I am fatigued from trying so hard to help my girlfriend because their environment is highly toxic. Her parents’ have a history of getting in a lot of nasty arguments with each other and lately they haven’t had their fix so her parents are pulling my girlfriend and I into drama. I just need support and help to stay away from it all.

1003,Can someone help me figure out what my reaction means about my character?,"I work with a nonprofit that hosts summer camps for trans youth. Since we were unable to meet for camp this year, due to COVID, I decided to develop a Minecraft server that the campers can log onto, despite camp being closed. We haven't been doing too well the passed couple months. Campers are not logging in. So, we decided to create a re-launch video.

So, I'm on the server, recording our staff playing. And there's this one person whose killing the mood. I've had issues with them in the past, and it's clear that they are still resentful towards me. They are very rude when I'm around and they avoid talking to me. We were still trying to get everything set up; I had some bad internet and couldn't figure out how to work my recording program. This person kept rushing us to begin and rushing me to tell them what to do. They said that they weren't on board with the script I had created, and stated they created videos before our campers liked. I guess that was their language for saying my script sucked and they could do better? Not really sure. But this comment bothered me. This interacted was half a week ago.

Right now I'm working on another project, and this popped into my head. I kept trying to figure out why, and I really can't. Then, I had realized something. I had thought of all the projects I had done at camp previously, like creating carnival games and hosting a carnival at camp. I had gotten such good feedback. Some campers had said that it was the best night of the whole camp. It wasn't until I had thought of this that my insecurity had subsided. But why?

I guess what's bothering me is that it took effort to consider another context where I had performed well, in order to defeat someone else's nasty comment. Is it normal to think this way? I notice that a lot of times, I'm driven by my insecurities. I'm really trying not to be this way. Can someone try and help me out to analyze this situation?"
1004,Idk anymore,I can feel myself spiraling down. It starts with feeling like I’m not enough. Everyone around me watches me put 100% of myself into my work and yet still reminds me that it will never be enough. I’m wearing myself out and beating myself down until I feel worthless or useless. It’s at the point where I go to sleep and sometimes hope I don’t wake up the next morning. I try to speak up about my feelings but everyone in my life is so used to ignoring me instead of listening.

1006,What are your thoughts on meditation vs other mental health tools?,"Meditation definitely helps a lot of people. It has anecdotal reports and science backed evidence to back it up. It can help w many different problems from anxiety to depression. 

Some people act like it’s a cure all. Buddhist monks and meditation masters tell people they just need to mediate and all your problems will start to seem less important. 

I believe meditation can be very helpful but it’s just one tool among many. 
There are other tools, like journaling, exercise, reading, learning, therapy, relationship building, creative arts, CBT, biofeedback, and so much more. I think a balance of different tools is more beneficial than being a meditation master. 

If someone has PTSD then they should focus on working on that. If someone has anxiety they can focus on a daily meditation practice. 
If someone has ADHD, they could focus on exercise and mindful walking.

I seek to avoid most encounters with people other than my partner and my best friend, because I just want to be most of the time alone. I started to love more than ever to be alone. I don't waste this time by doing nothing nor crying/ruminating the past/overthinking. I read,paint,cook,take care of my plants and most of the time I try to improve myself. When it happens to be around more people I immediately start to have anxiety because of the virus and can't stop thinking of going home. Some poeple told me that something seems wrong with me lately, because I lost most interest in partying and hanging out with larger groups of people. The thing is that I don't plan to start partying and hanging out with lots of people after this pandemic is over, because I just love to be by myself most of the time. I had little to no hobbies before the pandemic. Will the anxiety of being around more people go away after this is over? I always had a bit of anxiety being around people other than my small group of friends, but i never had the urge to leave. Is this urge of isolation a sign of some mental illness or I just started to purely love me-time, because I have more hobbies? What are some other symptoms I should pay attention for?

I would like to ""take it back"". I want to plan a weekend away, where all the decisions are scheduled ahead of time, let her get dressed up and just enjoy a couple romantic nights doing things she enjoys in a place far detached from her history.

Last week tried to be a bit mean to a woman on tinder(nothing serious). Like mocking about her clothes. To my surprise she asked me to meet her in person. When I met her I couldnt be mean anymore because Im not like this anymore. We were laughing and had a really good time togheter. I gave her my jacked when it got cold and drove her home.

Then I wrote her that I liked the date and would love to meet her again.

Then she told me I wasnt like what she expected me to be. She told me it was FUCKING BORING.

1017,Actively endangering my life and that of others but I don't know what to do or where to ask for help,"Okay so first of all thank you for your attention and any potential input! 

Here's my story. I'm 24 year old doing an internship as the last project of my course. I was heavily bullied throughout the first few years of highschool (I had been bullied before but not to that extent), which included being bullied regularly by 5-6 groups inside school and about six independent incidents with strangers outside of school. I'm including teachers in the first group; at the time the school's therapist got wind of it and I stood quiet for some dumb reason, if I could go back in time now I'd make sure those teachers would get absolutely destroyed and do my best to guarantee they wouldn't see another kid again, but whatever, all I can do now is hope that the next kid will do what I couldn't. Anyway, the bullying was never physical, but at its height it included a bunch of classmates urinating in my shoe while I was showering in PE.

The reason behind the bullying was my appearance. I have a weak chin, somewhat of an open bite, big lips and big ears. Perpetuators were pretty much always male, I don't remember an instance of being directly attacked or insulted by a girl or group of girls (though I remember a couple of instances of insultive comments being made behind my back in a whispering voice). All this together got me into a suicidal depression, went to a psychologist who did more harm than good, but eventually managed to force myself to climb out of it and believe that one day things would get better. Finding a group of friends helped a lot at the time.

Fun part is, the bullying did not stop after high school. At all. It continued in college. It got way less intense, no more uraniting in shoes or people directly insulting me, and instead it turned into offensive or offhand jokes. So for example, being in a class meeting with every student of the course, one guy telling me ""Hey mate you should really consider posting a picture on Facebook, you're the only one here without one and it would help people memorize your name"", then another guy I barely knew jumping in with ""Yea but don't post one of your face"".

Another tremendous experience in college including me and a guy I considered to be a friend going to a barbecue party, a friend of my friend approaching him and pointing to me and going ""Hey so is this your cousin?"" and my friend replying ""It looks more like your cousin"" and his friend going ""Nah he looks more like yours"". That was fun.

Left a few experiences and stories out but I think you get the point. Right now I feel I'm chronically depressed, there's a constant loop going through my mind 24/7 repeating these events, and that loop has been with me for 10 years now. Now, there were some good things too. Right now I have a few (extremely few, like \~4-5) close friends from both genders that I know enjoy my company and never did me any wrong. I've also had fantastic interactions with lots of people. I've had a few girls interested in me (I'm counting 4; and I know this because they told a mutual friend and asked him/her for help). Two of them were very attractive, and my bullies at the time once followed me into a date because they couldn't believe she had set a date with me. Still never took a chance on any of them because I felt underserving of their attention.

The thing is, I've managed to live with my depression by having ambition and learning and trying to make the world a better place. Believing I have something to contribute to the world as a whole and learning to reach that goal is what keeps me going. So despite my feelings I'm able to reach a point and say ""OK, enough self-pitying for the day, let's get some work done"". HOWEVER, when a trigger hits, it hits hard. It's devastating. It's the feelings of hopelessness, rejection, loneliness, frustration, anger, worthlessness, being alone, not being able to find companionship, etc. All at once.

I have lots of hits. A rejection by a girl is actually not that big of a trigger, but it's still one. A rejection by a group of guys is also a similar trigger (so for example, a former group of friends would never ask me where I wanted to go, they would decide it among themselves and inform me afterwards, never giving me a choice. Or they would just not invite me until I asked if they wanted to hang out, then they'd tell me where to meet them).

The reason I'm writing this today is because I went through a massive trigger in my internship (which I also hate because I hate my course and I think it's useless but that's another point entirely). And all that happened was a woman working there, amidst conversation with a man working there, asking me ""You don't have a girlfriend, do you? Great, because this guy is giving bad advice"". And that, that was a huge trigger for some reason. The fact that she phrased that question that way instead of ""Do you have a girlfriend"", as if assuming a negative response, was enough to trigger me. 

And here's how I respond to big triggers like these: I use my car as a weapon. I'm usually a very calm, attentive, proactive driver. But when something like this happens, I actively look for ways to make accidents happen. If I predict a mistake, I don't brake, I accelarate as much as I can and steer my car to guarantee an accident if the person keeps going. Right of way stops existing, I will let the other car come close and then violently steer directly into them. The only reason I'm capable to be writing this right now was because 6 people were paying enough attention to dodge me.

The thing is, right now I'm stable. I look back and it's like I'm not the same person that was driving that car. And I will be stable tomorrow, and I will be stable until the next trigger. And then my brain will shut down and act on pure self-destructive instint again. It has happened before and it will most likely happen again. And the thing that scares me, is that maybe next time one of those drivers will not be paying attention. And then what? My plan has been ""Just wait a few more months and save enough money to get help"", but I feel like being forced to go to this internship daily and being exposed to these triggers make this more urgent.

So, what should do I do? Where should I seek help? Tried my college therapist, but she is specialized on family relationships and over the course of 12 sessions did nothing for me. Don't have enough money to pay for more than 1-2 appointments myself. My parents are also professionally diagnosed as being depressive and they don't believe in psychologists and tell me to just get my shit together when I talk to them. I could call an ambulance or go to the Hospital but a) I'm no longer in crisis, my crisis last for 10-20 minutes only although they are extremely dangerous in those 10-20 minutes; b) I'm scared I'll get put on medication and subsequently lose my ambition and will to work, which is the only thing that allows me to fight suicidal thoughts. 

My only option I can see is calling my country's non-emergency medical number since they provide psychological support and see what they have to say. They also have the power to contact emergency services if needed. The thing is, every time I'm in a crisis I don't feel like calling the number, and when I'm not (like right now) I don't see the point of calling them lol. Anyone has any idea? Any input? I'd appreciate the hell out of it. Thank you a lot :)"

If you want to shift your opponent to the left, just push the head to left, and their weight will be shifted. However that quote also applies to the mental side too. If all you think is negative thoughts and down all the time, that's how you're gonna feel too. When you thinking down all the time, you sleep more and seem to just want to be alone or asleep. When you start thinking up or positive is when you start to feel like going out and about."

1020,Am I really that much of a coward or is my mum scary?,"I am a coward and quite weak but I don't know if I'm not overreacting. I've seen other kids on tv scared of their parents when they got in trouble too. 

My mum isn't a vicious beater but if she gets angry enough; she'll beat me with something or at very least grab me painfully by whatever's convenient for her and push me against a wall or into a corner. More than that and the words she says when she's angry (she told me some stuff no mother should ever tell a kid, no matter how angry they are) I'm scared of what she's gonna do when her anger cools off. The rules and conditions she's gonna make me follow. Physical pain doesn't last long, my room can be cleaned up and I'm fairly used to what she says but it's what happens later that makes me really uncomfortable. Still, I somehow can't give any examples. What I can say is that like pushing a person who can't swim into deep water. That's how she makes me feel. And she thinks it's for the better.

So the following  are the things I did because of that fear:
1. I lied, many times. About anything and everything.
2. I took advantage of the fact that I self-harm to avoid punishment. I cut myself, deeply and deliberately. Then I designed a whole act where I pretended to try to hide it but made sure she'll find out, so she won't be as angry. 
3. I tried to stop her many times from visiting me on the weekends but failed each time. 
4. When she visits I go 7 flors down, to a basement thingy for several hours to sleep when I can't endure anymore, cry myself out or to get some peace. I have sleeping bag there and jars if I need to relieve myself. 
5. I didn't let her into the house when she randomly visted so she took away they key to lower lock. I tried to not let her in anyway by holding  in place rim latch lock as hard as I could until she went away.
6. When my mental health got really bad I started spending my whole days under my bed. She came to visit me one time when I was under my bed. I never came out. It was late and she was both worried and livid. To this day I have no idea how she didn't notice because I swear I heard her looking under my bed. It was thanks to the darkness I guess.
7. I chose university far away enough for her to be unable to visit me often.
8. Ghosted my father because she somehow found out I met him after many years of not seeing him.

I'm flawed and not perfect, in fact I'm terrible daughter but even when I was just a kid I remember being scared of her eyes. They reminded me of wolf eyes and wolves appeared in my nightmares almost everyday until I turned 11/12. She was the type of person to open the door to living room in the evenings because she thought I was being ridiculous for being scared that a wolf may hide under the table which was perfectly visible from the hall. She would push me in there when she was mad and force me to look there. She was the type of person to push me onto a barking dog (rather small one) in a narrow hallway when I was crying from fear to prove me the dog's harmless.

Am I right for being scared of her? Is it weird that despite all of that I still hug her often?"
1021,I just don’t know what I’m living for anymore,"I don’t know where it started, but I guess it was when I was young. I don’t know how and why it happened, but it did. What I am talking about is that I choose the choice that makes everyone happy, except me.

Like when I was younger and some girls were teasing one of the boys, I would join in so I could feel like a part of the group. I felt horrible, that I made him cry just so I could be recognized as a member of the class. 

Then I realized my feelings, I guess and wanted to take another route. I started hanging out with the boys instead, and they were much funnier to hang out with. I guess you could say that I took the other path than the other girls. I was satisfied for a while, then my mom stepped in. She said something like: “you don’t have to take the other path, you could go with the others.” Basically, she didn’t want me to stand out, as I understood it. I guess this is where my rebellious side grew and my anxiety I guess.

I still hung out with the boys a lot, but I stopped doing that as I grew older. As I entered the teenage years I became more aware of what the world thought about me, us, the girls, and the boys. I started out the years happy and playful, but as I grew I started to pull back and turn more anti-social with everyone.

Now, when I’m in high school I don’t know what to do anymore. I still feel like I’m just living to make others happy, and yes. You could probably say I do because when I’m alive they’re happy. But what I meant is the choices and decisions I make. I’m mostly influenced by my mom, she wants me to go to a school at a certain place and to either become: a doctor or lawyer. And that’s not my dream. But since I’m always heavily influenced I don’t know what my dreams are anymore, like the stars of my dreams in early childhood either got swallowed by black holes or they just stopped shining.

I’ve started to “calculate” what to say when I’m having a conversation. Based on the person I’m talking to (their body language, their personality, their habits, etc) the different my personality and reply. I calculate what they probably would say to one of my responses, and I try to make them happy. Even if I lie.

I feel like my mom has high expectations of me, but I just can’t. And I don’t want to disappoint her, so I just swallow my feelings and nod as I smile. You will probably tell me to talk to someone or my dad or an adult I trust, the thing is: I don’t trust adults. I just don’t, I think I developed that in my childhood as well. But that’s a story for another time, thanks for just reading this stupid and random rant.

And I still don’t know what to do with myself."

1023,"(TW: Suicide, self harm, ED) A Friend Called Me While Self Harming","I’m here again, as a pt. 2 to when I asked for advice to give my best friend that texted in a groupchat she’s having feelings of wanting to starve herself again. I told her previously that she can call me whenever she needs and I will be there to listen, because I struggle with sobriety and previously self harm. But she called me after those texts saying “I just tried to kill myself but it didn’t work”, then proceeded to cut herself while I asked her to stop. She listened and I asked if she had consumed any pills- she said no. Then I convinced her to tell her mom, but when her mom entered the room (me still on the phone), my friend told her Mom about her suicide attempt, then her mom asked her why, which I know my friend was dreading, and demanded she hang up the phone with me. I told her I love her and we hung up, then she recently (like 10 minutes later) texted me saying she appreciates my patience and support 100%, and left it at that. I called our other best friend while waiting for her to call me back and asked for advice (she had the words that our other friend needed to hear, but I had the calm voice so she spoke through me). Is there anything else I can do???? She needs therapy and to be taken off Zoloft but I don’t think her mom listens to her. I’m at a loss. Please give me some guidance."
1024,Self-talk &amp; Anger at myself / others,"I've  been dealing with some strange behavior in myself over the past few  years. Thoughts from my  past, regrets from the past, moments of  embarrassment from my life, moments when I wish I had reacted  differently or wish I had said something different -- these keep jumping  into my head at random moments during the day. I could be working,  reading, eating, watching TV, anything. And bam, a thought pops into my  head - e.g. Why did I let that guy at work treat me like that 8 years  (!!!) ago? Why did I say that to that girl in college 15 years ago  (jesus, that long ago)?? Why did I embarrass myself like that in front  of those people??

I find myself  yelling at myself out loud to ""Come on!"" until the thoughts go away. So  far I only do this when I am alone, and not in public like a crazy  person. I feel so self-conscious about the yelling at myself that THAT  emotion starts to crowd out the original thought itself. I'm telling  myself to snap out of it, to come on, you're better than this, to let it  go. I feel the anger directed at myself. A brief moment of self-hatred.  And then I shout it down. And then shame at the whole episode.

On  the flip side, there are moments when I feel an intense anger at the  other person in some of those episodes of anger. And instead of yelling  at myself, I find myself practicing out loud what I wish I had said or  had done. I'm practicing cutting down another person, even a friend.  I'll even find myself moving through a list of people (the usual  suspects) and practicing what I wish I had said to them. Earlier this  week, I caught myself doing this for over a few hours. Jesus. WTH. I  write this and I feel shame. What is going on in my head that I react this way.

I know the silliness of  feeling this way, of reliving the past, of this type of anger toward  myself &amp; towards others. It's silly and unhelpful. It's a sign of me  regretting so much, or wishing that I could be different, or wishing  that I had been a better person.

I've thought about talking to a therapist or someone to help my figure out why I'm reacting this, and to help me get it under control."
1025,i don’t know what to do. i feel disgusting.,"i know that i suffer from anxiety, but i have no medication and help for it, nor does any of my family even know what it’s like to have it. 

my mom knows i was diagnosed when i was young, but did no research on it. same with the rest of my family. 

i don’t know if i have depression. i fit all the symptoms, but i don’t want to completely self diagnose. every time i go to the doctor and they give me one of those mental health sheets i have to lie on it.

i lie about everything i’m feeling because my mom would give me shit for feeling that way, even if i have no control over it.

she always accuses me of never doing anything but sleeping. i try and get up and do things. i do a lot of art when i feel like shit. but it’s gotten to the point where i can’t even take care of myself.

i have no motivation. my mom calls me a pig for my room not being spotless. she says she’s the victim always and makes me feel bad if i think a certain way, even if i have no control over it.

i don’t know what to do. i feel gross. i cant talk to anyone in my life about it. if i ask to talk to a doctor alone my mom throws a fit. i’m stuck. i cant go to my dad. 

i try to get up and do things. i try to get up and do so much as make myself food, or brush my hair. but everything feels so heavy. or that i don’t deserve it. 

i feel so trapped."

I tried to remake it but instead I deleted all of my footage - slapped myself in the face 100 times (my standard punishment) and dettes the phone numbers of my best friends and left our discord after sending them rude remarks that I don’t even mean to keep them from contacting me again/keep me from apologizing.

I really regret this. I feel really really embarrassed and bad. Help me."

1029,My mum keeps telling me how unhappy she is and how she wants to kill herself and I don't know what to do and it's tearing me up inside.,"My mum is in a horrible relationship and has been for years (on and off). There has been some physical abuse and a huge amount of mental abuse. I am one of four (sister 30, me 29, Brothers 16 and 13), my brothers are with the bloke she is with. 

The problems stem from the fact that he doesn't work, spends money on stupid things, lies, cheats, lazy and refuses to do anything about any of it. One of the hardest things is if you were to meet him, you would say he is charming and nice. But there is a darker side, he has thrown plates, he pushed her once and broke her rib, left her while she was pregnant with my youngest brother. There is loads of things like this that have been happening for the last 17/18 years. 

I love my mum dearly, she is an incredible person immensely practical and fun, but she does drink and when she does she gets sad (or the sadness just shows more). We are quite similar in temperament and personality as such she likes to talk to me. But the problem is, these conversations have been getting darker and heaver over the last few years. She constantly says she is a failure that she should have stayed with my Dad, that she has fucked my life up and the lives of my other siblings, that she doesn't see anything bringing her happiness any more. On a few occasions (including tonight) saying that she wanted to hang herself, but in a semi serious/Joking way. 

She has been to the doctor and was prescribed some anti-depressants but she had a bad reaction and was given anti-anxiety medication instead. She was also told to phone a councillor to setup some sessions. No matter how much I encouraged her, she never did, even tonight I said that she should and she refuses syaing ""It wont fix anything, it doesn't work, they are all going to ask me if I'm ok and just tell me to leave X"" I keep telling her that's not the point and they won't do that and that they are there to give you the tools to help manage your feelings emotions and life. But this all falls on deaf ears.  (She was drunk tonight).

I moved away to Europe some time ago for work and I really started feeling more free and light (I had been there of around a year), but because of the pandemic I came back home. 

I feel awful saying this, but I want to listen to her, I want to be there for her and I know I'm nearly 30 so should be able to handle this but, I just can't. I can't help, I can't listen to her pain any more, but at the same time I don't want to stop talking to her as I am one of the only people she opens up to and I couldn't live with myself if she killed herself because I didn't listen.

I don't know what to do, sometimes i feel like my head is splitting apart."
1030,Tips for coming back to society and work after a breakdown?,"I'm getting close to a point where I will be returning to work and society after a pretty major breakdown. Only my supervisor at work knows what happened, and I doubt she has an idea of how bad it was. In fact, she might think I'm faking, but it's hard to know if that's just my insecurities or how she really feels. She's a pretty toxic boss so I am going to need to be prepared for the worst and for her to use this against me. Regardless, I have to transition back (and then find a new nontoxic job). I don't know if I'm ready, but I also don't know what ready feels like. 

Additionally, I should probably tell the people in my life why I dropped off the face of the planet. It's not really that rare for me to be out of communication, but it's been a long time and I feel like a pretty different person after all of this. 

So I was hoping to get some ideas, thoughts, experiences, etc on how to go back to life? How bad of a stigma am I going to be facing? Do I have to tell everyone I'm not violent, just depressed and traumatized?"
1031,YouTube makes me feel like I need to reach unrealistic standards to be happy...,"I’ve been watching youtube for years and seeing people like Syndicate and KSI being able to do basically whatever they want makes me feel like I’ll never be happy unless I can do that too. 

I want the freedom to do what I want and the money to afford it, but that is very unlikely to happen and I feel like it’s an unrealistic goal that I’ve got stuck in my head. 

I want to be comfortable with a normal life without feeling like I’m not doing enough to reach a level of freedom similar to theirs. How do I stop myself from thinking this way?"
1032,Wish I would've just died of the virus instead of living now,"It's never been a life worth living. Not a single moment of it.

Why should it be? None of it's been worth it. Nothing brings me joy. Going back for my second year of college just brings me enormous anxiety. I hate pretty much every aspect of my life anyways. I don't want to just spend all the time in my dorm being miserable and alone like I was last year even without the fucking restrictions. 

Who cares. It was never a life worth it anyways. Not a single second of it has made me glad to be alive. Not in the 20 years I've been living in this hellhole. Not a single minute has even mattered. 

I don't want to look in the mirror anymore. I hate myself. I hate everything about myself. I can't even stand to see pictures of me that's how much I hate being me. I hate my body, my voice, my personality, my history, my taste in media, everything. And yet I was fucking cursed to be who I am because some selfish slut decided to get knocked up instead of telling her baby daddy to wear a fucking condom. My bio mom is a stupid bitch––it's all her fault and I hope she suffers and dies."
1033,I’m only attracted to deeply troubled people,"I have a problem- I’m only attracted to deeply troubled men. Like if they have mental health issues, a drug addiction, family problems it entices me in.

My last relationship was with a man with BPD and that thing almost broke me. I suffered severe depression and anxiety. I thought that would stop me from going for troubled men but nope, now I’m healed I’m looking for the exact same thing.

This guy literally sexually assaulted me the other night and at first I felt sad but then I was like ‘maybe I didn’t make it clear’ or ‘I should have just had sex with him and stopped being a prude’. Now I fancy him. Like I don’t understand me. 

I’ve been through so much shit and I’m still looking for more."
1034,I’m in a really dark place,"I just really hate myself. I hate who I am, I hate how I am, I hate how I always upset and hurt people around me no matter what I do. 
I have unresolved traumas that cause me to lash out sometimes no matter how hard I try to control myself and tell myself to shut up.

I wish I had some fucking duct tape for my entire fucking face because then maybe I wouldn’t say dumb shit all the time... 
therapy doesn’t seem to be helping, medication doesn’t help, jobs don’t help, I’m just a fucking lost cause"
1035,trauma over something small that happened,"for context, my dad died in December - that's not what's effected me, i've already grieved and feel better about it now.

what happened was in March i decided ""alright, this is a sign that life is too short and i put it off any longer"" and decided i wanted to medically transition from female to male since i'm 18.

i was talking with my sister about it, the person i came out to in my family first, because i trusted her and y'know, i just needed to talk it out with someone close to me. our mom has never been the most accepting but she'd never kick me out or disown me for being trans so i felt okay about this - however any trans issues i had that i wanted to bring up to her, i did so through a note or text because i can't handle having stressful conversations face-to-face...

my sister knew this so she brought up the point that i hadn't had a ""real"" conversation with mom yet - which i don't think is accurate, i had, just not in the most conventional sense. i tried to explain that and that i physically could not talk about something like that (where i didn't really know what kind of reaction i'd get) in person.

and... she accuses me of not caring about our mom's mental health. that i didn't care that she was depressed. that i was taking something away from her. that she couldn't handle losing both her husband and daughter.

and that's completely traumatized me. it's been five months and despite my mental health rapidly declining, i haven't said anything because i don't want to make my mom's mental health worse. i don't want her to know about how bad it's gotten, about how up and down my moods are and how overwhelming it is to the point where i desperately need help but can't receive that help because of the pandemic (i have a very weak immune system so i can't go to therapy yet without risking getting sick)

and as much as i want to inform my sister of how much she's fucked up my mental health, i won't. because i don't want to cause tension in our family and make our mom upset.

so if there's a way to more subtly let her know how much she's effected me, please let me know."
1036,I need help feeling less shitty and insecure about going back to do an NVQ3 (UK 2 A Levels/US high school diploma) after years of graduate unemployment [,"Basically I graduated a few years ago now with a BA in English and History, however I immediately relapsed on my mental health so couldn't compete in the graduate job market. In that time I got an autism (high functioning ASD/Aspergers) diagnosis and I've been doing a lot of volunteering to compensate. One of those was volunteering in a primary school, since I wanted to be a teacher at the time, but I had a confidence crisis after being sacked for being late a few times due to my mental health, and this put me off thinking I could cut being in a school for several years. As far as local autism support services go, I was on an employment gateway scheme in 2017 but the funding for the charity got cut due to it being EU funded/Brexit. So I got discharged early and not much came of it job-wise, nor did I get to keep in touch with most of the programme leaders.

Last year I did a TEFL, thinking of starting fresh by travelling abroad to China at the start of this year to teach English there and see the world. Obviously I didn't go due to COVID, but I was afraid of going anyway. Currently I'm doing online distance learning of CACHE's NVQ Level 3 teaching assistant training. Although I did look at it for open days late last year, I don't feel mentally well enough to handle the PGCE, which I understand is one of the most intensive degrees out there. It would mean a lot of debt for nothing for that to happen-so I thought I should see whether being a TA was right for me first, or if even that would lead me into panic attacks.

My main problem is that a bit of me feels ashamed that I'm not doing an MA or even PhD by now. I'm fine reading lit and philosophy etc., but I panic whenever reading corporate, finance or business including plain old job vacancy listings. I said that I started looking at open days for PGCE but didn't feel confident to pursue. I did feel confident pursuing an MA in English or History, but my mum (loving, but a helicopter parent who is part of my anxiety disorder's pereptuation) convinced me out of it by saying ""how are you going to pay for it."" Which is true. I have disability benefit (but it was supposed to be reassessed before the lockdown) but it would be a big gamble, and I live in social housing which for any sort of student experience I'd have to give up.

I missed out on a social life the first time during my degree since I was a home student, this means I have no student debt but my social skills feel behind everyone else (they already were because of ASD and social anxiety), and I didn't make many friends which also is a cause of insecurity. To be honest, while I've got some close friends from high school who've stuck with me throughout, a lot of old classmates have well moved on and out of the area, and most of my new friends the past few years have been made through Facebook, and while I care for a lot of them, this has posed two problems really. One, I go through phases of thinking they're better than me (because more Friends, job/career, Masters/PhD family or partner, house, car, travelled and so on) and on the flipside, some of them have tried politically grooming/radicalising me to positions I don't agree with tbqh.

To top things off, I am struggling more with the NVQ3 training than I thought I would, which makes me feel stupid because ""isn't this an A Level course? Am I smarter than a 16 year old?"" It's not impossible but I have had to put time into it. I've also had to redo a couple of assignments, which as a perfectionist is essentially signalling I'm stupid. I've had enough therapy to not relapse over this sort of thing but not got far enough to not berate myself over it. My friends say that I'm really clever but I don't feel like it, I feel like an impostor waiting to be found out, and struggling with 'just' a Level 3 NVQ is proof of that when I 'should' be at Level 7 or 8 now.

I'm not sure whether I need advice or support, maybe a smack to my ego? Lol, thank you anyway"
1037,Second opinion for therapy,"At the moment I am in schema therapy and it is ending in September. I’ve been in this group for almost 10 months. So far I did see improvement but I feel like I need more therapy, just different than schema. 

So far I’ve been diagnosed with borderline (traits), depression, avoidant personality disorder and self harm. I basically only got to join the group because ‘I didn’t have enough borderline traits’ so I could join. 

Besides the weekly group which is every week for 1,5 hours and I basically get 10 minutes tops to talk and then it is listening and listening. I still have issues with panic attacks, emotional outbursts/moodswings, self harm and depression. I explained to my therapist I want more therapy because I feel like this isn’t ‘enough’ for me and I need more intense therapy instead of just 10 minute ‘me’ time in the group. Individual sessions aren’t always helpful because we have to do imagery rescripting and that doesn’t always help because I have to dig for traumatic memories from the past, but I need more help for situations I find very difficult now also. 

I have explained all this and she is convinced I don’t need any more therapy which I think is weird?? They only see me very shortly and in a different mood which doesn’t show how I am outside of the group and what i have to cope with... 

Do I have to listen to them and try to handle my life with what I’ve learned or listen to my gut; ask for more/explain or go search somewhere else? Idk what to do... because if I could be better out of sheer will I would but I can’t do this alone..."
1038,No insurance,"I need mental health help in the San Marcos or Austin TX area. I need a support group a therapist or a physiatrist, preferably all free I can go to. My bipolar and adhd are untreated and I’d like to be in focus for school and work."
1039,I dont know how to tell my parents that I feel suicidal all the time,"I have to get this off my chest so here goes, I always feel like I am worth nothing and there is nothing I can do to change it, and that i cant pursue my dreams. 

For context, I am an immigrant in the us from India that is living on my parents work Visa, what this means is that a lot of things that people normally do in the us, I cant, for example i cant get a job, get scholarships, and there is the constant fear of the government telling us to get out

This makes it feel like I wont be able to do what I want to pursue, game developer, even though I get good grades. This has really led to a spiral of despair in my life, which has led me to wanting to kill myself a lot of the time, and to go as far to put a knife to my neck and just at the last moment backing out many times.

I want it talk to someone about this, and while I feel like my family would be supportive, my sister has an eating disorder and I dont want my family to go through something like that again, and while I hope my friends would understand, I dont want to be seen differently for telling them how I feel. 

I dont know what to do and I'm hoping someone here might be able to help."
1040,Mental splurge,"I really have been struggling lately with increasing periods of dissociation. The only official Diagnoses are Bpd, depression and Anxiety mental health wise... I’ve been advised to seek more help with my mental health as i am part of a system, but honestly terrified of official help and diagnosis. At the same time it could help long term. Family have been low key aware of something for decades. 
And yet it still feels weird... faking being a single unit is just normal so allowing each one to exist outside of the rest seems alien but we have separate identities and species etc. System is something that was vaguely bought up by a therapist years ago and we had mentioned stuff prior to that even. Just terrified of being committed as we have never been held in a mental unit and pride ourselves on the fact we kept things together throughout everything.

I recently lost my dog and feel guilt at the fact he had to be put to sleep. He was my best friend. I only had 3 years with him but loved him so much. He slept in my bed and I went everywhere with him. Life just feels so much worse without him in it and I just want to end it all. He was a senior dog when I rescued him and he was my first dog. I can't eat or sleep. I feel sick. Will the pain ever end?"

I get bouts of pure bliss then something insignificant happens, such as chipping my already shitty teeth, and I sink back down. I don't want to continuously depend on my family for support. I know it can feel like a burden, and I don't want that. 

Today's been rough. My SO is out of town and we got into it over the phone, thanks to good ole Facebook. And it's just really bringing me down. I don't feel like I can confront him about my issues without it turning into reasons I have no room to feel the way I do because of past mistakes. Which I've made a lot of. And it's just hard to keep myself together when I'm reminded of my mistakes when I try to bring up the things that bother me here and now.... Just some words of encouragement would be nice. I know this isn't as serious as others... I'm just feeling down today... And don't feel like I have anywhere else I can go to confide in myself about."

1046,does anybody else has this really violent intrusive thoughts?,"(sorry if my english is bad) okay so i(18m) have an history with self harm, eating disorders, anxiety, etc. but it has been more than half a year since i've gotten better, i mean the are still some things u know but in terms of self harm nothing. lately i have been feelin down a lot, which isn't weird for me, but i have also had a lot of intrusive thoughts like at first they were just like ""cut yourselve you know you want to blah blah"" but now  they have been scalating like ""smash your head on the wall let's see what happens, bite your hand really hard maybe you can take out some skin, what if you stabbed yourselev mutiple time?"" and such. of course i haven't done any of these things but idk i just wanted to ask if this is normal or not?"
1047,Why do I have these thoughts,I just keep having thoughts in my head that all of my friends secretly hate me and.just put up with me. I have to constantly ask/tell my best friend if I am being annoying or a nuisance because I'm afraid that they'll abandon me and they keep reassuring me that I'm not being a nuisance and such.
1048,Not really sure.,"Like the title says I'm not really sure, it's just about alot of things. I spose it stems most recently from my leaving my second job to go full-time in my trade, which I graduated from my schooling for during covid after having gone back to school at 25. My anxiety has been slowly climbing everytime my kitchen manager asked me when I was gonna be able to work full. Despite then asking me to work more I can't help but feel they don't have any real faith I my work ability, which in turn has been making my anxiety grow even more. I had confidence in my abilities while I was my final year of school after completing my workterm.  But between my anxiety and overthinking of how people around me are acting I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really cut out for it. On-top of that I have been asked by friends to put thought into moving into a new apartment with them which makes me question if I should really quit my other job. Which raises my worries about the fact I can never tell if I have genuine friends or no.  I'm aware that this post is a block of undirected venting.

 I wanted to add I have ADHD, the more mental where I have trouble focusing or get far too focused.

It took me the better part of an hour to get this outta my head and onto text. So sorry again for the block of text."
1049,Is it bad that I'm not affected by death?,"Serious question people. Because it's something I've wondered for a long time and it's worrying me.

Is it odd death doesn't affect me?

I mean it never has. Family members, friends, suicides even of loved ones. None of this has ever affected me negatively at all. I've never had to grieve either, I just accept their gone and carry on.

I'm wondering if I'm alone in this? Because I see statuses about people grieving lost ones a lot, and the fact I don't makes me feel like I'm somewhat insane of psychotic.

I haven't really spoken about it before out of fear of being judged for it, but now I just want to get it off my chest so that I can understand myself a little better."
1050,Concerned I am going to relapse to bad mental health... looking for advice to avoid this,"Hi,

I am bipolar. I say this first because for the past four years my life has revolves around being bipolar. 2 years ago I finally received a diagnoses, and the first 6 months medication actually made it worse and I lost my relationship,job and dropped out of school. With the help of my doctor and a new boyfriend I got out of that rutt and changed my life. My new boyfriend was very supportive and assisted me to get on my feet. After three months of dating I got a job in the career I went to school for (even though I dropped out) my boyfriend has been my rock for the last year and a bit and has helped me keep a routine that keeps me stable and sane. It’s boring but Ive not had an issue with my mental health since. I rely heavily on routine and when covid hit and my routine changed I started having episodes. With heavy work on keeping my routine the exact same (legit had to pretend I was still working in the office even tho I was at home) I was able to stabilize myself and I’ve been pretty good ever since. Well we just found out my boyfriend got a new job and he has to leave for 6 months. Right before he got the job I decided to finish school online in the fall and paid my tuition (on top of working my 40 hour a week job). Well now he is going to be gone and I am going to have two dogs to care for (we live in an tall building top floor apartment, so no just letting them into the back yard to pee) work, (back in the office now too) school AND have to be alone most of the time... when I’m a really dependent person. The past few days I’ve started to get anxiety about this whole situation to the point I’m having panic attacks in my work bathroom because I think I’m am going to have a major manic or depressive episode triggered by the change in routine and loneliness. I am worried I am going to ruin my good job, great boyfriend and ruin my bank account. And before you say it, once I go into an episode I have no rational thinking to pull myself out, 99% to get me out of it I need outside help and no one is going to be there to help me this time. 

I’m just wondering if any of you have advice to potentially avoid a breakdown before it happens I could really use it, I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and if history repeats itself I could ruin it all.

Thanks!"
1051,Why do I feel like I deserve to be in pain?,"So I’ve finished work and today a lot of stress hit me along with depression, like it hit me like a train and right now
I’m on my
Way home but I keep wondering what it’s like to be hit by a car or just summat cos I feel like o deserve pain?! Idk what’s wrong with me and I don’t like it"
1052,I want to apologize,"I wanted to apologize to my previous post, titled [Fuck my Psychiatrist](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ic8r6g/fuck_my_psychiatrist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I understand that there is a pandemic going on and that it’s not always possible to handle things correctly. I’ve been dealing with some mental health issues but I had no right to take it out on someone who was just trying to help me. 

I went in with a preconceived notion on how the session would go, and when it didn’t go the way I expected, I got upset. It’s not the psychiatrist’s fault that I’m dealing with mental health issues, or that I can’t communicate well, or that there’s a god damn pandemic going on. I had no right to get upset like I did. Miscommunications happen. Hopefully I can reschedule an appointment or find a different psych to talk to in person when I go up to school."
1053,My best friends are leaving and I’m scared,"I‘m not sure if this is the right place for this. Today I learned that my two best friends are going to move to Berlin in two months. They have been planning to do that for about a year or so and I’m genuinely happy for them, I 
really am. They’re so happy and they really deserve it.  It’s not really a surprise but now it’s “official” and although I saw it coming it hit me like a truck.

Yet I feel sad and left behind. I know that’s a selfish thought but I’m so scared of being lonely.  They are the most important people to me and now they’re starting  a new life and I won’t
 be a part of it. It hurts so much. 

What am I saying? I don’t know. I will have to deal with this somehow. Right now I’m feeling sad and scared and I’m feeling bad for saying that because I know I can’t make other people’s decisions about me.
I just don’t want to be alone."
1054,I am not one to vent anything about myself and I believe that it maybe time for me to vent my feelings or lack there of.,"I don’t know what I am feeling all of the time I just feel empty just making decisions from my instincts no feelings involved last time I cried was 2 weeks ago because the love of my life left me suddenly after 8 months of I believe a healthy relationship, before that the last time I cried was 6 years ago and that was because my grandmother passed away. I still love my ex the only thing I can think about is her I just want to go back in time and fix myself to be better for her not to be cold that was the problem that she had with me, I tried to tell her that I’m working on that and if she could just be more patient with me that I would fix that problem within me. I gave up my social life for her I touch with my friends because of that. I just feel so bad about myself I want to know what is wrong with me in her eyes so I can fix it and be with her. She told me that I was manipulating her, I asked her why does she think that and she replied that she just felt like I was manipulating with her feelings, I tried to explain that the problems we had are just temporary and that they will be resolved with patience and help from the other person in the relationship. I tried my best to be as good of a person to her. I poured my heart and soul for her I gave her all of myself because I believed in us. I just feel empty like life has flipped over. I tried to vent to one friend and I feel like he doesn’t understand what I’m saying and that he doesn’t care, the problem may also lie in me because I don’t know what I am feeling I just feel like this ———— no emotions just survival. 

Sorry for it being so long and emotional. 
Sorry for the bad grammar I am writing this in an emotional state and I don’t know how to manage the emotions. 

Thank you for listening"
1055,Please Read: Looking for Guidance on Job-Related Anxiety,"Hello all,

I should probably begin by providing a little bit of background information about my situation. I was hired as a teacher earlier this summer. For much of my adult life, I have believed that I wanted to pursue a career in education. Although I initially was excited for this new job, I quickly found myself completely consumed by anxiety and depression as I began preparing for the school year.

As I worked on curriculum over the summer, I was surprised by how little I enjoyed the work and how anxious it made me. In the beginning, I tried to ignore this or else chalked it up to nervous jitters associated with beginning a new job or trying something for the first time. However, over the last few weeks, I have realized that I am dealing with a much more serious problem. We have had a number of on-campus events in the last several weeks as we have been preparing for the school year to start this month. During these events, I have been overwhelmed by a sense of dread about this job. I have found myself asking, ""Why on earth did I think I wanted to do this?"" I have been unable to sleep or eat and have been having almost daily panic attacks about starting the school year.

Classes have begun but I am currently taking a medical leave of absence because my anxiety has become so unmanageable. I realize that I have put the school in a difficult situation but the panic I have been feeling is really out of my control. I have serious questions about whether or not I will be able to perform my duties as needed. It is clear to me that I need some serious help working through my anxiety issues and I don't know if I will be able to get the help I need with the hectic schedule of a teacher. I have real concerns about what will happen to my mental health if I continue with this job. To be honest, at this point I feel incapable of doing the work required of me. I have no idea what to do and have come here to see if I can't get some help discerning a plan of action.

Thank you for reading."
1056,My own world,I know it’s a saying and all for daydreaming but it’s different I know it’s different. I’ve created a world where I am god with characters I love and have bonds with and it’s like a link from this world to mine so whenever someone does something to me I go off to my world and do whatever I please. When I listen to music it’s like a trigger to a scenario like an epic fight scene or a stroll through the Capital of my City in my Kingdom and it shuts me off from any real world interaction. I like characters in my head more than some people I know? I’ve built my morals and dreams on this reality. What I want to be when I grow up is based on the goal of eventually becoming a god. I’d say if you ad up how long I’ve been in this world altogether it is 3 years of my life give or take. And it feels like an eternity. My real dream is to bring all the stuff from my world to this world . It’s never going to happen but that’s what dreams are if you want something impossible everything seems good from my perspective. Some might not understand what I’m saying cause I went on a ramble and I’m sorry but I want to know do any of yous have a world as bad as mine? If so how long do yous think yous spent? Thanks.
1057,Do you have a song that perfectly describes your depression/anxiety/feelings?," Mine would be Migraine by Twenty One Pilots (and basically almost all of their songs).

And  I heard the song 'I think I'm okay' by Machine Gun Kelly for the first  time the other day, and can definitely relate to some of the lyrics.  Like: "" You'll find me alone at midnight Inside my mind, tryna get  things right (something's fucking wrong with me)"" or "" I hurt myself  sometimes, is that too scary for you?""

I was just curious about your relatable songs."
1058,Can addictive behaviours used during adolescence affect brain development?,"Can excessive gambling, pornography, video game and internet deter brain development into a downwards spiral?"
1059,How to tell someone you love that they have mental issues?,"My ex broke up with me a month ago. As ive been thinking through the relationship ive realized she had MAJOR insecurity issues, trust issues, anxiety (she knew about anxiety) and due to all these she tried to sabotage our extremely healthy (despite the sabotage lol) relationship multiple times- and i always looked past what she did because i loved her. However she broke up with me this time (clearly due to self sabotage) i want to respect that she no longer wants to be with me, and we are meeting up sometime this week. 

QUESTION- i truly still love this woman, but i really dont think we can work this out. That being said, i dont want to be a dick and just meet up and say “you have these problems” but i genuinely care about her and want her to be able to fix her problems, because despite my best efforts i couldn’t help. I think she needs therapy (she has lots of childhood trauma). How do i tell her in the nicest way possible that she needs help. I could lay out all the times shes sabotaged herself?"
1060,I'm giving up on seeking help.,"After multiple failed suicide attempts, depression, self harm, and anxiety which have all gotten worse over the past 5 months, I started seeing a therapist. She eventually referred me to a new therapist who she thought could help me more. After just one session with this therapist she decides that I should see someone else. This comes after saying that she would be happy to start seeing me and that she is particularly trained in treating my symptoms. She even started to talk to me about her problems with her kids, work, and having to pay bills. 

After this I'm just ready to go back to how I was before all this by bottling up my feelings and hiding them from everyone. The only relief I have gotten is when I told the last therapist that I give up on seeking help because it's just easier to deal with it all on my own.

I see it everywhere that mental health is something that people need to seek help for but everytime I seek help for it, I just get abandoned and sent to someone else because they can't help me. Why start seeing another therapist/counselor when I'm just going to have to start over again with a new one?"
1061,The human brain sucks when it stops functioning properly.,"Only 15 minutes ago I posted in r/unpopularopinion (now deleted) about kids learning to face reality at a young age, fairy tales, parents, blah blah...

And I'm going to get help first thing tomorrow. At some point in the conversations I started to panic and had a sudden realization that maybe I just had bad parents? Or maybe I'm only 28 and just now becoming totally aware of myself and my subconscious thoughts? Maybe I have some deeper mental issues with no proper diagnosis?

I don't really know how to explain anything other than my brain isn't cooperating with me, I have no control over my own thoughts, and I need to fix it immediately. 

Sorry for ranting. I just don't know what I'm experiencing and it's terrifying. A sudden rush of what-ifs sent me into a spiral real fast and I can't control it."
1062,tips on finding a good therapist?,looking for someone in boston and don’t know where to start
1063,Talked to my grandmother about my mental health,"My gran is 67, she's what we call a baby-boomer. She used to work in a mental institution as a secretary. Her own mother suffered with chronic depression her whole life, got hospitalized for a year (got the electrochocs treatment of course...) and attempted to take her own life more than once. 

However, my grandma has a weir approach of mental health. She's never seen a psychiatrist in her life and considers that you have to be mentally ill to seek council. This led to many arguments because mental illness sounds like an insult in her mouth. 

I'm 20 and I'm not in a good place, never been actually. I don't have depression, I don't have any illness, I'm ""just"" never feeling great. I have panic attacks and I can't manage my stress nor emotions. I think I might have social anxiety and/or an inferiority complex. I'm just not happy with the person I am and the way I behave sometimes, I want to change for the people I love and for myself. I want to have control over myself. 

I told her how I felt and that I was looking into seeking help. But according to her, I should not see a therapist because I'm not ill. It's nothing I can't manage by myself, therapy is not a magic remedy to all my issues, I shouldn't take the spot from someone who really needs help, I'm still young enough and I got time to figure out things for myself...etc. I thought that of all people, she would understand but she doesn't. She thinks I'm weak and I feel like I disappointed her."

It’s all come to a head.

I cannot sleep at night. I don’t focus. Haven’t eaten a whole meal in probably two weeks, until today when I somehow managed. I shake all the time. Gag while I talk on the phone. Ruminate. I feel empty and so extremely sad. It’s pretty well that I don’t have interest in anything anymore. I’m trying new hobbies to bury the pain, but it’s not working anymore. I am just exhausted of being a human. I am so, so tired. 

I know I can’t go on this way, and I have an appointment booked with a psychologist coming up.

But I need relief, the symptoms of whatever is going on with me have manifested physically. I feel like I am dying in both senses.

1074,How do I keep myself sane knowing that I won’t be doing much of anything for the next 6 months?,"I have a pretty good history of the standard anxiety/depression that comes from being a young adult, as well as ADHD that I was diagnosed with in elementary school.

My college closed down in March and it won’t likely be opening until next February. My best friends are away in the army, my girlfriend of 2+ years left me recently, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to/hang out with, and no way to meet people. I work with very few people and, while I get along with them well, we don’t share many interests.

I don’t know what to do, I am beyond lonely and heartbroken, and while I’ve been trying to take care of myself more (eating enough, exercising) I can’t help but want to stay in my bed and sleep every second that I’m not doing something. Before this month I hadn’t had a panic attack in 9 months, but I’ve been having them every couple days again. 

I think I need to drastically change something in my life but I don’t know what, I can’t stand the thought of not meeting any new friends or talking to any new girls for half a year. I’ll end up being asleep all day every day and 120 pounds (I’m almost 6 feet tall) again like I was during my last depressive episode.

1077,My friend is dealing with PTSD. I need help or advice.,"As the title said, my friend is going through a rough time. She was abused by her ex and though she was able to break off the relationship with him she was left with severe PTSD. Lack of appetite, incapability of sleep, flashback, all the symptoms. As we are currently pretty early in a boarding school program in another country with me being the only one with the same native language she doesn't have other friend to rely on. Her parents are also the no-good type that throws out money like fountain water but gives zero emotional care. 

I've been trying to support her as best as I could. I don't push, allowed her to take things in her pace, listened to her whenever she needs. But she's keep getting worse. Lately, she's been getting flashbacks and screamed in public, she can't sleep for more than three hours per two days. 

I've been looking into psycholog or psychiatric, any kind of professional help, but she's been refusing all of them. I've also tried recommending journal keeping or a sleep schedule, though I don't force it on her, but she didn't want to do any of them. I don't know what else to do, I'm afraid she will get worse. 

If there are people here who has similar experience, can you tell me in this situation, what is the best thing a friend can do?"
1078,Is it a normal symptom to rationalize persecutory delusions?,"Over the last couple of years, I have been struggling with persecutory delusions. I have gone undiagnosed for bipolar or schizophrenia after meeting with my psychiatrist on the matter twice ( I have diagnosed depression) It has been chalked up to PTSD brought on by a particularly bad LSD trip a couple of years ago where my friend had a bad trip on two tabs in front of me. Being on acid, it felt like he was raving and ranting about how our friend group had conspired to get him there that night to kill him. I guess I latched onto that bad trip, because over the last two years anytime I would smoke weed I would begin to think the same. However, even with the stoppage of recreational drugs, I tend to now dip into that irrational delusion that my friends are conspiring to kill me in heinous ways. I get nervous to do something as simple as go get food with them or crash at a friend's place because of these fears. My question, is it normal for someone suffering persecutory delusions to rationalize why bad may befall them? I find myself giving a reason as to why they would be trying to hurt me, agreeing that maybe I did enough bad things in life to deserve it and I am being punished for those actions. It causes the delusions to intensify A LOT.  Being able to rationalize something so.... irrational has caused them to spiral into territory I am afraid of going towards ( constant feeling of needing to defend myself, the thought of having to kill in self-defense, etc...) I guess I would feel better if I could confirm with anyone who knows anything on the matter if it's a normal trait of these type of delusions to rationalize them, it would help me put the worry to rest that I AM right."
1079,Does anyone just have that specific safe place they go to?,"Sorry if the title is a bit confusing; I don't mean a physically safe place (as much as that would make my mental health better!) but more of a safe place mentally. Of course, this can mean anything for anyone!

For me, I always think of myself being in this huge field full of flowers with no one around except my SO and I. It's peaceful, it's quiet and I'm happy. Or sometimes I try to picture myself in this beautiful park I found in Washington, where you can see all the beautiful trees and clouds and the nearby lake when you reach the top of the park.

This might totally make me sound like a cliche or just a plain weirdo imaging things, but stuff like that has helped me with my anxiety or when I'm stressing. It gives me a lot of hope as well, like I truly believe that I'll be at those places in the future and that's given me something to look forward to. 

Does anyone else have these safe mental places?"
1080,What options are left?,"
****Extremely long post**** 

My name is Sara I have a son whom has extreme mental illness- ODD, DMDD, ADHD (with impulsivity), with severe mental development. We struggle with outbursts (violent and aggressive), he  lies, steals , destroys property, hits and throws things and shows no empathy or remorse for doing so, more times then not he laughs, smirks and smiles (especially if I show emotions that I’m upset or someone else is), he’s verbally and emotionally abusive to myself and others. He often times gets so volatile that destructive behavior is the only calming outlet. He has been in three facilities ( five different time)to help with these issues, on a gambit of medicine ( that just bandaids the issues). He has tried to commit suicide twice and self harmed in various ways. His current form is gnawing his fingernails and toenails until they bleed, punching himself with his fists and/or random objects.
We have therapists, counselors, psychologist and psychiatrists on board. We also have him in OT, Speech and weekly CBT therapy as well as TBRI therapy. We also are treading waters with EMDR therapy. 
He currently has an IEP for school and a behavior plan as well in place. He’s functional abilities fall between 4.5 years and 6.8 years educational purposes and daily life skills. 
These behaviors have been consistent for 6 years now. These have been ongoing issues since he was 3.5 years old. He’s gotten worse over the last few years. We have seen no improvements.  He cycles so rapidly that it’s a whirlwind of daily struggles. Nothing about his behavior is ever the same (triggers or reasons). I have come to a halt with dealing with it. I am very closed off and emotionally detached (not for lack of loving or caring) simply because I am struggling with what avenue to take next. He’s had almost every test they could run on him and watched him from all areas. He’s even a myth to most doctors and therapists that meet him. 

He was a 24 week premiee with a grade IV brain bleed in the front left lobe of his brain affecting his frontal lobe. He had only the bronchial branches and no lung sacks. He was on a ventilator for a great length of time. Through his journey in the NICU he suffered sepsis, three medically induced comas and a variety of surgeries. Through that journey he was given very potent medication to help him rid infection, thrive and survive.  All the while not knowing the long term effects of those medicines.  Through the first 3 years of his life was a constant back and forth to the PICU for various health issues, surgeries and testing.

I am reaching out, I need help. I need to know I’m not alone. I have asked for yet again another opinion on him. He’s lost all parts of his childhood and is slipping into void again.  No eminent danger presently to himself or others so a hospital isn’t willing to evaluate him at the moment. 

I am scared for him and myself because I know where this shadowland leads. These are the biggest fears I have for  him. 
We have excessive eating issues. He’s violent when not allowed to eat beyond his portions or getting junk in place of not eating. He’s hiding food and has gained over 30 lbs in 6 months. His medication has contributed to some of this but the rest I have no answer for. 

Please I am begging someone to speak up and stand up to show me that I too can be heard."
1081,Why am I reaching out on reddit when I deep down don't want help and want to die so bad? Why are people telling me I want help when I really don't?,"I know how to do it and what has to be done, I know the time, I know how to convince people it would be an accident, but I just can't take the final leap. I get so close &amp; I don't understand why I can't just do it already? I keep telling myself to just do it &amp; I can't. I've been trying to convince myself over and over that loved ones would accept that I was supposed to die. My heart is feeling so heavy. 

My urge to die is still so strong, I can't focus on anything but my mental pain all day now, nothing is helping any more, I used to have hope &amp; see things worth living for and I can't anymore. I just don't see how things getting better. I'm going to be so old soon, have no career, won't ever be able to support myself or be successful, I'll be terribly lonely because I'm asexual &amp; my family won't want to anything to do with me, I'm not as religious as my family, and I'm different so my family won't stop telling me how messed up I am. My parents won't stop mentally attacking me every day and I can't get myself out. I thought I could &amp; I never will be able to. I'm trapped. Most of my family hates me like crazy and this year we all tore apart. My sisters turned out to be people I didn't know after this family conflict brought out secrets. They constantly make up gossip about me. I'm so jealous of people who have a mom and dad there for them &amp; and brothers and sisters to live life with. I have no normal family. Any family gathering ends up in a conflict that breaks my heart even more. I'm so different. 

I realized that none of my friends are true friends. When my birds died this year no one cared to be there for me. People thought it was best to leave me alone, and ignored my messages because they didn't know what to say to me. But when I needed someone no one was there. I had one friend there &amp; I realized that she also is now not a true friend anymore. I have no one and nothing to look forward to. I hate everything about myself. Because my birthday is so soon I'm just freaking out about how I'm such a complete failure in so many ways. I'm so embarrassed about my age. I won't ever contribute to society and I don't want to. My past successes, if any, mean nothing to me. I don't think anything will change my mind. On top of this, a health issue that I thought I got rid of came back &amp; I have no strength to battle it. I did do stuff I know I wasn't supposed to, and it's my fault but I can't do this anymore. I have no more strength. I can't do this anymore. 

If there's a God, then I hate god. How could he take 4 birds away from me within a year? I hate how hard my past was. I understand that people have it worse, but I can't help to hate how my life has been. So many of my loved ones died and I hate god. There was more trauma and abuse than I could handle. This world is no longer beautiful to me. I can't see any beauty anymore. It's just one dark cloud. I was put into the wrong family, the religion I was born into is too much for me, I can't be who I want to be, and there's only pain in this world. I want nothing to do with this world.  

No matter what people will tell me I don't think I'll ever be convinced that it's worth it to see if my mind will change. 

I don't see how my mind will ever change. I just want my life to be over. I know this world would be better off without me. Please don't feel the need to respond. I'm obviously not committing suicide. I'm just writing privately what I can't say to anyone who knows me. Just have to pretend to smile to other people in life, while I secretly am hoping my life will end soon. I want to disappear."

1083,I feel so empty,"I have officially reached my lowest. I feel so alone and empty. I don't feel I can talk to someone because when I try I'm just disregarded as being over dramatic. I'm alone and quite frankly scared, for the first time in along time."
1084,My best friend just left after 14 years of being friends because I told him about having DID,I've been friends with this guy for so long and today I told him that I had DID he called me crazy and just left. I was scared he wouldn't take it well but I didn't think this would happen. I'm really struggling and have no idea what to do. I've already told my other friends about it years ago but I've been really scared to tell him and I guess my fears came true.
1085,im just so tired of having a body,"oh my god i hate my body so much i already had an ed and now i just going to EXPLODE with dysphoria (im trans) AND my ed is coming back and i just CANT do this shit again I JUST WISH I DIDNT HAD A BODY i just wanna be a fucking concept, an idea, a memory :("
1086,Should I seek psychological counseling?,"I’ve lost touch with reality I don’t know what I am really feeling like I just go on logical thinking and that is how I get an idea on what I should be feeling and I also look at what other people are feeling and I try to mimic them feeling wise. I don’t know what to feel almost like I have no feelings at all. Already I have that problem for two years or so. 

But if I would seek counseling I would need to wait till I’m 18 years old so I can go to counseling without my parents consent. I tried to get them to find a counselor like that for me but they just say you’ll be fine."

1088,I've lost my reason,"She made me want to become a better person. 
She convinced me to go to a doctor for the first time in years. 
I got a referral to find a therapist at her suggestion. 
I tried to be everything she needed. 
I have her everything she asked for.
I was always there for her but she never returned the favor. 
She wanted me to be her therapist but when I was having a rough day it inconvenienced her to the point of ghosting me because she couldn't handle the negativity. 
I was in love with her. 
The only person I've ever truly loved. 
And she abandoned me. 
After swearing and promising it would never happen because she knows what it's like to be ghosted. 
I was disposed of like I never even mattered. 
Now I have no interest in going to therapy, in continuing going to the doctor, or taking care of myself anymore. 
She was the only thing keeping me alive and she threw me away like a broken toy. 
My birthday is in less than a week and I'm not sure I plan on making it that far. 
I've lost my reason, my purpose, and my chance at a happy future. 
I would've done anything to make her happy. 
But apparently, only me being gone would make her happy. 
Fine, you've got your wish. 
Soon, I'll be gone."
1089,I feel like I’m just floating,"So for the past couple of months I felt nothing like myself and felt something was off. I’m a very upbeat and outgoing person, overall was just a really happy girl. Then I just kinda don’t recognize who I once was. Like I feel almost dissociated from all of my previous memories and stuff from before. If I ever look at pictures or think about how I was before I just am not able to connect with it all. 

And it’s almost like I go through waves, like I’ll have some good days once and a while. But if something ask me, am I happy, I’m not really happy. Even tho maybe I’ll have those goods days,as a whole I’m not happy. And I feel numb to everything around me and I just feel like I’m floating rn and am not in touch with everything going on in my life right now. 

I keep telling myself, I have roof over my head, I’m in good health, my family is here with me. And there are people that are dying everyday. This frustrated the HELL OUT OF ME. Bc I should be grateful for all the blessings in my life so why can’t I just call it a day and be happy. And I am aware how truly blessed I am!! So I just don’t know why I’m unable to enjoy life rn.

I’m very stressed out about the future even tho Im young. I’m just not happy with myself in anyway self esteem wise and in regards how my mentAl health is. So I’m hoping it’s just a phase and eventuAlly I’ll be able to feel better about myself."
1090,Everytime I get my life on track I do something to sabotage my self growth,"After failing school and being bad with financing
Two years later I finally have my life on track, I have an amazing girlfriend, amazing friends, I'm starting school in January and getting my own place around March, my ADHD had made it difficult for me to believe in myself especially with recent failures stemming to about a year ago so this is a big step, I've been extremely motivated at work, I've been having fun with my job.

But now I'm disassociating myself from everything and everyone? I want to use something other than sobriety as a crutch, I want to leave my girlfriend, my friends, my job, my home, my family, I'm beginning to psych myself out of school under the preface that I'm not good at anything and I never follow through with things like I should. I want to kill myself but I've already thought too hard about it and know I never would or will have the balls to do such a thing. Why is this happening? What makes it so hard for myself to believe in success? I want to sell all my things and just sit in a ditch and drown. I feel like everyone looks at me differently these days, I feel as though I have nothing to offer to anyone. There is no underlying pretense to be deserving of someone's friendship or companionship. This always comes and goes in waves, I'll have a couple years of no problems and all of a sudden everything comes crashing down in this exact way no matter the outliers."
1091,I never “lived” throughout my teen years and now it feels like my young adult years aren’t going to be any different. I think I’m going to die lonely and full of regrets.,"I don’t smoke, drink, or go clubbing. I’m extremely shy, I’m scared of big groups, and I’ve never in my life approached a girl I found pretty. I’ve always been more than a wallflower. When I see other young people having fun, living their best life, I feel like the biggest loser. I look at them from a distance and say “why can’t I be like that too?” And right after, I get paranoid that they’re making fun of me or judging me. 

I don’t know who I upset in a past life to have this. I’m so lonely. I’ve never even had a girlfriend, and meanwhile, all my friends are living their best love &amp; sex life. Sometimes I hate myself. Why can’t I be an asshole? Why do I have to be so shy? Why can’t I go to a club every Saturday and charm every girl I encounter like these other guys my age? Why can’t I at least go up to a girl on the street and introduce myself, maybe try to get her number? I genuinely hate myself sometimes. I wish I was cool, I wish I was in a better place. But for some reason, I’m just a big fucking loser."
1092,I want to stay in a ward?,"I've always wanted to go stay in the psych ward. I've had these recurring feelings for probably 5 or so years. I dont think there's really enough wrong with me at the same time though. My mental health isn't great, and I'm trying to fix it but I can't help but feel like a long stay in the ward would fix me (I know it won't) but maybe I could get help in there and find an answer/diagnosis and it would be a lil holiday. 

At the same time though, money isn't something I have nor something I want to ask other people for. Again, I dont feel like there's enough wrong with me to justify going, and I'm worried it would just be rude to other people who need it more. Then again I already feel rude for wanting to stay somewhere where a lot of people probably don't want to stay. 

I've never been in a ward but my mum did once threaten to send me 5 years ago when she found out I was self harming. She doesnt really get it I dont think. She says she has a mental illness (hasn't told any of her 3 kids what) so she should understand more. But when I told her I think i have this thing it was ""well you used to think you had depression, but now you think this? Sure"" and that's its probably just trauma, there's nothing wrong with you. But cjildhood trauma can cause mental health issues, and if i have a personality disorder its not always going to look like something is wrong. I know something is though, I just can't tell anyone for some reason

Sorry for the long rant. I think i needed to type it all out. I guess I'm venting but also sort of looking for opinions/advice. Thank you"
1093,I feel like I’m hurting the people around me,I really want to let out my feelings but I feel like I’m to needy and clingy to the people I am close to and I think I might be accidentally hurting them by constantly confiding in them with my problems.  I hate myself for being like this and I think that by telling them what I’m feeling I’ll be proving that I really am a piece of shit so I’m writing it down here. I’m not okay. I am okay and I should be okay but I’m just not. My anxiety is constantly getting the better of me and I never stop being afraid of losing the people that I love. I feel like I’ve been so stressed and so anxious but no one seems to notice. Either I’m getting better at hiding it or no one seems to care. I don’t even know what I’m anxious about which is the worst part. One of the things I hate most about myself is that I can never understand my own emotions. I’m not having any suicidal thoughts but I feel like shit and I don’t even know what to do anymore. I don’t even know if I’m writing this because I need attention or because I want at least someone to know something is wrong.

1097,Short term memory loss and bedridden from meds in the mental hospital,"When I self admitted myself into the psych ward they gave me pills that made me bed ridden, and gave me short term memory loss for a few days-week? They eventually switched my meds thankfully. I was in trembling tears or something as well when my husband visited me. 

It's been a over a year later and I think I'm going to request my records so I can know what they gave me during my stay. Anyone else have similar stories, and how did they deal with it?"
1098,i feel like i’m losing my mind,"so I’ve been back in therapy for a couple of months now and I was doing better but in the last few days it feels like everything has just gone to shit. But I just wanna talk about what is happening right now, so every since I was younger, I am now 18, I’ve been afraid of the dark because I would see things and become extremely paranoid that they were following me, to the point that I couldn’t sleep, but I thought that was normal because I was young, but even now even if I’m in a lighted up room sometimes I just see this thing but I know that it isn’t really real but I’m still really fucking afraid IDK i’m just panicking"

1101,School just makes me incredibly anxious,"So currently I am in the middle of my exams, this is the final school “based” exam I have before my HSC. 

I feel incredibly underwhelmed by it, two of my teachers already told me I got a mark in the 60’s for math English. But here is the thing throughout the year with all my subjects I’ve been getting 70,80 and 90x so they are like it’s not gonna affect you much. 

But I have a dream atar of 90 right now and it feels so unapproachable. Like I don’t think I will get it. Worst is because I have tried my hardest and everything and feel like I don’t get the marks. 

On top parental pressure and pressure myself which I drown myself. I honestly don’t know if I’m even gonna get into my dream uni. It scares me, especially with COVID, everything feels like a mess. 

I honestly feel lost, it took be three hours understand my marks, and not I’m absolutely tarnished."
1102,"I really need to feel valid, and my parents aren’t very good at doing that","I just feel worthless. I’m not suicidal, but I just wish I knew what my purpose is. I don’t know what I want to do either. One of my worst fears is growing up to work at a desk job and waste my life doing things that aren’t fulfilling. But the things that would fulfill me are things I don’t even know how to do. I don’t know how I’m going to be happy when I’m older, or even how to be consistently happy now. I have good days but then like once a week I just have awful days that make me want to stop having emotions. I’m scared to tell someone I know irl, because then I might be forced to go back to the place that made me do scary things so they could “treat” me. I get told by my therapist and my parents that it made me stronger, but I didn’t need to be stronger, I needed to feel safe.


When I was suicidal, my mom guilted me into not committing because she kept talking about how devastated everyone I know would be.  She said the classic guilting phrase, “When you commit suicide, you are just passing your depression onto someone else” So for a while I was living for everyone else, because I was so terrified that if I died like I wanted to,then my friends would feel the way I felt, and I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy."

1104,I need help,"I don’t know if there are any doctors in here but maybe somebody has had a similar experience that can help me. So as recently as 2 months ago, and randomly up to today, I have experienced what I describe as a glitch in my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happens is that I get to thinking about something (same thing every time) and I fall into a loop. That thing I keep thinking when I fall into that loop is weird. I keep thinking about how my mom, my partner who is expecting our daughter in 4 months, and my other family would fair without me alive. Then I switch to how would I would I fair without my mom. Then how I would fair without my partner. And I go through the loop of thinking of each particular combination of those thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

But for a split moment, I worry about if I wasn’t around then if my mom wasn’t around, then my partner, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

5 seconds in, I recognize that I am stuck and I have to force myself to distract myself. I either turn on the tv or I get up and get a drink of water. Whatever it takes to get out of that loop.

&amp;#x200B;

If I really look at the heart of it. It looks as if I am getting an anxiety attack. This is my first daughter. Maybe that is why I am getting these thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this considered an anxiety attack? Or some for of overwhelming stress? What could it be?

""I cant do this. . . Every car I hear go by i pray its you coming back to tell me this is a bad dream.""

My soul has never been so crushed. I wanted to immediately do just that but I keep pulling away. I'm young, I get it but I invested a lot of time and energy and just my being into her and her two little boys for almost two years. I guess this is just me venting or getting it off my chest. I dont know but there ya go. Maybe this makes your shitty day not seem so bad. Good luck to all in this crazy game of life."

She's had it ever since the dog was born and grew up with it. About a year ago our dog almost passed away from cancer, but we had it operated and managed to save it. Ever since then, she's been obsessed with the dog, to the point she wouldn't let us touch it. We went on a vacation 3 days ago and left the dog at my mother's house. After 4 months of persuading her to come with us, she accepted. First day of our vacation passes by normally, but after that, she starts having panic attacks at night and can't seem to calm down. I can't help her in any way. We are going to go back home tomorrow since no one can enjoy it anymore. I'm afraid of how she will handle it when our dog is no longer with us. She attempted suicide once, I fear she might do it again. Just a little rant because I have no one to talk to in real life."
1110,I’m ready to fucking die,"Nothing in my life brings me joy anymore. I burden my parents with tuition. I have no friends. My family thinks I am worthless. I am truly lost in this world. 

Today, I took the time to write down all of the ways I could see to kill myself, with cutting and overdosing being the major contenders. But the big theme throughout my reasoning was just stopping the pain. 

I feel pain in everything I do. All I want is the pain to stop. I just want to stop hurting. 

I’ve felt suicidal since the 3rd grade. I disclosed to my teacher that I had a razor in my bag and I wanted to go to the bathroom and slit my throat. She called my parents and told them I had a stomach ache. My mom came and got me. 

My parents know that I have felt suicidal in the past, but recently it has become a constant thought.

1114,feels like I’m going down hill,"The smallest things tick me off and I get angry so often. My head hurts from the anger, I just want a moment of serenity. I only feel peace when I’m alone but when I’m alone I feel lonely. I know I have family and friends but when I’m with them if they do something that ticks me off I’m mad for a good 10-30 minutes. 

Recently one of my close friends took my charger without asking. Yes, it’s just a charger but I don’t like it when someone uses my things without asking first. I would have said yes if she asked first but she just used it as if it was her own. My other friends where there and stared at me like I was crazy... I left shortly afterwards because I felt like i wasn’t welcome.

It’s a cycle of anger to feeling like I’m a burden being around the people I get mad at. I don’t know how to fix this part of me. 


P.S. I’m sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language."
1115,I just started to write down my thoughts down.. wanted to share maybe someone feels the same way. My writing is awful excuse me if it doesn’t make sense I typed it fairly quick.,"
All good things come to an end,in this case it was far from good but as close to good as it can get. Atleast for me. Everything is calm like a sea my state of mind and emotion rapidly change from a calm ocean to a aggressive storm that comes with dread and panic.. anxiety a rare appearance it has made once again. Why now? Why at night? Why at all? This makes me question of who is really in charge of my emotions is it me? The thoughts in my head or just these chemicals playing peek ah boo. One moment I’m fine there you are! Then the second despair comes over me “where did you go”?. This is definitely helping with this feeling I’m dealing with but god is it confusing and terrifying at times. I feel like a deer caught in the headlights of a on moving car. 

I rather not know nor do I care what controls my emotion. All I want is for this feeling of emptiness to go away.. and if there is a higher entity controlling me why must I feel this way ? Is this a stage I have to experience and if so why dosent everyone feel this way or em I right and everyone is miserable? I have questions but no answers... it’s like I’m that crazy homeless man you see as you walk by the street.

I can’t explain this awful I wouldn’t even call this feeling awful or terrible or any other word in the English language to describe it because it’s so unexplainable, dull and tasteless I can’t explain it. But I know one thing for sure and that is it’s not a good way to feel. Perhaps in my perspective good to feel this once and a blue moon to appreciate The good times and the good memories but a constant feeling of a weights dragging you down and the lack of motivation one feels is not good any living thing. You can of course fight it but one only has so much fight in them before you allow this unwelcome feeling to overcome and take over your being. I may sound like I’m exaggerating things but I swear I’m not. If you never felt this way then perhaps you should share the experience with me but we can both in each other presence and me you both would feel completely alone."
1116,Could anyone explain to me why people around me are suddenly depressed?,"My mom, my two friends are having a tough time right now (one is suicidal). I want to support them with all my heart but my mental health is only halfway to success... I was just learning to have a positive disposition in life but suddenly they came to me and open up for the longest time. It honestly feels draining but I am not complaining since I want to be there for them through thick and thin. How can I be mentally strong for my loved ones and for myself?"
1117,My anger issues have more than just anger.,"I am 20 and have been diagnosed for ADHD and ODD *it is adhd because I am very hyper when it acts up* ive been teaching myself anger management for 5 years after I threw my brother through a wall because he wouldn't let me play the Xbox *I was 15*, ive had time where I've woken up in full body pain and go through a house of smashed doors,windows and mirrors with no cuts, and would watch my sibling cower as I walk by. I knew my blackouts where getting worse. Now I'm not so bad and have a girlfriend who ive been with for 1 year and 7 months and still doing good, but my anger gets in the way sometimes. *I dont blackout anymore* For example after a day at work she comes home and will try too tell me about her day but if I'm not in the mood I'll snap at her, if she tells me about so.ething she very excited about I won't show any care for it openly. I know its not me being a douche because I try too treat everyone with love and respect but anytime those few thing plus more happen I get angry. I'm aware its a problem I am trying as hard as I was 5 years ago at the start. I'm not asking for advice but I'll listen too anyone who has any. My anger as been nothing but a curse too me and I don't want too mess this up over something I haven't gotten control of. My ADHD makes my mind race and sometimes I can't sleep because all I can remember all the things ive done and I haven't forgiven myself for. I leave and drive 20-50 mins out of town too cry once every 3 months or so because it becomes too much for me sometimes. Sometimes I ask myself why ive been dealt this hand but I try too push forward.

*ps if anyone is curious how I know ""exact"" times like that, I monitor myself 25-8 so I don't blackout. Lastly i may not even have odd it might be worse than I thought because my mom told me this year I might have been misdiagnosed because I was diagnosed by a doctor you called too your house, ive had visual and auditory hallucinations rarely but its happened*"
1118,Problems caused by (relatively) high levels of Neuroticism,"I like using the Big Five factor model to understand myself and others better. Using that system I've come to understand that naturally I have relatively high levels of neuroticism especially for a male (i fall somewhere in the 60 to 70th percentile). I've recently made very drastic changes in my life. I moved to a new state where I only know 2 people and I'm essentially starting a new life in a completely new place around (mostly ) new people. The uncertainty that comes with such an undertaking alone has ramped up many negative feelings. To plunge into the unknown in such a dramatic way has not been easy for me. So I'm working a new kind of job, trying to make all new friends and establish myself in this new community. So far I've had some trouble in my relationships with others which has caused me distress and more recently I've started to encounter problems at work. Ill describe these events and then i would greatly appreciate any help/insight/advice with regards to this issue. 

Relationship troubles: since I've gotten here I've been flirting with girls at work and attempting to make new friends. I've found a fair amount of success in these persuits but ive also met with some failure. I was talking with a girl who i seemed to be hitting it off with quite well. Initially she showed interest and I was reciprocating. Eventually a new guy got a job where we worked and they had known each other since high school and rekindled their old friendship. Eventually i began to notice she was taking a liking to him and very gradually realized she had decided she would rather persue a relationship with him over me. This caused me great feelings of jealousy, resentment and anger. Eventually i ended up going out to a bar with her and some of her friends. I got drunk and essentially talked shit about the guy she liked and made fun of her for choosing a guy like him. I felt like a shitty person the next day and apologised. I still feel bad for hurting both of them in this way . Eventually she left the job and our friendship withered away. It was my own weak ego that caused me to act like an ass and ultimately cost me a potentially good friendship / relationship. I've also realized I have somewhat of a reputation for being disagreeable and headstrong which people in general seem to find distasteful about me. Where others follow rules, are polite and do things by the book I often cut corners, am blunt and do things my own way. Which leads into the incident involving my job...

The other day a customer came in and wanted me to do something for her. I wont go into details about what because it isn't important but essentially we were extremely busy that day, understaffed and I was very stressed already by everything going on. I was being pulled in multiple different directions. So I told the lady that we didnt offer the service she wanted because it was too detailed (which is what ive been told to tell customers if their request is too detailed because it wastes time) i could tell immediately that she was upset at my lack of cordial customer service and another coworker immediately stepped in and offered to take care of the lady so I went about my business doing other things. The lady ended up filing a complaint about me to the company and earlier tonight i was called to the managers office and confronted about it. I admitted to the incident and told my side of the story. Luckily i really dont think I'm going to be fired for the incident but it does mean that I'm on thin ice. Overall the lady didn't like the fact that i seemed cold and impersonal and she could sense annoyance at her. All of which im sure is true even though it really was less about her and more about the fact that i was very stressed about all the other things that was going on that day. Needless to say I again find myself feeling like a shitty person for operating in a less than ideal way because of my neurotic temperment. Ultimately I really want to be a good person. I want to be liked by others and i want to do the right thing. How can manage my neurotic nature and overcome it so i can avoid these situations in the future? Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and to anyone who cares to offer me some help on this issue."
1119,"Men, how do you feel when you see your loved one (friend/girlfriend) getting beaten up in front of you?","I'm curious, because this has happened to me. Being a female, I don't know what men think about this kind of situation. 
I want to know how you handle the situation. And then, how do you console your friend/girlfriend? Because she wouldn't be in a proper frame of mind."
1120,Is it normal to have crazy moments?,"I started thinking about my ex and I made the metaphor in my head about killing a baby which was our beautiful relationship, and as I was doing this I started laughing very hard, and crying very hard, I did this for a while, feeling lucid in between and laughing and crying for maybe 40 minutes and then I stared at the wall. I had moments of wanting to hurt myself. I had a moment of clarity, came here, but now I feel lucid again and some reason I smile."

1122,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."
1123,what is wrong with me?,"i go through phases,,, like for maybe a few weeks i’m depressed as fuck, i’m unmotivated, i cut, i’m tired and then suddenly i’m fine again. i’m pretty productive, (my sleep schedules still fucked but that’s besides the point), i don’t cut (yay) and then it restarts. right now i am in my sad phase i guess that’s what i’ll call it"
1124,I am having trouble expressing my anxiety to my parents,"For about 3 years now I have felt very uncomfortable with myself and others

It has gotten to the point where I will look in the mirror and struggle to comprehend that the person looking back at me is me. I would not say that I have been bullied but people have not been nice to me I have no close freinds and feel pushed out by others. When I go out to a restaurant or a grocery store I will find trouble breathing and feel as if I am submerged under water. Things get alot worse when I dont where a jacker or hoodie. For about 2 and a half years people have insulted things about me like you're ugly, look like a school shooter, or what's wrong with you. I have replaced people in my life with music to make me feel better. But seeing as I'm alone so often the music gets repetitive and I am alone with my own thoughts witch can be very intrusive and scary . I wonder what will make me look better why I'm so sad why I am so uncomfortable around people why no body likes me.
I honestly dont know how to Express my feelings to my mom about this. Am I overreacting if I go to the doctor's will I be wasting there time. 

Do I tell my mom I dont want to make her worry for no reason and if the doctors give me anything will she be sad how do I tell her if I should 
Thanks for reading I am a guy 15"
1125,How long does it take antidepressant side effects to kick in?,"I just started Lexapro two days ago. My anxiety and OCD related intrusive thoughts have gotten really bad since then. My libido has also gone down a lot, but I don’t know if that’s related to the meds or my anxiety. I don’t know if these problems are because of the a antidepressants or if my anxiety just coincidently started acting up at around the same time. What do you think?"
1126,"Had several nightmares this year, I can remember one from March and a couple from last week.","I believe that dreams are often keys to our deepest (sometimes darkest) thoughts &amp; desires. In March I had a nightmare that I was watching a cartoon from my childhood and was constantly reminded about how worthless, pathetic and unloved I feel. That was literally it. There wasn't much to it but nevertheless it impacted me enough to think about it for days afterwards.

Last week I had 2 nightmares that I can remember at least in part. In the first dream I believe I was in a room, possibly a house,  with other young women. Outside the windows I could see a large city with tall buildings, one of which was next door to the building I was in. I don't recall how it happened but the building caught fire, first the very top floor, then soon the entire building was on fire. Somehow I could see a person, a woman I think, standing on top of the roof of the burning building. Then the person caught fire and fell or jumped to their death at the bottom.


The most recent nightmare I had is more vague, I think I remember seeing some people that I know outside of a house, and I talking to them. but the most vivid part was watching several police cars pass by the unfamiliar neighborhood that I was in and they suddenly fired shots at the house I was in.


I'm left wondering if these bad dreams mean something"
1127,my last experience in the ER,"earlier this year i tried to commit suicide. my father rushed me to the nearest hospital (i live in the country, meaning the nearest hospital was over 20 miles away) 

when we arrived they asked the same old questions. ""were you trying to take your life"" ""what did you take"" ""why did you do it"" ect. 

they had one of the nurses ask me questions before i had to talk to a lady over the screen.
after i finished answering all the questions they made me wait for 2 hours before they came back and told me what the plan was.

the nurse said, and i quote ""based on the questions we asked you, your depression isn't on a scale that is alarming. we will give you a different medication and see if that works for you while we get your discharge papers ready.""

like? i was baffled. i just tried to commit suicide. what do you mean its not on an alarming scale? 
you're not even gonna keep me for the day and monitor me?



has anyone else experienced anything like this?  it still has me thinking to this day."
1128,Wierd things been happening?,"So this is kinda lengthy, but I have had some weird stuff going on and just wanted to know your guy’s opinions.  So the past couple of days my anxiety has been extremely bad.  Difficulty breathing and all that.  But recently something has put my on edge.  I have been seeing stuff like out of the corner of my eye that when I look it’s not there.  Like I’d be walking by a window see a car and when I look it’s actually not there.  I’ve seen bunches of other things in the last couple days.  I normally wouldn’t be concerned about my anxiety increasing but seeing stuff out of the corner of my eye every once in a while the past couple days has been unnerving.  Do you guys think this sounds like it’s serious or am I just overreacting and all that?"

1130,Boyfriend is moving away:What should I do?In dire need of advice!,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone!

I(22F) really love my boyfriend(29M).We live in LA and have been in a relationship for 2 years now. I'm Muslim, he's Hindu.We both realized quickly into our relationship that we're both in it for the long haul and want to marry eachother eventually. I met his mom and he asked to meet my parents. My parents are totally against this relationship due to religious reasons and forbade me from seeing him again. We kept seeing eachother secretly since I spend all day at my college campus and he moved to a place that's 5 mins away. 5 months ago my dad found out about us again and tried getting a restraining order against my boyfriend. I intervened by speaking to the authorities and got the case dismissed. My boyfriend was really upset at what my dad did and I profusely apologized. He was glad that I stood up for him though. He told me I'll have to choose him or my dad since my dad will never agree to our relationship, and I told him that while my parents are an important part of my life, it is ultimately upto them whether they want to accept our relationship or not,and that I want to be with him and love him. He said he wants to marry me, and I let him know while I'm certain that I want to marry him, I can't tie the knot until I know for sure where I'm going to medical school. In addition, I am a citizen and he has a work visa.I was advised by my friends to date him for atleast 3 years to make sure I don't get exploited for citizenship.We decided to wait for 2 years to get married

We had a long conversation about our future.I just graduated this year from college and will apply to medical schools all over the country next year. Since I'm currently taking classes and studying for the MCAT,I can't afford to get a full time job until I've applied to medical schools in May of next year.I need the financial support from my parents. I told all of this to my boyfriend, and he said he wants to be with me and is alright with waiting until I've applied to med schools.We talk every day and everything's been going great.Since he works in IT, his job was moved to remote, and he said once I know where I'm moving for medical school, he wants to move with me and we can get married then. I wholeheartedly agreed, and told him that I really love him and would love for us to move together.I told him when the time comes for me to apply, we'll both make a list of schools that I'll apply to,together and take everything into consideration(his job prospects as well). He really likes Austin and I told him I'll apply there as well.

Today he told me he wants to talk about something serious. He said he's been offered a really good job in San Francisco and wants my input. I think he applied there because this new company is offering better pay.I was taken by surprise and felt a rush of emotions at once. However,I didn't let it show.I congratulated him and told him ofcourse he should go ahead and accept, since it sounds like a great opportunity.He said he can work from LA for now, but needs to move to SF by March of next year.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him he didn't even have to ask me.I told him that he can't put his life on hold for me and it would be unfair of me to expect him to do so,and that I am very happy for him. He said initially they offered him a position in LA but they've moved the office to SF now.He said once I know next year where I get accepted for med school, we can decided what to do. I was since I was going out so we didn't talk much afterwards. He did not ask me to move with him.

I feel really hurt but I didn't communicate this to him because I don't want him to resent me later on.I don't want to hold him back from being happy. I feel like it wouldn't have mattered even if I had told him not to move, because if he really didn't want to move then he wouldn't have applied for a job in SF anyways.

Also, if he needs to move there by march of next year, what happens if I get accepted to medical school in another state?Will he be willing to move with me?

Does it sound to you guys like I am important to him?I'm struggling to figure out how serious he is about me. We have talked about marriage but he hasn't given me a ring or formally proposed to me.

He is very extroverted and has a lot of female friends whom he hangs out and goes out/on trips with. I'm afraid he will find someone he clicks with in SF.

Do you think I should break up to avoid getting hurt down the road and just focus on my academics and my future like he is thinking about his? Or should I wait and see what he wants.

I've been through so much fighting with my family for him, and I've gotten really attached to him.I can't help but feel like I am not as important to him as he is to me.This is why I think I might be looking at this relationship with rose-colored glasses.This story is pretty complicated and I can fill in the blanks where need be, but I just wanted to get some advice. This is a very difficult time for me right now and I don't have a lot of people to talk this out with.

Reddit, what should I do?

1131,Why do I get so anxious,"I get so anxious at random things, and I feel like its getting out of control now that school is starting. I keep stressing over the smallest details. Just now, I used my debit card online for the first time because my credit card wouldn’t go though, and now I’ve searched the internet for two hours about debit card fraud. I’ve convinced myself that my debit card info will be stolen and I’m currently panicking which is why I’m writing this post. I also never post online even if its pretty anonymous because I’m scared my info will be stolen even though it probably already has been. I also worry that no one will read or respond, and I feel like I just want some support or validation. I know I don’t need it and everything will be find but I can’t stop stressing. I just spent two hours searching the internet about debit card fraud because I made one purchase online (which was a spur of the moment purchase bc I’m stressed abt school). I just hate myself so much for being like this. I keep stressing about everything, and in my head, I know its not a big deal, but I can’t help spiraling out of control. I feel like no one will read or respond to this, but I just felt the sudden need to vent."
1132,Should I get help ?,[removed]
1133,My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom &amp; help me honor her.,"“On July 23, 2020, Annika passed on from this life. She fought for her life, and this wasn't the first time. Please listen to what she had to say about mental illness: 'I also don't accept it that one should feel ashamed because he/she is suffering from a mental illness…everyone could be affected, no matter if he/she has a cheerful personality or not…I'm aware that \[I have\] a chronic disease and it belongs to your life but fortunately you can live with it.' 

She was a warrior. She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.

I have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel. 

I believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better. I have been on medical leave of absence many times, I have seen more than a dozen providers, and I have given up on my biggest dream. I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.

And now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.

Annika said, 'I admired and adored \[Avril Lavigne\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.

If you have Twitter, please help me reach Avril by retweeting my post with a comment, tagging **Avril Lavigne** and **The Avril Foundation**. My Twitter handle, if the link doesn't work, is simply 'libbyredda'. I've pinned the tweet.

If you do not have Twitter, please post an Instagram story with a screenshot of the tweet and tag the same accounts.

And if you have any other suggestions or connections, let’s use them too!

Please help me do one last special thing for Annika. Your support means everything to me.

Annika deserved every drop of magic in this world. And you do too :) Please let her witness this from wherever she is watching us.

Thank you with all my heart!”"
1134,I’m feeling worthless and it’s been tiring my partner out,"I have always had problems with my self esteem
I’ve tried to get help from my universities therapist but I’ve been juggled around with four therapists in the past three years
I got a boyfriend a little over a year and I tried to get a support network with him as my family doesn’t view mental health as a real issue and I don’t have many friends I can truly rely on
However in the past month or so, it’s taken a toll on him
To the point he’s started wanting to take breaks from me this past week
More and more to the point I’ve been left alone a lot as said before
I don’t have many friends to talk to
Nor rely on
And my self esteem has hit me really hard to the point my partner just gave up on me saying he wants another break day from me even though he just had one the day before
I wanna get better but the fact is I can’t afford proper therapy and the university therapist may not be equipped to help me nor want to deal with me if they’ve been juggling me around
I just wanna get better but I don’t have any support networks to rely on anymore
What do I do?"
1135,I'm trying to move on,"I've been dating a girl on and off for the last 3-4 years. Pretty well every breakup was her doing, but for some reason she kept coming back and getting close to me and then she gets romantic about things. And I feel tired of being hurt. I have this deep hatred in my gut that I can't let go of because it seems like after every breakup, she got to move on with her life and forget about me and be happy, and I was always stuck with my problems, not able to go anywhere with them. At the start of quarantine when we were more separated than usual, despite my best efforts she started self admittedly giving up on the relationship because I wasn't going to be able to see her for a week at a time. I just suggested we take a break, and after a few days she said she wants to prolong it. She made it abundantly clear she wanted to get back together around the start of May, but May came and she told me she moved on and wasn't ready for a relationship. And once again she moved on like nothing happens, and began flirting with guys openly. It's really fucking hard trying to move on with a breakup when she's sending photos daily of her in the mirror constantly reminding me how beautiful she is. Almost daily she told me about new pickup lines she got, and it really hurt, so bad I almost committed suicide on multiple occasions and still to this day debate it almost daily. In June I finally called her out for what she's been doing and she said she thinks we should move on and blocked communication from me. I feel like I get no closure, and after everything she's done to me, she won't admit it now and just moves on with her life and it hurts me so bad. I want nothing more than to sleep and wake up in March again. We still go to school together, and I don't know how I am going to be able to exist near her, let alone face her. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want it all to stop."
1136,what is causing me to do this?,"I hate self diagnosing and am too scared to ask my parents about mental health cause they are scary. but when I'm in a public space I get really hot, and start punching my hip without even noticing. I feel almost as if I'm short for air. any ideas? and should I get over my fear of my parents and confront them about this?"

Some people are shallow af and the ones who matter to you are quite rare. Being cyber bullied taught me to love myself no matter what; if I am to judge my own opinion based on others' point of view I'm bound to desperation and isolation.

They’re going down a dangerous path of doing drugs and worst stuff to put it short. 
So i still care...even if she doesn’t even wanna talk to me i still do. But deep down. I know there a chance she may be a lost cause.

1144,Any helpful tips on seeking help?,"I've never really posted on reddit before but I was wondering if others felt this way too, and if anyone has advice or has gone through these thoughts. I dont know where to start but I dont know how to reach out for a diagnosis, mainly for the fear of it. I'm unsure how beneficial it would be for me or if it would even make me feel better. I often back out of going and getting one because I dont think my suspected mental illnesses are bad enough too go seek help. That if I get there they will tell me i have it and cannot help me because it isnt bad enough. (I do realize that this is irrational.) But I'm also worried that I will not have them. Which sounds like it would be good news, but then I'm left too wonder what's wrong with me, why am I so depressed, why do I have these intrusive thoughts,etc. And even if I do get diagnosed I'm scared i wont even take the help they offer so what is the point? Which ig is kinda stupid, I just wanted to rant about my fears with going and getting help and seeing if anyone who has had these fears, went and got diagnosed and seen improvements with how they feel at all. Idk❤"
1145,How do i listen to people?,"So, i don't know how to start this.. I'm from the netherlands, i hope everything written here will be in a understandable language.

&amp;#x200B;

Basic background information:

First of all, i don't think i have autism due to the fact that i have empathy, i know how people feel in certain situations. I've had a hard time growing up, i've gone through abuse my whole life, moved 3 times to another country and a lot more. Then i moved away from home because i was 18 and wanted to build a life on my own in the country i was born. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and paranoid personality disorder (PPD).

&amp;#x200B;

Problem:

So i found some sentences on the internet which exactly explains how i feel:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""I just don't find most people that interesting. I know I should, but I'm just not.""
* ""I can't bring myself to care when a co-worker or party guest is telling me about mundane things like how their week is going or why they like some random hobby.""
* ""I can't be bothered to try to learn about people, because most of them are boring and generic. They don't have anything to say that I need to hear.""
* ""I know how to go through the motions of asking people about themselves and seeming interested, but I don't actually enjoy those conversations.""
* ""I don't get much from talking to people unless we're discussing one of my narrow interests.""
* ""I don't want to learn details about people for its own sake. I'm like, 'What's the point?' How am I benefiting by hearing about this?'""
* ""I'm self-reliant and happy to be on my own. I don't need to be learning about everyone's lives all the time. ""

1146,Is this Mommy Issues? or something else?,"(Btw i’m a female)
My mom passed away about 4 years ago, and I can’t seem to let her go. I idolize her and she’s what keeps me alive. However this has led me to something. 

I feel safe and cared for around females—more specifically ones who will care and watch over me, and I love them so much. 

I feel so much happier when I know there’s someone proud of me, or caring.
Every time I see a person or something that reminds me of my mom, I feel so safe.

Maybe it’s because I miss when my mom would care for me and love me, but now i’m not able to get that feeling from her anymore. 

idk what this would be called and i tried looking for answers and thought that mommy and daddy issues are where you are uncomfy around said gender, but i couldn’t find anything for being safe and comfy around them because of a parent figure

It has gone back to normal but I don't feel the same I just want to be gone. I don't think I serve a purpose but I am to much of a pussy to kill myself so I'm just cooped up with these feeling. And I'm scared to tell anybody because I don't feel supported anymore. Is this a start of something or am I just overreacting thanks.
1148,I THINK IM A SOCIOPATH...,"listen, I genuinely think I am and hear me out 

Before u say ""your overthinking it"" ""no your not""

I've done a little bit of research in sociopaths and I swear i relate soo much 


I've been through some things in life at a young age that most people would call traumatic and throughout life I've noticed that I'm different, people don't think the same way as me. ""How would you know what other people are thinkng"" 

Well I observe a lot....like a lot 

And I've been doing it since I was a kid. I'm not saying that I'm good at reading people but rather I observe the actions they do and why they do them 

My intentions behind my interactions with people are sooo fucked up. I'm not genuine, I really try to be but I just can't be genuine 

I always have this hidden agenda in the back of my mind

It's like I'm in my head watching the interactions I have with people through a tv and having a conversation with myself about it (while I'm interacting)
This probably all sounds weird but it's the best way I could describe it

Anyways I have this thing where I make girls fall ""in love"" and I literally only think of them as any other rock. I'm not saying their objects but rather I don't love them, just pretend too so they love me. It's weird right?? 

But then I just ghost them and end it. 

And find someone else to make them fall in love 

I'm not no killer or anything but I have this darkness in me I could feel and like wtf do I do? 

Like I think I'm a nice person? Right? I do good things...by there is this side of me that no one sees and I hope no one ever will 

This side is just evil, lies for no reason, a sadist, and the thought process is just not normal


In conclusion I need help"
1149,A downward spiral of suck,"I dont know if that is appropriate but it explains how I feel.

Alot of my self hatred comes from being jack shit at almost everything I try to do, and my mental block when it comes to trying to improve.

When I try to learn something, whatever it is, I always find myself asking,  ""What is the point?"" To myself over again, either that or a clam up and defend the mistakes I make instead of learning from them.

Then obviously, I dont learn, I just keep sucking without improving, then I get those feelings of hating myself because i suck, and then it goes around and around again.

I dont know, maybe my issue is easily solved, maybe I'm just being a big baby, I have no idea, maybe I need help, maybe should get through this shit on my own, whatever it is, I'm my own mental block, and I dint know how to get out of my own way."
1150,I don’t know what to do,"I want to die. BUT, I don’t want to kill my self. Is this a problem, if yes, who do I talk to. Because I’m not suicidal, just want to die"
1151,"I’ve done online tests that score high in adhd, anxiety and depression.","This has ended up like a circle of torture for me, all three of these things feed into each-other and make it an impossible loop to get out of. I knew I had anxiety and maybe some mild depression. Any idea of what I should do? I could really use some advice right now."

1153,I happened upon a post about someone who was recently diagnosed with OCD and I feel like my world suddenly makes sense,"(Also posted to r/OCD.)

So I recently stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hbtzdt/aita_for_throwing_my_kids_clothes_onto_the_floor/) about a woman who throws her daughters' clothes on the floor when she doesn't put them away the ""right"" way. I read the story and I kept thinking ""okay that's a dick move, but it's not THAT weird, what's the big idea?"" And oh boy, then I read the comments. I saw her family's reaction. I saw the update where she told the story of getting diagnosed with OCD because of this incident.

I've done almost exactly the same thing: throwing my husbands laundry on his side of the bed or on his dining room chair when I thought it was in the wrong place. I figured out by myself that that was a dick move after the fact but that woman's update broke me.

I was diagnosed with bipolar type I five years ago and am successfully in treatment for that. I haven't had an episode in years - but I've always felt like something else was going on. My life just feels like it doesn't fit. I'm always obsessing over cleaning, organising, controlling - instead of actually focusing on the things I want. I have violent or grossly uncomfortable sexual intrusive thoughts that never seem to go away. After my husband gets out of the shower I reorganise the bathroom so all the product labels are facing the right direction. I'm constantly - only partially successfully - fighting the urge to totally control and nag the way my husband does anyhing, even folding his own god damn socks. I reread emails a hundred times and check and recheck endlessly to see if I 100% **for sure** *definitely* sent it to the right person. I'm obsessed with taking care of my health. I get upset about completely fictional fights with friends or colleagues and have to ask my husband for reassurance about them. And so on. And so on.

Nothing about my life feels entirely normal and I never seem to get anything done. I have so much potential and it almost feels wasted. I can't focus on anything because the next thing that needs organising is always right there in the back of my mind.

I don't know yet if I have OCD or not. I don't mean to self diagnose - I'm speaking to my psychologist soon. But reading those comments opened my eyes to how much potential for treatment there still is for me, if nothing else. People with these kinds of issues actually can and do get help! There might even be a name for the reason why I constantly feel like my life is turning into an empty shell.

I feel overwhelmingly confused and kind of crazy, but finally hopeful as well.

I hope this post is appropriate to the sub, thanks for reading anyway! It helps to write stuff out, for me."
1154,Come Out?,"I've finally discovered and accepted that I'm heteroflexible. The main problem is I'm a muslim minority living in a Buddhist majority Asian country. We have so much toxicity around LGBTQ and islamic communities. 

Anyway, should I come out to my immediate family members? I've been sober for 8 months from hardcore drug abuse. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. PLEASE HELP ME DECIDE THIS.

1155,How can a therapist help me?,"This is going to be half a rant and a mental dump, please forgive me if this isnt structured well. 
Im afraid a therapist cant help me. 
Im afraid I cant verbalize my problems in a way that makes sense (especially not in person) and in turn, they wont be able to diagnose / help me properly. I went to a therapist a couple years ago and had a really hard time. At the time, I felt like I was losing my mind in a way that really scared me. I couldnt control my thoughts. They would race and it was literally like Tourettes but internally. I say that because I would pretty much think whatever the worse thing possible at that moment that would make me feel the worst about myself. It was hard to verbalize this especially because I thought it would sound really creepy. I tried using a term I had heard online, “intrusive thoughts” and the therapist said she didn’t know what that was. Also at the time, I was doing very poorly in college classes, to the point where it was really ridiculous that I was still going. I had already flunked out of regular university and started attending community college, where I was literally failing almost every class because I was falling asleep and literally couldn’t retain any information anymore. I would read a sentence and have to reread it four times to get it, and then Id forget it soon after. I had no friends and just really hated every second of it. And after several sessions of me talking and her listening, the therapist tells me she’s giving me “homework” and a thick pamphlet of stuff to read about cognitive therapy. I wondered if she even listened to me at all when I said I couldnt retain information like that right now and that was part of the problem. And I guess its sensitive but the word “Homework” really irked me then. I was convinced that all therapists can do is hand me papers that I feel I could have googled about. I didnt feel like she helped me and I thought the least she could do was give me medication. She did end up prescribing me the lowest dose of Zoloft possible which had the same potency as a tictac. But she told me I had to slowly see the results (I understand if thats the policy but I just felt like I needed immediate help. (Sorry, This is where Im starting to just rant, but I hope its useful info into my psyche.) Anyway, a lot has changed but my mental health is still really low. The worst part is the things I dont want to talk about simply because it puts me in a really dark path in my mind and I dont always know how to get out of it. I have anxiety attacks about death now, but I dont even want to call it an anxiety attack, more like existential terror. How can a therapist help me with that?"
1156,I don’t see the point,I’m getting to a point in my head where I can’t seem to find the point anymore. I’m convinced my ex is the only one that could’ve cared for me as deeply as she did. My friends do not give a shit about me and some seem to be distancing themselves from me already. I’m so distant from my family and they don’t care. I have pets and I feel like someone could do a better job than me at caring for them. I want it to be over. I don’t see the point of being around anymore.
1157,I’m embarrassed about my psychotic breakdown that I thought was a spiritual awakening :(,"I’ve had a lot of time to reflect on it, but honestly the whole situation comes up in my mind almost every day and I get ashamed/embarrassed about it even though it happened months ago. Here’s mostly the full story on what happened, I just need to vent it out and need advice on how to stop feeling like this.


I’ll also preface this by saying I’m a very healthy individual, I’m 20. I have never had suicidal thoughts, have never been diagnosed with any type of disorder or anything. I’ve always considered myself to be level headed, generally happy, and at ease with life. The most of a depression I’ve experienced was a couple months in my freshman year of college after failing some classes and having to switch my major. (Im now going into my third year)

Back in May I had the worst experience of my life. I was taking online classes, not having much social interaction, and having some problems with my best friend. I started getting into spirituality and very into the idea of a spiritual awakening and opening my third eye, clearing karmic cycles, and one day everything just seemed to ‘click’ into place for me. I became obsessed with a journal I had been keeping, convinced it told the truth and predictions about the universe. I stayed up maybe two or three nights in a row just writing in my journal and googling things about religion and Buddhism and spirituality and angel numbers and how numbers are connected to the universe. There was also stuff about the 2017 eclipse happening in my journal, and that I had this revelation about it exactly 1000 days after it happened. Eventually everything that came out of my family’s mouth sounded like a metaphor with a deeper meaning, and I was convinced I was discovering what life was really about. I found so many coincidences with numbers and things around me. It was like everything was connected and had a special, certain meaning. The first day I realized all of this I showed my family my journal, and they were intrigued about the connections I had made.

This went on for two days. Then there was a day where I think I fully ‘broke’ from reality. The night before, I was intensely posting on the story of an Instagram blog I’ve since deleted, I had about 50k followers and I felt like I needed to tell them what I had discovered about spirituality and religion and the world. Looking back I’m sooo embarrassed and I was responding to them when they commented on my story asking if I was okay and I think hundreds people saw my story (not anyone I’ve met in person, though, thankfully). I’m pretty sure I sounded like a robot to them. I thought Jesus was even speaking through me for a few solid hours and that I had to share his message before time ran out to save everyone. I thought my ‘account’ was a big metaphor or something, and remember journaling about needing to split my ego from my Self to get Oneness or something along those lines. I was so certain that I had to divide my Self (it’s hard to explain). 

That next morning, I was convinced in my mind there were certain things I needed to do to ‘wake up’, and I ended up playing a song on the piano in a key I didn’t know how to play it in. To this day, I don’t know how I did it, and my mom heard it too and was wondering how I was playing in that key. It seemed like past, present, and future all coincided on that single moment. After that moment it was like I was ‘free’ and I just went into my room and cried from pure joy and relief, then went out and hugged my parents. I felt happier, lighter, and freer than I ever had in my life, and I was trying to explain to my parents about how I had come to this moment, but they became really worried about me and told me I needed to go to the hospital. Then I became convinced that the hospital was ‘bad’ and that I wanted to keep experiencing what I was experiencing, and that the doctors at the hospital would take away whatever state I was in. Long story short they ended up taking me there.

While I was in the hospital room I was only with my mom, and a lot of strange thoughts were running through my mind. I can’t remember it fully now because I actively avoid thinking about that day, but I remember sitting with my mom thinking that everything that was happening was just a test. I had to become a ‘patient’ to learn to be patient and I was convinced I was going through a journey that spanned several lifetimes. This current lifetime I was in was just temporary and there were certain things I needed to do to go back and forth between alternate possibilities of timelines and lifetimes and realities. I remember switching between a few of these realities in the hospital room while waiting for the doctor to come. I thought my mom was thinking a similar way as I was also. I remember pointing to a weird pattern of little holes on the wall of the room that looked like this: O-O-O-O-O-O, and pointing to one hole and telling my mom it was like I had jumped from one hole to the next, trying to explain what was going on in my mind. I thought the voices on the speakers of the hospital announcing what rooms nurses needed to go to were talking to me to tell me numbers to push on a remote. I also remember a newsreel or something played on the tv when I turned it on to a certain channel. I remember sitting on the bed just staring at the news like i had never seen anything like it before. I remember it saying ‘adult contemporary’ and everything that was playing on it was connected to what I had experienced in the past few days. I saw numbers on it that I had noticed in my journal. I felt like I had changed the world somehow, and I was watching the effects of what I had done play on the news. I felt like I was in a different reality than the one I had come out of before, and that I had manifested myself into this new reality that was showing on the tv. 

I kept asking my mom if we could go yet, and that I was fine, but she kept telling me to wait for the doctor and that we couldn’t leave, and I genuinely did not understand why we couldn’t just walk out of the hospital now. Then I finally had a zoom meeting with the doctor, and I remember not really answering any questions that clearly. Like I remember not even knowing the date because I felt like time wasn’t actually happening in the hospital room. When I was talking to the doctor, I got really upset internally because I realized how what I was saying must’ve sounded to him, and after I got off the zoom meeting the tiredness of not sleeping for three days finally hit me. I remember my mom telling me they were going to figure out what was wrong with me and not to worry, and everything felt so surreal because in that moment I actually finally felt like I was experiencing something really scary. Then I went to sleep, and when I woke up, I was hugging my mom goodbye and I was taken to a psychiatric hospital. 

I was brought in on an involuntary order because I was either a danger to myself or others. I remember going in calmly and peacefully, thinking this was all part of what I had to experience in life and that everything would be fine. I think I was pretty dissociated while I was in there, I remember my parents bringing me some stuff from home. I was reading Harry Potter and the goldfinch, and I couldn’t read them without seeing so many bizarre coincidences to what I was experiencing, and I thought every book had a hidden meaning about life (I mean they do, but when I was reading them it went so much deeper than that). I thought the things my parents had brought me from home were everything I needed to ‘ascend’ to a higher state of consciousness somehow. I also thought the hospital was like purgatory or heaven/hell and that not everyone realized where we actually were. There were also moments I was scared I was dead and in an alternate reality. But on the outside I think I appeared pretty normal to the doctors because I didn’t share most of this with them. I was very friendly to all of the doctors, nurses, and other patients and made a lot of friends. I stayed in for about a week, and was able to get released pretty early because my parents had been fighting for me from the outside, making lots of calls and making sure my medications didn’t get upped for no reason. The only medication I was on was one Zyprexa pill a day. The first two days I was there I was more delusional but once I got sleep I pretty much returned to normal. 

On the last day the doctors had nothing that conclusive to diagnose me with. In the end they said it was psychosis due to lack of sleep and marijuana use. I’ve used marijuana in the past but wasn’t high at all in the week leading up to the events. That month before my breakdown, I was smoking out of a weed pen with an untrustworthy cartridge, that might have been part of the problem. 

After I got out of the hospital I was still living in a ‘higher’ reality it seemed. I could hear lots of metaphors when people spoke still, and I thought everything I did had meaning still. Life seemed to beautiful and connected when I went outside especially. I had one week of school left and told all of my professors I couldn’t complete the remaining work due to stress, and I ended up passing all my classes and getting good grades anyway. (Most finals were cancelled because of the George Floyd riots and covid). I became very into taking my dogs on long walks, journaling, cooking, reading, poetry, learning new things, playing piano more, writing letters, going on a spontaneous road trip to Oregon, talking to my grandmother who is very spiritual, finding more about myself, making good self care habits, calling my friends more, joining a church, and even going to yoga. I was convinced something had happened to me spiritually. I couldn’t hang out with certain friends because their ‘negative energy’ was bringing mine down and I couldn’t handle being around them. In that time I also realized how many friendships I needed to cut off. But also in these times I was pretty forgetful about where I placed things, and also I often got emotional and had to make sure I wasn’t in a negative headspace. Also I would switch in and out of ‘bad thought mode’ where if I was in a bad mode of thinking, everything seemed negative. Conversations around me, everything my mom would say to me would sound too scarily coincidental, and once I switched out of this mode I was okay, but it took a while of just being silent and calming my thoughts to get out of it. Also I remember being able to be in the ‘middle’ of these two sides. I did some crazy things on a road trip like play piano for some homeless men on a random stop on the highway because I thought I was ‘compelled’ to do it, and felt a large spiritual connection happening.

Then it slowly all faded away over the next few months, and now, in August, I feel I’m back to the way I was in March, before everything happened, and I’m embarrassed that I thought it was a spiritual awakening when it actually was just me being crazy. I feel absolutely zero spiritual drive now, and I cringe when I think about it all or if anyone mentions anything about me during the time immediately after the hospital because I don’t know where that spark of inspiration had come from because it’s definitely not here now. Like my mom will mention how she thought I wanted to start a cookbook this summer with her, which I have no desire to do anymore. Or my best long distance friend will ask about when I’m writing her another letter, which I don’t feel the inspiration for anymore. Or my guy friend from college will ask how my “spiritual/musical/life journey” is going, because I over shared with him (without telling him about the hospital part) of all the things I was experiencing. 


I’m currently fine, done with a few months of therapy, and on no medication. I am scared to ever smoke weed again or even drink, and I’m also scared to get back into spirituality. I feel stuck and I miss the inspiration I felt. I also feel embarrassed because my family had to see me in that state, and I hate thinking about my time in the hospital and the week leading up to it. I haven’t told any of my friends about what happened, and no one would expect anything remotely close to this to have happened to me. I can’t believe it happened to me and seems like a really bad dream. 

If anyone can relate to this experience at all, can you let me know how you’re dealing with it?

If you read this whole thing I’m impressed lol"

So i am getting used to living with my dad but he is really physically abusive and controlling and right now i have no other option. He says that i have outbursts and that i shouldnt be taking them so he just threw all of the rest of them away.

1162,How to handle trust issues,"I have serious procrastination problem which I'm already working on with my therapist.

But recently I have developed a serious trust issue. I have noticed I haven't talked to anyone about my feelings (apart from therapist) in last 2 months. 

I have stopped talking to people about anything. I just listen and talk about platonic daily things. My mind keeps repeating 'Everything is lie, no one likes you, no one cares'.

I just don't know how it all started but I feel like everyone is lying. Yesterday when I was crying for an unrelated thing, my husband was trying to console me and cheer me up. But  all I could think of was 'He is lying, he doesn't care, he's just tolerating my shit'. I am feeling very distant from him. I'm unable to feel or connect with him. I'm feeling betrayed though nothing major has happened. 

I don't know if this is normal, or am I just getting paranoid."
1163,None of my friends know if anything is wrong,"(I posted this in r/depression with little response so far, so I'm hoping to get more out of here..)

I'm a teenager, diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and ADHD. By a psychiatrist. (Just want to throw this out there, self-diagnosing is bad)

I've attempted suicide twice this year (don't worry, I'm not considering it anymore)

I cry at least twice a week, with a couple anxiety attacks tossed in there

I'm underweight and it's so off-putting to put food in my mouth

My mom and my brother are constantly fighting in home and it makes me extremely anxious

I've been falling behind in online class, with no work to show for when physical class starts

And none of my friends know about this..

I've always been there to listen to my friends when they vent. Some of them are also mentally ill like me, and I try to be there for them. I've gathered a lot of information about healthy coping methods and practical advice one can give for depression/anxiety through Google, and generally i succeed in making them feel better..

But recently, one of my online friends told me, over text, that they were going to kill themselves


I've never felt so scared in my life.

My family was still at home, so I had to make sure I looked calm, but I couldn't, so I locked myself in a bathroom, trying to make them stop while my chest hurt so much
They didn't kill themselves, but they're still in a depressive low

I'm trying to be there for them, but they push me away, particularly telling me to just stop and go back to talking to everyone else in our group

I did stop, saying that among my group of friends they counted as well, but I 
was so upset 

I just wanted to tell them everything there, about how my life was also rough like theirs, or at least just send a little passive agressive message like ""I go through stuff too, you know.""

But I didn't, because it isn't right to do that to someone whose suffering


I've always been the counselor of the group, but I have no one to confide in

I have one friend who I tell about my minor frustrations, but that's the most venting I ever do

My family can't afford therapy as of right now, so that's off the table

I'm trying to apply all these methods I've learnt in my articles, but..

It's so hard

I think the problem is just that I don't have anyone to confide in

but I never can. 
It's assumptive, but I predict what people will say if I vent, and that they won't tell me anything I don't know. Everytime I've vented before, I've been right in this, though I've only vented like 3 times 


and I know that's not the point, the point is that there are people who care and who know, but

it's just so hard..
And I don't want people to know.
I can see the people and their own struggles, and I don't want to add on to that by making them worry about me.


I always think that I can handle this myself since I practically know EVERYTHING I need to do in order to get my life together

But something is wrong, and I just can't do it

Anhedonia, question mark?

I don't know

1164,Overwhelming Control Issues and Eating Issues,"Hey everyone,
After snooping around for a while I decided to join the community and seek some advice. I’m a 20F who has been, according to the BMI chart, overweight and obese for most of my life my mom used to be very controlling about my eating when I was younger. She wanted me to exclusively eat home cooked food or food that she bought. When I would ask my dad to buy me outside food after school, she would notice, ask me what I ate and then yell at me for eating unhealthily. I know that her love for me was overbearing and she only wanted what was best for my health, so I don’t blame her. She is a traditional Asian mother who expect her child, me, to respect and listen to her. Eventually, I ended up binge eating the fast food and restaurant food that she wouldn’t let me have. On top of that outside food I would also go home and eat my mom’s cooking so that I could hide my binge eating from her. So if I think back to my elementary, middle, and high school years I was eating around 3,000-3,500 calories a day. Her food was always tasty, but my growing body craved sugar and fat which she would completely cut out of the food she made. For example, she would buy only lean meats (if there was any fat on the already lean meat, she would cut it off before cooking)and our house DID NOT have any sweet/salty snacks, or things like butter (she cooked exclusively with oil). When I turned 20 and approached 170lbs I started to panic about my body (self esteem maybe?) Because I am only 5’2” I was definitely in the obese category, and I felt guilty because I’m supposed to be in the prime of my life, but my bulky size made it hard for me to enjoy things like shopping and taking photos with friends. I got to the point where I would tell people that I would take the pictures so that I could avoid being in the picture myself. Since quarantine started around April I have really taken control of my eating situation and told my mom that I would cook for myself. Now I’m making food with that I enjoy and that satisfies me since I can buy cuts of meat that aren’t too lean. I cook with all the sugar I want, and when I’m really adventurous I’ll even have some full fat oat milk or bake some cookies. I also talked to my mom and confronted her about the restrictions she placed on my eating and how I thought I was affecting me. She apologized to me and I forgave her. She was shattered because this whole time she thought that what she was doing was beneficial. Since I had that closure I dropped 30lbs in 4-5ish months. For that I am thankful towards my mom’s understanding.

I’m sorry this is so long....
But now to the current issue at hand. I believe I was control issues that have become too overwhelming for even the closest people to me to bear anymore. I went to a Catholic elementary and middle school where every aspect of my life was controlled. Uniform was to be worn everyday. The top button on the shirt always had to stay buttoned and the skirts could not be shorter than two inches above the knee cap. Only white crew socks allowed and completely black shoes (even the soles had to be black) or else there were consequences. How we spoke was also controlled. When speaking if I accidentally said yeah or nah I was immediately corrected to say yes please or no thank you. Between home and school there was no sense of choice and I think that my mentality turned into, “If you can’t fight em, join em” (Woah using em instead of them was also a bad thing at that School). I turned myself into a drone in the system. I was the model student that teachers would say, see look at her good example. I became a teachers’ pet. As I because closer to teachers and the principal, I was able to, in a sense, police my own peers. The teachers would ask who I believe was right or wrong in arguments among classmates. I felt ignorantly happy and didn’t have that oppressed feeling anymore. Even though I didn’t have control over my own life, at least I was given the responsibility to have a sense of control over my classmates’ school life. I micromanaged every detail of every group/class project and that made me feel ok. My micromanaging continues through today and I don’t want to be like that anymore. Sometimes I do it to my close friends. For example sometimes I feel like my roommates just let me do things my way (cooking, cleaning, furniture arrangement) bc they are starting to feel like there is no point in arguing anymore. They end up having to do the hard work of cooking, cleaning, etc. with me, but have little say in how they want to do things. 

Here’s where my issues overlap. After talking to my mom and gaining the freedom to make food my way and of course going to college, I became aware of my ability to doing things my way. At the same time I’m also maintaining my obsessive control issues. Now that I’m staying at home during quarantine and my mom has just yielded the one thing she controlled the most (my eating) to me. I see myself slowly eating away at my mom’s happiness I’ve now turned into the overbearing person. I’m controlling her life. I didn’t realize until today how critical I was about how little protein she was eating. I kept to nagging her about it until I could see in her eyes that she had backed into a corner and given up. I’m doing the exact same thing she did to me when I was younger. Food is just one of the many aspects that I try to control, there are more things that I’m not ready to say yet, but just know that I made her cry today because I overwhelmed her. When she cried I cried and said the same thing she used to say to me, “I know I’m being mean to you but it’s only because I love and worry about you” and like me when I was a child she sniffled a bit and said thank you for the love. I feel so guilty for doing the same thing back at her and when I realized I told her sorry and that I wanted to go to therapy for control issue. She supported my decision for therapy, but said that she did feel like I was being controlling of her. I JUST SAW HER CRY BECAUSE I MADE HER FEEL USELESS AND SHE DOESNT EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT THE FACT THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO HURT AND BROKE HER TODAY. I feel like shit because I don’t know how to balance what my mom and I have for each other. Either I’m controlling what she does or she controls me. We love and worry so much for each other it suffocates both of us. At this point my dad also recognizes our issues and tries to remind me and/or my mom to yield to the other. He does this privately to both of us, so he’ll either pull me aside or my mom aside and mediate our relationship. I don’t want to make my mom feel like she did today ever again, but at the same time I’m scared that if I yield then I’ll be the one controlled again.

Thank you for taking the time to read the whole thing. And thanks a million more if you respond!"
1165,Sorry for the formatting I'm not doing great,"My good friend attempted suicide and I had to help track him down. I struggle with suicidal thoughts as well and have previously attempted suicide as well. The (thankfully only) hour it took to find him was excruciating. Back in 2016 when I had attempted suicide I wound up in jail from a warrant that was purposely left unsent to me. For 4 or 5 days my friends and family looked high and low for me. I had posted a picture to Facebook of my hand bleeding and hinted suicide- and that night I took a script of adavan (spelling?) with 5 cans of 211 Steele Reserve malt liquor. I fully intended on dying but unfortunately (thankfully) my body said ""nah you're gonna keep going"" and since then I've been weird about the whole thing.

I cannot imagine what my friends and family go through with me. I wanna ignore it and just *be*

I am feeling guilty and feeling very self conscious about how my tendencies affect my relationships. I am very vulnerable and very distraught by this whole ordeal and it's been affecting my sleep and decision making. I have been drinking and sleeping to cope and I know it's only making it worse. I wish there was someone or something to aid me. I dunno how to break my cycle. This year, 2020, has claimed the lives of too many I have loved, and I'm struggling. 

Can anyone that sees this please tell me I'll be okay? I don't want to feel this way any more. I promise I'm trying. I needed to get this  out. 

I'm glad he's okay but that's how my friends feel about me. I know from now on, from personal experience, he needs to be monitored. Is that why my friends stick around???? To be sure I don't off myself? A lot of thoughts are bubbling and I cannot escape them. I'm sorry for littering [this sub] as I'm gonna post this elsewhere likely just to hopefully hear some words to push me positively. I'm sorry."
1166,My grandparents destroyed my life.,"I am 19F and still live with my parents but my grandparents also live with us. Ever since my cousins moved here my grandparents started comparing me to them and treating me differently. It gradually became worse and when I left my church and got a new boyfriend which my grandfather didn't approve of things got even worse.

My grandfather became outright emotionally abusive and my grandmother isn't much better. My brother who is apparently on the autism spectrum started getting treated like an angel even when he physically hurts me. He gets spoiled rotten by my grandparents which isn't bad in itself but he gets rewarded for bad behavior often.

Right now I am at a breaking point my mom refuses to help me when my grandparents decide to be horrible to me. It's gotten to the point where I can't leave my room without my boyfriend otherwise I will be in trouble for something when I did nothing. My dad and boyfriend is the only support I have and sadly with the pandemic we can't find them a different place to stay...

I am at the point where I just want to die... I feel like a burden to everyone. I feel like I am just making everything far worse than it has to be for everyone. I feel guilty that my boyfriend has to sit with my messed up family and it's eating me up inside.

I don't know what to do or who to go to. I am at the end of my rope. I have no strength left to fight"
1167,When to stop seeing a therapist,"Does anyone feel like they’re not “sick enough” to see a therapist / continue therapy? I’ve been going to one for a few months now, and I genuinely feel a lot better. I mainly struggle with depression and anxiety, but lately I’ve been doing all these self care / mindfulness practices, and I feel like there’s nothing else to update my therapist. It’s also somewhat a money issue because my parents are paying for it and I feel guilty using their money for my mental health. (I’m 20) At what point does one stop going? 

Also because of COVID, I’ve had friends telling me they feel depressed and anxious. I sometimes feel like I’m not “qualified” to continue my therapy sessions. I’m not suicidal and my anxiety is not debilitating these days. But I’ve been stuck in this rut for so long I don’t even know what is considered a “normal” feeling anymore. I don’t know if my anxiousness in certain situations is just normal or what.

TL;DR : I have anxiety and depressive symptoms. Have been seeing a therapist for a while. Not sure at what point does one stop."
1168,Can someone here help me please?,"I don't know where to post this, so I googled for mental advice on google and found this sub (you can comment the right sub below if this is not the right sub)

First of all, I don't really understand what I'm feeling all the time and because of this, I'm bad at expressing what I feel (as even I don't know what I'm feeling and I don't know how to explain what I understand). So I'm going to just give an example of what exactly I'm going through right now.

Today, I woke up to my alarm with an unfinished dream. I don't remember what it was, but I can't focus on anything else now from the moment I woke up. This is just an example, I feel like this quite often. Another example is, sometimes I'm doing something, like watching a movie, and suddenly I feel like something is missing, or that I forgot something, I can't even explain what I feel but it's so uncomfortable and distracting that I can't focus on anything else for the entire remaining day. I have to stop doing what I was doing, like pause the movie, and that's how my entire day is wasted. This has other impacts on my life too. Like, I get angry at people because I'm feeling so confused (these are the people that care about me, like my mom). Another impact on my life is that the thoughts literally don't let me sleep, I just can't stop thinking even though I just want to have a sleep.

Please tell me what I'm going through if you know about it, give me some advice. I will appreciate you for the rest of my life."
1169,Does anyone else get uncomfortable around children?,"Idk why but children stress me out. 

I also have a lot of trauma related to my childhood, and I’ll get intrusive thoughts and I’ll get freaked out that I’ll end up like my abuser, even though I don’t have the urge to do anything bad.

I really want to get help for this but idk how."
1170,Any experiences with anxiety medication?,"Hi I’m sorry if this is not the right place to ask. I will remove if not. (I am not asking for medical advice, I’m simply asking for your experiences
I’m based in the U.K. btw

I have used to have bad anxiety constantly but that’s seemed to have subsided. My main issue now is having panic attacks at any time without any obvious triggers. When the attacks do happen they’re really bad, mainly forgetting how to breathe, rapid heart beat and palpitations and abdominal pain. 

Anyway, I’ve been to the GP and he prescribed me Citalopram 20mg. I understand this is mainly an antidepressant but can also help with anxiety. I’m not depressed btw but this medication makes me feel really low. Ive only been taking it about 2 weeks. 

Anyway, I want to change the medication as I don’t feel this is working for me. What other medication is out there for anxiety and panic attacks? What are your experiences with them? Any thoughts? 

Btw I’m in the U.K. so no Alprazolam is not prescribed here."
1171,The world won,"Idk what to do anymore, I barely even have the motivation to do things I love, how will I be able to live like this until my 20s? I'm alone, I hate the people that care about me and I feel like a burden to the people I care about. I'm able to do literally anything I want in my life right now, I could steal a car if I felt like it but I can barely even stand up because when I think I'll enjoy something it always gets ruined because of me. My friend treated me like shit and made me feel bad for not wanting to talk to him anymore. And like I said I feel like I'm wasting peoples time when I talk to them. I have no one to talk to. No one is there because of me. And I'm too scared to find the quickest way out. I have nothing and all I want is more nothingness but I can't even get it. Dreams and reality are getting mixed up so I can barely tell the difference sometimes. And my dreams are always so good, then it's a total fucking let down when it was all just a dream. So I don't know what to do anymore. I want to talk to people but I know they don't want to talk to me. And I only care about one person but we barely talk and it would be weird if she knew that she was the only person I care about. I just want to leave, no pain, and no regret. I'm not religious which doesn't help anything, if I was I could think about how great heaven would be but there's fucking nothing. There's no heaven or hell, there's just nothing, not even thoughts or feelings, no hot or cold. I'd just be trapped with myself not even being able to process information. There's nothing left for me here. No one to talk to. Nothing to enjoy. I guess in a way it's like I'm already dead.

Anyways sorry for probably ruining your day."
1172,Just sorta letting out my emotions,"So I'm just gonna say it right here, I'm about to go on a huge spiel about my terrible upbringing. 

I'll start off by saying that as far as I know, I don't have any mental illnesses, I just don't have a good headspace. Most, if not all of this stems from my childhood. My father was to say the very least, an awful human being. While I myself was never physically abused, I was constantly abused verbally. If I remember correctly, my father had narcissistic personality disorder, bipolar disorder (type 2 I think) and very likely was some sort of sociopath. He was also a drug addict. Being that I was his own flesh and blood, I guess he believed that I was more worthy of his affection than my mother so she got the worst of it. While my parents were still together, my mother was very meek and under what was basically mind control from my father. I've always like my mother a lot more than my father just because she was the only family member I could talk to. Everytime I tried to talk to my dad, some sort of argument would start and my grandparents were way too gushy. I could also relate to my mom, being that we were both going through the same thing by the hands of the same person. Sometimes, my parents would send me off to stay with my grandparents for the weekend and when I came back, there would be broken beer bottles and cigarette ash everywhere, with my parents passed out in different rooms. When that happened I hated both of them and felt like I had no one to turn to. 

I'm just going to go over the two main biggest fights they had. My memory is bad so this isn't all exactly it. 

-The first big one happened when I was 8 or 9 I believe. My mom was fed up with my dad and had an affair with someone. At the time, I was mad at her for this but I don't blame her anymore. Their fight lasted about 3 months. My little kid brain did not know how to handle this so I sorta just went into this state of catatonia. I didn't talk to anyone, I wore the same outfit everyday and I either ate too little or too much. Of course, instead of worrying about me, my parents just kept fighting. 

-After that was all done, when I was 13-14 my parents had the biggest fight. It lasted for a whole year. I believe it started when my mom started having problems with her ovaries. She ended up getting them removed. After it was done, she had to stay home for a month. For context, my father forced my mother out of the nursing field to work at a car repair shop that they owned together. There were security cameras installed in the place mainly because it wasn't in a very safe neighborhood. My parents had already been fighting about my mom's surgery since it costed a lot. One day when I came home from school, I found my mom crying because she had basically caught my dad in the security cameras with a prostitute. 

This lead to an even bigger fight. I remember the day so clearly: 
I came home from school and my mom was out of it. She explained the situation to me. After another fight that day, my father had physically dragged her out of the repair shop and threw her to the ground. She was finally leaving the toxic relationship. I was given three options. 1. I stay with my dad and she moves to Florida with my other grandparents. 2. We both move to Florida. Or 3. We stay here and get rid of my dad. I decided on number 3. We made a plan that my mom would go to night court and file a restraining order against my dad, as well as getting him arrested for battery or assault (I can't remember). While she did this, I would stay home with my dad and tell him that she went to go run errands. It felt like an eternity until she came back. And she came back with the police. My dad was arrested on several charges, including possession of drugs. 

After the whole thing went down, I felt much more confident. Obviously, my mom and I had to go to court to officially resolve the issue. The first time we went, I saw my dad with his lawyer and some of his friends from the repair shop. I went up to them and gave them all an angry look. The lawyer offered me a handshake and I gave him a very aggressive one before tearing my dad a new one in front of all them. I won't get into all the details but it ended up being that I could visit my dad or calm him once a week. I really only called when he was in prison and visiting never really worked out. The whole contact thing just stopped after a while. 

The last I heard from him was about a month ago when he finally decided to go into rehab. I don't really know what happened with that. Anyways, it was really nice to air this out. I've been going to a therapist and feeling much better so I'm all good from here. The past just really gets to you sometimes. I really hope someone can relate to this since it's unfortunately very common."
1173,"Please, I need your advice","First of all, I don't really understand what I'm feeling all the time and because of this, I'm bad at expressing what I feel (as even I don't know what I'm feeling and I don't know how to explain what I understand).

1180,My mental health causes me worse mental health,"Theres a lot to cover here really, 
I spend most of my time anxious, overwhelmed and suicidal and have panic attacks almost daily at this point, i breakdown before ive even had the chance to leave my house over my body or some other ridiculous but massive issue to me,

I cannot eat, i cannot sleep and im constantly exhausted trying to keep myself alive. 

Because of this i tend to isolate, not see many of my friends or talk to them which some of them seem to take rather personally, this stresses me out further or i guess triggers a sort of fight or flight in me where i literally cannot deal with it i get defensive and angry or just dont reply at all which obviously worsens the situation.

Im so done with myself im constantly fighting ME and im losing currently, this doesnt even begin to cover the problems ive caused myself its just current, overwhelming and i want to cut ties to everyone and live in a hole."

1182,I’m a failure and an idiot who can’t even communicate right,"Yesterday I finally managed to go to the psychiatrist’s Office after three weeks of trying to set up an appointment. When we talked over the phone and filled out the paperwork, they made it seem like my mom could be with me in the interim visit, because I’m bad at communicating certain things by myself, especially emotional and mental health stuff, and especially if it’s to someone I don’t know well. 

I had planned around this by bringing my journals and [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i7ykfw/ive_been_posting_a_lot_but_i_need_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) , [and this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ibixz4/not_feeling_like_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). But he didn’t want to look at my journals or phone, and when I asked him if I could quickly send him the link, he said he doesn’t do talk therapy or look at journals. I did that because the writing explained exactly what I was going through much better than my words could. 

He also kept asking questions like “why are you here if you’re leaving in two days? What do you want me to do? Why aren’t you seeing your previous doctor?” And I didn’t really know how to answer those questions. I just wanted to show him what I was going through. Those were all questions I think my mom would help answer. 

I also tried to explain that my school therapist said that I might have OCD and that I’m going through what she called “depersonalization” expecting him to point me in the direction of getting a proper diagnosis, but he didn’t. 

I assume he was probably as confused as I was, since he seemed to think I was there for y’all therapy or something. I just wanted to tell him what I was going through and I couldn’t even do that right. 

I was so angry at myself for being so stupid and my mom kept telling me that it wasn’t my fault but deep down I know it is. Deep down I know it’s my poor communication skills. Its my poor communication skills that make me freeze up and forget things when I’m put on the spot. It’s my poor communication skills which kept me from talking to my crush, it’s my poor communication skills that kept me from talking to my professor who did 8:00 classes about retaking a quiz because I was late (my friend had to do that for me), it’s my poor communication skills that led to one of my covolunteers at a wildlife rescue calling me the wrong name for a solid month because I didn’t know how to correct her. It’s my poor communication skills that keep me from talking, even to my friends. It’s my poor communication skills that lead me to try to solve my own problems instead of seeking help, making them worse. 

I was so mad that I even made [this post which I should probably delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ic8r6g/fuck_my_psychiatrist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but I’ll keep it to remind myself how stupid I am for lashing out at people who don’t deserve it. I also made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/icd1s5/i_want_to_apologize/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as some sort of apology, but I know it doesn’t really matter."
1183,Coping with always being worried,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is the correct subreddit.

I‘ve always been an anxious person and worried about anything and everything. I don’t think I have anxiety disorder, though.

Still, the smallest things can spoil my day or go send my thoughts into spirals. Mostly I worry about things not going smoothly. And tbh that’s really exhausting. 

So, I am looking for ways to cope with uncertainty. Something I already try to do is to take steps to minimise uncertainty for example not dreading phone calls but making them right away so I no longer have to worry about them. So if it’s possible I‘ll erase uncertainty but most of the times that’s not possible. 

Do you have any ideas how I can stop my thoughts from replaying situations that made me feel bad and thinking of thousands of possible scenarios in the future? It should be something I can do myself without the help of someone else.

Thanks a lot."
1184,What's your most backward trait?,"-Mine is giving into my Depression and not leaving the house for days on end.

1185,I destroyed the friendship between my two friends and I,"Or at least I think so. I'm not looking for solutions, I just want to let this out because it hurts so much. I hate how I always have to be so insecure about every relationship I have and how I get so depressed. They're both really special to me but the voice in the back of my mind always tells me that they hate me, they're annoyed by me, and that this friendship wouldn't last long.

They both have bad days a lot and so do I but I hate how I can't manage to pretend it's all okay for them so I can be even just a little source of comfort. Why do I have to be so weak? Why do I have to be such a shitty person?

I don't think I deserve friends or people who support me but I still can't help but drown so much in loneliness and longing for a secure relationship.

I feel so bad for being like this. I started wishing that maybe we should have never met because at least they won't have to be burdened with or they don't have to put up with me because they don't deserve such a shitty and toxic person in their lives."
1186,I don't think things look good. Is something wrong with me?,"What the title says. I never find things aesthetically pleasing. I don't even understand what it means when someone says something is beautiful. It doesn't make sense to me. Particularly when it comes to colors. When people say two colors go good together, I simply don't get it. To me I see no difference whatsoever in any combination of shirt/pants color, for example. There has never been a time when I think someone looks weird for wearing a certain color. I simply don't notice. And I have had friends tell me I am wearing a strange combination, and I truly didn't know because I don't understand why people think that wearing a shirt that is darker blue than my jeans looks weird. That seems arbitrary to me. The only thing I do have is a sense of satisfaction if things are orderly/matching colors. I might be satisfied from a really well organized closet , but there is no sense of ""beauty"". I do experience attraction. I am attracted to men and there are certain characteristics that make someone attractive to me. But I have friends who are attracted to women and say they can tell when a man is ""objectively good looking"" and I don't understand it. Are people who say that secretly bi? I don't have the slightest clue when a woman is attractive. It seems arbitrary to me which women people think are hot and which they think are ugly. I don't understand what people mean by ""cute, pretty, handsome"" etc, for me all there is is attractive."

1188,How do I tell my parents that I think I'm depressed?,"Or do I even tell them? Do I seek therapy without their knowing? I'm starting uni in a few weeks in a new city and since I'm moving out I probably could seek help without having to tell them. However, I'd much rather see a therapist at least once or a doctor who could provide a diagnosis before I start uni. 


I know it probably won't change much and even if I could somehow get access to antidepressants I assume they won't have an effect until at least after a month of usage? But I can't stand the thought of starting uni in a mental state as numb and unhappy as this.  Just the thought of my major made me so excited about a year ago but now doesn't give me an ounce of happiness. I need to change this, but I'm scared to let my parents know because they've already suffered a lot because of my mental illnesses and they think I'm completely fine now."
1189,I can't find a good enough reason to keep on,"I have BPD and in february I made a serious attempt on my life. I managed to send out a message to someone saying I am in crisis and they took it seriously. It took over an hour for an ambulance to get to me and a bit longer until the firefighters came and broke down my door. They found me OD'd and unconcious submerged in my bath. I woke up some time later after being in an induced coma in the hospital.

I haven't processed it, it just doesn't seem to be real in my mind. My family love me but I need the love of a person external to my family to feel ok. When I don't have that all I can think about is not existing. I don't think about death, I just think about how I want to not be here. I often think it would be better if I hadn't sent that message, they hadn't called 999 or they simply hadn't got there in time. I don't feel like anyone understands me or how hard I find it to do normal everyday things.

I don't think I am really here for an answer, I don't think an answer exists. I just needed to tell someone because I don't want to tell my family and make them worry that I will try again.

My brother started appearing depressed a couple of days ago, but these past two days have been the hardest. We took him to see his doctor, they gave him some sleeping medicine and a muscle relaxer because he hasn’t been sleeping a lot. I’m sure he’s convinced himself he wouldn’t wake up if he was to sleep. It was hard to get him to take the sleeping medicine but he did after the doctor visit yesterday, we thought he’d wake up better but he got worse. He’s hearing voices, being extremely paranoid (going as far as checking every room in the house) and is also going trough quick mood swings. Last night it was way too hard to deal with him, we took him to an emergency room where he stayed for a couple of hours. He had told us he’d stay a couple of days and we thought we’d be able to leave him there for a while. I was looking forward to resting right before they called us that he wanted to leave the hospital. They gave us a list of mental health clinics to call, but my brother doesn’t understand that he needs help and refuses to accept that he needs it."

1196,Physical illness is making me miserable. I’m sick mentally and physically and I’m trapped at home with my toxic father.,"24/f here.

Two weeks ago I had a really bad grand mal seizure. We don’t know what caused it yet but I’m seeing several doctors. In my state, if you have a seizure, you cannot drive for six months, so instead of being at my apartment, I’m at my parents’. 

I‘ve also found out I’m dangerously anemic. I’ve always had the tendency for anemia, but right now it’s very severe. Doctor said I need iron infusions pronto, so I’m getting my first one tomorrow morning. I feel like hell. I’m tired 90% of the time, walking up stairs feels like I’m running a marathon, I’ve had a week long pounding headache that won’t go away, and my mood is shit. I don’t even know why I’m so anemic. I’ve recovered from an eating disorder and am much healthier now or so I thought. I don’t bleed super heavily either when it’s my time of the month. I don’t understand.

I’m trying not to slip back into anorexia. Living with my dad right now is HARD. He’s a narcissist and a complete health psycho and TOTALLY triggers my anorexia. When I am at my apartment, I eat a good 3 meals a day. When I’m at home, I’ve realized I do EVERYTHING to not eat in front of my dad. Its totally subconscious, I’ve realized, that I won’t eat in front of him because he’s constantly criticizing what I eat. I can NEVER eat without him being totally up my ass. He basically wants me to eat exactly like him and if I don’t, I’m unhealthy and “need to watch my diet”. I’m a totally normal bmi right now as opposed to my 16 bmi when I was sick, but I know my dad thinks I’m fat and unhealthy. It’s excessive how much he comments on anything I eat. I’ve never been overweight, in fact I’m still small. It’s ridiculous and extremely triggering.

I’m miserable at home. I can’t do this for six months until I’m able to drive again. Any words of encouragement welcome."
1197,Feeling useless sometimes,"Recently I’ve been feeling in such a rut. 

I’ve gained weight, I feel very uncomfortable in my own skin. I don’t do anything but work, sleep, eat and watch tv. I used to do lots of stuff with with COVID I just feel like I’m not adding anything to anyone’s life. 

On top of that I feel like I keep making mistakes at work and I am busy just messing everything up a little. It honestly feels like I am just treading water at the moment trying to keep my head above water. I’m not sure how to fix this, I don’t think I’m depressed but I’m not happy either and I feel like a failure. 

My boyfriend was talking about all the things he’s doing and what our friends are doing, they’re all working towards some goal and he has this amazing job which he really really loves and I’m so happy for him but when he talks about it I feel such resentment because I used to be the one who loved their job and did well but now I’m just sort of existing?

Any help would be appreciated :) thank you"
1198,How do you motivate yourself to do things?,I know there shouldn't be the pressure to be productive with everything going on in the world but I have been very unproductive and unmotivated especially the past week where I've been severely depressed and constantly just lie down on my bed to cry or sleep. The unproductivity makes me feel worse about myself so I really want to change that and help myself even just a little. I've had a list of things I want and need to do but it's so difficult to start anything when I barely even have the energy to get out of bed or even open my eyes sometimes.

1200,I don't know how to stop self sabotaging myself. It's getting to the point where I'm purposely hurting myself to feel pain so I can take a break.,"(Longer than I expected it to be, sorry in advance). 

Okay, so I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember and I was officially diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder about 8 years ago. I also have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and I am lactose intolerant. Unfortunately, one of the main triggers for IBS is stress, so even when I am avoiding all of the foods that I shouldn't be eating, my stress levels can make me have an IBS episode where I'm sick for hours. 

It has only recently occurred to me that to cope with my anxiety, I quite often utilise this disadvantage by intentionally making myself sick. I then rationalise it by saying I have an 'excuse' for taking a time out and not having anything to think of or worry about. 

Looking back, I've also made myself sick to avoid things that I needed to attend or do. In some of these instances, the anxiety of an act would make me sick in itself, however I would often exacerbate the situation by eating things I shouldn't in an attempt to be sicker for longer. 

It feels like my brain is overriding itself by finding a way out as a lot of the time I don't fully register what I'm doing. My body is starting to have negative effects to this cycle as I've had to have surgery, medications and I am really starting to gain weight. 

I feel a disconnect between my brain and my anxiety brain. I've tried meditations, antidepressants, aromatherapy, breathing techniques etc but it doesn't seem to be able to help calm it down. Every doctor and specialist I've seen has told me to try to calm down and relax because my muscles are in a constant state of tension, but I don't know how to. Most of the issues I've had for the past few years have all been linked to my muscles constantly being tensed and my constant rounds of IBS/selfinduced/anxiety sickness. The only relief I get from any of this is after I've been sick and I'm lying down for a few hours unable to move. It's like my brain just switches off and I get some peace. 

I just don't know how to stop this automatic response to life that my brain is activating. I'm sick of being sick, but the peace of mind it brings me is quite comforting. I constantly feel as if I need a break from life or that it needs to slow down. You would think that my brain would be happy with COVID19 literally slowing down the world, but it's almost made me worse. My brain is still working overdrive and I'm just becoming a sadder anxiety ridden mess. 

I'm writing this post after another episode and realised for the first time I should take advantage of my few moments of clarity 😅 any help or thoughts would be appreciated, because I'm at a loss."
1201,talked to a counselor and...,i made an appointment the other day for anxiety &amp; depression and just talked to a counselor on the phone. she asked me questions but I feel like i wasn’t being completely honest. i’ve never talked to a professional about my anxiety &amp; depression so it felt hard to really open up. my main concern is other issues im having. i wanted to bring it up but i couldn’t... she sent me links to therapist and medications and said i can call her back and follow up . i still want to open up about what else ive been going through but its hard. where do I go from here?
1202,Freaking out over the uncertainty,"TLDR; my home environment is toxic and idk how to deal with potentially being kicked out of my safe space on-campus.

So I (21F) have ADHD and anxiety and have been doing my very bestest to not freak out for the last 6 months but my breaking point seems right around the corner. For background, I live in the US (sadly).

My home environment was very emotionally abusive growing up. I love my time 500 miles away from it while I’m at college but I just moved into my new on-campus apartment three weeks ago after being stuck at home for most of quarantine and am just starting to adjust into my “I’m in a safer space” mindset, which is truly liberating and typically reduces my anxiety and improves my general wellbeing, especially since my home family has no clue I am LGBT or have ADHD.

Then, yesterday, just two weeks before the semester was about to start, my university switched to all online learning and will be only allowing housing for a small amount of people who can prove they need it (homeless, for example). I don’t know how I can prove that my home environment is terrible for my mental health and learning because my younger siblings and I are all technically adults and our parents pay for half our tuition, so I’m not about to call my parents out on their issues and have my siblings’ education taken away just so I can stay in my safe space when I could just get a lease on my own, but that would be very hard to explain to my parents. I honestly might just go that route if I have to, I cannot deal with another semester of living at home, especially not my last one while I’m taking 18 credits and working 3 online jobs. 

In addition to the memories of emotional abuse, my father has no concept of respecting people’s noise sensitivity so always has the tv or music blasting and is deaf to any request for quiet, which I need in order to function.

Anyways, I just need a virtual hug or some recommendations or something. I would talk to my therapist but I’ve been without one for way too long and have no clue how to find one in the midst of a pandemic, especially when my future is so up in the air (I’m graduating in December and will most likely be unemployed then so even if they don’t kick me off-campus now, they will in a few months, so who knows where I’ll be)."

1205,Today my counsellor suggested that I stop taking anti-depressants because it's not natural,"I've only ever met two counsellors. I fought with the first one four years ago because she kept telling me to stop fighting against the corruption in my previous workplace and just learn to shut up. I stopped seeing her after the second session.

For the past four years I've only met with psychiatrists to update my condition. Honestly I still don't know the difference between psychiatrists, psychologists, and counsellors, but psychiatrists never question my meds, so I find it easier to talk to them. They know that mental health is just like any other disease, sometimes feeling positive is just not enough to cure it. That's where medicine comes in.

Lately, they suggested me to see a different counsellor, just to check if anything has changed. It's been four years, so I thought why not give it a try. I immediately regret it when today the counsellor starts saying ""Well, I wonder why the psychiatrists keep increasing your dosage? They should try reducing it."" Like, dude, I'm no doctor, but even I know how to respect other people who know better about their fields. Then he went on saying, ""I wish you can try quitting the meds, cure your problems more naturally, just, without meds.""

Please tell me, does this happen to you too?"
1206,Can’t Afford Therapy,"Hello everyone, I use to go to therapy when I was 17 but my parents pulled me out because they “didn’t like it”. Now I’m 20 and I’m not doing good, so I’d like to go back. I talked to the hospital I use to get therapy at and my insurance company. They said I have a $1000 deductible I need to meet before they pay for anything. The therapy visits are $400 for one 1 hour appointment, and I have to pay out of pocket until I reach the $1000. I can’t afford that. I’m in college and work part time, and the expenses for books and tuition take up most of my money. I go to community college and the one I attend doesn’t have any behavioral counseling or anything like that. There’s no community mental health centers near me. I can’t afford therapy and I’m panicking at the prospect that I’ll never get the help I need. They spiral said I can apply for sliding scale pay, but I doubt I’ll qualify because I live with my parents, I’m their dependent, and they make too much. Also my parents refuse to help. What can I do?"

1208,People who make up being in abusive relationships should suffer consequences of ruining that person's character.,"If you tell people that you are in an abusive relationship and you are being abused.

Who would EVER make that up???"
1209,"Cognitive depressive effects, has anyone recovered full intellectual capacity?","When does the neuro-cognitive effect of depression wear off? Is this permanent? I feel as though I've lost so much intellectual capacity, faith in my mind, IQ points and memory ability.

I did so well in school, and even in grad school but when my last psych fucked up my meds (feel like I have brain damage from klonopin)... I went into a never-ending withdrawal state and/or a resultant depressive state I'm still recovering from 2 years later.

I feel like I haven't been able to learn or be enthusiastic about anything (other than learning about ways to try to heal myself faster- out of desperation). It's affecting my job and my outlook on life. I see young adults years younger than me zooming past and I'm 'only' 26...I feel like I've had dementia for 2 years now. The stimulants only help so much, they almost give me a false sense of feeling like I'm up to par but realistically I'm struggling to keep up and everyone can tell.

Has anyone been able to get themselves out of a neverending cognitive hole like this? I've thought at times I was on my way out, but then I slip and fall even deeper. (These slips have been accelerated by my long term SSRI taper but I've been at it for a year and a half now...)"
1210,I cut myself for the first time yesterday and I did it again today. I'm scared,"I knew it wasn't right but I did it anyway. They're not deep cuts and they're more toward the underside of the arm. I didn't bleed much.   
I've been in a very bad place mentally these past months and I keep thinking of suicide. I don't have anything planned, but my mind has been moving towards something horrible.   
I've never felt this bad in my life this is all too new for me I didn't think it would happen to me.   


Idk what I'm doing. Idk what I'm thinking. God damn it what's wrong with me."
1211,Traumatised after cat hit by car.,"*Warning, some of this is graphic*

We were outside feeding our cats and something spooked my housemates cat
 It ran under a parked car out and straight onto the road and was hit by a car and killed. 


I ran across the road and told my housemate not to follow as I knew it wasnt going to be ok. 


****GraphIc***
The cat was convulsing in the gutter as I got to him and he died seconds later. 
I picked him up and just felt the crunching of his bones inside.  I wrapped him in a blanket and handed him to my housemate like a baby so he could hold him and not have to see or feel it. 

I took his paw prints for my friend to remember and I just felt the bones crunch in my hand  

We decided to bury the cat. 
As we were going outside the cat has a spasm and my friend (clearly in shock) was convinced he was alive. 

I knew the cat was dead. It did not move after he stopped convulsing and his eyes were dialated and open. I also knew the internal damage my friend hadnt noticed without the simple fact that he had not breathed in an hour. 

After pleading with my friend that his cat was dead he agreed and we buried him in the yard. 

A few hours later I am trying to sleep but I am so traumatised. 
Everytime I shut my eyes I can see the cat convulsing in the gutter. I cant get over how the cat felt as I picked him up. I feel physically sick . 
I try to sleep and I am getting anxiety/panic attacks. 
The only thing I am ok with is that my friend didnt have to see or feel it like I did.
I coulnt imagine going through that with my own animals :( 


How can I even begin to process/ get over this to get some sleep?"
1212,How to Get Out of Your Head,"Over the last decade, I’ve struggled to get out of their head, lost in a mental fog of uncertainty and anxiety. It’s addicting to self-analyze or to notice abstract patterns to try and grasp some intangible truth. My worst mental trap is the “who am I” question where I study various sources (or take dumb online quizzes) to determine where I best “fit in” in the grand scheme of things, hoping that life will present a lifestyle or identity that makes my life feel more fulfilling.

Lately, however, I’ve been a bit disillusioned and wanting to come back to reality, to feel grounded. My mental process, up until this point, has made it difficult to find meaning, make decisions or to take action. Instead, I over analyze myself and the world, searching for some perfect meaning or guarantees since I'm uncomfortable with not knowing what to do with my life at the age of twenty-eight. While this has helped me in some cases, for the most part, I’m just miserable."
1213,Quarantine impacts on my mental state-,"I'm a 22 y/o male based in the US. 

Ever since the quarantine began, my overall mental health/state has been declining rapidly, complemented by overwhelming feelings of loneliness/isolation (I do go out often for work and still see friends). I began turning to alcohol just weeks after it began- I'm trying to cut off alcohol altogether for a while as a step in the right direction, but I'm struggling. I've made attempts at dieting, going on daily runs, but nothing seems to be alleviating this constant pain I'm feeling. 
Then there's the self doubt. While I had at least an ounce of self confidence/esteem prior to the quarantine, being alone and trapped in my own head has made me criticize every aspect of my being and my self worth. I've been a pianist for a decade, but as I play, I tell myself that I'm terrible- I know I'm not, but it feels like I'm at war with my own brain, like I'm my own enemy. Funny thing is, piano was one of those escapes for me, but now it feels as if I have to force myself to play only to embarrass... Well... Myself, as silly as that sounds. I have a general lack of motivation to do anything, really.
I want to know if other members of this sub have been dealing with the same sort of thing- I'm coming to a point where I can't stand it anymore. I can't control how I feel. 
I just want to be happy, content with myself and who I am. I want to be able to chill at home, in my room, doing whatever I'm doing and feel okay doing it. I don't want to have to depend on work and school occupying my mind to feel okay- I want to be able to feel alright when there's nothing going on and I have time to think. I'm so tired of this."
1214,I have these severe mental breakdowns where I self-harm and say a lot of nasty things to anyone who’s around me. I don’t even know who I am during these episodes.,"I’m 16, I live in the US just in case anyone has any resources.

For close to a year now, I’ve had these severe mental breakdowns where I will feel deeply distressed and begin to self-harm. If I’m angry enough, I will also say a lot of nasty things to my parents and it has even gotten physical between them and I before. They, especially my dad, are one of my main triggers. They are pretty shit at dealing with conflicts with me and it usually always turns out nasty between us, even when I don’t have a mental breakdown. 

In terms of what the self-harm is, I usually hit or punch myself. Afterwards there will be bruises on my face and sometimes on my hands or arms. It’s deeply disturbing and makes me feel very ashamed afterwards. It’s almost like I black out (not literally) during these episodes. I can barely remember what happened afterwards, it all blurs together. 

Before last night, I was clean off of self-harm for 3 months. But due to pent-up resentment, depression, and rage I’ve had towards my parents over an unrelated situation, I completely broke down yesterday and wanted to die. I lost control and hurt myself badly, probably worse than usual. I’m still in pain today and I was going to stay over my aunt’s house to take a break from them but now I don’t think I want to- I don’t want her to see my face. I’m all scratched up, have a busted lip, and bruises will probably be following soon. I feel so ugly and ashamed. My dad also wants me to be put away in the psych ward, which won’t do much because psych wards here tend to be subpar. He’s ableist and uses my mental health issues against me.

I’m at a loss with myself. I’m in so much pain over hurting myself yesterday, both mentally and physically. I thought I was getting better but I guess not. I want to hide. Can anyone relate and does anyone have advice for me as to what I can do to stop?"
1215,Depression shouldn’t be trendy..,"When I was younger, many people thought depression was trendy or cool. As the type of person I was I always thought it was cringe to feel sad. I never grew up with a single friend I can trust (hard to believe yes I know) I’ve always been bullied for being fat/having a studder/ coming to school late. I’ve just had an overwhelming feeling of I’m not worth anything and if I was dead the world wouldn’t change a bit. I was thinking of getting my hands on some morphine but I’m still very young and under 18. Me and my brother had a fight just now that ended in him clocking me in the throat because I didn’t want to go hiking with him (I was told yesterday to finish staining the deck.) I told him it’s unfair how he is always right when I’m reality he is always wrong but can’t admit it. He was trying to get me to cry because I haven’t cried ima few years and I broke. He told me to grow some balls and I’m just a pussy that should go hang himself. Overall I’m 14 he is 21 but still acts like he is 10. He takes all his anger out on me from collage and just yells at me for literal hours on end without a sigh of stopping. I don’t want to get out of bed anymore realizing my day will be shit like the rest of them. He is bigger then me so I can’t take him on  (I’m 6”3 220lb) if I had a gun I would have been dead by 5 from abusive parents. Please don’t comment for me to call the suicidal hotline, I won’t call it. Just tell me your experiences so I can realize I’m not alone with this shit"
1216,I'm a failure,"I realized that I couldn't talk or chitchat with people.... I just seem not interested in talking with people, or i dont have anything to talk about... So I always stay alone or isolated from people..."
1217,How did a toxic parent(s)/emotionally unavailable parent(s) affect you?,"TW: Weight, SH


For me my dad is emotionally unavailable as a result of his childhood. He was abused emotionally and physically. He left when he was 18 and cut off communication with his family. 75% of the day he’s grumpy/mad at us (my mom and I) for something. The other 25% he’s sleeping,less grumpy,or the I’m going to be mad later but I’m “happy” now. 

It affects my mental health. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. He has called me nicknames that I’ve told him to stop using but he doesn’t listen. He has called me skinny and string bean. I get self conscious because I miss the way I used to look. I was 95 pounds and 5’6. I miss that. Now I’m 5’8 and I go between 110-125. I feel fat. I miss my abs and actually feeling skinny. 
He sorta knows what he says. He’s said that he wishes he had a different daughter. He’s caused My mental health to get worse. I’ve had more urges to self harm. I don’t even remember the last time he has hugged me or said that he loved me. He hasn’t been to one of my school events with a smile on his face since kindergarten (10 years ago). I can count on one hand how many times he has even been to a school event. He’s not really there for me. Sometimes I feel like I’m taking care of him."
1218,I just noticed it is my birthday.,"I'm so disconnected from the world I don't know the date, time or day of the week most days. Today included, but I caught sight of a date somewhere and was like. ""Hey, isn't that my birthday? Oh that's today?""  


No facebook notifications, no friends coming by, no family left to give a shit. I am completely alone as per usual, this isn't a special day, just a reminder of how empty my life is."
1219,Anyone with severe previous depressive episodes. Do you ever get this.,"So I don’t know if it’s any different because I’ve been told I have ptsd symptoms by my therapist but Everytime I feel a a similar feeling to my last episode, coming on or a wave of panic/depression it becomes an absolute panic mode and I start to really go into that mode of “fuck is it happening again” and I start comparing EVERYTHING double checking my feelings and comparing them to back then and justifying and finding reasons. Even dates and times (because I remember well) any similarity and I panic. I have to avoid certain things that remind me. If I have an experience that relates somewhat to my last episode then I start to expect an episode and in fact may be more likely to induce because of the focus on my emotions. I end up doing everything to avoid the severity of my last episode by taking different vitamins, working out, sleeping to avoid thinking, eating healthy.  Anybody else have this or is too traumatised by last episode? I literally feel like I’m reliving something"
1220,What's the first step?,Ok listen I know I need therapy. But generational curses will trick you into thinking that you're crazy and you'll be fine and that you don't need therapy. I'm tired of not feeling ok. I know I need to go to therapy but where do I start? I don't even know what to expect or what to say. I don't even know why I'm going. I'm just so tired of feeling this way all the time. Please if you know of anyone online websites or even apps I could try I would like to start there.
1221,Online resources for mental health?,Ive never been diagnosed but I know I’ve had anxiety my whole life to the point where I’m too scared to even go to the doctors to ask for help because I’m afraid they won’t believe me or take me seriously and then I’ll just leave feeling embarrassed. Going in and talking to someone is too terrifying for me but I feel like I really need something to help me cope for now and then maybe I can consider therapy so I’ve been looking into alternatives. Has anyone used online prescription/doctors services like maple where you don’t actually have to meet a doctor in person? How did you like them? Did you feel comfortable with them?
1222,"I feel disconnected from reality, like none of this is real","Why else would I feel like this? Like I'm hardwired differently from other people. Why else would nothing I do to make myself healthier and happier work? I eat well, I drink plenty of water, I take my meds every day, I get plenty of sleep but nothing gets better. It feels like a simulation. Like there's someone pulling the strings trying to see how long I can deal with this"
1223,Is There A Program to Help Coordinate Care?,"I'm seeking a program that helps those with mental illness coordinate their care and resources. Like a social work program?

I know there are hotlines that you can call and they will give you some clinics you can call. I know there are gov't funded organizations that can help with the homeless and those on medicaid. But for those in the middle -- is there anything for them?

I'm imaging a program where a social worker may keep a database of your insurance info, your medical record, etc. and helps coordinate care based on the notes of your doctor and psych.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this exist? And if it doesn't, is it possible for it to exist? I'd seriously love to be a part of it."
1224,Having a panic attack in the car. Don't worry I'm not driving I'm parked,But I can't get myself to go into work. I tried calling a hotline and they just kept saying oh you shouldn't have to hide your symptoms. They just want to pretend there's no stigma around mental health anymore but there is. A huge stigma. Opening up to people about it did nothing but drive them away.
1225,Friend with paranoid delusions refuses to seek help,"I have a good friend from college who has had a very rough time of life for several years. I believe he is suffering from hallucinations and paranoid delusions - most likely exacerbated by drug abuse. He believes he is the subject of harassment by a shadowy group who uses advanced/secret technology to send sounds and messages that only he can hear in an attempt to manipulate him. I have tried to talk to him directly about mental health and seeking treatment, but he refuses to seek help and is offended by the suggestion. He has friends and family who are concerned about him, but most are tired of his antics and have essentially cut him off. He has recently been asking for help. He wants me to hire a P.I. I'm not going to do that, but I'm wondering if this could somehow be an opening to get him to talk to a mental health professional? I'm looking for ideas about how to get him to be open to the idea and also about what resources may be available to him. He lives in the Cincinnati area. I live out of state."
1226,i want to hide again,"i have no idea how to explain this in a way that doesn’t lead to “people knowing gets you help”
but that’s not what i want.
i’ll explain.

I (16 M UK) suffer from an eating disorder. 
as well as that eating disorder i struggle with anxiety levels and obsessive compulsions as well as a form of depressive episodes. nothing but the eating disorder have been diagnosed so i try not to reference them.

i developed my eating disorder at a young age (12 or possibly younger) mainly as a result of genetics (my mother, father and many other close relatives also struggle with EDs)
if i do have depression that would be due to my dad’s chemical imbalance that also passed on to my siblings but we’re not sure about me.

due to these issues occurring at a young age they were known by my parents and my mates. (although they didn’t understand) 
i grew up fast for other reasons and people knew that too, i developed new issues and coping mechanisms, one of hem being humour.


to cut a long story short i’m 16 and most people i know, know about my mental health from finding out through my jokes, my older mates or genuinely having breakdowns in front of them.
i shut off as much as i could then ended up in a relationships, my boyfriend also having struggled convinced me to talk and let go of hiding. now i regret it. i regret being open, i regret having panic attacks in front of people, i regret all of it and i want to hide it again but i don’t know how.

1227,I feel like giving up.,"Ever since I was a wee lad, around 9, my own house life has been shite. From a mom who cannot care, to a verbally, mentally, and sexually abusive stepdad. I haven't felt true happiness since I was 8. It sucks, really. I had an argument with my mom earlier and I ended up screaming at her how I just want to die, how life sucks and how I just wanna give up, because no matter what I do nothing get's better. I realized then how fucked up everything has been in my life and I just want to be free of my pain. I want to be happy again,, but I don't know what to do."
1228,Does anyone else get stressed out and uncomfortable around children?,"Idk why but children stress me out. 

I also have a lot of trauma related to my childhood, and I’ll get intrusive thoughts and I’ll get freaked out that I’ll end up like my abuser, even though I don’t have the urge to do anything bad.

I really want to get help for this but idk how."

1230,BPD and magic psylicibin bad trips,"Hi all,so I have borderline personality and have tried truffles before and it was amazing at first but went sour fast,I'm just wondering if anyone thinks it's a good idea to try again,I felt like I learned alot about certain things and it's seemed to calm me down in every day aspects of BPD,especially me thinking of people out to get me and so on,I was wondering what was a bad trip like for others so I can possibly try differentiate a normal bad trip or my BPD affected it. So  this was my experience, I took the 8 grams of shrooms,shit kicks off about an hour in, I had such a pleasant feeling and saw constellations the stars Hindu gods the lot and felt soooo connected finally to everything like right down to the soil,now,at my 3 hour mark everything just started pulsating violently like out of the blue it came from nowhere and it was fast and everything kinda went black,grey and blue,but I was in reality,no more stars and no wave after that,I got seriously anxious,paranoid and threw up,it kinda of finished then,I kept telling myself it will pass tryna calm meself down but  but it wouldn't stop I cried laughed and felt clarity and terror in well it had to be 30mins,it was my first time and it was a few days after I stopped mirtazipine. I feel this urgency to try again like I feel better now than I was 3 years ago,after the trip for months I'd never been so aware of the way I treated others and my perceptions of things in real life I saw they were a mirage. Any legit advice would be amazing,much love"
1231,Im very unhappy with life and want a quick way to die,"I had a shitty childhood where I was sexually abused for five years by my step father. I told my mother about it 6 years ago but she decided to stay with him and now she lives a happy life with him in a different country. My sister and the rest of the family have accepted it and hate it when I talk about it. I can’t feel close to my sister or the rest of my family anymore because of that. I am now almost thirty and just got broken up with because of Covid, me and my boyfriend at the time we had problems but we were hoping to work it out. I traveled for a bit, away from him and got stuck here because of the pandemic and so he decided to end things because he couldn’t wait for me and had “needs”. I have no job, no future, I have no real friends or family. Im so sick of life and its problems. I see no point in living anymore. Please tell me about a fast and painless way to die.

My brother is 21, and since he returned from uni he’s been so depressed and sad, hardly talking to anyone. Today he burst into tears in the car and told my father he wants to kill himself. He thinks he might be transgender but isn’t sure- I don’t know what I can do for him right now. What can I do to help him?

Say I cut myself (by accident) or got injured in some way. I do what most people would and try to reduce pain and prevent infection to ultimately let the wound/injury heal. Yet after the fact I want the wound to get worse than before, bleed again, or start to hurt again. It feels like whatever it is isn't enough.

I don't know why.

It isn't sexual."

For example: I browse incel related spaces, even though I'm not a virgin or an incel, and I've had two girlfriends and dated 4 other girls. I also browse r/smalldickproblems despite me being above average in size. I don't like browsing r/averagedickproblems as much cause it makes me feel worse about my size"
1245,Is my mother a manipulator/gaslighting me?,"Anything she calls a 'weakness' in me she finds, exploits and uses it against me.

It can be anything, from walking too fast in the house, speaking in the wrong tone to her, forgetting something at home, eating too fast, not doing this not doing that.

Once she's in, then that's it, you considered either rude, unappreciative or mentally unstable.

Last Friday I forgot something at home before going to work so had to come back home to get it.

I could tell she 'latched onto' this and when I returned from home she laid into me saying that I eat too much at dinner last night and that I don't care about her feelings because I never talk to her - she's in bed when I leave for work and in bed when I return.

Today, I sat down too fast in the living room when I returned from work. Subsequently this has resulted in her questioning my mental health and yelling me that k need to see a psychiatrist because I'm acting weird. I literally returned from work and sat down when she asked me if something was wrong - to which I replied no.


It's serious gaslighting and I don't know what to do."

1250,"Is it true that if you think you have something, you probably don’t.","Hello so... I think I have ocd. I never really thought about it until I had a relationship and I basically suffered a lot of doubt and checking of my feelings and just so much anxiety that I had to break up. My ex brought it up to me and I looked up rOCD and it fit me to a T. And now since thinking about it, I also think I have pOCD but that’s a very scary subject to talk about, I probably shouldn’t have mentioned it.

So I made an appointment with a psych that works with ocd, but I wonder if I’m being dramatic. I had a psych, but she told me that ocd is like, washing your hands repeatedly or something. But I learned that ocd can also be obsessive thoughts and might not come with rituals at all or that maybe the rituals are not what we usually think they are. So that’s why I’m seeking a different opinion, but am I dumb? Am I being dramatic? Maybe I read too much into ocd and now I think I have it... I’m so scared that I’m coming off as a total dramatic idiot. I remember my old psych telling me that I ruminate a lot... so maybe it’s just that? And they say that usually you don’t know that you have a disorder or something so maybe I really don’t have ocd.

I don’t know... what do you guys think? Should I follow through with this new psych or should I listen to my old one? And am I being dramatic?"

Hey, I'm 19 going into my 2nd year of college and I'm studying 3D modelling and animation. Since I was little I always wanted a job that would in a way make someone happy: being a chief and making food to people, being a cartoonist to entertain people, being a coder to make games and my latest is being a 3D modeller and making things for any entertainment platform. 

As of right now I haven't done any kind of work in about 2 months, I don't want to do it, I don't want to think about it, my heart sinks when i think about it.

But he also says that i should take professional help i.e. seek a therapist. My university offers free counselling &amp; i have studied a psychology course from the counsellor, she is very nice and sweet. 
The problem is that i am not comfortable enough in sharing my personal issues/reasons with a teacher. If it was a random counsellor (not a teacher) then i would have definitely tried this. And i cannot go to any other professional that is outside of my university because of restrictions.
Because of this quarantine and lockdown, my mental health &amp; anxiety attacks have gone from bad to worse.

However I am feeling major side effects including extreme nausea, diarrhea (sorry if tmi) and a killer headache.

I've talked with my doctor and they said it was likely OCD but I've never pursued professional help outside of that. I've started to become depressed as of about a year ago due to me not liking myself and my anxiety symptoms so I'm looking into getting actual help. Medication seems to work for a lot of people so I'm curious what have been some of your personal experiences taking them if you're comfortable sharing and is there anything I should be aware of beforehand.

I love animals and want to be a Zoologist, im a junior in highschool and suffer from anxiety and depression. I have had thoughts of hurting people too, but I am never close to acting upon those. It's just with animals that it is hard to control the urge. But it's only with animals I randomly find not my dogs or anyone elses pets. I never have the thoughts until i'm about to release the animal. I just wanted to know if anyone else can relate?"

1268,anxiety podcast recommendation,"It's called ""Panic Attacking"". Two comedians talk out what gave them anxiety that week and they talk each other through it and make jokes while a licensed therapist listens and gives advice. One has general anxiety disorder and the other has a social anxiety disorder. Really cool to hear them talk discuss things that I only thought made me anxious and make light of it and the therapist's advice is really great. I listen on Soundcloud but its available all over i think

1269,"Nearly ran over a pet today, I feel bad","Hey, I know this story isn't that bad and I'm not sure if it deserves to be on this subreddit. Nevertheless I want a bit of advice to get over it as quickly as I can, so the situation doesn't worsen.

I recently passed my drivers license for motorcycles. It's the first vehicle I'm legally allowed to drive. I've only ridden about 400 kilometres by now.

Today I was driving a lot and a cat jumped out out of nowhere and ran into my bike. I didn't roll over it luckily and the cat could walk normally. Still I'm thinking a lot about this and it ruined my day. I'm making up scenarios in my head what could've happened. 
You must also know that my family recently adopted a little cat which is only 4 months old. Every time I see it I must think of the accident. The last 2 cats we had were both ran over when they were 2 years old.

All this might not seem that bad but I have a feeling I've never had before. I don't know how to describe it

I just want you guys to suggest me ways to get over it as quickly as I can. And also share your opinions."
1270,The frustration of just wanting to know what's wrong with me.,"I never sought any diagnosis or treatment until recently. I've just started seeing a psychologist but have only had a couple of sessions. So far so good, but an hour session is not long enough to even start to peel back this onion.

I _know_ I have brain damage from the self harm (head punching, head banging etc) - I used to have an IQ over 140 and now I barely scrape over 110, and my short term memory is shot to hell and my speech is slurred and I find it difficult to put concepts into words verbally (written is fine). I _know_ I have symptoms of aspergers. I _know_ I have symptoms of CPTSD. I feel it in my bones...

I also know I have to go through the process with the psychologist to hopefully get some kind of I suppose, closure, a reason or explanation for what is happening to me. I need to know for peace of mind, and knowing would help me because finally this is something real, that can be dealt with, and isn't just me being a randomly messed up unit.

It's just frustrating, I feel like I have lived in my skin for close to 40 years and I know where I am broken and falling apart, and this new phase where I am finally letting someone tinker around in my psyche seems slow and ineffective, especially when I know so many areas in this field are unknown, contentious, or unrecognised, but I also understand why it's necessary and scientific approaches just take time.

I know in my work I don't just jump straight to the first solution that pops to mind, they're still figuring out all the puzzle pieces before they can work out how to assemble it I guess. I need to trust the process, but trust is not something I have a great deal to give.

I just want answers, I want help yesterday, I want peace and comfort. I want not to continue to pass this trauma on to my wife and kids. I want a holiday from myself, and a chance to start over. 

I wish I'd started to get real help decades ago. I don't know why I was so proud or afraid, thinking now all the years I've wasted and bridges burned, but hey, I guess I am making progress and it's never too late.

Sorry just venting, it's early in the morning and I haven't slept (again) and am overwhelmed with work and I've run out of excuses as to why it's not finished yet, when the reality is I'm just so god damn exhausted and I can't seem to concentrate enough to put 2 and 2 together right now."
1271,Toxic family sucks,"I wasn’t having the best week to begin with. Just working on telling myself positive affirmations all week: You’re a good person, you help people, you’re kind, smart and generous. You have friends. You’re worthy of love. You are beautiful. 
Then my mother calls me, who I support financially mind you, to tell me that she’s suicidal and it’s all my fault because I’m selfish, rude and that I will never be loved. All because she’s insecure about being poor and in an unfit situation. It was a super toxic call. She’s already a toxic person but just like damn. It felt like a punch to the stomach. 😩 Trying so hard to keep my head up but damn is it hard."
1272,I NEED HELP PLEASE. THANK YOU ALL!,"First of all, sorry for my bad English, I'm Spanish :) I need some advice from some of you. I'm a ""very intelligent"" person (said by the people around me). What's the problem? I'm literally always thinking about everything in the life, literally everything. I watch ASMR every night 'cause I can't sleep. One of the things that I think the most is about being productive. I know that I'm doing every single time things, but my head doesn't think so. I don't know why, but when I do/finish anything I think: ""I didn't do nothing, I'm wasting my time and my life"". I tried many ways to don't think that, but nothing worked. I need some advice to convince myself that I'm doing things with my time and life. I have always been so ambitious, maybe the problem comes from that, but I don't know.

1278,I’m struggling,"I just joined this thread as I’m finding it hard right now. 

I recently found my self jobless. I worked fixed term (from January) and planned to apply for jobs in April (this is when they begin to cone up in my career) but Covid made that not be the case as no one handed in their notice. I applied for the few positions that did but per position they had over 100 applicants. 

Now I am jobless and living at my mums. She is in financial hardship and needs ‘rent’ but with how bad the unemployment money is in my country (as after rent, bills and debt repayments I would have £40/$50 for food for a month and no spending money). She wants at least 1/4 of my unemployment. I can’t claim extra for rent as I live with family. There is no loophole for that in my country and long story short: if I pay her I have no money and if I don’t we end up homeless in a few months.

My mum and I argue a lot about money as she is so bad with hers money.  I am now sorting out both mine and hers. I tell her how much she has for food (she asked me to do this to help her) and she doesn’t alway listen. She often goes over or about halfway between food shops pesters me about having more rather than prioritising (I give her a good amount to spend a week and it is more than I will have when the unemployment kicks in after my final pay check at the end of the month). We argue a lot and she always end up refers back to me being jobless which annoys me.I remind her what I am doing, how being jobless isn’t my fault and that I am trying my hardest. Her references to this makes me depressed, anxious and stressed and unfortunately a reaction I have to that is an angry outburst. I feel at times like I will have a stroke or heart attack when she is going at me as she goes on and on and never drops it (as much as I hate that I have, I told her this and she hasn’t changed as if she gets a kick out of fighting). 

Even more annoying, My mum needs me to live at home as if I don’t she will be homeless as she can’t afford her debts without my ‘rent’. I’m made to feel useless and worthless by her subtle digs (she says she didn’t mean but...).  The moment I try to rationally discuss money with her she makes it an argument and says I should move out even though she knows that at 29 this is not my life choice! I have a stupid urge I help her and stop her being homeless from her debt. 

Also, even more depressing, I have self published a fantasy adventure book a few months ago and no one is reading it (it’s available on kindle unlimited so free for a monthly subscription) - I been told by the few friends that the story I created is exciting and could be the next LOTR (but in 5 parts not 3). However, I am beginning to feel disheartened as I have no sales or reads and I just want my ‘exciting’ story to be heard. 

I need some advice, care, support, friendly words or anything! I don’t want to talk about it with friends or family as I don’t want to burden them with my emotional turmoil hence why I am saying this anonymously on reddit. I don’t like talking about things like this and I found it hard to type this all out.  Expect this to be hurried as it is so long... 
thx in advance"
1279,Young adult with a sleuth of health issues wants to die by suicide,"hi im 26 and have been sick all my life. hospitalized with bronchitis in the 5th grade, hospitalized again with H1N1 in 9th grade, contracted STDS as a teenager by not using condoms, and then presumably contracted Covid this year while being exposed unknowingly to 3 covid-positive people at work (when they found out, they shut my job down. We were nit wearing masks in February though).  I now have blackened gums, weight loss and stomach pains. Doctors don’t know if the virus can stay in your body, but I think it caused permanent damage to my body...

Oh and I might also have Cancer. A Student Doctor in the ER told me so. After just one CT scan, she prematurely diagnosed me with stage 4 cancer. She gave me pamphlets about dealing with Cancer. she told me to freeze my eggs if i want to have babies and to get chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove my colon. Then days later, 2 Cancer doctors call me telling me that she made a mistake: that all the other labs came back fine. I dont know who to believe. I’ll have to do a biopsy just to double check. 

I’m tired of having no control over my life or my own body. Why does my own body fail me so much? I wanted to be a mother and have kids. I didn’t think that was too much to ask for. But now i dont know if that can even happen. I dont know whats happeneing to my body. My stupid body wont tell me whats wrong with it. I punish my body by not eating, sleeping or bathing anymore. After my teenage years, I’ve been taking verrry good care of myself. No drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Vaccinating myself, doing annual physicals of the brain, heart, lungs. Getting std testing with new partners and using condoms, wearing masks, goggles and face shields once masks became mandated. And yet I’m still sick. I’m disgusted at how nonsensical this life is. Nothing makes any sense. you cant have control in this world. The body limits you. I dont want to have a body anymore. I want to be free. I dont want to be sick anymore. I think getting rid if this body is my only way to be happy."

I just ran 8 miles because I was sad and wanted to get that feeling out of my head. The most I've ran at a time was around 4.5 miles but this time I felt so depressed that I couldn't even feel the struggle of being tired and just wanted to distract myself. I had a terrible panic attack and thought I was going to pass out, and now I feel even worse because the entire time I was just thinking about the stuff I wanted to get out of my head, and now feel 10x worse about all those things.

I'm a big movie fan and I'll sit for 15 minutes trying do decide what film I fancy watching but my mind just won't focus. If I actually watch a film I'll really struggle to concentrate and the simplest thing will go over my head.

It's very frustrating being in a position where all chores are done and I can relax but then my head is spinning.

Does anyone else have this?? And any advice to help calm my mind would be great.

I think it's a combination of OCD and anxiety or something,

Please any advice would be so appreciated."
1285,is this ocd? please help,"I think I've had ocd symptoms my entire life. When I was younger (maybe 8), I convinced myself I was pregnant. I didnt even know what sex was, yet my brain kept telling me I was pregnant. That went away and I was convinced that if I didnt tell my parents everything ""bad"" that I've done, then I was a terrible person. I would cry myself to sleep every night remembering things I did in the past and I HAD to tell my parents. Then I convinced myself that any time it stormed we would all die. When it stormed I had the most fear I've ever felt in my life. It was like panic attack after panic attack. I couldnt even watch weather channels or anything because of it. Then I was convinced my brother was touching me in my sleep, and I had to wrap myself in blankets. After that I had a horrible fear that every time my parents left they got into a car accident and died. Once again it gave me panic attacks, I couldn't stop crying and I'd call them like 20 times. Then it was my sexuality, it was all I could think about. But around 2015 is when it got so much worse. I had CONSTANT thoughts about killing myself. I couldn't think of anything else, it was like thoughts going in circles and it never stopped unless I slept. Then it turned into killing people. I couldnt hold or even look at anything sharp, and I couldnt watch or do anything that had to do with that. I would hide scissors and knives behind things so I couldn't see them, and I could barely do dishes. Lately it hasn't been as bad as it used to be, but its still always there. My brain keeps telling me I'm a sociopath or pedophile. It really keeps me from doing and watching certain things :/"

I've made an appointment for a referral a few months ago and they said they would call me back. the lady told me theres nobody available to talk to me and just gave me breathing exercises to do. i dont like being suicidal but its becoming more of a comforting though recently"

1291,I ENJOY HURTING MYSELF,I'm 18 and I discovered that I enjoyed hurting myself.First i started to punch the wall to get rid of my stress because of my exams.It was hurting me but I was doing it anyway.My hand was fully pink.No1 asked me but my mom because they knew that I had some problems and it was ok.But I realised that I wasn't feeling anything by it.So I took it to one different level and started to hitting my head to the wall. When ever I got some awkward moment or unpleasant conversation I was hitting my head to wall.I'm doing this for 6 months it was OK but now I realized that my head was all purple.is there a possibility that I could stop this habbit by not going to a psychologist.

1293,To much abuse in my life. I wonder if this life is worthy or not.,"I have been having major depression since I was 11. I tried to kill myself couple times during my teenage life.
And I entered marriage life, I can bare with the abuse didn't have anyone in a different country that I moved because I was marrying this guy. Who is a drama king.
I'm so exhausted. I tried to get out of the marriage and I still feel that he still haunted me by reaching out to his friends and told them how awful human being.

I can't take it anymore. Last night, I felt that I should just buy a gun and shoot myself. And be over with. Entire of my life, it seems either people take advantage of me or they would treated me bad. I need to learn to get the fuck out and just leave away from everyone. I'm so tired of people.

Today I can barely do anything. Because my anxiety won't go away. I can feel it that my panic attack is right in the corner or my head. It is ready to attack me when I'm off my guard.

I don't know why I feel this way again. I just so exhausted. What is living anyway? I don't have anything to look forward anymore. I tried so many things to make me feel again. But those memories that make me feel not worthy is still there."

1296,Does anyone else get this overwhelming sense of euphoria that is almost painful?,"Hi,
I don’t really know how to start this but ever since I can remember I‘ve gotten these episodes of feeling overwhelmingly and almost painfully euphoric. It can get triggered by a lot of things like e.g. TV-Shows, Music, Movies or sometimes without any sort of trigger. It feels like this incredibly intense urge to just run or drive super fast and feeling the wind in my hair while blasting music. I think one way to describe it is wanting to do things like skydiving, bungee jumping, racing, just running until I can’t anymore and finding love. But it feels like this uncontrollable urge to do all of those things at once right now. It’s like when you feel trapped and all you want to do is go outside but can’t and it tears you apart. In a way I feel like I go crazy because nothing I do satisfies this urge and It almost feels physically painful and all I want to do is cry and scream but at the same time I feel somehow good and energetic but also awful. It’s hard to explain but I just wanted to know if other people feel the same way?"

1299,I don't think my depression diagnosis is cutting it,"[TRIGGER WARNING: self harm, abuse, suicide]

I'm in no way asking for a diagnosis or trying to self-diagnose. I'm just looking for some suggestions and mutual experiences that could point me in the right direction of what's going on with me.

I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. However, I think there is something more going on, or a misdiagnosis. For some background, I have a past of parental abuse.

Here is a list of symptoms I experience. Some are related to depression and anxiety, but some don't seem to fit:

- Mood swings that occur within a short period of time, from hours to a few days. 

- Overwhelming anger. I typically take it out on myself or my posessions. Major road rage. 

- Self harm. I used to cut myself, hit myself, scratch myself, etc. Nowadays, I fulfill that urge through drinking, smoking weed, smoking cigarettes, or doing other reckless things that put me indirectly in harm's way.

- Overly concerned with what people think of me. I do get very anxious in social situations.

- Very nervous in relationships. Sometimes it's so bad I prefer not to be in one at all. I'm not posessive, though. When I feel insecure, I get distant. Major people pleaser and will try to conform to what they like.

- Issues with procrastination and ""giving up,"" if that's what you want to call it. Instead of failing, I put things off and try to forget about them. I often run away from my problems - literally. I will not respond to messages for days on end. I have a fear of commitment.

- I struggle with body image to an obsessive degree. I will become preoccupied with a certain part of my body and ritualistically check it in the mirror, research how to fix it, ask for people's opinion on it, and try to hide it. I don't think I have anorexia, but these thoughts can affect my eating. 

- I often feel like I have no direction in life or identity.

- I keep a happy face on constantly. I will laugh about traumatic events when telling them to my therapist, or just simply show no emotion about them at all. I cannot cry in front of people and barely by myself. My friend told me I have a very specific range of emotions I allow myself to show.

- I will also have periods where I behave impulsively with money, go see friends every night, am unusually talkative and energetic, smoke and drink, and feel great about life. But it usually lasts a week tops. 

- I suffer from nightmares a lot, and they have to do with losing control, people hating me or abandoning me, or other tragic real-life situations.

- I suffered from panic attacks as a kid, but only occasionally now that I'm older.

- I have severe health anxiety, and often fear I have conditions that I don't.

- I have difficulty focusing, remembering where I placed things, and remembering assignments, etc. I cannot sit through a whole movie. 

- I have taken antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications without much of a result. 

- I eat in large quantities at night, 3-4 times a week, and it's often strange foods. I eat very fast, but don't necessarily experience guilt. I do always eat when my family is asleep, though. 

That's all I can think of at the moment. If anyone has any insight into these symptoms or suggestions as to what I might need to be screened for, please let me know."

1302,Big baby steps towards better mental health,"Hi! I am relatively new to reddit, and I just wanted to tell someone about a step I made today in my mental health. I am a nurse and have had issues with my depression since well before I entered the medical field. I have a master's degree in nursing, but have never used it due to my mental health issues holding me back. Today, I applied for a nursing management job for the first time! I don't have high expectations due to lack of leadership experience, but the fact that I believed in myself enough to apply is such a huge step. Just wanted to share, it's seems like such a baby step, but it's forward progress for once and I am so excited!"
1303,Confused about my mental health,Sometimes I just burst in to tears because I don't feel okay but then I just brush it off because I never like making a big deal about my emotions. Sometimes I'm stuck thinking I have worst problems but I don't want to make it out to be worst. I just have a hard time expressing how I feel and my household doesn't feel like a safe place to do so because I'd be judged tbh. My parents just dismiss any feelings I've mentioned before and just feel like there's no point. I do have friends who I talk to but I don't think I can bring myself to talk about this much because any time I talk with them it's like a distraction for me. Sometimes I think I'm just confused.
1304,Advice for getting out of a low mood and actually doing things,"A bit of back story: 
I suffer from depression and only my sister fully knows about it. I have mentioned it in passing to my parents but I don't think they've caught on how serious I am about it. I'm on medication but can't bring myself to tell my parents as it makes me feel like a failure and I also don't want to worry them. My sister has severe anxiety (and is very open about it with my parents) which my mum already worries enough about (to the point where she can't sleep at night) so I don't want to add to the burden. 

Back to the problem at hand: 
I feel constantly lethargic (I know it's depression being a bitch) but I'm fed up of doing shit all. I accidently sleep at stupid times during the afternoon and then feel guilty when I wake up and realise that I've wasted time. It's got to the point where I'm either not eating dinner or eating at 11:30pm at night and not sleeping until 3am which then makes me hella tired for work the next day and hence the cycle repeats. I don't have much support (mainly due to not wanting to burden others with my problems so that is on me) and really just want to cry and have a hug. I'm just lying on the sofa watching life pass me by without feeling anything. No emotions, no nothing. 

I'm sorry this post has been a ramble, it's literally a clusterfuck of my train of thought. Any advice would be very much appreciated &lt;3



Tl;dr: Depression is a bitch, I'm constantly tired and accidently falling asleep and wasting time doing shit all. How does one get the energy to do shit?"
1305,"is it okay if your parents constantly wish you weren’t born and wish your death and things along those line, when you know they love you and that they don’t really mean it, or is it a form of abuse?","i can’t really tell if that’s common or if i should be worried that its toxic, i kinda dont care anymore since they damn and tell me these things on a daily basis"
1306,So frustrated and anxious that I physically feel it,"Recently, I've become aware of something I experience with my anxiety. I feel like something is holding the base of my spine. I become hyper aware and all physical sensations increase my anxiety. In these moments, I feel like the only way to relieve it is to rip my clothes off and float in a room that is my body temperature with no moving air. I don't want anything or anyone touching me. Not the ground, not my clothes, nothing. Like a sensory overload. I feel like I'm going to implode or explode. Is this normal? 

I have a history of misdiagnosis and overmedicating via doctors using me as a guinea pig since I was 7... So I'm not sure of my true diagnosis."
1307,I feel like I achieved something but I didn’t and I still feel like garbage. I’m 15 btw,"
I had an argument with my dad 3 days ago, which lead to him taking my laptop for one day over a sleep schedule and i got it back, dad gave me advice on my education and my dreams and how to achieve them. I made another post from this subreddit but i accidentally clicked off the post on my iPad and now it’s gone so his is a new one. I feel like garbage. I can’t even do anything in my miserable life and others are doing it like it’s a cake walk. I want to become something, i’ve always wanted to become a gamedev, programmer, artist, and animator, yet i don’t even put the skills and motivation to do it, leading to wasted time and resources. I feel like trash for wasting my time and my parents time, but yet i did something. I watched a Khan academy video on Euclid the father of geometry and i searched the color blue since a quote mentioned blue on the video which also lead me to the color red, but i atleast didn’t go to a YouTube video during the duration of the video playing, i even asked myself if the content on YouTube was advancing towards my education and i told myself to watch a khan academy video. I’ve done so much bad in my life,i recently did something bad on Instagram and the dude forgave me for it, yet i still feel like garbage for doing it. I’ve sinned so much and i feel like the black sheep of my family. I feel like a ugly and stupid person, all of the people at my school are having friends and having good grades and are beautiful and smart. Yet i’m making good grades but I have no friends and I feel ugly as well. I wish i had a friend, someone to talk to, maybe even a group of friends but i don’t and i feel ashamed for it. I hope I honestly die and i should end it, i’ve told myself to end it a few times, but i didn’t. Even through all of the help people have given me, i still haven’t changed. I feel like a useless dude in this world. Even anime characters would be disappointed in me if they saw me. I’m worried about my act/sat scores, i’m scared that i will fail. I won’t even continue my education and others will be ahead of me and i‘ll be behind. Last night after that argument i cried and cried after my dad gave me advice about what to do and how i wasted money and even today he gave me advice on what to do today and starting today and stuff, and i cried last night thinking about those anime characters and how they’d be disappointed they saw me and how i was telling myself that i should end it, also about why i can’t do anything, even asking god why i can’t do anything, yet i still live. I did something bad recently on Instagram which was stalking someone and I made someone else uncomfortable with what I did and they forgave me, now I’m worried that it’ll spread but I want to change myself and not do it again, I feel like going crazy over this stupid thing I did. I’m scared I need help, I’ll get arrested and I’ll be ostracized and I’ll ruin my life and I’m scared please I’m scared I don’t want to do this again. I’m scared. I need people’s help. I need some help on my dreams, maybe even a tutor. Anyway I need help guys, i might not live on this planet anymore. I want to become a game developer, programmer, artist, and animator, been my dreams and i want to improve my grades in school, i need someone who can help me out, on act/sat and my grades in school. No i’m not a choosing beggar, i can’t help myself so i’m asking on here, i’m trash and i will never make it in life. Anyway I have a discord send me messages through dm on reddit and also chat message me on reddit, if you want to help me on my dreams. Anyway bye."

1311,panic attack and weird feeling?,today i had a panic attack while i was driving home. i tried my best to stay calm and as soon as i got home i just completely broke down and couldn’t hold it in anymore. i laid on my bathroom floor for about an hour till i felt a bit better. now it is later on in the day and i have this weird feeling i can’t describe. it’s like i am not inside my body? but i’m insanely inside my head and i keep catching myself staring blankly at things. it’s like i feel no need to look around anymore and i’d rather stare at the wall which sounds weird to say. I’m wondering if anyone else has ever felt like this? it’s not like depersonalization i just feel kind of empty for no reason and i can’t stop shaking.
1312,I don't deserve anything I get,I have been struggling a bit with my depression this past week. School started and I'm not feeling so confident. I am always given things and I always tell myself that I don't deserve it. My dad is always suggesting that he will get me what I want but that makes me feel bad. It makes me feel guilty that he is gone for weeks at a time working so hard and I don't do anything to get the things that I would want. I feel like he feels guilty because I told him that I'm not feeling happy. I don't have a phone at the moment and I've been asking him in the past if I could get one. Now I'm just thinking that I truly don't deserve a phone or anything I want. I am always telling myself that I'm a manipulative person because my dad is just giving me things because he knows that I'm always feeling sad. I'm trying my best to get these thoughts out of my head but I never can. I can be doing something and these thoughts come to my head out of nowhere. They make me believe that I am a garbage person. They make me realize that I truly don't deserve anything I get and I should just hide away and disappear from everyone.
1313,DAE just want to runaway/ disappear?,"It's been something I've thought for years but never acted on. I just want to leave home and never come back one day. Maybe get on a train and travel nowhere in particular. Over the years I've come up with so many ideas of what I'd do, from pretending to go to school but actually staying on the bus and heading to the train station instead to taking my bike and cycling down to the canals where me and my dad used to go for regular bike rides. I just want to disappear. Stop existing for a while.

I don't think I ever will but I do want to."

You 'make up' with me but i still want to run

Ive replayed it all a thousand times in my head

I just take your words
They feel like knives to my chest
I just stand there
Saying....nothing
I know what i want to say
I just dont have the courage

I try to tell you calmly that what you're doing hurts me
You just ignore me
You say 'there's nothing wrong with me, your just sensitive'
You dont know how much it pains me
To think i should bottle up my feelings
Because 'no one cares'
'Stop telling tales'
'Just stay away from them'
'Your just a snowflake'
'Grow up'
'No one cares'
'NO ONE CARES'
'No..one...cares...'

I replay these words a thousand times in my head when i do something wrong
'Its your fault'
'Your useless'
'Your worthless'
Hoping you wont get mad
 if i make myself feel bad

But you still do
You can get annoyed at your work and take it out on me 
but when im stressed at the smallest thing you flip
I try keep my cool
And tell myself it'll be alright

As i tell myself 
'They love me'
'This is just me being bad'
This is my fault'
I have hundred and thousands of memories of me being scared for my life
Cause im worried you'll kick me out or you'll hurt me
I sometimes hope you do hurt me
You do anyway
Just if i had scars and wounds then id have proof of your harm to me
But no

Its all just mental
Im just mental

You tell me 
'You love me'
And i grow to believe this
Until the next time we argue
When everything happens again.

  I feel......nothing......melancholy.....empty, like a robot, no thoughts, no feelings, just......emptiness.

I cant be my real self around you.

Yousay talking to yourself means you've gone mad, then
Am i mad?
I ask myself this alot
Without ever reaching a conclusion

'I love you' you say

1315,What to do when everything is bad?,"I honestly don't know anymore and it seems like everything is against me even myself.

1316,Since a few days I feel like out of my body and away from reality / dissociative disorder,"So first off, this isn't something completely new for me: I have a dissociative disorder and since I've took meds for it for over an year, it barely appeared again. But now it's back stronger than before despite my meds.

It feels like my body and my movements do not belong to me. Sensing contact on my skin is limited - it feels kind of numb. My view and perception feel like I'm far away from my physical body, as if I was looking on reality trough a hole. I blame the heat and my definitely far above average sweating for it, but even with drinking a lot of water and cooling myself down I can't close the gap between me and my perception. It's as if I had a strong fever.

Now I wonder if I should ask my psychiatrist for an emergency appointment or just wait until it's gone? I'll meet my therapist next week anyways and since it's the same facility she can just ask her colleague for a moment to talk with me. I'm just kinda in a state I'm unable to go to work properly and don't want to call in sick... (My boss knows about my mental illness)."

Yesterday, I spent many hours trying to talk my best friend out of killing themselves, and thankfully that's worked so far, but during that whole time, I did not feel sad, scared, or anything, and I kept thinking about how thats not normal at all. I should have felt sad and scared for my friend, since she's the most important person in my life, and I never want to lose her, but I felt zero emotions throughout the entire thing.

1320,Professional help,Hi all. I am a 17 year old from the UK and I think that I suffer from some anxiety problem. I really struggle opening up to people especially my parents (it’s not that I don’t trust them it’s that I don’t want to burden them) and feel as if one day I’m just going to implode. I am a great student so I’m not even remotely stressed about school. It when I go out into public is when I get a truly awful existencial dread kind of feeling in my heart; whenever I feel like someone recognises me or I hear something that sounds like my name. My head starts spinning and I feel sick and feel breathless for a few moments. I’m not a terrible person- I haven’t done anything that would warrant someone coming up to me and doing something so I’m not sure why I get anxious. Obviously I don’t do public speaking (although it is a common fear to do it) but I even struggle when trying to asked waiters at restaurants for a refill or ordering food. I’ll go a whole meal without a drink. This doesn’t sound that bad and I know that there are much greater problems but I don’t know what is wrong with me. If anyone has any advice I would be extremely grateful. Thank you for reading :).
1321,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Cliche but since I can remember I've never felt right. I said all the wrong things and reacted in all the wrong ways. It felt like I had to learn interaction with other humans through years of hard work. I've always moved weird and acted weird and felt weird, and people noticed, so I had to train myself to be normal.

These 5 months of quarantine have felt like they were undoing every single thing I learned about how to be a person. I'm genuinely terrified of going back to regular social interaction because I don't know how to act at all. Now that I dont have to adhere to social norms all the time, all the weird things are showing back up. A lot of the time I find myself doing things like clapping or flapping my hands for no apparent reason. I react weirdly to things again and never know when the right time is to do anything—to talk, to clap, to laugh. My voice is either too loud or too low and monotone. I don't feel like I can even do facial expressions right, and forget about reading them.

I just don't know how to act. It's hard to know whats normal and what isn't. I dont even feel like I have a personality. It's just snippets of things I absorb and internalize and I'm quite literally nobody without them. My personality is just my current obsession.

This is probably just me being ""quirky"" and ""weird"" and I'm just one of those people who are a bit freaky for no apparent reason and everyone has to deal with it, but I really just want to know why I can't be a normal person with normal thoughts and actions and reactions. It's just this constant thing where I always stick out at a weird angle, like I don't fit right even in my own skin.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just suggestions of where to start looking because I don't have access to therapy or help right now, and I likely won't for a long while."
1322,TW!!!! I like to write about rape and abuse in my fictions but Idk why?,"I hope this can be the right reddit to ask this...if not please lead me to the correct one. This is something that has always bothered me so I made an alt account to come post and ask.

First of all I have been sexually harrassed numerous times in my life... but I sometimes still fantasize about rape (usually it's more of what I call soft rape where you don't want it but give in?) however I have never been physically hit or verbally abused.

I like to write stories and sometimes they are pretty dark. The main character is getting abused physically and verbally manipulated into doing things the antagonist wants or is practically raped but gives into the rape? 

I just don't know why I like writing these kinds of things as for a normal person this could be quite disturbing...  I was hoping reddit could help me figure this out about myself.

Maybe I like the idea of being wanted so badly they take control or become so angry? I don't know. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me whenever I read over my stories that involve this. Almost all of them have some sort of forceful action (pinning down for a kiss sort of thing if not close to rape)... 

I also really like to write the protagonist's love interests to be so into the protagonist that they will weep or become angry with people. It's almost like I have a fetish for sad or angry people...


But if I was in a relationship I would not want to be forced or physically or verbally abused without consent... I never asked any of my exes to pretend to rape me or anything like that just spankings but that's literally it...


I'm sorry again if this is the wrong section for this. I didn't know where to ask but I thought if I had some insight on this I could better understand what's going on in my head."
1323,I feel like a failure,"My CPTSD has ruined so much for me and I feel like I’m stuck and not making any progress in life. My friends are all about to graduate college while I’m still in and out of treatment centers. I can’t even get a real job because meds don’t help my anxiety and working makes my anxiety unbearable. I’ve literally been anonymously camming to make money because I can’t get a real job rn and I’m not even a sexual person at all (I literally have sexual trauma yet I’m pretending to be interested in sex just to make money). It all just feels so wrong. When I look back to three years ago, I NEVER would have expected this to be my life. I thought I’d be working towards a bachelors degree and living an academically and socially successful life... but instead I’m stuck living with my narcissist-mother and doing sex work to make enough money to get out of my childhood home. I don’t even know how long it’ll take! I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this."
1324,How to people work office jobs their whole life?,"I don’t understand how people are okay with this “white-collar” lifestyle.

I have 0 interest in accounting and do the bare minimum all day because the more I do, the more work I get piled on. I hate sitting at a desk. I take 3 drugs just to keep my interest in my work: Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Modafinil. When I don’t take them, I sit at my desk and think about suicide all day. I make good money but hate my job so, it doesn’t matter. I get such a small amount of time for myself on a day to day basis, that playing video games or doing stuff that I used to be happy doing, isn’t satisfying anymore because all I do is think about going back to the slog the next day, and starting it all over again.

1326,Didn't have adhd symptoms when i was a kid but definitely have them now,"I talked to a psychiatrist today for the first time and we talked mostly about adhd stuff

I definitely have a lot of the symptoms going on right now that i can identify in myself but when they asked about childhood—honestly i can't remember much of my childhood but I don't think i had the same symptoms back then. I was pretty chill and good in school, never had any issues with paying attention to my teachers.

So the psych asked me to talk to my parents about what i was like as a child. The issues are 1) I really don't want to involve my parents at all and don't want them to know I'm talking to a psych. 2) I'm fairly certain I didn't have any adhd symptoms at all when i was a kid

Does anyone else have experience not having symptoms as a kid? Is it possible to develop adhd in late teens?

The psych said ""we have to establish that there's a history of these symptoms."" Why??? I'm having these problems now why can't i get help for it now?!? Does anyone have more information about this"
1327,What illness this might be? Are these symptoms normal/common?,"If I could afford a psychiatrist, therapist or go see a counselor (my school doesn’t have one) I would. I just want to know what I have. 

I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom has severe OCD though.

For the past 2 years, I feel like like some  people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way, haha. Practicing my religious beliefs? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 
I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost. And very recently I smelled a hideous smell twice in two different places. The first time was in my grandma’s house two weeks ago, I’ve smelled it the whole night for no reason. And the second time was two days ago in my house, again for no reason and it was the exact same smell.

Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. Only people my brain imagines. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder. It’s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don’t take my mental health seriously, and I can’t afford therapy myself."
1328,I mimic traits and characteristics of characters in TV shows or movies when I watch them. It's starting to get alarming.,"This is pretty hard to explain.

I have this thing - had it for years, I tend to mimic displayed thought patterns and characteristics of main characters in movies or TV shows I watch. I don't know why, but it just happens. I lose track of myself, I sometimes even disassociate and will firmly believe that I can think and execute actions as these characters. Be it a detective, a freedom fighter or something more sinister.

It's starting to scare me a little bit, because I don't know what this type of (assumingly abnormal) behaviour is or might be. 

I'm diagnosed bipolar and with general anxiety disorder. Could that have anything to do with it? I'm reaching out to the psychiatrists on here, pseudo or not. 

I'd appreciate any form of insight at this point. I have a psychiatrist, and I have an appointment with him in three days.

I just don't know what to make of this, and I'm terrified of whatever it is.

Thanks in advance."
1329,What should I look for to seek help for my uncle who is showing signs of severe psychosis?,"I am in the US, in Florida.

My uncle lives with my grandmother and his father. Until a few months ago, he was perfectly healthy. I hadn’t visited my grandmother’s house for a while (at best I’d guess 3-5 months) and when I visited for the first time after that break, my uncle was completely different. I’d heard other family members saying that he was acting strange and wasn’t right, but I thought they were just misunderstanding him. However, when I visited for that first time, he was almost completely non verbal only groaning and making short weird grunts; what shocked me the most was as I was leaving, he turned to me from the door of his room, started tracing in the air with his finger in an incomprehensible pattern in some attempt to show me something. He nodded at me and stared me in the eyes and I just nodded back and smiled. 

Flash forward to today, I’m celebrating my little sisters birthday. He’s walking in and out of his room repeatedly, laughing at random times in silence, and making the same guttural grunts, but held out for a little longer. The only words I heard him say were “damn it.” Besides that he is completely non verbal.

I’ve still treated him the exact same during all this, but I can’t help the feeling that what I perceive as psychosis is going to lead to him hurting my grandmother and his father. I understand that’s kind of rude to imagine, but my mother feels similarly and we discussed that we no longer want my little sisters around him anymore because one of them said he bangs on their door and tries to get in their room in the middle of the night. His father owns guns as well, so this is not a good recipe at all. I’m very rarely worried or scared, but I’m very worried about him and what he could do. I’m mostly worried and upset that they haven’t seemed to put much effort into finding him help, and if he’s gone non verbal in a few months, what’s going to happen in another few months?

I have no clue how to even start looking for help for him, if this is gonna cost any money, or anything about this process. I’m looking for any help anyone can give."

1331,Is Mass Euphoria a symptom of Clinical Depression?,"Hello! I’m diagnosed with Clinical Depression - along with other diagnosis - that has brought me to a question I’d like to bring to this community.

As I write this, I am having feelings of massive euphoria. Like, I feel like I’m on top of the world, I’m having an amazing day, and almost a feeling of supremacy. It’s like nothing could ruin my mood and I’m so excited for..basically nothing. This has happened to me several, several times before between 2 times every 4-5 months. 

Then, when that euphoric state ends, I see myself at an all-time low. All of the symptoms that generally come with my disorder tend to linger within those next few periods of time until I end up on that euphoric high again.

I was wondering if this is a common thing that can happen with people who suffer from Clinical Depression, or if this is just something that happens with me. 

Thank you! Any feedback will be taken generously."
1332,I have schizophrenia and my parents believe I’m lying,I recently told my parents I have schizophrenia I have all the symptoms seeing things zoning out easily ect they told me “you know mental illness is fake right?” I haven’t said a word to them ever since they said that I need help. I’m scared I’m alone I’m sad.
1333,Anyone else think they’re faking depression?,"More often than not, I feel like I’m just pretending to feel depressed and numb. I can distract myself and easily switch to being full of energy. Inevitably, I feel sad and overthink by the end of the day but I can help but feel as though I’m making this up for attention. Is this how most people act these days. Do I even have depression at all?"
1334,How do I ask for more emotional support?!?,"Hello! The title says it all, How do you tell your boyfriend you want more emotional support from him? Plzzzz help a girl out :("
1335,My friends keep telling me I'm crazy,"I don't know if this is the right sub. Im on hold with the samaritans but they aren't picking up. I live in the UK. I have one friend who I meet with a lot to do social distancing things with. My other friends don't bother with any of that stuff. They don't social distance, even during lockdown they were going to each others houses and having parties. I was cabin crew for years until March and so are all my friends. When I try and say that the fact that they are still flying means they need to be extra careful they laugh at me. 

One put a post on facebook earlier laughing about getting in a fight in the post office for not wearing a mask. Lots of people underneath where like ""oh so its your fault when we get a ""second spike"" lol, only joking!"" My best friend in the world keeps pushing me to come and visit (we are in different countries in the UK) but he's also not following any sort of social distancing, he's in and out of peoples houses all the time. When I said I was stressed still about covid, he laughed and said ""you must be the only person in the UK still worried about this!"" When I mentioned how upset I was over the facebook post he ignored it, and when I questioned why he was ignoring me, he said ""because I don't argue with idiots."" I have no idea if the idiot was the other girl or me, but I think it might have been me. 

I have lost contact with so many people because I am so scared that I'll learn more of my friends are treating it as a joke. But just walking back from town earlier I saw groups of people meeting up, hugging, not wearing masks. I feel like maybe I am being stupid, and maybe I'm being overly cautious when there is no need to be. 

I lost my job and my partner at the beginning of lockdown. I live by myself. I have no one to bubble with except the friend I mentioned earlier and she has a partner, and a flying job still so she is being careful. (She is also originally from a country that has handled this much better, and she is a bit confused by the reaction in this country.) I am so lonely. I want a hug more than anything else in the world. I feel completly isolated and insane. I am scared to go into shops because I just don't trust anyone anymore, but what if it is me? What if I am making myself miserable with all this social isolation and I didn't need to? What if I could have gone and seen my friend?"
1336,I feel so disheartened seeking mental help,"TLDR at Bottom of post 

So I made an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss my mental illness. I haven't spoke with a psych for over a year.

For context: I've received mental help in the past but decided to stop seeking help because I didn't feel like I was being heard. I have a long history of abuse and mental disorder diagnoses ranging from BPD, GAD, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and Bipolar Depression (I've never gotten a clear diagnosis and every doctor i had came to a different conclusion.) I felt like receiving mental help was a lost cause and they all seemed more interested in cold prescribing me pills that exacerbated my already sensitive psyche. 

Now: So i booked an appointment a month in advance, scheduled to take time off of work so we can speak over the phone and was ready to start getting help again. I had one previous appointment OTP with a therapist 2 weeks prior to this appointment. He was very thorough and attentive and I felt like he truly cared. Fast forward to the appointment I just had. The psychiatrist called me (25 minutes late..i do understand they're busy but still) and we began speaking. I never spoke with him prior to this so he doesn't know anything about me other than what it says in his notes from my therapist. He asked me how I've been feeling, to which I told him about my anger issues and constant mood fluctuations. Not even a minute after talking with me he automatically wants to prescribe me Lithium and something else (didn't catch the name). He went on a 15 minute spiel about how he personally likes it and recommends it and how its been around for decades and yada yada yada. This immediately made me feel uncomfortable. I haven't even been properly diagnosed yet or talked with long enough to get a clear understanding of what is wrong with me and he already wants to throw drugs my way. I expressed to him after he was done that I wanted to speak with someone and get diagnosed first because I've had issues in the past with taking medication and that I take my mental health very seriously. He apologized and said that the appointment center will be contacting me about setting up a more appropriate appointment to get more into depth about my issues and go from there. 

I understand it's a psychiatrist's job to prescribe medication, but it scares me that he was so quick to prescribe me multiple medications without properly knowing anything about my condition(s). He just picked 2 meds I've never taken and said okay so take these, sound good? Even on my after visit summary he just put ""mood disorder"" in the description. Shouldn't he have a more"
1337,How do I ask for help?,I’ve been struggling with anxiety and overthinking a lot lately. I thought I could get through it on my own but it’s been almost two years and has only gotten worse. I want to ask for help to possibly get into therapy but I don’t know who to ask or what to say when I do.
1338,How to tell my doctor about this,"Quarantine is probably one of the biggest wake up call for me. I never think that something isn’t right with me until I’m not distracted by the things outside my home. 

I’ve been seeing shadows since last year, but I can’t be sure when because my memory is a bit fuzzy trying to remember the first time I experienced symptoms. I always think it’s because of my eye sight, my parents thought that too. I have myopia and it has gotten a bit worse. Now I’ve experienced things like hearing my mother call my name. There is one time where I heard her call my sister name and my sister responded, I can tell it’s not them, it sounds distant or a bit far, and one time I heard my father call my name, he wasn’t home. Others like ringing in my ears, unusual nightmares, and intrusive thoughts, etc.

I’ve been researching the cause of this, not realizing they’re symptoms. I could be experiencing psychosis. But since I don’t want to self diagnose I just want to raise my awareness and get help. I told my dad about me seeing shadows and hearing things, and nothing else. To my surprise, he has it too, since he was a teen too. My research was helpful enough to notice the symptoms in him too, one of them is delusions. We both have the same symptoms but not the same delusions. So my thinking concludes that it could be an early signs of schizophrenia, it can be a genetic as well.

The only chance I got is my eye doctor, My mom made an appointment for me to get eye contacts. Like I said, I don’t want to self diagnose so I want to leave my diagnosis to a psychiatrist. 

I don’t know when I go to my eye doctor but since covid made things held back so I know I have some time. I want your thoughts on how can I tell my eye doctor of my symptoms and hope they’ll catch on and tell my mother that I need to be checked for my mental health. My mother is a bit of a karen so I don’t want her to think I’m lying"

This experience made me very sad because it's always been a struggle for me personally to receive appropriate help and an accurate diagnosis. 

TLDR: My psychiatrist cold prescribed me two medications without even knowing what's wrong with me and effectively discouraged me from speaking with psychiatrists in the near future"
1340,Just need to say some more things,"I know everyone’s lonely during quarantine and I know it’s getting back to normal and I can see people again, but I’ve been so lonely for fucking ages. There’s only so much playing video games with your friends can do, especially when you only play one game that you’re bored of and they don’t ever want to play anything else. Honesty I don’t even know what else I want to put here, I can’t get anything into words and I’m not good at putting my feelings into words anyway so yeah, sorry for wasting everyone’s time."

1342,Lost - Self Destruction Seems Imminent,"I'm under counseling and the care of a psych.  I really like them both a lot - more than any other's I've been client to.  But I suffer from issues that even after almost 5 years I don't know how to bring up.  They are astonishingly shameful for me personally, but these things keep ruining my life to the point that everyone's abandoned me but my family - and they can only handle so much of me from afar (and there's literally only two people left everyone else is dead - my mom just died last month and I cried and cried hoping she would take me with her).  I'm 49 and so unlikely to ever make any new friends.  I don't know how to talk about these things with anyone.  I totally hate myself for all my loser defects.  I'm currently diagnosed with PTSD and take quite a few meds, but I've only ever been able to talk about some of the things that go on with me.  I haven't worked in 6 years because I can't, under any circumstances, be around people.  But my psych doesn't know this because I haven't told them very much, and she keeps pushing me to find a job.  I just don't see how I could ever work again.  The last of my savings is dwindling fast and I fully expect to be homeless within a year.  This has literally ruined my excellent professional career and my life.  I suffered childhood abuses but as a young adult thought I had easily resolved them all myself.  I've spent my whole life trying to put a happy face on but over the last 20 years or so this monstrous thing has progressively grown, become stronger than me, come out and taken over my entire life.  I stay holed up in my home all day, all of my appointments are by phone and I have all my groceries and meds delivered because I can't be around people.  The days go by, I've missed the whole summer, I never know what day it is, the only thing that marks the passage of time are the various horror shows that I can't stop creating.  Even if I tried to work professionally again I could never get any references from the people I used to work with (they all hate me) if I wanted to put my resume out there.  Without references, I don't think it's possible to get a job in my profession.  But I'm nowhere close to any sort of condition to being able to be around people to work.  I've tried telling my counselor I can't be around people but many of the reasons for that remain hidden.  I just keep talking about my insane social anxiety and they think that's the biggest affect of my PTSD, but it's not by far.  I used to be a college educated professional who was good at my job today I can't organize my thoughts to even write this simple post.  I'm not married and neither have (nor ever want, children because I don't like the things).  But while I do love animals, I'm unwilling to take on a pet for my loneliness with the uncertainty I face in my future housing situation.  I'm not suicidal right now, but don't really see why I shouldn't be.  It seems like a very reasonable alternative to homelessness and loneliness.  My future is just going to get worse - there's no question about it.  I don't even support personal firearm ownership, but have been contemplating buying a gun.  It just seems like a much better option than becoming homeless, killed in a stabbing because I refused to give up a french fry to another homeless person.  I need the mental anguish and suffering to end.  They've had enough play time with my life.  It's time for them to move along."

I'm kind of at a loss now. The feelings of depersonalisation/derealisation don't bother me anymore. I dont know if I still feel them or if the way i feel is just anxiety at this point. I just sort of feel like everything is slightly alteredz in nightmarish sort of way. But I know the way I feel about those things is a delusion. 

Anyway, I was but on seroquel but stopped after about 8 days because it make me feel super super derealised,  I dont see myself getting my life back on that stuff. My doc gave me abilify, but after taking it once and doing some research about it I really dont wanna be on it. It seems awful.

1348,Being mentally ill/ struggling with mental health is so exhausting and no one gets it unless they experience it!,"Title pretty much sums this all up but if you feel like reading all of this buckle up.

I've been out of work since March due to Covid. During my furlough I've realized the environment I was working in was beyond toxic and making my mental health (mainly eating disorder and anxiety) SO much worse. 2 weeks ago I decided I should finish my degree, I'm 3 semesters away from being done. With Covid everything is online. This was last minute so I didn't know if I would be able to get back in for fall semester and have financial aid/loans go through, but somehow by the grace of God they did. 

So now I'll be taking 6 classes starting next week. My job that I was already on the fence about will never work with my class hours, as well as they had cut me down $6/hour and 10 hours a week. If i went back it would be on a part time basis so that's even less hours and I would only imagine my hourly rate would get cut more too. This to me all wasn't worth it. So I put on my ""big girl"" pants and ended up getting a job at a barn (I've been riding horses 14+ years) and a hostessing job a couple nights a week. Both of these jobs start tomorrow and I'm beyond ANXIOUS and dreading them. I know it's normal to be worried but once you throw in shoddy mental health it becomes that much worse. Everyone in my waking life is like you're young, you're fine, who cares? 

Well I care. A) I'm going to be making a lot less money than pre-pandemic. B) this is all so new to me, while I've worked with horses, never at this barn and I've never worked in a restaurant before. C) Throw in 6 college classes when I've been out of school for a couple of years now. 

It sucks so bad because it's just like to them, oh if you don't like it just quit or just do this or that. Well no I can't just quit one of these jobs randomly because I do need income. And it's so not a good look to just up and leave a job. I'm beyond worried about how I'll manage my mental health in these upcoming weeks and it's like no one cares or gets it. I just look like an idiot complaining about 2 fairly simple jobs, but it's not that. It's the sheer exhaustion, the anxiety, the depression, the barely fucking eating so where is my energy coming from? It's awful and even though I have a new therapist I don't really feel supported at all anywhere. I wish people could just understand that something like this could be hard for me without making me feel like shit about being worried. That's really all. I just hope this stuff goes well because I don't know what else I'll do if it doesn't and I just wish people could be more supportive and understanding :("

1352,it’s the falling in love with my therapist for me,"

I’ve just got married. 
I love my partner, deeply. But I have been going through so much, childhood trauma and all that and we thought therapy would be a good idea for me- since I’ve also moved to be here with my partner. 

Problem is, we have been having a hard time adjusting. We have been lacking. 

I started therapy. Met my therapist, was the best one I’ve had so far. Didn’t even feel any attraction at first. She’s in her 50s. I’m in my 20s. Corona happened, been doing Telehealth. I’m quite literally alone, in another country. Started looking forward to our sessions a bit more than usual. 

Hit me like a truck about 3 weeks ago. I am attracted to this person and that’s fine. It’s normal. All good here. 

The next week, oh god. Nope, this is deeper. Don’t even know this woman. 

This week? The question am I falling in love with my therapist pops up. 

Panic before sessions, sweaty palms. 
Making sure I look snatched. 
I feel awful. I just got married. I love my partner. Always have and always will. This isn’t what that is. 

I think this is transference or whatever that thing is called. 

I am completely alone, my partner is always working- we have severe communication issues. I’m in another country. Literally not one friend. 

Am I attracted (which is normal, I’m a human being- even if I am married) or am I actually falling in love- or is my current situation making me have ‘transference’ as it was? 

Any advice here guys? What do you think? What’s the advice? 

I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like I am cheating. I feel like a creep. 

Much help would be appreciated. 
Stay safe."

1354,Why do I feel incredibly sad/lonely when I do homework?,"For a while now, whenever I sit down and do my homework I suddenly feel incredibly lonely and upset. This can make it extremely difficult for me to bring myself to do homework sometimes. It feels like I'm the only person in the world when I'm doing work, as dramatic as it may sound, but it really does. This makes me upset, and I find myself having difficulty concentrating. I see homework, professors, school in general as threats. It feels as though everyone connected to school, including fellow classmates, are against me and deep down want the worst for me. I don't know how to fully explain the sadness, stress, and anxiety I feel when I study for a test, I don't even have the vocabulary for that. I get all A's but it comes at such a huge price for me, everything is confusing and there are times where I stay up all night just to do well on a big test, and it makes the lonely feeling last for hours. I try to turn on the tv or videos, talk to friends, but it doesn't go away. How do I stop this?"

And honestly..... it kinda freaks me out. Its not just family, but friends to. I don’t know what this is but it’s scary. I’m still just a teen. Does anyone know what this is?

1359,"Opened up to family, went awful","So I’ve recently become more open about some disordered eating behaviors I have. My girlfriend has been really helpful (I’m a male btw) and I decided to talk to my parents about what I’ve been feeling in hopes that they’d offer support and be willing to help me see a therapist. It was basically the most horrible, toxic conversation I’ve ever had. they just yelled at me, told me i don’t have an eating disorder because I’ve never said anything and I’m not fat (whatever that means, boomers), told me how screwed I am by writing about it on my med school applications, and accused me of fabricating my disordered eating behaviors. I was and still am so livid at them, I don’t even want to talk to them. I told them I need space but they’ve continued to text me. Today my dad sent me a text basically guilt tripping me, saying “how long will this go on, a month, 1 year, 5 years???” It’s been less than 24 hrs. He also said how hurt he is, that he wants to be able to talk, and that he thought we had a good relationship for the 23 years of my life (but I’m 24 lol). My dad and I have always been closer, my mom is basically the least empathetic person I know. The only words she’s said to me after the conversation have been rude and accusatory. I feel guilty because I don’t want our relationship to dissolve and I want to talk to them, but I’m also still so angry and don’t want to have an over emotional conversation with them. If i text my dad, I’d be opening the door to conversation which i want but idk if I’m ready for that yet. But if i don’t respond then i just make him more hurt which i don’t want. Idk what to do guys."

But moving on, I feel really sensitive to little things and keep getting upset and wanting to cry. I haven't cried in a long time and I keep getting that feeling when you hold back your tears and you can feel your face going so hot. Right now its 3.25am and I'm up alot as usual which means I have time to over think alot. I can't sleep, its difficult to explain why, but overall I just don't k ow what to do.

1361,Leave of Absence from work,Has anybody taken a leave of absence from work due to mental health issues? How did that work and did it help?

1365,A Vengeful Child That Has Now Grown Up.,"CONTEXT ** We fled Afghanistan and came to Canada as a refugee almost 2 decades ago with my mom and brother. My father died in the sands of that godforsaken hellhole. We had a rough start here and were very poor. ** I can't forgive my mom for what she did to me when I was younger. She abused me and my brother for years and a few years ago, (thanks to me and my brother becoming financially and physically independent) my mom stopped abusing us. She would beat us up and mentally torture every day. I would be beaten for the stupidest things daily (e.g. getting violently beaten to the point of having a nosebleed and a black eye on the day of my 10th birthday because I asked my mom why I we weren't celebrating it, one thing I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR). We were poor and suffered immensely as children. I was violently bullied in school because I was awkward, had no social skills and looked dirty because I was poor. I still remember the other kids laughing at me because I smelled bad and had no lunch. I cry every time I remember those awful years, I would be bullied in school and come home just to be beaten and called names. I was 12 and wanted to die. All I wanted to do was fucking run away. I was so sad and the only reason I didn't kill myself was because of my older brother and a set of dirty legos my uncle gave me as a pity present that I played with all the time. My mom is now an old, frail woman that I fucking hate with every inch of my body and soul. I remember how I wanted revenge so badly when I was little on her but now I can't do it. I want revenge for those years of pain and misery. But I can't do it to her now that she's old. I still have that pain and trauma and I don't think it'll ever go away as long as I don't get vengeance for all those godforsaken years of hell. I have nightmares of my mom even to this day. I'm sorry if I sound pathetic or attention-seeking, I just want the nightmares and the pain to go away, I want closure."
1366,Read this if you’ve experienced physical/emotional abuse by a sibling,"
TL;DR: after surviving an abusive situation, you have two choices: use the pain to wallow, or use it to grow. You have complete control over the decisions you make. 

Sibling abuse is often referred to as the forgotten abuse, because what would in any other situation be categorized as unacceptable behavior is often explained away as a “sibling rivalry.” It’s easy to feel sorry for yourself, and let the pain wear you down until you feel like you just can’t deal with it anymore, but I’d like to share a message that I wish I had received a long, long time ago. 

Just to give you all a little context, my brother... well, let’s just say he left a lot to be desired. He tormented me throughout my childhood, and when I asked my parents for help they would once again start up the, “one day we’ll be gone and you’ll only have each other” speech. Occasionally when they were home and witnessed a diluted version of my struggles, they’d claim that I asked for it when I was just trying to stand up for myself. It felt like no one was in my corner and I spent a long time in a funk. 

As of late, I can feel myself starting to heal and grow from my experiences. The major catalyst for this was finally being able to distance myself from my brother and his toxicity. 

One day, though, while taking a shower of all things, I found myself in one of those moods again, where I was only focusing on the bad things that happened with him and the rest of my family. I sat on the floor and just let the water wash over me as I asked myself why no one believed me, why no one was in my corner, the usual. 

I don’t know what brought it on, but in the midst of my self-pity, I had a life changing realization; I had two choices. If you’re in a similar situation, these will apply to you. 

Choice 1: You can wallow in that pain forever, never find peace, and live the rest of your life knowing that they were able to drag you down and keep you there.

-or-

Choice 2: You let go of that burden, use the pain and experience to grow personally, break the cycle, and drive you toward success - however you may define it. 

You don’t have control over the past, you don’t even have control over most of your present, but the one thing you can control is how you react to a given situation. Don’t use your pain as an excuse to not grow. 

Repeating that has become somewhat of a mantra for me, and I hope that this serves as either a wake up call or a reminder for anyone going through sibling abuse. If you’re going through a similar situation and need someone to talk to, don’t hesitate to message me, even if you just need to vent. 😊"
1367,I'm Going Bald,"I (F34) am going bald. My sister was braiding my hair over the weekend and she said ""Whoa sis"" and I immediately heard the concern in her voice. She told me I was missing patches of hair around my scalp. 

What's crazy about this is she visited me back in June and she did the same thing, braided my hair and no comment of the sort was made. I had her take pictures and show me and instantly started to cry.f

I did a quite google search and learned it can be many things like surgery or a traumatic accident. None of which I have had. I do however have stress...lots and lots of stress.

I've scheduled an appointment with my Dr. Bought hair vitamins and am patiently waiting for Amazon to arrive with my natural hair oils.

Has anyone experienced this as a result of stress? And if so, how did you come with it? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

1370,Advice on how to get the help I know I need?,"So I'm about to start my senior year of college and I've known I've probably had multiple mental health issues since I was in high school. I've been trying to pay more attention to my mental state, especially over the last few months due to Covid-19, and I'm pretty sure that what I've been struggling with for all these years is due to anxiety, depression, and potentially bipolar disorder. I also believe a lot of these issues stem from my family being overly controlling/trying to make it so I'm not capable of taking care of myself (joke's on them though, I moved out over a year ago and I've been doing just fine!). For example, I'm 21 but as far as my parents are concerned, I may as well still be like, 15. I haven't sought out therapy or any medical help because while I know that doctor-patient confidentiality is a thing, I also know that my parents will see any appointment I make or prescription I get due to their insurance (I learned this the hard way when I got birth control behind their backs a few years ago).  I don't want them to know that I've been struggling with all of this because they already had to deal with similar issues with my younger brother when we were little and having watched that, I can't put them through that again, plus at this point, they would see it as an excuse to try and get me to move back in with them. Covid is definitely not helping because while I still have a job (luckily I work at a grocery store), they've been treating us worse and worse as the pandemic goes on and it's getting to the point where when I have a day off I spend it being a potato on the couch alternating between watching TV and sleeping. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
1371,Not feeling like myself,"For the past mont I’ve been feeling... not like myself and I really don’t know how to explain it. I’ve made posts about this before. I feel like I’m reading too deep into this but it’s kinda hard not to. I feel like everything is fake and the whole world suddenly feels foreign. My school therapist said I probably have depersonalization. It feels like I can’t emotionally connect with others outside myself in real life or in the fiction (comics, tv shows, books, etc.) that I usually get engrossed into. 

I keep having intrusive thoughts that give me the chills (like turning into a sociopath) especially since I’m feeling so emotionally disconnected from everything. I feel like I have to remind myself what my interests are, and then my mind immediately goes “why was I interested in that? Why was I not interested in this?” It feels like my opinions on things are gone. Even worse, I feel so emotionally disconnected to the point where it feels like I have to remind myself how I’m supposed to feel about things, but I still don’t actually really feel like I’m feeling that emotion. This is especially true about things involving violence or death, which is making me feel uncomfortable. I used to know when something was supposed to be funny or serious or sad or neutral, but now it feels like only the logical part of my brain recognizes how I’m supposed to feel but the emotional side doesn’t. 

Just a month ago I was depressed over not seeing my friends, (and I was beating myself up a bit for having a crush on a friend who doesn’t like me the same way back) but at least I felt like a person. I can still get frustrated at things if they concern me directly, but I have this intrusive and irrational fear about going berserk or something. 

Nothing makes logical sense, it feels as though everything is a foreign concept. Sometimes I feel like I’m afraid of myself because I have some disturbing intrusive thoughts and some gross fetishy thoughts sometimes. I know it’s nothing, but I keep remembering times in my past when I knew what I was okay with and what I wasn’t. When I knew what my boundaries were. Now it feels like those boundaries are gone."
1372,Coping with being replaced whilst depressed. Please Help...,"I really need help from people. I have almost no coping skills right now due to suffering from bad depression. I really need sincere advice on how to cope with this so I don’t become even more miserable and progress downwards. 

I don’t have many friends. To be specific, I have two. One I’ve known for 18 years and one I’ve known for 6 years. 
My oldest friend got a job as a lawyer, and with a child, she became constantly busy that I only really saw her once a month or so. I completely understand though, she’s very busy. 
It was at this point 6 years ago that I met my other friend. She had lots of spare time and we became very close. I saw her through her pregnancy and basically helped her raise her child. In short, we became inseparable and did lots of things together, with our kids as well. 

I felt happy because I always had someone to talk to, to hang out with when lonely, to laugh with. I really cherished her friendship and made that obvious by being a really good friend. A year ago, she moved away with her husband and kids, but only about 20 minutes away. I knew things would change but I didn’t think majorly, I mean...it’s only 20 minutes drive. Well, almost immediately the “activities together” ended. It became just house visits. Then it became me always travelling to her house. I think she just expected that as she has two young children, so it was more convenient for me to go to her. 

Over lockdown, my mental health really deteriorated. I was crying myself to sleep every night. I also suffered physical pain due to a health condition. Honestly, I really needed a friend, just to talk to....to feel like I wasn’t completely alone. I found that with almost everyone in my life, it was always me chasing after them with texts. This fact made my depression so much worse. So I decided to stop chasing and let people come to me. I had to go through 3-4 weeks of severe depression and no one contacted me. My best friend didn’t text me once. I started going on Facebook and checking on her profile. I found that she had become close with another woman whose child was now best friends with her child. She was putting up all these “loving friend quotes” and tagging this woman in them. I looked back before lockdown and she was doing all these activities with her. 
Honestly it felt like a punch to the heart. What made it worse, is that when she eventually did text, I let her know that I wasn’t ok. We eventually met up and after that, for another 4 weeks no text. Meanwhile all her posts are now tagging this other friend and they’re obviously in constant contact. 

So, after 4 weeks no text, I decided I wouldn’t chase because I’ve been doing that for ages and I’m fed up of it. 9 days ago, she finally texted and she acted like she hadn’t just blown me off for a month. “Hey stranger, hows u? Can’t believe how hectic things have been lately! Been getting kids ready to go back to school. Have you got everything ready?”. I texted back basically saying I was “alright” but I was struggling with bad depression and pain episodes but desperately trying to keep distracted. I explained what I had been up to lately, and usual small talk. I ended it with, “how about you, what have you been up to?”. She’s not texted me back since. 

I feel totally mind f*cked by her. She doesn’t text me in a month, finally texts me, and when I reply, she’s back to not texting me again and didn’t bother to reply. Why did she bother texting me again after a month only to not reply? It’s not like she’s “sooo busy” because she’s able to be in constant contact with my replacement. It’s settled in my head that I have been ditched and replaced and I essentially have no friends now. It hurts. I cannot believe you can tell someone you thought cared about you that you’re seriously struggling and in response they screw with your head and ditch you! Now I can’t get it out my head. I’m hurt, I’m angry and it’s making my depression worse. I cannot heal until I get over this, but I cannot get over it. I’m so angry that I was always there for her in her worst times and this is how she thanks me. How can people just replace people like this? Like I’m just a piece of trash? My mum and others have said that’s just how it is with friends, but if that’s the case, what’s point in getting to know anyone if they will just hurt you in the end? Might as well live as a loner. If that’s how life is, then why live it? It’s just cruel and pain. I already have physical pain, emotional pain is so much worse. 

I’m scared and anxious of confrontation, I know deep down I would love to just text her all of this and go mad, but I just don’t have the courage to shout at people. I thought about maybe something small like....”hellooo? No text back???” Or something. Then I’m like, am I supposed to just let her go and not text ever again? I mean...She’s moved on and replaced me, so I obviously mean nothing to her. 

Please help me, I need advice on how to get over this so I can improve from this depression episode. The more I think of this, the more I think of....you know, not wanting to be here anymore. I have no one, and I don’t want my son to feel like he has to be my friend. We need to keep it a mother/son relationship not friends, but as it is, he’s my only company. I think I would go mad with cabin fever without him. Bless him."
1373,Is it normal to feel like your being watched?,I’ve always felt like I’m being watched but now I do more than ever before Idk if it’s quarantine messing with my head but I feel like people are watching and listening to everything I do
1374,Whats the difference between ADHD and autism?,"Ive been really, really fidgety and hyperactive since a young age. I have a difficulty focusing and i get super overwhelmed really easy. Sensory overload is almost an every day thing for me unfortunately lol. Quarantine has only made this worse and more apparent to me

 When i had online therapy, my therapist asked me if i ever got screened for adhd because my trouble focusing and a few other things had led me into a deep depression. She brought this up to my mom and stepdad and they said they’d talk to me about it. but all they told me is that 1) they don’t want me taking meds, and 2) i was supposed to be talking to my therapist about my depression, not other things

After a month my parents asked me if they could take me out of therapy as it cost a lot and i wasn’t talking to my therapist about my depression as much and “seemed” better. i have a really hard time articulating what i’m thinking so i just said yeah sure so it wouldn’t turn into a big thing with them. 

The only problem is that i never really learned any coping mechanisms for my problems so everyday it’s getting harder and harder for me to stay afloat. I tried googling some adhd stuff to see but the link i clicked on was for adhd AND autism. so i also googled autism (more specifically Asperger’s) because the website i was on didn’t provide that much info on the disorder and the little info i did get on it i related to a LOT. Anyways, i googled asperger’s and i didn’t really understand the difference between that and adhd. i related to both disorders significantly. 

Can someone please explain to me the differences so i can try to find some coping mechanisms that work for me? (Also i’m sorry i ranted it’s really hard for me to collect my thoughts)"
1375,I feel ignorant and naive.,"Ignoring these obvious feelings of extreme sadness or anger or anything feels extremely ignorant and naive. It makes me feel like I’m not “digging into things” and “finding the root” or “trying to understand” I try hard to ignore the things that trigger me into any extremes of emotion, but I feel like I long to be pulled in. I would LOVE to dive into the pit that is these emotions but I know I can’t and it makes me feel dumb as fuck. Like I’m leaving so much on the table and completely ignoring an entire piece of life. Even though I know that the triggers are not worthy of devoting so much energy and brain power to, i feel so fucking stupid. That’s what it is, I feel absolutely fucking stupid to not be paying attention and giving into these things. I don’t know why, and maybe the longer I work to stay away, the chains may disappear, but fuckin christ why why why do I feel retarded."
1376,I have a serious case of paranoia and it gives me extreme anxiety to the point where I start crying sometimes.,"I get paranoid over every thing. If I’m downstairs and it’s dark outside I’ll think there’s someone standing in my backyard or on my deck watching me. If I’m in my room and my closet is open slightly, I have to thoroughly check it out to make sure no one is hiding in there. I turn on a light as I go downstairs because I’ll think there’s someone waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs and when I go back upstairs I’ll turn the lights off but literally trace up them because I’ll think someone will magically emerge from the darkness. I sleep with a night light at 19 years old because I’m afraid of what could be lurking in the dark. It’s this feeling of my stomach dropping but like ten times worse.
 And when I don’t hear back from someone within 15 minutes I automatically assume the worst has happened. I was talking to my boyfriend and the call ended but I didn’t realize it at first until he didn’t respond when I called his name.  When I did I called him back and got no response. I waited ten minutes and called back and did that routine at least 8 times. Every time I grew more paranoid and then I started thinking someone broke into his place and injured him. Then injured turned into killed and then I just got so anxious and worried that he wasn’t answering my calls that I burst into tears for about five minutes. 
Then I prayed, cried some more and then prayed some more and then cried once again. I don’t remember when I stopped crying but I managed to stop pull myself together so I can write this post. I still haven’t gotten a call back so I’m hoping that he fell asleep while we were on the phone. I don’t know why I put myself through these kinds of things or what is even wrong with me to begin with, let alone how to stop myself from doing this."
1377,Is something wrong with me? Is this normal? (TW!),[removed]
1378,Crying and heartbroken over something that hasn't happened yet,"This might just be a ramble, I'm not sure what it is. But I was just thinking about someone that I fell in love with who probably doesn't think of me in that way. I love the fact that they're imperfect, I love that they lead others with guidance and not force, I love when they talk about their passions to share and not just to tell, I love their goddam smile and laugh and I love every little thing about them, whether it's a flaw or a virtue. I find beauty in their mistakes and how they take responsibility for them, their growth over time, and even in their faults they refuse to acknowledge or admit. (Not saying I'm vetter than him, lord knows I've got issues and problems myself). And I've felt this way for years, but I've never been able to tell them because I have a gut feeling that they don't even look at me that way. But my feelings have never changed. Randomly tonight, I just started thinking about what would happen if they died, and I burst out into tears, really ugly tears. I can't stand the thought of them passing not because I would miss them and I want them for myself (which is part of the reason, but not the biggest reason) but because they wouldn't be able to continue doing what they love. They wouldn't continue to share and touch lives. And most of all I can't stand the thought of them suffering, even a little bit. I never want to see them suffer, I never want them to stop feeling happy. I can't stop crying at the thought of them losing that, meanwhile he's probably at home right now not even thinking about me. I'm not expecting him to, but my point is that I'm WEEPING at the thought of him dying because he doesn't deserve it, he doesn't deserve sadness or suffering. I don't care what happens to me, as long as he's alright. I would give everything I could and I mean every damn thing if I could somehow keep anything bad from happening to him, from having a bad day to death. And I can't even tell him that I feel all this. Again this is just a ramble to get my feelings out."
1379,What should i do?,"I need help.

For half of my life i was homeschooled, until recently, about 4 years ago my parents decided to send me to public school because they thought it would help me open up and become more social. Instead, it made me become the opposite. Ever since ive been going to public school my depression and anxiety have skyrocketed and often effect my performance and attendance. My family keeps encouraging me to get friends, but im very antisocial and i struggle with relationships in my family as is, and when i get friends i often feel more lonely than i did when i didint, as i feel none of them really care about me and just use me or don’t pay attention to anything i have to say. I started my first year of high school a week ago, and i already feel as i can no longer mentally handle going to school as my anxiety and depression are even higher than they’ve been before. I’ve been trying to convince my parents to let me do distance learning, as my school offers that currently due to the pandemic. What should i do?"

1382,I don’t know.,"I’m a 19 yo male, and I don’t even know how to explain how I feel, or the problems I’m having. All I know is that my situation has gotten so complicated that I don’t know where to turn. 

I’ve been thinking about suicide a lot lately. I’ve gotten to a point where I would rather die that deal with my issues.

My whole life is just completely fucked up. I grew up in a really toxic environment. 

• I have manipulative parents, that only care about themselves. 

• I grew up my whole like with no social support, and still don’t have any. This is because I was homeschooled.

• I’m extremely socially awkward, and I don’t know how to make or keep friends. And I struggle with the idea about wether I even deserve to have friends.

• I was sexually violated by my mom at a young age (around 11 to 13 years old), as well as put in uncomfortable sexual situations with my parents.

• I’ve also sexually violated my mom (Inappropriate touching and voyeurism type stuff), on a few occasions at an older age (around 15 to 17 years old). Which I’m still feeling really guilty for.

• I have problems with a voyeurism fetish.

• I’ve been struggling with the symptoms of ADHD, OCD etc for I don’t even know how many years.

• I have jacked up teeth from almost never being taken to the dentist in my life.

• I’ve been having some gender identity issues. 

• I have so many insecurities about my body and the way I look.


I’m just overwhelmed with guilt, stress, and past memories that I just can’t get out of my head. I want to move on from my past but I don’t think I can. 

I’m scared to go to a therapist because I know that they will think I’m a freak, and put me in a psychiatric hospital. 

I’m also afraid of people finding out about my past, and everyone hating me for it.

I also feel like I don’t deserve to be happy or to have friends, but I want to. I want to move on, and just never do these things again. But I don’t know how. 

I’ll probably not get any replies to this, but I just can’t keep everything to myself anymore. I feel like nothing can help me at this point. And I’m getting to the point where I would rather die that deal with my issues. I’m just fed up with everything."
1383,Please Help Me.,"I’m (M21) living with my family and my sister (F20) who has Bipolar Disorder. 

To make a decade’s long story short, my family is being mentally and physically abused by my sister who won’t get help. 

It’s been years since my sister was diagnosed with BPD, and my parents are constantly trying to help her. They pay for any medication she gets, any therapist/professional she needs to see, they have been nothing but patient with her. But she has been only the cruelest possible daughter to them.

Frequently, she will harass, manipulate, and verbally assault my mother and father for no reason other than she was mildly inconvenienced. My sister will frequently start a giant fight with them, threaten to leave and murder them, and then proceed to get drunk, high, and then beg to return home. 

My parents have given her second, third, fourth, fifth, infinite chances because -as a Hispanic household- family is of the utmost importance to them. But it’s high past time things change.


TODAY, my family was threatened violence by her and her equally unstable boyfriend. My mother was nearly assaulted, the boyfriend tried to get into the house, and was promised that “we were all going to fucking die,” while my little brother, 10 years of age, was on the computer in class.

My parents have tried medication, professionals, mental health institutes, but as an adult we cannot force her to go. And on her own, she never will. If anyone has any advice or help, please help me. She has haunted our family for years, and we cannot take much more.

TL:DR My family has been emotionally, physically, and mentally abused by my BPD sister for nearly a decade and I need to know if there’s anything I can do to change things."
1384,I think I may have ADD/ADHD,"Okay so, I've been having problems lately that have caught my attention. I've been catching little things affecting my life and it's also affecting my health. I'll write a list of the things I've noticed.

• Cant sleep well. Can only fall asleep late at night. Slight insomnia.

• Can't stay still. I always either have to be doing something. I can ever sit still. This also used to happen when I was at my primary school. Had to pretend to be dead but couldn't stop moving. 

• I always have to be multitasking otherwise I feel uncomfortable.

• I can't follow instructions properly. I always need the teacher to show me an example of I need to see an example to understand fully. 

• Excessive amounts of energy throughout the day and night.

• Very hyperactive.

• I start doing this thing where I put excessive force into something. So if I close my fist, I start clenching harder and harder and stuff like that. Dunno if it's linked to adhd but I thought I should type it in case. 

• I can't finish big projects. Partially because I lose interest. But then when I don't lose interest, I just don't. I don't know why. ADD is my best guess.

• I start loads of projects but don't finish many.

• Dunno if this is also linked to it but I like being freezing cold? It's weird but I just like it. I don't know why. It just feels nice.

If any of you also feel these, please recommend your best ideas for me. I've tried multiple tests online, all came out positive. Says I have moderate to severe ADD/ADHD. Should I get tested?"

I don't think my parents are proud of anything i've done, i don't think my friends are either

but last night i was thinking to myself and saying ""damn i'm treated like shit i deserve so much better"" but now i feel like i deserve to literally get fucking tortured. Why?"
1387,How to deal with the physical symptoms of anxiety?,"How do people handle the physical symptoms of their anxiety? Because I find the back of my chest aches and feels restless and right now it feels like I could explode. Sometimes it feels like I’ve ran miles or that I simply struggle to breathe, and along with worrying thoughts of things that COULD happen I know the likelihood of them actually happening are equally as it not happening but it’s so hard to convince myself of that bc in my head it feels so real."

1390,"I’m stuck: no job, living with my toxic parents, and most of all, no motivation","I graduated university during this pandemic mess into a field that has essentially shut down. Only jobs I’ve seen hiring where I want to work are the CEO types that they absolutely need to function and that I am definitely not qualified for. I’ve stopped applying because I’m tired of filling out applications for the only thing available: volunteering/unpaid internships. And in the rare event something comes up I like, I end up not applying because I physically cannot open the computer (let alone get out of bed). I’ve been told that there’s no shame going into food service or retail, but I never worked those jobs before because the thought of them gives me the most insane anxiety. And like I said, I can’t get out bed. 

I’m thankful I am not stranded during this mess and can live rent free. My family is a mess though. My father is a narcissistic asshole, my mother is a paranoid, complicated angel, and my sister switched between being a saint and a devil every hour. I’m pressured by my parents into doing things for them, most of the time things I wouldn’t mind doing, by being told things like “you have nothing else to do and you’re just taking up space” or “I want to test to see if you can do something other than sleep or eat”. My emotions are ridiculed and I’m afraid to ask for a therapist (but I will be anyway as soon as my damn insurance is confirmed). 

My mental health was improving drastically before COVID. I was a different person, I miss her. I’m depressed and worse, I’m aware of it. I was preliminarily diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I can’t stop thinking about it. Everything I do or think I question if it supports the “theory” that I have bipolar. 

I’m stuck in a cycle of my own thoughts in a cycle of virus spread in a shitty country in a shitty family. And yet I don’t want to do anything about it. 

Honestly I don’t know why I’m posting here. I appreciate anyone who actually read this and I hope those also stuck become free soon. Screw you COVID-19!!!!"
1391,I really can’t tell if I’m exaggerating everything for attention or if I really need to see a therapist,"I’m 16(F)

I’ve always been so shy and nervous talking to people, even family members and because of it I don’t have that many friends since it’s so hard for me to speak to someone. For example I’m even scared to pay in the mall or something since I’m scared of doing something stupid like swiping my card wrong, and so I try to avoid it or go with someone. I can’t even make eye contact with others.

I feel like I’m constantly scared of something, especially death. Sometimes when I do something really bad I get a subtle thought in my mind that because I did it wrong I’m going to end up dying in my sleep as retribution. Or sometimes I’ll get the thought that I’m not going to live long. I‘m often scared that something I do or don’t know about is going to result in my death. I used to not be able to go to sleep early because I’d try to stay up as I was afraid of dying in my sleep. Or whenever I eat something unhealthy and I get an ache on my body I’m scared it’s because i’m going to get a heart attack from it.

But Sometimes I’ll get a thought that it’s enjoyable to lie about this or to have people feel bad about me, but then right after I’ll try to shoot that thought down. I can’t tell if I’m just lying to myself or exaggerating for attention. Maybe I’m a bad person and I’m exaggerating about everything because I want to be unique and I want attention?

This probably makes me sound horrible

I don’t know, I feel so weird all the time for lack of a better word."
1392,Hi I’m 16 and I have a question,My counselor she’s been trying to help me for about a year now but I feel like it’s going no where she knows I can’t really feel emotions but yet she’s tryna get me to recognize my emotions but she just doesn’t get it I’ve told her manny times that it’s not helping should I just look for someone else to help me or should I just stop going I’ve been to counseling before when I was 6 and 10 but every time it does nothing or should I just stay and let her help me
1393,Unsure what to expect from therapy?,"Today I had my first phone consultation with a therapist in my area who I found online. He’s also certified in psychiatry and a bunch of other shrink stuff but seems to mainly focus on the therapy part. I’ve never been to any sort of mental health specialist in any regard fwiw.

Anyways, the call was more or less him being silent to try and get me to spill the whole damn tea on everything that plagues my mind to see what I’m about - basically every reason why I’m seeking out someone to talk to in the first place. A lot of it is insane past trauma so I just kind of kept it brass tacks and told him about my history of anxiety and some recent shit I’ve been dealing with. He said “hmmm... Mhm”

Honestly I would really prefer something more guided. I’ve thought about this shit enough and talked it over in my head for years so it’s not helpful to me at this point to just “vent” like that - twitter is free lol. I’m kind of after someone who can lead a discussion and come to some conclusions on how I can help myself, not just be like “tell me why you’re fucked up - wow that sucks” you know? 

Are all therapists in the vein of “I’m just here to listen”? Should I be seeking out something different? I don’t really get the difference between psychologists, therapists, etc. Maybe it’s just this guy? I don’t know. Any help is much appreciated!"

I don't have a good family situation, and I don't really feel the best rn. I want to talk to a phsyciatrist to really see if I have any real problems, but I feel like I don't and so I shouldn't. However, when I ask my dad, he just kind of scoffs and I think he has that ""all in your head"" idea (I love him, but he is a boomer and I just can't handle him sometimes). I am pretty young, but I don't see what that has to do with my mental health, especially after the things I went through when I was younger. From research, (I am NOT self diagnosing, this is just something a believe I may or may not have. I'm not saying I have it) I feel like I might have avoidant attachment and emotional detachment, I am *extremely* out of touch with my emotions to the point where I sometimes I wonder if I even have them (I have a hard time expressing them and I don't know how to show love to people. Not even my own family, and so I end up appearing mean and snotty to them. I think I might have this because my mother would put me down when I was a child whenever I wanted something, and so the lack of reciprocated love, emotion and caring from from her end made me more closed off so that I wouldn't have to be emotionally hurt by her anymore), and I may have some sort of ""social paranoia""; I don't know what to call it, but I HATE it when people look at me or sometimes even acknowledge my existence because I am extremely insecure about myself. When people look at me, I feel like they are constantly judging me and I'll wonder for days at a time why they were doing that. I just feel like everyone is against me and don't like me, or they don't care. 

Every now and then, I will get overwhelmed by horrible emotions. These are usually stemmed from when I notice people looking at me. Even if the emotions don't stem from front that, I'll go from thinking everyone doesn't like me and they think I look ugly, that leading me into thinking about how much I hate a certain part of my body (my nose, I just HATE it with a passion). That usually grows into feeling a passionate hatred to the rest of myself, and then I soon find myself spiraling and thinking about how much I don't deserve to be liked or loved by other people and how I wish people would just ignore me. That will make me wonder whether or not I will actually be a doctor, because becoming a doctor and being successful is literally the only reason I'm motivated to do anything. Because of how much I strive to be successful and do something with my life, I think I get myself overly ambitious just because I want to distract myself from the fact that I don't really have anything I can call my own. I don't think I'll ever be able to let myself love somebody or have a family. I used to want a family, but now that dream has crumbled and it won't happen, it's almost as if the possibility is so far fetched that I can't grasp it.

I digress, this spiral happened a few days ago just because, on the first day of school, we had a mask break and some dude looked at me. But the spiral felt so much worse and I couldn't even block out how I was feeling, it was so much more overwhelming and uncontrollable than they normally are. I know one thing that bothered me was that it wasn't just a glace, either, he looked from my legs to my face and did that a few times and I feel like he was doing that because there was something wrong with me. What really set my mind off, though, was that he looked at me face and I didn't have a mask on, so he could see my nose. I literally ended up crying silently while trying to go to sleep that night. I have to go to school and see the same kid tomorrow, I'm not sure if I can.

I know I should probably go to my school counselors, but I can't. Because of my situation (the whole custody thing we went through, the fact that we have DHR on us, and my overall living situation), I don't trust them for help. If I went to them, we would probably get in trouble. Also, I think if I told them and my dad found out, he would think of me as a traitor to our family (we only have me, my two brothers, and him. We can't trust anyone else with our problems)

I don't like venting or telling people how I feel because 1. It feels like my whole body shuts down and my brain crashes the moment I try to talk about how I feel 2. Because I know a lot of people my age are saying they have mental illnesses just because they listen to Billie and want attention. I don't want people to think about me that way. As I've said, I don't like it when people acknowledge me or try to show me they care because I feel like I'm undeserving of it 3. I feel like most people don't care and I don't want to burden them. 4. I cry when I do open up (I'm opening up here and I've already felt the urge to cry so many times) 5. When people do show me kindness, such as giving me compliments or just being nice, I usually don't believe them. I only believed one compliment I've ever gotten, and even then I'm left to wonder. When people are nice to me, I feel like they want something.

Even though I don't like venting or talking about how I feel, I'm afraid of this progress into something worse. And that's why I want to see someone so I can see if this really is a problem or is just some teenage hormonal thing.

I don't really know what I should do. I've got a few more years until I graduate and be able to make my own decisions, but it feels like my mental health is crumbling down at a constant rate at which I don't know how to stop."

1403,My dad and his fear of COVID-19 may cause my parents to break up,"Note 0: sorry for bad English, French is my first language.
Note 1: In Canada our social distancing is of 2 meters
Note 2: We live in a region where there is NO active Covid case

Since the start of the pandemic, my dad has a extreme Covid anxiety. At the start it was fine, tolerable. But now he crossed the red line which will maybe cause my parents to separate.

Since the start of the pandemic in my country (Canada) my dad refuses to eat anything made in a  restaurant, not even food pick up or delivery. He religiously wash his grocery shopping every weeks. He refuses to enter in  people homes and when he go out of the house he vigorously keep his 2 meters physical distancing. My grandmother (his mother) invites us at the end of July to eat a cake outside of her house for my grandfather’s birthday and he refused the invitation even if we could keep our 2 meters social distancing. He watcha everything we do and tell us if he thinks that it’s  insecured (ex: one weeks ago he asked me to wash my hands because I touched a tree in the middle of a forest) My mother, my little brother and I were happy at the begging that he has such a exemplary behavior, but now that our country and our family is deconfining itself ,except him, we are starting to think he is crazy.

I think that the redline had been crossed this evening, when one of my mother’s cousin (she resides in the same region where there is NO active case since end of June) decide to do a surprise visit to see us. The two (my mother and her cousin) were talking outside of the house at a distance of 1-1.5 meters when suddenly my dad open a window and ask them to keep a distance of 2 meters (remember that they were outside).

After her cousin leaving my mother comes back in the house and after a moment went cries in her room. I asked her what’s going one and she said that she can no longer tolerate my father watching us all the time and telling us what to do about coronavirus and that we accept all the choices he made about Covid (not seeing anyone, not eating anything made in restaurant, etc...) but that he must accept that we (the rest of my family) are starting to deconfining ourselves and having contents with people outside of our near family. She even said that she is thinking of getting a apartment without him. 

Note 3: my father is a teacher at a secondary school and will go back to school in two weeks where he will have to manage a group of 30 students and mask and social distancing will NOT be mandatory.

All that to say that I’m really scared for my family and my dad. He never had problems of watching or telling us what to do before. I don’t see how he will be able to return in a school with thousands of teenagers , no mask and no social distancing mandatory, if he can’t even stand that my mother is talking so someone at 1.5 meters outside of the house. 

I’m really scared for him, his mental health and I don’t want my family to break up. So do you have any advice? Thing we could do to sensibilise him to the fact the the world start to spinning again ? Is there a name of something for a illness like that ?

Thank you very much."
1404,I can’t tell if what I’m experiencing is normal.,"It’s really nothing compared to what most people with mental health issues go through. I think it began just under 2 years ago, half way through the school year. I started to feel unusually anxious and it got to the point where I’d feel sick from it a few times a week, even causing me to be sick in the middle of the day and have to go home on one occasion. Some days I wouldn’t eat unless my friends convinced me to cause I either felt too sick to or I just didn’t want to gain weight.

Fast forward to quarantine and things generally started to go downhill. I would feel constantly anxious if I had any upcoming assignments or needed to do anything within a timeframe and it would pretty regularly end with me getting angry and giving up on the assignments which inevitably caused me a lot of trouble down the line. Once school ended I stopped feeling anxious really, instead I began to feel a sort of empty feeling where I found it much more difficult to feel and express emotions besides generally things like anger and sadness. Little things have started to really get to me and I either start off angry and become sad in the end or vice versa. Some days I wake up feeling incapable of acting happy and others have begun to notice it as well,

Last week I got into a small argument with my girlfriend which wasn’t very significant but it ended up having heavy affects on me and that’s when I started to get concerned. For about 30 minutes I sat there feeling really down and upset for some reason and then, for a brief moment I felt an overwhelming sense of dread and confusion it’s hard to put it into words but it was like I was going through every negative thought I could conjure up as quickly as possible and it left me feeling terrible for a few seconds and then, suddenly I just felt completely neutral again.

I’m not trying to say I have any serious mental health issues, it could just be something everyone goes through and I just want something to complain about, I don’t know. My life isn’t that bad either, I’m in a happy relationship and have good relations with all of my family so I see no reason why I feel like this, nothing has ever happened that would cause this. I’m not interested in therapy really, I don’t want to put the burden on my family really and I don’t have an open enough mindset to actually listen to a therapist either. I’m not sure why I made this post, there’s not much I’m  willing to do to help myself besides things I can do on my own. I’m just worried it’ll get worse instead of getting better. Or maybe it’s just a normal thing everyone feels at some point and I should get over it."
1405,Got mad while driving and potentially putting my gf in danger.,"Hello,

Recently, I (M25) have anxiety and leads to rage especially while driving. I never get mad at my gf as she is the sweetest and most understanding person. But yesterday, i was driving my gf to get jamba juice. When we are heading home, there was traffic and I got extremely annoyed and my heart beat shot up. Next thing i knew, i was in furious rage and was driving erratically. Speeding red light to red light, turning fast, braking late, etc. My gf was so confused and scared. Asking me “whats wrong? Whats wrong?” I could not control my anger and was completely taken over. After we got home, my gf was speechless. This same rage has also happened the few days before and she seem sadder and sadder. 
After i cooled down, i began realizing the dangers than i put my gf in. I could not bear the thought of her being hurt. I broke down and kept apologizing. She told me to not feel guilty as long as i seek help.

Has anyone felt such sudden rage before? I feel really bad for putting people in such situation, and i want to be more calm.

Thank you"

1410,This pandemic is ruining my life and I’m at the end of my rope,"I just needed to get this off my chest to someone. I know i am privileged and that there are many people in much worse shape than i. I haven’t lost anyone to covid but god damn has this year sucked. I lost my grandma when the pandemic was starting (old age, peacefully) and the same day i learned that my university was going all online the next week. I have adhd and online learning is hoRRIBLE for me i have no external pressures to get classes done but nonetheless i suffered through and even took two summer classes. I applied to grad school for spring semester and I’m so scared that i won’t get in. I don’t have a plan b for my life. 

I lost what was going to be one of my best semesters in school yet, my friends and i were are beginning to turn 21 and the weather was going to warm up soon and then i lost it all. I went home and thankfully i had my bf who i was able to see and we’ve spent a lot of time together these several months. But i fucking miss my apartment and my friends. My friends dislike my bf for made up reasons that i gave them evidence weren’t even true. They took it out on me and i lost the people who i thought i was closest to as they told me i was toxic and horrible. I have a few other friends but i couldn’t see any of them bc covid of course. I’m an extrovert and i live to hang out with friends in person. I’m so fucking lonely all the time and no, Skyping or zoom meetings with friends isn’t the same and frankly i just cancel a lot on people bc I’m losing my will to do anything. 

I lay in bed all day and do fucking nothing. I spent almost all my summer doing classes but otherwise i just lay here and sleep all day. I’ve never been so out of shape i used to love group exercise classes bc it forced me to workout with everyone around me. Watching a YouTube video isn’t the same at all. I picked up crochet as a hobby and that’s helped some but i would trade it in a heartbeat for some fucking human interaction other than my parents and bf. 

Schools starting again next week. I graduate in December. It’s my last semester of college and it’s a sham. Online classes are a sorry excuse for what they used to be and my school is charging full tuition and fees for things that are functionally cancelled like rec sports or the library. The only thing that has me holding on is my one in person class/lab and being back in my apartment. It’s a second home to me and i miss it so much it hurts i haven’t been since April. My class is extremely low risk as there are 6 students and it’s a very large classroom where we can sit far apart and everyone will wear masks. But this is too high risk according to my bf. He is adamant that me wanting to go back to school is immature and selfish. I’m not going to parties or bars or even hanging out with large groups of people. It’s not fucking fair i want my life back or whatever i can get and he wants me to throw it away. I miss my apartment i miss my roommates i miss my college town. I’m losing my college graduation I don’t want to lose my bf in this too. I love him and with all my friends ditching me he’s pretty much all i have. I can’t do this. 

If you didn’t read all this that’s fine but I’m falling apart and I’m losing everything it’s not fair i know life isn’t fair but fuck. I’m so sad i don’t even want to be alive there’s nothing good coming. This pandemic is ruining my life and there’s no end in sight bc Americans are idiots and a vaccine is months if not years away"
1411,I might lose everything,I (m24)might lose everything. I might go to jail over me making the mistake and not quite understanding a law regarding proper storage of a firearm while transporting it and I might go to jail for 10 years I’m supposed to get married in 22 days I can’t expect her to wait 10 years for me. If I get 10 years I can’t see any option but to just give up on life I can’t live without her I could care less about my job or how I look but I just can’t imagine not having her my anxiety is killing me I can’t eat I can’t focus I am so lost as to what to do and I have no one to talk to. Has anyone else had experience planning a life looking for a space to build a house one day and the next seeing it all on the edge of disappearing and losing most of the money in your account I can’t do it when I get out I won’t be back to zero I’ll be below zero I’ll be a felon I’ll never be able to get a good job I’ll lose the love of my life I’ll be worthless I know no one will really read this but I just needed to say it
1412,How do I stop overthinking past situations?,[removed]
1413,I don’t know what to do,"I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me. I feel like I’m lost now and I no longer have a purpose and I’m scared that my habits are going to relapse because I don’t want to be sucked down any of those holes again. I feel sick everyday and miss having a real friend to talk to."
1414,I'm terrified of earthquakes.,It all began when I was in the epicenter of a 7.2 during Easter Sunday years ago. I was in the middle of nowhere in the desert and I thought the world was ending. I've grown up now and whenever there is a quake I become terrified. There was a few earthquakes about 2 days ago and ever since then I can't even be still without feeling phantom quakes at all times. I'm currently laying in bed and I feel my bed and my body continuously moving as if the earth itself was moving. I am afraid and I can't change it.
1415,Everything wrong with me,"I'm a bad person. Let's talk about it. I deal with depression, anxiety, anger issues, body dysmorphia, all the fun stuff. And all it has done is make me miserable and push everyone away from me. My anxiety is fucking awful. Whenever I get into intense situations like arguements, or things in a relationship that I'm not okay with, I back down. I'm so afraid of what they'll say or do that I just back down. And coupling this with my anger issues, it causes me to bottle up my emotions until they all explode and I turn into a complete asshole. I remember when my ex and I had the fights where my anger issues came through. Every angry thought about my life would be thrown at her. I would lash out. I was so angry at the world that I would often forget what the argument was even about. I called her names. I would cuss her out. And eventually I began to take out my anger on her in every argument. She became like a punching bag. Over the quarantine we couldn't see each other and I stopped looking at her like a person, she was just a vessel for me to take my anger out on. I believe that's why she quote, ""Fell out of love."" And I don't blame her. But even now I get so fucking pissed off and I think awful things about this girl. And that makes me a bad person. People will often use the excuse that it's, ""just their emotions,"" when they are toxic. I know this, because I did that. The truth is that I was toxic. I hate myself for it. I hate myself. And I'm such a fucking pussy. I just sit and wallow in my own self pity. My anger and my anxiety go hand in hand. My anxiety causes my anger. It causes me to irrationally hate people who I shouldn't. But I can't seem to help it. It's like a switch flips in my head and I don't care anymore. I don't even have an outlet anymore. I'm afraid that I'm just going to blow up again and hurt someone else."
1416,What kind of emotions/feeling/problem is this?,"I have recently started meditating and am figuring out all these emotions that I go through. One of the biggest emotion that is present in my body is when my brain suddenly feels really dark and foggy. It then starts thinking of something nostalgic or gets jealous of somebody.  Finally, it finishes off with me feeling as if I am very unfulfilled in my life. 

The last feeling - unfulffilement - lasts the longest and is often accompanied by a mild increase in my heart rate and me feeling miserable. I have tried everything to fill this up (sports, study, video games, parties, drugs, etc.).  While doing those activities the emotion fades away but it returns the next day and the cycle repeats itself. 

Some times I can break the cycle by doing something but sometimes it paralyzes me. I end up procrastinating and wasting my time rather than doing something productive. 

Ergo, my question to you is what kind of emotions/feeling/problem is this?

**Note:** I am 17 Male. I have had a very good childhood and I perform quite well in school.  I am decently popular with a solid group of friends.

However, a minor issue is that I have nobody with whom I can confide my sad emotions. I will gladly give them all my passwords and stuff but I just cannot open up to anybody emotionally (like crying, stating my worries or saying I am sad). 

This is mainly due to the fact that many will just tell me to be to stop being such a sissy. Also that I hate feeling weak as is what I have often been seen as - only jokes from family members and friends and stuff, however, I have never been bullied about it. 

I have tried to do that in front of my parents - express my worries -  but I get a bit judged and feel very vulnerable, so I stopped.

**PS: I know all of it this is just a simple chemical reaction in my brain but I just a bit more definite answer into a problem. and I will delete this post if it breaks a rule.**

1417,How do you you know your depressed?,"I've been thinking about this for a while because some time ago my grandma asked if I wanted to talk to a therapist and possibly get anti-depression meds, this seemed out of nowhere to me I didn't think I was  showing depressive symptoms.

1421,Can anyone relate? Need some direction.,"Let me preface this by saying I have anxiety linked with my bipolar disorder.

Personally, I’ve always been afraid that my subconscious thoughts while under stress come out of my mouth without me knowing it. Never when I’m alone (typically talk to myself when alone so nothing out of the ordinary there), but when I’m in public. I’ve never thought myself to have social anxiety, but that could be the case.

Recently I started a new job working in a kitchen. All and all the job has been fine, but in some moments I feel a lot of stress. I’ve developed skills to help me manage that stress to let go of it, but in those moments of stress I worry I might be saying things (mumbling) that I believe I am just thinking to myself. I’ve caught conversations that have arises between the kitchen staff (there’s three of us in total) that lead me to believe I might have said something aloud, because that conversation the other party is having would not arise unless something was said to bring up said conversation.

Another part of me questions if it’s my own anxiety fueling a fear that I have. I’ve never been a part of these conversations that lead me to believe I could have said something, and when I ask my sister (she also works with me) if I said anything to provoke a statement she has said out of nowhere in relation to something I was thinking (possibly mumbling aloud due to stress the stress I was currently under) she declines (she’s also an empath so she could just be picking up on things).

I’m sure this is all hard to follow, especially with the parenthetical statements. My biggest question here is has anyone else ever experience something like this? Where something they think comes out of their mouths unknowingly? I’ve tried doing some research on cognitive studies about the topic, but I’ve been unable to find anything. This, for me, feels like a shot in the dark. I truthfully could be over-analyzing the whole situation I’m facing, but something in my gut tells me I’m on the right track here.

This is hopefully something I can work through upon understanding it more, but right now I’m grasping at straws. Any information about this topic would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time reading this."
1422,I need some help figuring this out.,I was venting to my girlfriend earlier when I realized something. I really do feel like I have multiple conflicting like...l personalities. Not like DID but more like I feel like i just have so many days where I wake up and feel like God and others where I'm so weak if someone looks at me dirty id collapse. Sometimes I wake up and love everyone and every thing I see and others I despise the world and everything in it. Sometimes I want peace and calm constantly and other days I'll snap at anyone for the chance at a fight. Some days I'm passive and others I'm aggressive. And the problem is... none of these feelings feel wrong they all feel like me. I've always just assumed I've had depression and nothing else so I don't know what this may be. I'm not too sure about bipolar cause I have friends with bipolar and they don't seem to act like me. If you have any idea as to what this may be please leave me a comment. Thanks.
1423,Dead or Destitute,"Hello,

I'm kinda rampantly posting due to the distress I'm feeling. I call numerous hotlines and centers to no avail of my worries. To preface before continuing this; I'm twenty, my family abused me and I ran away at 15 to my half-brother's place, he held me in contempt and kicked me out at 18, I was homeless for a month and stumbled into the comfort of an air mattress of my best friend's mom's apartment. I've been in a never ending bout, a wrestling of melancholic thoughts incessantly pervades my mind. Do I continue to fight, lose time and soul for a dream which is locked behind the assumption that the light I've provided my tunnel is both attainable and not complicit with my faults, or do I just give it up? 

I want to move on to my prospective four year from my two year, to provide service to my country (mostly bc the economic incentive to afford college), and to fulfill the career goals I've posted to my life. 
I'm tired of dreamers and want doers, I'm tired of pinhole lights in tunnels and want stellar masses of hope, I want restitution not destitution, I want Lazarus like resurrection not death.

What is there to be done?"
1424,Out of antidepressants and now I feel like I'm going to spiral,"I dont have money to continue going to my expensive ass psychiatrist. I thought I had one more refill but I didnt so I was forced to stop cold turkey. I thought I was doing better but now I'm not even sure if I am worth the dirt off my shoes. I dont know what to do. I can tell that I'm going down a dark path and that I'm sabotaging my relationships but I dont know how to stop myself. I was feeling so confident about what I wanted with my life. What the fuck is even happening right now? Am I going through withdrawals or was I never getting better in the first place? I dont know what I expect to gain from this, someone help me please."
1425,First post. Hope it isn't downhill from here.,[removed]
1426,"I dont really understand much of what im going through, kinda need some open opinions/advice as to what im going thru?","So, my homelife... I grew up in a cult as a bisexual man. 

The cult is Jehovahs Witnesses; I dont mean to shade them... I just dont enjoy the feelings of loneliness, sadness, depression, anxiety, and detachment from everything. 

I recently decided to end my attendance at the meetings, but that choice has consequences; I lose my social web. To be frank, if you dont know, you’re only encouraged to talk and make friends with people inside the cult, nobody else. 

So, I feel empty. I feel sad. Relieved to be free— but a piece of my identity is just— gone? I dont know who I am anymore and im trying to figure it out. I still try to avoid any contact with them or any action that ties me to them. I just— dont feel right.

I keep zoning out, cant connect to people, have a fear that people are against me... hard to make friends. I have a huge gap in my life and I no longer feel adequate, to say the least. 

I have a boyfriend, he has been an amazing coping partner and amazing person all together. I wouldnt trade the world for him. lol, im just in my room crying like a baby!! He’s amazing and I know he’s the one ill marry. I dont see nobody else that fits perfectly like he does. 

Back on track— I never feel enough tbh. Even though, deep down, I know I am. I just feel I need to put forth more effort into things because I never meet my status quo; essentially, I’m being hard on myself. 

I’ve always been like this. I also experience no feeling of emotion, then an extensive flux of emotion... mostly sadness. I do feel happy, trust me.. I just cant exactly pin point the feeling properly unless im with my boyfriend. 

I also have dealt with a lot of the negative things by disassociating myself from the situation; I turn into a completely different person??! I just dont think— my mind is completely blank and I become a robot. 

I’ve noticed some things at work; when my boss yells at me or accuses me of things that I have no control over.. I either take it and apologize profusely or i’ll give it to him about how he is in the wrong and I had nothing to do with the situation at hand. 

My mood also changes at work depending on the day; im extremely social or ill be quiet and appear to be mad. Depends on context. 

Anyhow, I’m confused and looking for examples or experience?? It’s quite confusing to me and I cant grasp the situation. 

TL;DR - I basically was born into a cult, grew up as a gay man where I was oppressed. Felt all sorts of emotions and negative consequences. I have left the cult since and lost my social web. I have a boyfriend thats a good aid in my healing. Leaving the cult has left me empty and hurt. No clue what im dealing with. Any help?"
1427,Just got home from the Dentist. I have to lose all of my teeth.,"So, first things first: I'm a paranoid Schizophrenic.   


I'm irrationally afraid of (almost) everything in my day to day life. One of those things is Dentistry. But, today, I managed to suck it up and make an overdue trip to the Dentist.   


I have to get every single one of my teeth pulled, and I will be wearing dentures for the rest of my life.  


I'm only 17.  


I honestly don't know how to perceive and handle this. I had a massive panic attack in the car, and a severe Schizophrenic episode when I got home. I'm absolutely terrified, and really, really, really need reassurance. Please help me."
1428,I realize this isn’t as major as other posts on here but,[removed]
1429,I was diagnosed schizoaffective not too long ago and I’m having a hard time understanding my illness,"If it’s even a real thing? I don’t know, there are times where I don’t hear voices. Almost a whole day and I go “see it’s not real, I’m not Ill I’m ok.” And then a vision or nightmare will pull me back into a psychotic episode and it’s just so confusing. I’ll try to explain as best I can. Please let me know if you experience something similar so I don’t feel completely lost and hopeless.

So I don’t really remember much of what happened but about a month ago I was in a very bad spot. I was hearing things every day and it would last a majority of the day. I would often stare blankly and just listen and experience an onslaught of emotions and memories and thoughts. It was rather difficult to articulate as I would just think and thinking was mentally draining so my speech suffered I guess. Then about 2? Maybe 3? Days ago I put myself in the ER and talked to people just fine. Was not hearing anything I was very lucid. This lasted until yesterday afternoon. 

I was taking a short nap before I had to go to work and I put in my headphones. I was dreaming and a song I never heard before was playing. It was Purity by asap Rocky and frank ocean. In my dream I was back home with friends listening to the song. I wanted to stop listening to music so I took my headphones out. Uhhhh there’s still music playing? I tried to turn down my volume. I see it go down but the music is still playing. I speak but there’s no noise. Just the song playing, crystal clear and loud. I scream and I still can’t hear myself. Everyone looks at me. I start to google, “why can I still hear music if my phone is off” and I scroll through and there’s nothing of use. I tried restarting my phone while crying because I want the song to stop so bad. Nothing is working. I scream so hard that my through starts to burn but still nothing. I’m crying harder and I lie down on the floor hoping for the song to end. It does. 

And then another song plays and I realize I’m trapped. I want to get out of this hell, I’m being tortured. I run outside and it’s night time. I look and see an old friend outside and to my right is a gas station. This makes no sense, you’re not real. And I wake up to the song that’s playing. I think, “fuck I’m still dreaming” but my air pod fell out Of my right ear. It always falls out so now I know I’m real, this is real life I’m not dreaming. And I sit down just broken.

I cried. That dream felt too real it was really scary. And the whole day that same song is playing in my head. Even right now. It’s like a joke. It’s taunting me. I’ve been drifting all day and just staring, thinking about the dream as the song plays over and over in my head. It makes me rather sad. People asked me today about 50 times “Hey, are you ok?” I just say I’m fine. I don’t know if the schizophrenia is playing off the depression but it’s been really making me sad. The song that gave me a very real vivid nightmare is almost sadistic but welcoming. Like it’s saying it’s ok to let go. Don’t fight. Give up. 

I don’t know if I just had a bad nightmare or if this is confirming my illness. I’m having a hard time dealing with the diagnosis. I want to think they’re wrong but these dreams and visions and voices pieced together from music and tv just taunt me. I’ve been internally suffering for quite sometime now. I can’t really speak to anyone. I try to explain and they just don’t get it. I can talk to a therapist but they don’t comfort me, they just make sure I’m not a danger to myself or others. Nobody understands me, I’ve never felt truly alone before in my life but this, this is loneliness. It’s just me and my mind. The only 2 things that make sense in this world, and nobody understands."
1430,SSRI sexual effects,"So i've been on serouquel, lexapro and lamotrigine for a couple years or so. But I'm starting to have sexual issues more commonly now and it's starting to make me more depressed, pretty much I have no libido and when I do I rarely have an orgasm. Is there anything I can do to combat it or do I just ride it out."
1431,"I know I need help, but fuck I'm scared","I know I need to pe put in a mental hospital or get a therapist or something,  but I'm fucking terrified of adults and I know I won't be able to handle it. I wish I wasn't so messed up. I just want the pain to end"

1435,Should I take anxiety meds?,"I have diagnosed anxiety and possibly undiagnosed depression. I haven't seen my therapist in almost a year but I'm thinking about going back bc my mental health has taken a turn for the worse after being in lockdown with my family for 3 months. My anxiety, which before lockdown, was only triggered by doing something I don't really do that often, is now beginning to affect my daily life. I overthink social situations, I have paranoia about being safe in my house, despite living in a nice neighborhood, and my stomach feels shitty every morning just to name a few symptoms. I have thought about taking meds but I’m hesitant because of the way other people describe them. From what I’ve heard, they significantly reduce your sex drive, and almost make you feel like a different person. Even though I’m not really happy with who I am now, I am still afraid that the meds will keep me from being myself or that it will seem like I’ll end up watching myself while someone else is in control. Are these valid concerns or is it just anxiety?"
1436,I get so hard on myself that I'm scared to try anything,"(tw: mentions of suicidal thoughts and self harm!)

Hello! I've been trying to discuss this topic with my counselor my past 3 sessions but they keep brushing it off??? So I'm gonna talk about it here lol.

SO, I'm currently attending my local art college for a degree in character design and animation (I'm going into my 4th year this fall). And despite having a fair amount of success, like honour roll, consistant As, and having an animated short play at film festivals, I am still ridiculously hard on my self, to the point that I am afraid to try anything new with my art because of what I might do. I noticed this started in my first year (which is notoriously tough for everyone interested in character design and or animation because of the insane workload and second application process to even get in), where I would get so critical of myself to the point of self harm or suicidal thoughts. For example: multiple times I cut an art board a quarter of an inch off of what the measurement was supposed to be and I would point the x-acto knife at my wrists, debating if I should kill myself right then and there, or hitting myself for getting a drawing slightly wrong, or blaring really loud static noise in my ears to the point where I'd get a headache just to make myself work faster. I constantly felt like I needed to be punished for my mistakes and these """"techniques"""" would help me be a better artist. My mom told me a couple years later that she didn't recognize me for almost that entire school year because of how much my personality changed. I never use to use self punishment before that year. And I honestly did feel like a different person? I remember thinking of myself in the third person sometimes, like ""NAME needs to be punished because she did this wrong"". And as I got into my second year of my program, I started to get better with allowing myself to make mistakes, but it's really hard to judge if and when I'll slip into that old mindset - it seems almost random what will trigger the cycle of self punishment. I am currently on anti depressants, which have helped, and I haven't had a episode like this since November, but I've been paralyzed ever since my first year of art school from trying new things with my art and actually enjoying the process. I haven't drawn in months because I'm scared that other side of me will emerge, but drawing is really all I have and is what I'm trying to get a career in so... idk what to do. It honestly does feel like that mindset is a different person in my head and I'm kinda scared of her lol!

Thanks for reading! I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just somewhere to vent, but feel free to comment if you've experienced anything similar or you have any suggestions. :)"
1437,Relationships,"At what point does one just walk away? Knowing your heart will be crushed, but still holding out hope? Knowing what is probably best, but just that sliver of hope, maybe?"
1438,I've been constantly angry for the last few days.,"I've been getting bullied online for the past few days, obviously, I blocked them, but they kept making new accounts to call me things, to the point where I just had a continuous stream of ""faggot"" if I looked through. I tried messaging them, telling them to stop, but they just claimed it wasn't them. (It was, I contacted support and they said it was coming from the same IP). From there, they proceeded to use inspect element to edit those messages that I sent and sent them to all my friends.

My friends have pretty much ghosted me at this point, and I've just been sat around fuming for the last two days. It just doesn't stop. I sit there and watch YouTube, something I don't do very often at all, but I do it all day, just still seething. I usually do exercise to take my mind off stuff, but it is still in the back there. Sometimes I play video games for fun, but playing them just reminds me that I don't have any friends to play with anymore. I honestly don't know what to do here. I feel like I've been completely robbed."
1439,Seeking professional help is incredibly difficult,"It took a very long time for me to be able to get any kind of professional help with my mental illness. In fact, it took one of the worst breakdowns of my life for my mother to even consider letting me see anyone. I'm grateful she did, and I know this is something I need, but damn it I can never say out loud anything that I know needs to be said.

Everytime I'm in therapy, I can never speak first. And even at the end, when the therapist asks if there is anything I want to talk about and discuss or any other concerns, I freeze and end up just shaking my head even if I desperately want to say something. Same thing with my psychiatrist. I'm fine with telling them I have a horrible sleep schedule, I'm fine with telling them what I've been doing the entire week, and I'm fine with saying ""yes"" when they ask if I've been feeling down lately. But that's it, and it frustrates me so much. I physically cannot bring myself to tell them the reason for the horrible sleep schedule, and times when I break down during the week and end up harming myself, and I can't even elaborate on ""feeling down"". I know this shit that I fail to say screws up the treatment they give me, but I've tried time and time again and I can never tell them.

I hate it so much. I do have some kind of social anxiety, talking to professors and other people with authority makes me want to jump out of my skin, but I can talk to other people just fine. I can be friendly with strangers, I know how to make friends, I can order my own food and call to make my own appointments and I can call the bank when I'm having problems with my debit card but god forbid I tell my therapist and psychiatrist any of the important shit. I know I can't get better if I don't tell them what's wrong but I can't tell them what's wrong.

I feel like I just can't be honest about these kinds of things. I could be so depressed that my chest hurts but I would still join my family for dinner and have a ""pleasant"" conversation with them even when my face feels numb and my voice feels faraway. I could be furious, but I would still play video games with my friends, laughing and smiling and joking even when I can feel myself bristling in anger. 

The online sessions with my psychiatrist are expensive and I feel like I'm just wasting money when I don't tell them what's wrong, and I'm having second thoughts about scheduling another one this Saturday. I could just type it, which is so much easier, but I can't do it when the other person can see my face via webcam, or if I can hear their voice and see their face. 

Just. Needed to get this out. If I can't talk about this with other people I might as well vent on the internet lol. Have a great day. 

TLDR - Therapy sessions suck when you don't say what you have to say and I am the embodiment of pent-up everything."
1440,I hate being young/hated being a child and I have no idea how to handle the negative implications of that.,"I’m in my late 20’s. Whenever someone gives me advice because I’m young or worse assumes I don’t know something because I’m young my self esteem just gets trashed. It’s not that I hate advice or something it’s that I have a lot of guilt about being young. I feel like culture constantly berates younger people/my generation as incompetent, lazy, you name it and internalize it as fact about me personally too easily. I also HATED being a child. I hated the feeling that I couldn’t make decisions about a lot of things and genuinely look back on my childhood with sadness. I also refused to act like someone typically would in the early 20’s, partying ext because I was too afraid of judgment surrounding coming off like a “stupid 20-something”. Even in my late 20’s though I feel too young and can’t shake that means I’m worthless and useless. I can’t find a lot of resources on stuff like this so I’d love some (solicited) advice."

I feel like my life is so fucked up for having such a toxic and abusive parents and that there's lots of necessary things that I'm missing out as a kid, teen and young adult. It's so hard for me to deal with them especially during this pandemic where I'm forced to stay with them 24/7. I just wish that I'm financially stable that I don't have to deal with them anymore. I kinda feel like the reason that I have to deal with anxiety, depression and the lack of social skill I have are mostly caused by them. I really wish that I was born in a different family like other people that I see."

&amp;#x200B;

I am chronically suicidal, always thinking about how and when to best kill myself. That being said, I have been house sitting for my sister who, as far as I last knew, keeps a gun in her house. I have been fixated on this fact, but have resisted the urge to look for said gun. It would finally be SO easy to off myself versus the ways I have tried in the past, but for some reason I have been able to keep myself from searching out the weapon. This is HUGE for me."

1446,How to turn off the constant internal dialogue that perpetually reminds me that I’m going to die and that I could die at any time?,"My mind never seems to run out of possibilities for how I’m going to die. Fires, airplane turbulence, serial killer, earthquakes, shark attack, cancer, nuclear war... and those were all just tonight. I am either thinking of all the ways I could die, or trying, unsuccessfully, to control these thoughts- but everyday the same thoughts creep into my brain. It makes it really hard to enjoy ANYTHING when I have this voice in my head constantly telling me that I’m going to die and it could happen at any moment.

I finally stopped having panic attacks when I think of how death is inevitable, but my brain is still hyper-focused on all the ways I could die and that I have no control over when I die. And it’s like that all day, everyday. There isn’t an activity that gives me respite from these thoughts- if I read a book or watch a show/movie, I just think about how everyone in the book/show is going to die and so am I. Social media is the worst because it’s all just bad news that makes me think the world is going to end. Doing things like painting or puzzles just gives me more time to think about my mortality. If I hang out with friends or family, again, I’m just thinking how we’re all going to die.

To put it simply, I cannot have a single thought without relating it back to death. It is mentally exhausting. I want to experience and enjoy life without the constant negative voice in my head. I’ve basically accepted my mortality, but the thing that keeps the mental cogs rolling is that I don’t know when so I try to figure out how much time I probably have left and all the ways that that time could be cut short. I’m rambling, but I think you get the picture. It’s never ending and exhausting.

Does anyone else have this problem? Any coping techniques that work for you?"
1447,Impending doom,I have a feeling like I'm going to die soon. I have OCD  and depression. Idk what to do. I am afraid to leave the house. My sister starts work next week and I'm afraid she will get COVID and pass it to everyone. I was prescribed pills but am too afraid to take them. Idk what to say to anyone. My psychologist said not to worry about COVID but it's hard not to when people are dying. And if they don't die they still have long term issues. No one knows if they go away or not. I quit my job last month because it was taking a toll on me. My boss mocked my for being worried about this. He threatened to fire my coworker's and I. I feel ridiculous.
1448,Motherly Advice,"I (25yoM) am looking for any resources, ideas, or insight that this community may have for my mother (46yoF). She is currently in a manic state, having visual hallucinations, and extreme paranoia. We are from a lower income area in the Southeast (Etowah County, Alabama). I feel as if a lack of education and the stigma of mental illness in our rural hometown have contributed to her decline. I am a nurse, so I have a general knowledge of some of her conditions but I have never spoke with her psychiatrist or general doctor so I do not know her exact diagnoses. Here is what I do know. She has a past medical history of anxiety, obesity, smoker, poor oral health, polysubstance abuse (marijuana, acid, meth, cocaine), childbirth (me), bipolar disorder (apparently old MD told her this so she changed MDs). As far as I know, she hasn’t used illicit drugs since 2003 or 2004, but she has abused painkillers and anxiety medications consistently through my childhood until now. She has two suicide attempts. One was an intentional overdose (2000ish) and the other was an anger driven, unintentional wrist cutting (2013ish). I do not remember the first, but I know she was committed to a psych hospital the second attempt for a few months. Her and my father are currently jobless/without insurance and live with my grandparents (her parents). From January-May of this year she seemed to be functioning better than she had in the past 5+ years. Her med list then was 10mg Methadone QID, 1000mg Metformin BID, 30mg adderall BID, 15mg Abilify daily, maybe an antidepressant as well. In June, she decided she did not need the abilify (a reoccurring thing the past few years) so she stopped taking it without telling her psychiatrist. At her next visit she told him she was fine being off the abilify and he changed her to keppra unknown mg and 30mg time release adderall. After ~ a week she stated she didn’t like the way keppra made her feel so she called her MD back, and he changed her to abilify 2mg daily. Since then (approximately 3 weeks ago) she has had visual and tactile hallucinations (believes there are bot flies in her skin and scalp), heightened paranoia, mania (didn’t sleep for 48hoursx2), and as of today she has shaved her head completely. My father has tried reaching out to her psychiatrist for a week as of today and heard nothing back from his office. I was hoping to have her medications reconciled to what they were before and try other therapies to help the medication too (something she has never tried). I’m hoping for that to happen instead of her being admitted to the hospital, but I feel as if that is becoming less likely daily. Also, any educational resources for family members would be appreciated. I’d like to attempt educate my father and grandparents because they have a poor understanding/outlook of mental health. Thank you in advance."
1449,The world needs more people like Darcy,"(in highschool)

I was sitting in woodwork class on Wednesday and the boy next to me starts crying as he realises he's messed up a section of the project. Me and a friend named Darcy went over to make sure he was ok. The boy explained that he had messed up his project and was overall having a hard time mentally over the past few days.

Immediately Darcy marches off retuning moments later with a hammer. I explained that he should check his priorities if he's not going to help. Darcy laughs in response while slamming the hammer into a ruler before going off to the teacher saying ""he needs help because the ruler he was using is f#cked"".

Teacher takes one look at the crying kid and the bent ruler before yelling ""WHY DOES THE SCHOOL THINK THIS IS ACCEPTABLE EQUIPMENT FOR A WORKSHOP!?!?"". He then takes the ruler away and spends the lesson comforting him and helping him with his project.



Both Darcy and the teacher are the kind of people we need more of in the world.



The world needs more people like Darcy."
1450,Anyone else ever feel the weight of every mistake they ever made in their life suddenly come crashing down all at once?,"Recent events in my life have really darkened my mood and mind. So much so that I almost begin crying at work. Every mistake I’ve ever made in my life suddenly begins to abuse me and beat me down. It’s a awful feeling that just takes all joy and happiness away from you all at once. Then all I can do is worry about others because I no longer care for yourself, because of how disgusted I’m  at myself. But no matter what I do nothing seems to be good enough to help others. So much so that I just obsess over this very phenomenon at night where there’s nowhere to go. I just wish I didn’t have to suffer from my own mind killing me."

1452,Having trouble. . ..,"I hadn't cried almost all summer, I just found it easier not to. I just cried for probably 20-30 minutes. . .  and punched myself. . . in the face. . .. I'm gonna be honest, I'm fucked up in the head. Not depression wise, but. . . for some reason, I'm just. . . fucked up. . .. I have a significant other, a long with some anger issues. . . *and* I'm learning how to box, the last two; not a good combination. I usually get mad when either playing games, but I don't rage at those. Regardless, I spend a lot of time at my computer, it's summer break, why not relax a bit? But I also have a lot of friends who come to *me* for support. . . so I give it to them. One friend in particular, she has a lot of problems at home and is stuck at home with her family for quarantine, so she has a lot of problems. Because of her and co. I have my phone by me at all times, or I'm at my computer. My computer is next to a window, a window means a solid wall, you know the corners on the sides of the windows? I punch that. See, I used to be a *terrible* human being. I would bully my ""best friend"" and just be a total asshole to others. So when I moved to where I live now, I thought ""I need to be a better person"" somewhere along the way. And so I did.  


. . . Well. . . I tried. . ..  


See when I moved, I had met this girl (The one who had the home life problems) and she's nice, and pretty. But I wasn't (nice (or pretty, but I was mainly focusing on the 'nice' aspect of this part)) and this was before I decided to be a good human being. See, this girl had been manipulated and abused by her family. She was neglected a normal life of a normal girl and had become the ""slave"" of the family. Her bratty younger brother was her ""king"" of sorts. He hits her, yells at her, and her family yells at her too. But they also manipulated her to being nice to them, to not fight back. They had taught her that people were the boss of *her* (I italicized 'her' cause I was pointing out the fact that they told her she had no power over anyone. She didn't have any power whatsoever other than to do others bidding.) So she was nice to everyone. I remember when I first met her in english, I would throw a pencil at her, at her forehead, now she didn't show any signs of pain, so I kept doing it. I don't know if I already knew this or had figured out, but they always hit lead first. Now I like my pencils sharp, so that must've hurt like hell! A year or so later I realized she had a bad minscus (part of your knee, a very important one at that) and that she would need a transplant, which are *extremely* expensive, or just get it removed. Now this was a while ago so I don't remember exeactly, but I think this was the point I was like ""damn, this sucks!"" and (a few months before actually) I had decided to try to be a better person. And also, one *very* importnant detail: I was a perve. I had originally approached this girl cause like I said she was nice and pretty (Still is, but I prefer the term cute, and also, at this point she's more of a little sister, both my words and hers. I have *no* interest in dating her.) and also, because she was *too* nice. I thought ""Well, maybe this girl is so nice I can. . ."" Idk, but it was some pervy, horny, teen shit. Fast foward a bit, I picked up boxing. To make sure that no one can hurt my friends again, I tell myself that cause. . . I want to be a better person. I tell myself that I wouldn't defend myself, only my friends. I wouldn't raise my fists unless it's to help my friends. That girl I mentioned earlier; as fucked up as this sounds, I'm dating her childhood friend. Not cause. . . well, just cause I like her. We've been dating for more than half a year (The longest relationship I've had considering I'm in highschool) And things are getting to a point. And I keep thinking everytime we kiss. . . everytime we kiss I get the fucked up thoughts in my head. Basically my own hormone moster to reference *Big Mouth.* Not two months ago she was *convinced* she was ace. And now I get my old thoughts back. I'm pissed at myself while writing this. Now I don't know if I'm old enough to know what love is, but I am *damn* positive I love this girl. . . which is where the title comes in. . . I want to break up with her. . .. Now I bet I know what your thinking ""You just said that you are almost positive you love her, you went even as far as to commit a sin in saying so!"" Now first of all, don't mention the ""sin"" it's just how I talk. Second, It's not cause I don't like her. . .  in fact, it's the opposite. Remember how I said I took up boxing to protect my friends. I lied, I didn't just take up boxing, I told myself, that if something ever happens to my friends that I could prevent. It would be *my* fault. Now I know that seems extreme, but gladly, I have gained a strong sense of justice. . . for my friends. . . and the friends of my friends. . . and people I find annoying. . . **but mostly my friends!** My point being, that's just how I've lived. And so when I see my old self. . . coming through. . . around her? I freak out. I think ""If I can provent her from getting hurt, shouldn't I?"". Cause I have told her about almost all of this plus more about me being a terrible human being. Hell, she hates basically everyone cause of what we do, we pollute the planet, plus so much more! Hell, I'm the exact thing she hates! just. . . me. . .. So I thought ""If it weren't me."" If any of the stuff I had done, someone else had just done 1-5 of, would she hate them? the answer was yes. She would. So if she hates everyone like me. . . but me. . .. Doesn't that mean that she should hate me too? That she realizes that I'm a bad person and just. . .. My point is, is that I think I should break up with her so that I don't hurt her, but she has said before that she'd be fucked up without me. . . so I don't know what to do. . . I want to protect her. . . but to protect her one way. . . I have to put her in ""danger"" the other. . .. HELP!!! I'm sorry for such a long post, I don't think anyone'll even read it. . . but it was worth a shot. . . I guess. . .."
1453,A rant on how my 2020 has been going so far. Spoiler: Not good.,"2020 has been a shitstorm. I graduated from my PhD in January this year. Applied for the work permit to be able to work as a postdoc fellow. The work permit was supposed to arrive in March. Covid-19 stuck, and it is August and I am still waiting for my work permit.

I am an Indian stuck in Canada. Can't return home since my documents are processing. Credit card debt to 1600$. Moving to stay with a friend as I have depleted all my savings and can't afford rent anymore. 

Can't say all this to my parents back home as they will be worried. I am super tensed all the time. My research is severely affected, productivity all time low as I can't concentrate. Can't apply for other jobs in Canada without work permit. No chance of moving to another country.

 I can't sleep well, I don't eat well. I am showing all signs of moderate depression. Only thing keeping me partly sane is long distance running and occasional movie nights with some friends.

I am not done losing hope yet. I will persevere."
1454,I'm scared of being better,"I've had depression for almost a decade now, since I was about 12ish. It came after years of bullying about my weight and my general quiet, 'weird' mannerisms. Since then I managed it okayish during high school, had  a girlfriend and some friends but still dealt a lot with anxiety, self image issues, etc. As I got into adulthood, now been single for a long time, went to university, it got really bad with loneliness especially.

But now, I've got medication, I have a gym membership, I've got a job. Still no girlfriend, but a good circle of friends including women. I think I'm making good progress. Still lonely, but generally getting my life together and feeling okay. But that's what scares me. After being the sad fat weirdo for so many years, it's become such a strong part of me, it's who I feel I am. What do I do when I get 'better'? What if I don't like the ""happy"" me? I'm scared to feel okay, because I don't know what that feels like. I think this is holding me back, to be honest, and I don't know what to do.

1457,I think I had a panic attack,"I'm 16, a male, no mental issues before this episodes

I think I had a panic attack, I tried to remember the timing but I'm not really sure. Also note that I checked the heartbeat a few times during this episode (I have a smartwatch) and, even if I felt it like exploding, it was normal.

My temperature was also normal even thought I felt very cold

1-   22:30 while I was in my room I started feeling cold (I was in a very hot place) and I am almost never cold, I also started to feel ""scared"", I don't know how to describe it, but I couldn't just do anything and all bad thoughts came to my mind

2-   23:00 went downstairs to look for ""emotional support"" from a friend, bad thoughts worsened, I started crying

3-   23:00-23:30 I was freezing (literally trembling from the cold in a place with 30+ Celsius, while wearing a hoody)

4-   23:30-23:45 Decided to get back to my room, I almost fell on the floor a few times, loosing my balance for no apparent reason, I continued crying, then I calmed a bit

Right now is almost 00:00, I'm still shocked and frightened, I don't really know what do do

I think this could have been a panic attack, I had a few ""moments"" of panicking without no reason, but they lasted a few minutes, no cold, no cry...

Even if I was sure these were panic attacks I  don't know what to do. All the bad thoughts that came to my mind had the same ""base"" so that could be the problem, but if I needed a psychologist I would have to talk to my parents before, and the ""base"" of the thoughts is something I don't want to tell them"
1458,How to be mindful of others when I'm feeling down myself?,"Hello, this is my first time here. Sorry for Format, I'm on my phone!
So, I've had low self esteem and been feeling down for a lot of the past two years, as I've interrupted my studies, felt completely lost and was unable to seek out a job due to anxiety. This eventually led to such an extreme form of anxiety that I developed depersonalization/derealization which got me feeling so bad I had suicidal thoughts.

This was in January, and I've been progressively getting better since. However, I still experience a lot of days where I feel down, sad, nostalgic, very philosophical/existential, and just don't feel great.
 And when I get like that, I tend to get selfish. I want to be left alone, I don't feel like I really care about anyone or anything so I don't reach out to people and tend to be irritable.
It usually affects everyone I know and I end up feeling bad for saying something that wasn't nice, or for not being grateful enough but at the same time I also feel like I don't really care. 
However the main problem I face with this is with someone who's a little more than a friend but we're not together. It's a long distance thing, so we talk through texts mostly. The past two weeks I haven't been feeling the best, and he approached me saying he'd been feeling neglected, as I haven't really sent him cute messages (I didn't feel like it), that I didn't care about his interests (which was kind of true, I couldn't get myself to care) and he just generally felt like I didn't care about him that much I guess (which is somewhat true when I feel like that?)
This ended up with me getting defensive and starting a fight, which got to a pont where I thought I messed everything up and was going to lose him, which I think might've cause a panic attack? I'm not quite sure if that's what it was, but it was an intense feel of panic and nothing calmed me down or could really distract me.

So anyway. My question I guess is : How can I get myself to care about others when I'm not feeling great myself? Because I know I have to take care of myself first , but I don't want to hurt anyone or risk losing someone for how I behave when I'm like that. It's gotten to à point where I felt like I'm the worst friend/daughter/person ever and that I don't even care about anyone, that I'm just selfish and pretend I like them, which I know isn't true.

Thanks if anyone read all of this, any insight is welcome!"
1459,need advice in online quiz answer,"Hey, I’m going to get all my info out rdd es ally quickly to get to the point so my apologies if this is confusing; I use drugs recreationally with a few set bou fries but have overcome and addiction u gave as I have been only smoking and drinking as of late. I am taking an online quiz to test for possible mental illness presence, I am currently talking to therapists and professionals  and will be talking about this with them so no need to worry. The question asks “. My symptoms are the result of being on drugs or alcohol.

1461,What to do when nothing in life excites me anymore and I feel no purpose?,I can’t quite explain this feeling I’ve been having for maybe 2 years now. I wouldn’t usually come to Reddit for help but I’ve started to feel like this problem is something I need to get off my chest. For some time now I’ve felt like I’m just going through the motions of life without any actual purpose. The effort of putting up a front for friends and family has become so draining that a lot of the time I don’t even want to meet up with anyone anymore. Its come to the stage where I won’t be able to eat for days because I can’t see the point of eating anymore.

1462,Should I get a dog und rebel (don't know better English word for it) against my parents?,"I'm 19 and got diagnosed with depression over an year ago. Currently I'm living at my father's place. I have pretty good grades and no one from outside would thing that I have a problem. 

I have big problems with feeling loved or wanted. I can only feel loved in a relationship or from dogs. So naturally I want a dog, so that I can get the mental support that I need. Many say it would a good thing others say when I get a dog I would just run from my problems. In my eyes a dog can give me the support that I miss to keep going. 

Now my father comes into play, he also has depression and some other mental health problems. He owns a second house with an empty flat and has more money he could spent and is not working. That flat was planned for me (while I write this down I feel like a snop). When I said I would like a dog because it would benefit my mental health he said he could understand me but no because he don't want a dog in the flat, he also had no dog when he was young and I don't know what I will do when I get older. 

I could go on and on but this should be enough to understand my situation, by questions just ask.

1463,I need some help,"So, I’m always stressed out and I don’t ever stop being anxious or fidgety. I’m trying to find some form of activity to calm me down. Thanks in advance."
1464,I feel like I’m losing my drive and that maybe I’m addicted to struggle and discomfort,"Hi there, this might not be the best sub to post this in but everyone here has been so nice and helpful in the past. I’m an 18 year old boy and I recently got into my second ever relationship. The problem is that I feel less of a drive to pursue my dreams of becoming an athlete. I feel like my focus has massively shifted away from my sport and onto my new relationship. I have been dedicated to my sport for the last four years, and it is fundamental to my identity, my self esteem and my happiness. It’s been my main purpose for a very long time. I’ve also been very lonely for a very long time. At first the loneliness was unbearable and I thought I needed a relationship to help me and that once I was in one everything would be much easier. But over the last few months I started to like the loneliness a bit. It felt noble to keep my head up and work hard despite the loneliness. I felt strong and capable and like a fighter. Pushing on in spite of my mental pain became a part of my identity as well. 

I entered my relationship about three weeks ago, and that part of my identity has now disappeared. I’m comfortable. There’s no loneliness, no doubt, no fear to push through. I feel like I’m withering. I don’t feel the drive that I used to, and my ambition seems to have diminished. I don’t feel the need to put my all into my sport in order to build a good life and get good feelings, because I know I can just fall into the comfort and good feelings of being with my girlfriend. I wonder whether I’m not emotionally mature enough for a relationship, and maybe I still have work to do on myself. I’m not sure how to balance this, and I want my old passion for my sport back, but at the same time I really care about my girlfriend and I want to stay with her and I don’t want to break her heart and mine for the sake of my potential addiction to struggle. I’m hoping that it’s just because being in a relationship is new to me, so it’s temporarily grabbed my primary focus, and that once I get used to it I will go back to being primarily focused on my sport. This may not sound like snug deal, but it’s really stressing me out and making me anxious about who I am.

Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thank you if you read this far."

1467,I don't know how to feel about this,"Since elementary school until university I've always struggled to pay attention for too much time in a row but it was never like a big deal because I could always pass every subject pushing a bit more at the end of the year so I forgot about it, but now I'm in my 2nd year of university and subjects are much harder so I couldn't do the same thing. I can't focus for too much time even if I like what I'm doing in that moment, it happens to me in class, reading any book (at most 2 pages without getting distracted), trying to do any assignments, homework or even playing the guitar, not more than 10 minutes even if I enjoy doing it, I start thinking about any other thing, day dreaming or just don't want to do it anymore for some reason. I also forget to do my homework or an important assignment but again, if I remember it and what I need to do forces me to put effort, I just can't do it and if I try I end up doing a lot of dumb mistakes. When you fail a subject, you must pay twice for it if you want to do the exam again the next year so university is gonna cost a lot of money this year, making me feel like a burden to my parents. Idk if this has something to do but when I'm talking to someone else, sometimes I just stop talking and forget what I was talking about in the middle of the conversation and this is new, I didn't have this problem before so idk if it's just how I am or its something else, but if this is how I am and nothing else, tbh I really feel like a piece of shit that can't even try to do but has to do because I feel like I would understand every subject I could focus and have discipline but it just seems so natural to me not to do assignments or just paying attention for too much time in a row so quarantine and online classes have been horrible to me, I could stayed even less focus on class so I didn't even try to do any exam. I feel so useless and so incapable of doing it. Should I go see a doctor? I don't want this to feel like an excuse for my failures and of course I don't want my parents to know until I know what's going on."

1470,19f UK - I have an issue with normalisation,"Obviously not all of it, of course we should normalise then topics of mental health discussion and the fact everyone at some point will suffer from mental health issues but not everything should be normalised.
I’m 19 at university and I’m in the waiting list for nhs mental health services after having a year of being suicidal and depressed, ongoing but nonetheless slightly better enough for me to get help.

However, my flatmate atm is diagnosed with depression. Naturally, months before going to professional help, I spoke to her about my experiences. I told her that I fantasise about my death (suicide or accidental death but thankful it happened by then end) nearly every hour of every day in vivid detail. I told her I’d planned how I’d commit suicide. Her response was telling me that was normal, that everyone does that, everyone thinks about their suicide and sent me to a load of websites explaining that it’s nothing to worry about.

Less than a month later I was bundling a jumper with a knife wrapped inside that I was gonna use to the kitchen to stop me from hurting myself.

Less than 3 months later I ordered pills online that I kept carrying with me until July when a friend found out. These pills were what I’d planned my suicide around so losing them made me desperately try to find other methods.

I recently told another friend about all my thoughts about this. Instead of normalising this behaviour, she took and destroyed the pills I’d been carrying and got me professional help. Without that I’d probably not be around. 

I have a problem with normalisation. I’m incredibly susceptible to it and it’s hurt me in many ways. Does anyone have a similar experience? Just want to know I’m not an idiot really 😅"
1471,Psychiatrist Explains Why Reframing Your Thoughts Doesn't Heal Trauma,"This is frankly ground breaking. I have dealt with anxiety for the past five years, spent thousands on therapy, but this book is a revelation:

I have high levels of anxiety related to my work which stems from traumatic past experiences when I was a teenager. On top of that, I have other traumas that often make me feel like a loser and disrupt my daily routine and productivity. So in short, my past traumas have impaired my self-regulation abilities.

Now, I am reading this book 'The Body Keeps the Score' which explains why fixing your thinking doesn't work because thoughts are just the tip of the iceberg. The iceberg is the deep inner experience stored in your body in the form of emotion. So whenever you try to move forward, the trauma, that still lives in your body, pulls you back - makes you afraid, anxious, depressed, feel like a loser.

It is not a ""cognitive distortion"" as mainstream psychologists would call it. It is deeper than that. The trauma is still living in your body. Your job is to befriend your body and heal it through practices like yoga that transform the body on a cellular level.

My problem is self-regulation - being able to do the things that I actually want as opposed to self-medicating through distractions or engaging in destructive activities. I often numb my emotional pain with porn or internet stimulation. I turn into victim mode often when I can't be productive. 

The one thing that I picked from the book is that when you're constantly aware of your physical sensations as well as your emotions - only then can you mobilize your energies (act in a harmonious way). When we suppress the awareness, stop listening to our bodies and distract ourselves with internet, porn or other stuff, we lose awareness and hide from ourselves. 

Here are the best excerpts from the book 'The Body Keeps the Score' so far: 

**Self-Regulation**

***The more people try to push away and ignore internal warning signs, the more likely they are to take over and leave them bewildered, confused, and ashamed. People who cannot comfortably notice what is going on inside become vulnerable to respond to any sensory shift either by shutting down or by going into a panic—they develop a fear of fear itself.***

***The price for ignoring or distorting the body’s messages is being unable to detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and, just as bad, what is safe or nourishing. Self-regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your body. Without it you have to rely on external regulation—from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.*** 

***The price for ignoring or distorting the body’s messages is being unable to detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and, just as bad, what is safe or nourishing. Self-regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your body. Without it you have to rely on external regulation—from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.*** 

***However, traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside. They learn to hide from their selves.*** 

***“Agency” is the technical term for the feeling of being in charge of your life: knowing where you stand, knowing that you have a say in what happens to you, knowing that you have some ability to shape your circumstances.***

***Agency starts with what scientists call interoception, our awareness of our subtle sensory, body-based feelings: the greater that awareness, the greater our potential to control our lives. Knowing what we feel is the first step to knowing why we feel that way. If we are aware of the constant changes in our inner and outer environment, we can mobilize to manage them.  But we can’t do this unless our watchtower, the MPFC, learns to observe what is going on inside us. This is why mindfulness practice, which strengthens the MPFC, is a cornerstone of recovery from trauma.***  

**Why Fixing Cognitive Thinking Doesn't Always Work:**

***Psychologists usually try to help people use insight and understanding to manage their behavior. However, neuroscience research shows that very few psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding; most originate in pressures from deeper regions in the brain that drive our perception and attention. When the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps signaling that you are indanger, no amount of insight will silence it. I am reminded of the comedy in which a seven-time recidivist in an anger-management program extols the virtue of the techniques he’s learned: “They are great and work terrific—as long as you are not really angry.*** 

 ***Yet another pitfall of language is the illusion that our thinking can easily be corrected if it doesn’t “make sense.” The “cognitive” part of cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing such “dysfunctional thinking.” This is a top-down approach to change in which the therapist challenges or“reframes” negative cognitions, as in “Let’s compare your feelings that you are to blame for your rape with the actual facts of the matter” or “Let’s compare your terror of driving with the statistics about road safety today.”*** 

***Sadly, our educational system, as well as many of the methods that profess to treat trauma, tend to bypass this emotional-engagement system and focus instead on recruiting the cognitive capacities of the mind. Despite the well-documented effects of anger, fear, and anxiety on the ability to reason,many programs continue to ignore the need to engage the safety system of the brain before trying to promote new ways of thinking.***

1472,Am I crazy?,"Hello! I am 20 years old, female and I really need your advice. I am questioning my mental health. All my teenage years I struggled with anxiety and depression and they never stopped, only my anxieties changed. I had also had some intrusive thoughts that I couldn't control and I want to a psycologist twice. I also have some really weird unconscious passion of hurting myself , I realise that it is wrong, but I do it unconsciouslly and then I am really sad. I have some people in my familly who struggle with depression and paranoia. What should I do ? Do you think I am really crazy ?"
1473,How do you know if something is a personality trait or symptom of a mental health condition?,"I find that I have traits of lots of different mental health disorders. I have actually been diagnosed as bipolar for quite obvious manic symptoms. I have however found I’ve got traits of schizoid, social anxiety, depression and probably lots of other things. It’s hard to stay positive about these things. It’s little things like lack of motivation, no interest in things, avoiding social experiences, being quiet with some people, the introspection and the manic symptoms which happen once in a blue moon. I am quite content usually and I am quite high functioning but sometimes I dwell on the negatives of the stuff that I mentioned. I have so much hope that I can improve but I can’t ever seem to reach my goals. To be fair I do set myself some quite challenging goals that a lot of people would struggle with. I want to do something really impressive though but I know it’s unlikely."

1475,"I need to stop dreaming about being raped, any tips appreciated!","CW: Rape, assault

&amp;#x200B;

It's been years, but I after getting out of an abusive relationship (that only lasted 6 months) and being raped by the same guy after, I still have horrible dreams. I'm finally in a place where I can be happy during most days. No more intrusive thoughts, no more anger, rarely sadness. But sometimes during the night I relive being raped, or physically attacked/held down. Sometimes by the guy who actually raped me, sometimes by others but somehow he's always conceptually present when these violent dreams occur. I usually wake up with tears streaming down my face and not wanting to get up.

&amp;#x200B;

I know one tip would be to avoid triggers. Some of my friends are still in the same social circle as him, possibly as I never told them (he told me they liked him more than me, so wouldn't believe me - as you might notice that still floats around in my head). So sometimes I still see a picture of him on facebook, looking horrible, honestly like a monster. I'm thinking I should probably hide all posts from my friends who still hang out with him to avoid seeing any representation of him, but somehow that feels like another defeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another trigger is probably stress but that's unavoidable with my job. But really, these dreams don't really seem to need a trigger. They can come at any time, ruining the next morning and making me reluctant to fall asleep again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips anyone can give would be appreciated. I've heard weed, but I have a bad physical reaction to that. But other things I can take - pills, supplements - or journalling/not journalling/avoiding the subject at all costs/analysing the dreams, anything. Thank you so much!"
1476,Failed my exam for the third time,Just gutted. everytime i try so hard nothing good comes out of it. I find it so difficult to learn and prepare for the exam but i still end up failing
1477,"I don't know what is happening to me,,,","Hello! I (21F) keep getting weird deja-vu feelings. My brain is thinking of a memory but the problem is that i don't think that what it's thinking about is something that has happened to me before? And while this happens i feel like my body is going numb and i'm running short of breath and also feel like i am either cold or extremely hot. 

The first time it happened to me was 2 months ago when i was playing a game. I brushed it off, i figured it was because i was concentrating too hard on the game and i was also stressed because i was about to find out soon if i'll get accepted to the uni i wanted to go. So i kinda thought it was an one time thing and it'll stop after i find out the result. Plot twist! It didn't really stop. It actually stopped for a while but the feeling came back about a week ago, and it's already happened 3 times this week. 

I am genuinely scared and i talked to my mum about it and she just brushed it off and said it is because i'm scared because of the Corona. I think part of it is true, i feel like the reason why it happened in the first place is because i stayed too much at home.And i kinda lost myself .

I am so worried. I don't understand what it is and i don't have the means to go to the doctor rn. I am scared this will continue all my life and it is going to get worse and worse and worse and i don't know the severe consequences it might have in my life...

1479,What's the effect of being surrounded by death from a young age?,"So my parents have their own business as funeral directors.

 I'm 20 now and was diagnosed with depression at 17, although I'd say I had mental health issues for a while before then. I'm not around that kinda stuff anymore but I wanted to know how negative an effect it would have on a typical teenager if they had to face that kinda stuff not having that background I did. And does seeing death have to be a negative experience at all?

There's a lot I could say but I'm not sure exactly what I should say or how I should even ask this question. I'll gladly add more details if asked."

Its super weird its like I get all panicky even thinking about it. I jump to conclusions way to much and I have this weird paranoia about people watching me and judging me, sometimes I guess thats why I get so nervous.

I don’t know how to believe someone in this world will actually like me or enjoy my company. 
She said I need to work on my self esteem and trauma. They handed me these self esteem work sheets but when I tried to fill them out I just cringed and cried. I didn’t realize how hard it is to actually find something about myself that I like. And I’m so upset I can’t. I want nothing more than to be happy and normal but I feel so stuck and don’t even know where to start or how to help myself. Now I’m back out in the real world, and everything is just....hard again. I didn’t realize how just draining life was. When I was in there, I was actually able to think. But now I’m just....anxious all the time. Paranoid all the time about what people think about. I don’t know why I made this post tbh. I just feel alone and worthless, and it sucks that I don’t even know how to fix myself."
1483,"Being nicer to myself, part one","I recently landed a new job after being unemployed for 4 months. Before that I was bouncing from job to job, shitty boss to shitty boss, and I hated all of it. On top of that, I was living like a slob. Horribly depressed, no goal, no aim or direction, basically just waiting until I had nothing left to live for. 

I still have depression obviously, and it’s a daily struggle, but one thing I’ve noticed is that certain things in your life can give you a real sense of meaning and purpose. Thankfully I’ve found a company to work for that does just that and more. Being somewhere that actually cares about their employees is very encouraging both financially and mentally. 

Since I’ve been carrying this load, my mood has increased, my libido has returned, my hygienic has picked up drastically, and I feel actually kind of confident in myself. I’m doing something I’ve never done before and actually making lists for my future self to check off. That’s a big one right there, I’m giving myself less to do later, and once I’ve accomplished everything on my “daily list”, it’s a huge rush of dopamine to know that I can kick back and relax without the constant nagging voice of “you’re such a lazy piece of shit, you can’t do anything,” etc. because then I have EVIDENCE! 

I can take my brain and say “No no, look at this. I did x y and z today and that is more than enough. The house is clean, dinner is cooked, clothes are laid out for work tomorrow, so you don’t get to bully me anymore!”

Just feeling good today and wanted to share. Much love to all of you &lt;3"
1484,Living with my family because of the pandemic is destroying me (TW: Suicidal thoughts),"I (F23) had to move back in with my mom, stepdad, and younger sister in April when lockdown started. My family aren't bad people, but I just can't handle living with them. My mom has awful mood swings and likes provoking political discussions so she can get attention and play the victim because nobody agrees with her. My sister and I can sometimes be best friends, but she can also be incredibly mean and thoughtless in what she says. To give an example, she likes to remind me what a ""bitch"" I was last year (I was suffering severe PTSD due to leaving an abusive relationship, which she is aware of). She also likes telling me how annoying I am, which really hurts because I have ADHD and struggle with social cues. 

I've been living on my own since I was 18. My life got SO MUCH better when I moved out. Now I'm back in and it feels like this is destroying me. The existence of the pandemic alone and the horrific response to it is stressful enough. I work in a grocery store, so that's even more stress. On top of that, I still suffer from PTSD and OCD. 

There is one silver lining, which is that I'm supposed to be moving to Spain in October to work as an English teaching assistant. I agonized over whether or not I should go through with it, but, because I have friends in Spain that I can quarantine with, and because it's a long-term move for work, not a vacation, I decided to do it. I have a plan for safe travels and everything (I'm going to try and get tested a few days before I leave, then self-quarantine upon arrival, then get tested again  three days later). But the situation is so unstable right now, and it's not looking good in Spain, I'm just not sure if it'll happen. Obviously, I totally understand (and support) them locking down again, I was there when the virus first started spreading, I want them to put the health of Spanish citizens first. But I can't help being scared of what happens if I can't get out of my family's house. I can't drive (severe ADHD/anxiety about being in cars, I'm super embarrassed about it), so I wouldn't be able to stay at my grocery store job, which pays really well. Also, all my money is saved up for Spain; I can always reapply next year, but having to pay rent, use public transportation, and buy my own groceries would put a serious dent in that. Plus, I just don't think I can find a job better than the one I have now. 

So I'm basically trapped with my family. I hate it. I feel like I'm suffocating. I've seriously considered suicide multiple times, but there's no way in hell I'm telling anyone in my family. They don't respond well when I tell them about my mental health problems. I just can't imagine spending another year in this awful place."

1493,My dad and his fear of COVID-19 may cause my parents to break up,"
Note 0: sorry for bad English, French is my first language.
Note 1: In Canada our social distancing is of 2 meters
Note 2: We live in a region where there is NO active Covid case

Since the start of the pandemic, my dad has a extreme Covid anxiety. At the start it was fine, tolerable. But now he crossed the red line which will maybe cause my parents to separate.

Since the start of the pandemic in my country (Canada) my dad refuses to eat anything made in a  restaurant, not even food pick up or delivery. He religiously wash his grocery shopping every weeks. He refuses to enter in  people homes and when he go out of the house he vigorously keep his 2 meters physical distancing. My grandmother (his mother) invites us at the end of July to eat a cake outside of her house for my grandfather’s birthday and he refused the invitation even if we could keep our 2 meters social distancing. He wash everything that will enter in the house. He received wood to build a shed, he washed it.He watcha everything we do and tell us if he thinks that it’s  insecured (ex: one weeks ago he asked me to wash my hands because I touched a tree in the middle of a forest) My mother, my little brother and I were happy at the begging that he has such a exemplary behavior, but now that our country and our family is deconfining itself ,except him, we are starting to think he is crazy.

I think that the redline had been crossed this evening, when one of my mother’s cousin (she resides in the same region where there is NO active case since end of June) decide to do a surprise visit to see us. The two (my mother and her cousin) were talking outside of the house at a distance of 1-1.5 meters when suddenly my dad open a window and ask them to keep a distance of 2 meters (remember that they were outside).

After her cousin leaving my mother comes back in the house and after a moment went cries in her room. I asked her what’s going one and she said that she can no longer tolerate my father watching us all the time and telling us what to do about coronavirus and that we accept all the choices he made about Covid (not seeing anyone, not eating anything made in restaurant, etc...) but that he must accept that we (the rest of my family) are starting to deconfining ourselves and having contents with people outside of our near family. She even said that she is thinking of getting a apartment without him. 

Note 3: my father is a teacher at a secondary school and will go back to school in two weeks where he will have to manage a group of 30 students and mask and social distancing will NOT be mandatory.

All that to say that I’m really scared for my family and my dad. He never had problems of watching or telling us what to do before. I don’t see how he will be able to return in a school with thousands of teenagers , no mask and no social distancing mandatory, if he can’t even stand that my mother is talking so someone at 1.5 meters outside of the house. 

I’m really scared for him, his mental health and I don’t want my family to break up. So do you have any advice? Thing we could do to sensibilise him to the fact the the world start to spinning again ? Is there a name of something for a illness like that ?

Thank you very much."

I’ve never tried any stimulants because Wellbutrin but it made me jittery and didn’t make me more happier or balanced just more energised than usual but I was motivated and did my tasks.

I’m wondering could a doctor prescribe a patient a stimulant in low or starters dose for studying, motivation, concentration, for mood swings etc?

Most antipsychotics, antidepressants has a side effect as sedating. I don’t take anything right now. I used to smoke cigarettes and drink coffee but it doesn’t seem to really help overal with the mood.

1499,4 Ways Teenagers Can Overcome Anxiety,"Teenagers are always predisposed to experiencing stress and anxiety owing to the amount of changes that they endure during their teenage years. Teenagers are always struggling to balance a myriad of responsibilities that fall upon them as they juggle the many roles they play at once during those crucial years. Anxiety can present itself in many different ways to a teenager. Teenagers may describe this feeling as a sudden sense of fear, may experience difficulties at school pertaining to academics or peers or have recurring anxious thoughts. Anxiety is often an unspoken problem that most teenagers keep locked up within them. Apart from considering [child therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) for your teen, as a parent, you can help your teenager with four easy techniques to significantly reduce the anxiety your teenager may feel. 

**Help them get some good sleep -**Teenagers may often find it very difficult to get good sleep owing to their constant worrying and stress. This may significantly affect their sleeping patterns and contribute to the problem at hand. Teenagers, on an average, need at least 8-9 hours of sound sleep. Encourage your teenagers to get a good amount of sleep on school nights, to not cram before exams into the wee hours of the night and get some relaxing sleep over the weekends too. This may significantly reduce the amount of stress a teenager may feel and help them cope. 

**Eat right, live right -**Teenagers are most often seen binging on anything that comes out of a wrapper, snacking on unhealthy snacks and guzzling down an unhealthy amount of soda. It is true that you are what you eat and so as parents, you can encourage your child to develop a healthy relationship with food that is good for them. Try to integrate fruits and vegetables into their diet and avoid unhealthy eating habits like consumption of junk food more than once a week and worst of all - skipping meals. A healthy body fosters a healthy mind and a healthy mind is stress free. 

**Move around, move a lot  -** Any [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) recommends at least one hour of physical activity a day for growing adolescents and teenagers. Teenagers who don’t enjoy mainstream sports barely get any kind of physical activity. You must encourage your child to get moving and exercise regularly the way they like. Motivate them to find a sport or any physical activity they like and make it a habit. It could be just walking too. These activities release endorphins in the body which serve as a natural stress reliever and can boost mood. 

**Let it go, vent it out -** Most teenagers believe that adults don’t understand them and therefore hesitate to share their thoughts with their parents or their siblings. This is where a therapist can help. A therapist can help your teenager understand where the anxiety they feel is stemming from and then target that part of their life to nip the problem in the bud. Apart from the technical aspects of therapy, it can give your child a safe environment to express themselves freely, without the fear of judgement. Venting, expressing, emoting and sharing can significantly reduce anxiety and relieve your teenager of the stress of keeping it all in. If you are wondering where you can find a suitable [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) offers many experienced and trusted professionals."
1500,Coping with stress,"Hi all, 

Do you have stress coping techniques that really help calm yourself down? 

I‘m under a lot of stress because of university (writing my thesis, enrolment at a new university, money problems, moving and finding a new affordable apartment)
and I can’t deal with it well. 
I keep going on in my head what I need to do when and how and it blocks my head. Plus when I tell myself that the best thing for me is to chill out and not to stress myself it just makes me feel stressed about being stressed. It’s like I constantly want to resolve everything but I can’t because a lot depends on other people/ different deadlines etc. 

What do you do to relax in stressful times? 
I would appreciate your advice very much!!"
1501,"Hi, I think I'm so depressed that I feel relatively okay. Anyone else?","Hi, I'm so apathetic. Right now I'm living back with my mother, I want and need my own place, but I just can't seem to talk to anyone about anything. I don't have the energy to wash, eat, call people, I don't even play video games anymore most of the time, I just don't care about them. All I want is to spend time with someone that cares about me and shares interests with me but I literally don't know anyone who fills those criteria anymore.

I don't even know what to write here because, no one can help, anger is my only emotion and I only know that from the thoughts I have, not from the things I express. Everyone thinks I'm boring, I have nothing to offer anyone. I never ever thought my mental health would be this bad again, I'm fucked.

It's been almost 2 years since me and my ex broke up and I'm not exaggerating when I say I think about her every day. Not consciously, she's just always present in my mind and I hate it, I want to stop hurting but I guess I can't be bothered to seek help anymore.

Thanks for reading, writing this allowed me to be sad."
1502,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I have no clue what’s wrong with me and that’s probably the worst part. My whole life my mom and dad never really takes to my sister and I about emotions or feelings. My dad only exhibited stress about bills and work, weekly, and would always talk about how easily we could just lose everything. Now, fast forward through 22 years of that and I’m a grown woman, paying all my own bills, living with my boyfriend and two dogs. Today my disaster relief assistance was dropped drastically and I can’t live off of it, and my original job is still closed. which means I’ll be needing a job. I’ve been looking for a tattoo apprenticeship, which if you don’t know, takes a lot of time and they aren’t usually paid. But now, that’ll have to be put on the back burner so I can get a job and pay bills. This scares me. I went to college and got a job when I was 18 because it’s what my parents told me to do, but I was extremely depressed and suicidal, and I always thought it was because I simply didn’t ACTUALLY want to be at college and I didn’t enjoy my job. So i quit both, and started a new job that I really enjoyed the next week, and my life was great, went from being the saddest I’ve ever been to the happiest I’ve ever been in a week just because I took out the things that were making me unhappy. I’m scared if I start working a job I hate again just to pay bills, I’ll go back to that dark place and I don’t know if I can make it out again. I told my boyfriend this and he says I should just choose to be happy. I explained that that doesn’t make any sense in my mind. What even is “happy” truly? I have happy days yes, but when I think “choose happy” in my head, nothing happens. What am I choosing? Do I smile? Am I supposed to ignore these issues, pushing back the apprenticeship again, getting a job I don’t like again, figuring out bills? I hear the words, but for me I don’t understand how you get your MIND to “choose happy”. He says it’s just as easy as the way I choose to be unhappy. He says that there’s no point in it, the world doesn’t care how I feel. Which is true, and that somewhat connected some dots in my head. I explained to him that in my mind, I’d rather stress, and worry and then something good happen and I be super happy, than just “choose happy” expect happy, and then something happen and I be crushed. He said that’s my problem, he said I need to learn to just be happy, he said if everything was taken away from him, he’d still be happy, cause he’s happy with himself. If he had nothing, and was homeless, he’d be happy. (He actually says he wishes he could just be homeless all the time and I believe him.) This got me thinking, he’d like to be homeless because then he wouldn’t have to have a job, or any responsibilities really. He would have complete freedom from society...but isn’t that the REASON for your “happiness”?? My point is, is there such a thing as just “being happy” or is there always a reason? He argues that you can just BE happy which blows my mind and do can’t imagine that. But I think it’s more like the whole “there’s no such thing as a selfless act” kind of argument. Sure as a homeless person you’d have no material items, but you’d still have a lifestyle that makes you happy. Then he kind of got frustrated cause he said it feels like I’m just arguing him because I WANT to be sad. That’s not true, I WANT to be happy you guys. So bad. It kills me. I’m only explaining my mental dilemmas here. Sometimes I think I’ve got depression, doctors have tried putting me on meds before, I don’t accept for fear of becoming dependent on them, I’d like to overcome this on my own, but it is becoming harder and harder. My boyfriend is amazing, and has open my eyes to so much, but I feel like my issues are ruining his love for me or pushing him away. Someone just tell me what to do please. I don’t want medicine. I do best when I’m being productive. For some reason I get like this the most when I’m in a relationship. But I don’t know why because I’m READY to be in a relationship and settle down, and he is what I want. I over analyze EVERYTHING, I over stress, I have really really REALLY bad social anxiety too which I forgot to mention. I guess I don’t know what my question is here. I’m scared to “just get a job” because I’m scared to fall down the hole again like I did in college. In a way I think he’s right, I do wake up and choose to be stressed and worried all day everyday. But I don’t know how to not. And when I have nothing to worry about, I feel I have no purpose in life and panic and change everything around me or create a problem. It’s true. How do I stop it? It’s all I’ve ever known for 22 years."

1504,I feel like I am becoming unhealthy in every way possible,"Spent about an hour writing the longest paragraphs and just realized maybe Im spilling too much so here goes round two.

I want to share my shitty quarantine thoughts incase someone else is going through the same shit

I (M 18) sometimes hate myself.
I absolutely despise social media sometimes because it reminds me of how imperfect I am. Its what triggered me to vent. I just opened instagram, saw someone really beautiful and thought god damn, far out of my league. And that thought alone just really got to me. It feels like I lost confidence and self control, never used to let these tiny thoughts get to me, but these past few weeks in quarantine have really got to me. Pretty pathetic but it is what it is.

I sometimes tell myself I’m too young, I shouldn’t give a shit about anything besides my studies, which is true but what the fuck can I do about these emotions? 

Quarantine made me remember bad experiences, and its made me remember them to be worse than they actually were. I ended up remembering bad choices that I made, and immediately began to overthink of how I could’ve handled the situation better. It gets worse and worse and sometimes I feel like my mind races at fucking light speed with thoughts like “oh you could’ve done this” “you could’ve done that” is it even self reflection at this point or is it more of me just living in the past idek but whatever it is its fucking me up.

I noticed that I have this crazy goal of becoming “perfect” by achieving many things, but I keep trying to tackle my goals all together. Clearly that isn’t working. 

Idk. I feel really angry about the way that I am, and sometimes I feel like I already know what to do in order to improve, but there’s always one part of me that just gives in and I end up slacking off like a fucking sloth.

I’m not worried about college, nor am I worried about getting a job. I can do all of that just fine.

Im just worried about the fact that I can’t deal with myself regarding my emotions, my lack of discipline when it comes to fitness / nutrition, and 
the whole “self reflecting” or “living in the past” habit.

if whoever is reading this is going through something similar, good luck to you too.

Thanks for reading this vent post."

1508,I don't know how to feel anymore,"For the first 17 years of my life I have been feeling empty and useless: I didn't have friends, I had bad grades, I was fat and ugly, I was sleeping during the day and stay up at night. Then after High school I moved abroad (alone) to work and then study. Since then, I lived the best 4/5 years of my life. I finally had a lot of girls, friends, parties, I had 5/6 jobs to be economically independent, I am fit and I graduated last month. However, one month ago my father had a stroke. 

I want to emphasize that all my life my main goal has been to earn enough money to make my parents stop working and live a good life. I come from a relatively poor region, my parents helped me during my studies although we don't have much so I didn't have to work too much and I could also study and have fun. Now I finally graduated and I was planning to start a food truck business later this year beside my Master's degree, and then this happened. 

I think it is worth mentioning that his cognitive abilities are still perfect, but he does have a hoarse voice, trouble walking unaided, dizziness, some double vision and fatigue. He is a very active person, the day before his storke we went spearfishing, we fixed cars together, etc.  Now I see him sad and I feel like whatever I will do and whatever amount of money I will earn won't be enough to make him happy again. I just don't see any way of me being happy without him being happy too. I don't think I can find happiness in another person ever again, after going through one year of toxic relationship living together  with my ex at the age of 20. Probably it was a mistake to do it so early because now I really just don't believe in anything anymore. On the other hand, I don't feel pain for losing friends or girlfriends anymore.

I cannot find happiness in myself because my only goal was to give my parents the life they deserve, and now this seems impossible, as he will probably have to deal with health issues for the rest of his life.

I just don't know how to feel. I am doing my best to help him, but of course all the money of this world will not solve some health issues. I would just like to see him happy again but I have no control over this, and as a consequence I do not have control over my own emotions."

1511,How to get over the fear of sharing something with a therapist?,"I am very scared to share any negative details of my relationship with my therapist. 

I really need support in finding a way to make my relationship better but I’m too scared to bring it up to my therapists. I’m afraid that if i say anything too bad they will think my relationship is bad and stop liking my bf (bc you always ask for help on the bad things, you don’t always talk about all the good things). Idk i guess it feels embarrassing and shameful that i can’t manage my own relationship or that i feel this way. I can’t even bring it up to my friends for the same reason. 

Has anyone dealt w this and what has helped?"
1512,"I’m starting therapy because of a toxic friend, what do I tell my friend group?","I’ve been struggling with depression and mental health issues since I was a child due to a lot of different traumas. My biggest problems are social situations. I’m either very clingy or push people away as much as I can, and I know that that makes me a bad person, so I almost tolerate every bad behavior towards me. But this person that I once called my best friend has been abusing me so much mentally that I just couldn’t take it anymore. So for the first time in my life I agreed to seeing a mental health professional and my first appointment will be in two weeks. Now here’s the problem:

My “best friend” is still in my friend group and my first appointment is *during school* so I don’t know what to tell them. I don’t want to make up a lie but I also don’t want them to ask questions like “You’re going to therapy?! But you’re always acting fine! So what’s the reason??”. Plus I don’t really want my whole class to know. It makes me really uncomfortable thinking about it. The last girl that publicly went to therapy in my class was a girl with anorexia, BPD and PTSD who had her whole arm cut open whenever she went to class. So I don’t want them all to think that I am that unstable as well. I am already the “weird” kid. Plus therapy isn’t as normalized in my country (Germany) as it is in America. 

(And a little bonus question: My mom told me the therapist said to her (on the phone) that she had to be with me for the first half of the session [I’m sixteen by the way] but I have an awful relationship with my mom and I always become a very ugly person when she is around me and I don’t want that to be the first impression that the therapist gets of me. So can I tell the therapist when the session starts that I don’t feel comfortable with my mom being there or will she think that I am rude or weird if I do so or simply say that that’s not even possible?"
1513,How to deal with jealousy &amp; Insecurities in a relationship,"In this blog, I’ll be sharing with you how to stop jealousy in relationships. If you have asked me maybe four years back, I would have looked at my life and said that I was somebody who would feel jealous quite often. I was in a relationship and if the girl that I was dating, at the time, was maybe talking to other guy or I felt threatened if she would go out to a club or she leaves her house for girl’s night out or may be some other reasons, I was someone, that in the back of my mind, would worry what if she talks to somebody else. 

4years ago she left me for this reason. I learned this hard way. I understand the pain. If you feel the same, I am here to solve the problem. Trust me, It’s a big issue if you seriously want a long term serious relationship.

I am going to share with you some ideas that changed my past relationships forever and help you to overcome jealousy in a relationship

Study in the United States found that one-third of couples who attended counseling cited Jealousy as the primary cause of their relationship.

Before you jump into the tips, I want to explain the difference between standard, healthy Jealousy- that kind of Jealousy that’s present in almost every romantic relationship.

And unhealthy Jealousy, which is often irrational and highly toxic to a relationship. 

Healthy Jealousy stands from genuine care and commitment to a relationship. This is the completely natural Jealousy that we all suffer occasionally. And it’s not something you should be worried about. 

Recognize that it’s perfectly normal to feel Jealousy’s jolt when you see your partner laughing and enjoying a conversation with someone of the opposite sex. I think these kinds of emotions because we’re invested in this relationship with our partner, and we are mostly ‘guarding our territory.’ 

It’s when people begin to act on these emotions, or when Jealousy becomes irrational, that thing moves into the ‘unhealthy’ sphere. 

Irrational Jealousy is more serious and tends to be a chronic issue that can erode the fabric of a relationship. 

Irrational Jealousy can have many different causes, usually related to the insecurity of low self-esteem. According to relationship psychology, the people who develop jealousy issues often have underlying insecurities resulting from past experiences. 

Whatever the cause, maybe, if you are the person who struggles with jealousy issues, then you can make changes to your behavior that will put these problems to rest. 

## ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR JEALOUSY IN RELATIONSHIP

Acknowledge your jealousy issues and their damage to your relationship. If you do not acknowledge this issue, then you can not solve your problem. If you are reading this hope, that’s mean you understand the importance. This first step to overcome jealousy in a relationship.

## JEALOUSY IS IRRATIONAL

Understand that your feelings of Jealousy are irrational. They’re merely unwanted. Unless your girlfriend or boyfriend has actually admitted to infidelity, or you’ve caught them, then your Jealousy is irrational. Recognize that your jealous feelings aren’t based on reality… they’re stemming from underlying insecurities and not from your spouse’s actual behaviors.

Once you’ve accepted that you’re feeling jealous for no good reason, then it can be easier to control those feelings and stop yourself from acting on them. Every time you feel jealous about something — for instance, when your spouse is texting someone of the opposite sex you haven’t met — remind yourself that your Jealousy is baseless and irrational.

You’ve probably texted someone of the opposite sex recently too, right? And I’m guessing it wasn’t because you were secretly having an affair with that person. The same is almost certainly true for your spouse, so there’s absolutely no reason to think that they’re doing anything shady or cheating on you.

Until you have clear evidence that proves otherwise, you must remind yourself that all feelings of Jealousy are irrational and unwarranted. If you remember this it will help you to overcome jealousy in a relationship

## LIST DOWN ALL YOUR INSECURITIES

Feelings of insecurity are nothing more than messages from our brain letting us know that we need to improve something. Write down why you are insecure ? are you comparing yourself with others ?? Do you think your girlfriend’s male friends are extremely successful ??[ Did your ex-girlfriend cheat on you?](https://www.mindspeace.com/overcome-breakup/) Remember, you are making a list for yourself because this is your relationship. If he/she leaves you, it is your loss. This is the most important thing to Overcome Jealousy in a Relationship.

Example: My insecurities were

1. I am an average looking guy.
2. I don’t have enough money.
3. Mine was ex cheat on me.
4. My girlfriend had so many male friends, and they had enough money. 

## IMPROVE YOUR SELF-IMAGE

Do you know that you have an image of yourself inside? When you stand in front of a mirror, you see a real reflection, but that’s not the real you. Self-image is one of the most significant investigations in modern psychology. Dr. Maxwell Maltz, who coined the term, told us, who have two images. One of our physical images and mental or inner image. Our mental image controls our daily lives. The people who changed their self-image, they changed everything in their life, relationship, income, friend circle everything. 

If you want to improve your self-image.. Start to study your mind, thoughts. Start to find out more about you. Understand your insecurities at a deep level.. Where do those insecurities come from ?? Who is responsible? If you can’t change them, then forgive them. Forgiveness doesn’t mean you are weak. Forgiveness means you care about your mental health.

1516,Parents want me (M17) out of house within the next month,[removed]
1517,Partner and I both avoid talking about feelings. But I'm comfortable talking to anonymous you.,"My partner and I have been together 10 years. We've never said the L word. We don't talk about feelings. In general I don't mind and think it's just a result of cultural upbringing. I imagine most couples (our demographics) are much closer because they can share feelings and sometimes feel like I'm ""missing out"" and this really upsets me.

I've tried to talk with my partner but they become argumentative. However I've never been clear or upfront with my feelings, I raise the topic indirectly. I'm sure they know where I'm trying to take the conversation and start an argument just to deflect the conversation. We've never have a deep conversation.

My partner's uncle and wife stayed at our house for a holiday the other year. The wife expressed how she was concerned about the health of my partner's dad. My partner and his uncle weren't in the room at the time.
I had no idea anything was wrong with my partner's dad and pretended I knew the story as I was too embarrassed to confess this was the first I heard of it. The wife mentioned my partner's sister (a Dr) wasn't sure if anything more could be done for my partner's dad.

Several months later we stopped by his parents house while in town for a wedding. The mum said the dad was upstairs in bed and I got the impression he may have either something like Alzheimer's and/or a physical condition that inhibits his mobility.  I wonder if my partner would tell me if his dad died. To be clear, it's not that he would keep it a secret, it's more that he just wouldn't mention it. I do think that should the worst happen my partner wouldn't tell me and attend the funeral without telling me. It's possible this has already occurred.

My partner has never made any comment about his dad being unwell. I don't feel comfortable to ask and I don't want to make him uncomfortable.

My partner has a strange spiteful streak and I wonder if they're not s actually reserved with their feelings as I am, but it's their spiteful streak and hence the argumentative reactions rather than checking to more subtly or just shutting down.

For example early into our relationship he told me about personal issue his brother had which I think would be a more sensitive topic than his father's health.

Early into our relationship I told him I didn't speak to my dad and I wasn't close with my mum and I had no desire of introducing him to her. My mum has met my siblings partners and has been horrible to them so I didn't want to go through that. Not long after we were in my partner's brothers car, the brother was driving and he expressed his strong opinions about how wrong it was that I wasn't going to introduce my partner to my parents. I wasn't offended but the conversation stands out in my mind cause I'm pretty sure the conversation didn't come up organically and I hadn't spoke to the brother about my views so it was like my partner confided in his brother and his brother wanted to call me out on it cause it was an issue for my partner.

They just got up and left. I feel alone. Did they even care in the first place? Maybe, they weren't friends but acquaintances and I got it all wrong. I've been sharing memes on my status saying that I don't feel good and not one person said anything. I know I'm being self centered, I don't want to be angry at people. I feel like a bad person for being angry at people who are just living their lives. I feel so selfish and guilty when I get angry, but those feelings still won't stop my anger. I keep reminding myself that they are busy and there's a pandemic going on but the anger won't go away. I think ""how can they just go away?""."

1523,Losing my mind as a Manchester United fan because of the football transfer window,"I am a Manchester United fan. We’re on the up performance-wise so if we get a few good players in, we can challenge for the title. The problem is, the transfer window for us is extremely stressful. We have terrible owners and a terrible CEO who just want to extract money from the club. The last few windows, the board didn’t back us completely because of which we didn’t perform as well as we could. The main thing is, every transfer is a fucking saga because our CEO Ed Woodward is terrible at closing deals and very good at creating drama for publicity. The window is open till the 5th of October but the season starts on the 12th of September(although it might start a week later for us). The manager would want all the new players at least a week before our first match to build team chemistry but I don’t know if we’ll sign any new players at all. I will be devastated if we don’t sign the players we need. I am not able to sleep properly, not able to study. I am on Reddit and twitter 15 hours a day to check for updates. I know that this window like any other window is ruining the mental health of United fans. We don’t deserve this. I also don’t like the person I am turning into because I’ve felt an unprecedented amount of hatred for Ed Woodward and the Glazers since the past couple of weeks. My anxiety and depression are as bad as they were before I started therapy. I just want to detach myself from all this but I cannot."
1524,Not sure what to do but I’m tired of feeling how I feel,"This is literally just a big dump of everything I’m thinking. I don’t have time/motivation to really put it into well articulated and complete thoughts. Idk maybe it is. I just want help. 

For the first time in my life I’m realizing my mental health is all out of whack and I don’t know what to do. This post might be a sign to talk about it but I’ve never been good at or sometime even able to talk about it. 

I had an abusive father growing up until he got more abusive and phased out of my life at about 17 years old. I’m now 23 and my wife and I just had our first baby and him and my wife are my whole entire world. However in the month leading up to his birth and then especially since then, my mental state has just taken a beating. 

I’m constantly filled with thoughts of being replaced in the eyes of my family and friends (no  resentment toward the baby or shade to them. He’s cuter and I totally understand they wanna see him). I feel more like I have become a disposable to my wife. Someone to fetch the diapers and bring in a paycheck and then if there’s time after the baby’s good, we’ll have a relationship. Which I get that the baby is taking a lot out of her. I’m trying to be understanding but my mind goes to bad places. 

More so, I have lots of feelings of inadequacy and falling short of what I should be and the things I should be doing. I’m working a full time job. Construction. New homes. 50+ hours a week. I honestly love what I do. It’s tiring and it’s hard work but I really love what I do and until recently I’ve always found a real satisfaction in the job. But lately there is a feeling that I’ve never felt before of absolutely falling short of what other expect of me. Most of all my mom. I love her so much but she is a bit of a scorned woman after two divorces. She has turned into a pretty hardcore feminist, which there’s nothing wrong with, but my mental state has me seeing things in a way where she totally disapproves of my job as a husband and a father. It’s been that way for our whole marriage but it’s become glaringly present in my mind since the baby came. She has sent my wife numerous texts and notes of how proud she is of her and the woman she is and how great she’s doing and in the same thread will tell me that I need to be better. My mental state reminds me of how scarcely she’s offered praise to me, causing me to think “why should I be deserving of that?” 

My wife through it all has heard a small portion of this. I’ve tried to give her a watered down version of this but I’m terrible with words especially in person. Typing this out has actually been incredibly therapeutic I guess. As I’ve told her she’s been sympathetic. She’s told me herself she’s never really had mental or emotional struggles to a certain degree in her life. She’s lived a relatively cookie cutter/picture perfect life and knows it. So she tries hard to he sympathetic and offers consolations that, with my mental state, feels like scripted lines in response to my venting. I appreciate and I think she loves me. But the expressions of love and appreciation and the reassurances have always been reactive. Never at least in the last 6 months have they been proactive. I love her so much and I do appreciate her consolations but my mental state causes me to question even that. 

It’s harder when about once a week, my wife has what seems like a snapping point where at a certain point she will burst out and say things to me about how selfish I am and call me stupid. This last time after her outburst she left for her parents house and continued to text me afterwards, as I tried to apologize for whatever might have provoked her, about how I don’t love her or our baby. It’s been the closest I’ve ever been to harming myself.  

TL;DR: Most of all my mental state causes me to believe I’m just a man who provides. And sometime I don’t even do that well enough. It causes me to believe and see evidence that I’m a bad father and sends me into a downward spiral that’s getting harder and harder to stop.

- Struggles with comparison
- Lack of desire/effort for sex life"
1525,What made you finally open up to someone about your mental health?," Ive always struggled with sucidal and depressive thoughts/severe anxiety as early as middle school and i have even attempted suicide before but it did not work out. Ive never told anyone about how off i feel or these suicide attempts, BPD and OCD run in my family heavily. I dont want to self diagnose myself ( not that theres anything wrong with that, i realize not alot of people are able to go out and talk to someone irl about this) but I feel like I do have BPD or Depression. I have weeks where i feel completley fine and very energetic but then i have periods that can last for months of me feeling incredibly anxious and like absolute shit. Quarantine has taken this behavior and multiplied it by 1000000, the past few weeks ive just been crying for no reason/feel like nothing has a point anymore/ and just want to sleep, i dont even want to talk to my friends anymore as i convinced myself they hate me. I hate feeling like this , how do you open up to doctors or family, i feel like im not valid/i have no reason to feel this way. I feel like ill finally gather the courage to talk to someone and theyll brush it off. How does someone bring this up to their doctor, if you have brought it up to a doctor what do they ask you? I have no idea what to do anymore and i hate this feeling so much i dont understand it"
1526,I have a question,"So lately I've had some arguments with a friend. But last night while showering I suddenly felt so overwhelmed and started crying for about half an hour. I then had the urge to harm myself. Not suicidal, I just like the pain because it distracts me from my stress (idk maybe I'm masochistic). I don't consider myself suicidal because I do still wanna live, it's just I consider pain as a stress relieving method. I also tend to find myself breaking down for no apparent reason, or just sudden feeling of being overwhelmed which leads to crying. What's wrong with me?"
1527,I don´t know what to do..,"Hello, for some context I am a 14 year old boy (yeah pretty young)  from germany and suffered from ADHD in elementry school.

Lately I´ve been feeling really weird, like I got so much anxiety at one day and like overthink all my decisions and feel really down. When I was in elementry school I had really hard ADHD and had to go to therapy and now for almost 1 Year I´ve been feeling like ""depressed"" I know many people are faking it these days but yeah.. And I the last 10 days I haven´t really eaten anything because every time I ate something I  had to throw up afterwards. In the beginning of the year I wanted to cut myself or do other things to hurt myself but I managed not to do it. And I don´t know what to do. I can´t really talk to anybody and I don´t wanna talk with my parents about this because they would prob send me somewhere. 

I hope that you guys maybe you what I am talking about."
1528,What’s wrong with me,So I used to date a girl and I was really attracted to her appearance I also really loved her and thought that she had at least the same feelings since she made the first move but then all of the sudden she broke up. I was really depressed and stared Smoking to get distracted off that situation and when I started feeling better I met this other girl. She is my girlfriend now and I really feel loved for being myself. But now I have to take some classes with the other girl and I start to feel sad again and also even though I hate to say it I still feel attracted to her. I won’t tell her anything neither will I try to get in touch with her but still. I don’t want to feel that deep sadness agin so what should I do?

1530,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I feel like the laziest person on earth. I am under the mental health team for unrelated stuff. I have manic episodes rarely which I’m taking medication for. Aside from that I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I get introspective all the time and look at my life and myself and try to think constructively about how I could change or improve. I have a few successes like having a girlfriend a job and a mortgage pending. In my spare time though I find it hard to get into anything. I do a lot better when I’m doing things with others like watching tv, playing games but I can never do those things when I’m by myself much. Even when I do those things with other people I seem to have a huge pull towards just being on my phone/on reddit and listening to music for hours on end. I try setting myself goals like get fit or do something productive and I just can’t. I guess it’s a lack of concentration/motivation. I don’t really have many friends outside of family and gf and I hate meeeting new people. I just feel like my life has no real substance. I feel like there’s so much I could be doing but I can’t even do normal shit that people enjoy. I have come very far these last 2 years by getting a job and a gf but I feel like I haven’t improved as a person. I have looked into the possibility of schizoid personality disorder and whilst that does cover a lot of my problems I don’t think I’d meet diagnostic criteria, I have looked into other things and I can relate to parts of it but not all. I don’t think I’m particularly social either unless it’s people I feel comfortable to be myself around but that circle is pretty small. I back out of social events and I hate mingling. I used to be popular and a leader but now I always take a back seat and I feel like I’m not in control any more. My gf is in control of our relationship. I feel like this can’t be normal and is this really how mentally well people live?"

1532,"I realized I don't just ""really like"" some songs/videos, I get obsessed and play them on loop for hours.","I used to think I *really* like some songs or videos. I would listen to them again and again, humming them or replaying the action in my mind. Nothing too harmful about it, except I would never just ""stop"" replaying it with any art, I had to get completely burned out by playing it constantly on repeat. But then again, some music is really just ***that*** good right?  
  
Several months ago, I watched a cinematic from a game I'm playing (I think specifics don't matter, but feel free to ask). Now that was absolutely stunning to me. Watched it once, and a few hours later watched it again. And again....and again. It's been 5 months and I can't stop thinking about it every day. If I don't watch it, and get completely burned out by it, I start feeling stressed, twitching and fidgeting on my chair and I absolutely can't get the itch of watching it out of my head.  
  
This is just the most recent (and extreme, time-wise) example. I have also had this happen with several songs but I manage to burn them out quickly by using them as alarms.  
  
My question is: what the fuck?

1533,I’m constantly scared,"I’ve never been scared before in my life from anything, then one day I saw something while driving home from my girlfriends apartment. I can’t describe what I saw but now I’m constantly scared. I don’t want to go to my psychiatrist and tell him because I don’t think he’ll believe me but now my head is scaring me by hearing things and seeing things. What should I do?"
1534,Going through the motions,"Title says it all. I don't really look forward to anything anymore, except for maybe hitting the bottle after work each night. Each day is a similar routine, nothing special. The things that have happened to me in the past year weigh me down tremendously, making it so much harder to just go through my shitty routine."
1535,How do I get more energy to do things in the day,"Hi, 

I don’t really know if this is a mental health problem or a me problem. But I find I get very fatigued even if I haven’t really done much in the day. It takes a huge amount of effort to do anything. 

I went to the town to get my eyes tested, grabbed some presents for my nieces’ birthday then immediately went home and fell into a nap. After when I was reminded I also have swimming this afternoon, I had an ‘oh god’ moment. 

I feel very achey and heavy, dreary eyes. I don’t have any kind of medical problem connected with this (I have seen the doctor), outside of my depression and anxiety. I drink a lot of Soda, which might have an adverse effect? Generally since lockdown (and even before), I don’t do much (because there’s nothing to do and it’s a main to get anywhere outside of my immediate village). 

I don’t know. I’m starting University in September, and my schedule is going to be a lot more full than the ‘one thing a day’ I’ve been doing for awhile - because I’ll be able to experience more of the world rather than be trapped in this village. If anybody has any tips on how I can stop feeling so exhausted after not doing much I would really appreciate it."

1537,Substance abuse is becoming a problem,"I was diagnosed Bipolar II in 2013 after a psychotic episode, and have (professionally) undiagnosed PMDD. Mental illness and substance abuse runs in my family on both sides. I have resolved and unresolved trauma that I deal with on almost a daily basis. In the past I’ve used alcohol/marijuana/pills to combat all the negative feelings and insecurity I feel, but as of recent years my drug of choice has been ketamine. I know it’s not as bad as opioids, but I long for the feeling of disassociation that I get with each high, and since May of this year it’s almost a daily thing. I’ve been told by a few people recently, including my partner, that I may be going overboard with my drug use. I usually just nod and agree, or tell them that no one would care if I was on or off anyways, which is a belief I hold. I really don’t want to take any recovery step so far as to go to rehab, but I absolutely loathe the days that I am sober and w/o K, and think about it non-stop. I believe the state that K puts me in helps alleviate my Bipolar symptoms and makes me less crazy and irrational, which is what psychiatrist prescribed medication has done for me in the past. I want to stop one day, so I can be healthy, keep more of my money and have a family one day but I’m not sure where to start. If anyone has any advice or relatable stories I would really appreciate to hear from you. Also if this is not the correct group to post this in, I apologize."

What should I do?"
1541,Seeing the state of the world makes me think I no longer want to live in it,"Everyday I hear about all the pain and injustices of the world. Climate change, racism, poverty and the growing financial gap. I hear about how all the billionaires and world leaders are basically screwing the world up the rest of the world and honestly I don’t think I can watch it get any worse. 

Society angers me and I feel like I can no longer live in a world full of greed and destruction. I honestly wish I was never born into such an ignorant society. I just can’t take it anymore. I can’t watch the world fall apart, and I certainly can’t watch the suffering continue and get worse. 

I just feel so infuriated by society and it’s actions. I can’t stand it. Everyday I constantly think of all the things I need to do to fix this world, but honestly I feel like it’s too far gone and I should just die before I have to feel even more of this anger and sorrow towards society. I feel like I need to escape from it all. From all of society’s conditionings and expectations, from all of the greed and ignorance and carelessness. But I can’t escape and I probably never will.

It’s strange because I have a pretty good life compared to so many others. I have a loving family, a good education and financial stability, yet I feel none of these things matter if I have to wake up in the morning and stand witness to the atrocities of mankind. People being massacred for their beliefs, billionaires taking money out of the pockets of those with barely anything, world leaders letting innocent animals die in the thousands for the sake of money.

It’s all too much. I know I could never bring myself to bring a child into this world and put it through such misery. I’ve had enough and I feel like the only worthwhile thing I can do is end my life."

1544,Why does everything have to be so hard?,"So this might just sound like a whole bunch of whining and I'm sorry. I just couldn't figure out where else to go to vent. 

I'm not in a state of depression (yet) and have an overall healthy mind (according to some of the tests I took). My problems have more to do with my physical illness (psoriasis) and the much uncertainty of this pandemic.

I am not even sure where to start.

I am married to a very loving but also troubled husband. He is currently in counseling for his mental health issues (anxiety) that were especially bad a year ago due to his high stress job. He quit his job after many years of struggling with it and found something that is better suited for him, even though his real dream is finishing writing and publishing his book that he has worked on for many years now. Problem is just finding time for it which I try to give him as much as I can. 

We also have a 4 year old that stays with me most of the week due to my husband's work and I am also trying to run a photography business that I started out just shortly before the pandemic hit. I have a hard time working a normal job due to my psoriasis as especially now most jobs require handwashing multiple times a day or wearing gloves (all that is killing my skin on my hands). 

I have tried a number of things to make all of this work, care for my son and making sure my husband is getting the time and space he needs and also working while not really making any money from it which is making me feel quite anxious. We are ok for now but our money will run out and the longer I go without making a dime the more worried it gets me and the less likely I'm able to stay organized (if at all).

Maybe this isn't as bad as it could be but it is something that has plagued me for the last 6 months since all of this chaos started to happen and I know what to do to get my business on the right track, I just can't seem to make it work.

I feel overwhelmed and I just can't stay focused on the task. I have all these projects in my head that I wanna do but I can't seem to finish any of them. I have trouble most days just keeping the house clean. It's starting to all come crashing down on me and I just have no idea where to go or what to do to keep moving."
1545,I cannot get out of bed,"So a bit of background: I’m currently in the city that my university is in because I have one in person class and no way to cancel the lease I signed last January. I spent the summer and most of spring with my sister and brother-in-law, so I wasn’t alone. Now I am and I cannot deal with it.

I thought I was continuing with my job from last year, but they changed my place of work on me so I need to learn everything all over again. I was talking to someone I met on Bumble and we were going to meet next week, but he just left me on read. Another friend stopped responding after 3 messages. My closest friend isn’t here because she had surgery and isn’t able to talk either (I still snap her but it isn’t the same). I talk to my family but they don’t really understand and are as helpful as they know how to be. I just feel terribly alone and like no one in the world would care if I ceased to exist tomorrow (I know that this isn’t true but it’s how I feel). I feel so isolated, like all the strings connecting me to someone else have become longer and longer, or disappeared completely.

Classes start next Monday but I’m in no mental space to be studying. I have been put on the list for therapy at my university but I haven’t heard back yet.

I feel betrayed because of my job change and the resulting absolute lack of familiarity. I was about to quit but then my supervisor talked to me and asked me to take 2 weeks off. I cried in her office and she was incredibly understanding, but I still don’t want my life anymore.

I’m incredibly awkward and socially anxious so dealing with people after 5 months of isolation makes me over analyze everything and decide that no one likes me. 

I honestly just want to stay in bed forever.

Thank you for reading and so sorry for the terribly long post."
1546,My feelings feel fake,"For the past year all my feelings have felt like I’m just faking it for attention even when I’m alone. I don’t feel connected to anyone anymore, and my anxiety isn’t helping. The only emotion I know is real is when I’m annoyed or angry other than that I just empty and bored of everything."
1547,"Stop saying ""How would your parents feel"" to the suicidal","It's completely condescending and unhelpful, 99% of the time the person has already considered these outcomes in their thinking. It further isolates the person from society - ""No good person would ever do that to there parents!!""; great job managing to make a person at the bottom of the barrel feel even worse.

What's even worse with this statement is not even considering that PERHAPS a great deal of the reason their mental health is so bad is BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS??? 

Just a personal rant from me based on an experience a few years ago, I deal with severely impulsive episodes and this was a statement from a fucking ""crisis counsellor"", and it very nearly pushed me over the edge.

Like what are you actually expecting when saying this? ""ah, actually never thought about it that way mate, thanks for the advice""."
1548,has having a routing/schedule helped with your mental health? it has with mine,"* having a schedule has:
   * helped me feel more productive:i'm able to not only ""mange my time"" better, but knowing what i should be spending my time helps me manage my energy into constructive activities as well
   * i've also incorporated times for ""mental health "" throughout the day. i.e schedule an hr or 2 out of the day if i really need to talk to someone, 5 minutes twice a day to write in my gratitude journal , etc."

Now I am counting calories and macros to lose some weight (hi Zoloft how are ya) while still eating different foods and it's a healthy and safe method. I find myself now thinking a lot about it a d feeling really guilty when I have a bad day and eat a whole bag of chips (oops). I noticed I weigh myself everyday and I keep pulling at my fat rolls or looking in the mirror. How can I understand when and if my brain goes in an unhealthy place?

I get extremely bothered by the fact that nothing on this earth is perfectly bilaterally symmetrical.

I have experienced nearly 40 years on this beautiful planet of ours and recently, with all of the crap that has gone on in the world in the last few months I find myself absolutely disgusted with the human race. I want to make it clear that I am neither suicidal nor homicidal, but fuck, I am having one hell of a time finding one redeeming quality in anyone who aligns themself with the right nowadays. I keep looking at the state of the world and I wonder what is the fucking point anymore? The air on my city is thick with smoke from a wildfire burning in the next county over. A fire which very nearly claimed the home of my brother and his family. When I was a kid, forest fires of this magnitude happened once in a blue moon. Nowadays its just another summer. Meanwhile dumbfuck climate change deniers are claiming that this shit is perfectly normal. Theres a pandemic going on and theres a selfish faction of people who refuse to take precautions seriously because the virus only kills the old and infirm so its just not their problem. They'll pick it up and spread it because fuck grandma, fuck grandpa, and fuck anybody with underlying conditions. Theres the orangutan in the whitehouse, who is currently trying to hobble our postal system in a desperate attempt to suppress votes. His list of transgressions against the American people over the last 3.5 years is miles long at this point and there is still a damn good chance the motherfucker is going to succeed in his game and get elected again because these right wing assholes are in denial. If we continue on this self destructive path there aint gonna be fuck all left worth saving in this world in a few short years. Its zero hour of the apocalypse. I can't see a point in going through the motions anymore. Im angry, depressed, and disgusted. I try and try to put on a happy face for my wife, my family, but i keep finding myself contemplating radical change. What is the use in working a 9-5.

1557,Any advice on coping with anxiety during COVID?,"I am not officially diagnosed with any mental illnesses, but this pandemic has taken a toll on my mental health.

I often feel very anxious when I think about the future or even my short term future even a month from now. I try to manage this feeling by trying to be productive during the day or exercising, but this only works every two days or so, and in between, I’m down again. When I ask my friends what they do to cope, they seem to be doing fine or they just splurge on online shopping. I don’t have a lot of money, so this isn’t an option for me.

It’s not exactly to the point where it’s debilitating I guess, but there are days when I just sleep an entire day away and still not feel rested, or days when I can’t sleep at all. And then I feel so guilty for wasting a fay not doing anything productive.

Therapy is out of the question since we don’t have a lot of money, free mental healthcare in my country is for the most severe cases, and we can barely afford my sister’s psychiatrist. (She’s bipolar and depressed) Everything is so uncertain right now and I hate it. I hate this feeling.

I guess what I’m asking is,
Do you have any effective ways to cope during this pandemic that you would be willing to recommend? (Hopefully nothing involving binge-watching as I feel guilty and feel like Im wasting time when I do this)"

1560,"Seeking online resources or books, any help really, for a teacher relative who had to unhappily retire due to technology changes. Feeling irrelevant, stupid, depressed with long history of depression.","I have a relative in The US who taught public elementary school over 30 years, has a Master's degree. The last 10 years has been strictly dedicated to teaching struggling children in one specific subject across several grades. (Think the Title-type classes for struggling math or reading students).

With virtual school taking over, that specialty position was temporarily done away with and the relative was told with only 2 weeks notice that they'd need to quickly get familiar with curriculum for an entire traditional teaching job of a specific grade (all subjects). In addition, they would need to learn how to create and use a virtual classroom with live meets for students, something they'd never done before. There was little support provided (the school system mostly sent everyone several YouTube videos with little other help)  and the teacher became so overwhelmed and stressed and just unable to figure it all out in such short notice. They left/retired a few days before school started and are now deeply depressed, crying, staying in bed in pajamas. There was no option to temporarily step aside until school resumed as normal. 

I don't know how to comfort them. I would like to find resources or things to read to help them cope and feel relevant."
1561,Is low testosterone affecting mental health ?,Sometimes I feel depressed and weak for no reason
1562,I think my parents are abusive.,"My father is always controlling the things I can do to the point of not letting me do exercise if he considers it's not time for it or that I should not do it. He's always complaining about anything I do. Did you not put this the way I told you? 5 to 10 minutes explanation of how it should be done his way and why even though I already heard it a thousand times. He wants me to do many things that when I fail at one he feels the right to scold me.

He tells me how to do the dinner when I'm in charge of doing it even though he has explained me how to do it every single time I have to. I feel dumb because he won't stop explaining even the most basic things like how to boil pasta or how much time do I have to leave the plate in the fucking microwave.

He is constantly controlling what I do and I can't do this fucking anymore. He always made sure I wouldn't go out at extraescolars (not English native so I'm not sure if this is how it's written). 
He first says no, then he will accept and say yes to make me shut up, and then he will say he doesn't allow me to go at the very least second. I've lost illusion. Now I'm not excited about anything.

He also has this way of thinking that people deserves to be scolded or even insulted because they don't understand by the good path. He used to hit me when I was young if I did not understand a thing. When he was teaching  me how to do maths for example he would do that. Now he doesn't do that anymore.

He's not a bad person but damn he is hurting me.

My mother is other case. She is oblivious and won't be there for you when you need it. I got very ill for a long period of time. Doctors did not see anything wrong with me so in place of looking more deeply she literally dumped me and assumed that all was psycologic. I am still scarred by that. The only one there was my father.

Sincerely I don't want to kill myself, I can't do that to my family, but I would love to have never existed. That would be so fucking fantastic. I'm tired, I'm so tired it's funny. In general being here is a joke but well. I guess I'll suffer until I end college and hopefully get a house if I am able to stand everything. If not I guess I'll die :)"
1563,Having Difficulty with Transition / New Chapter,"I recently moved back to my childhood home after graduating from my Master's program. I just had my last supervision Zoom with my supervisor from my internship this summer and when the call ended, a wave of sadness came over me. Throughout COVID, I have been consumed with my studies and then my internship, so I have not had any downtime to reflect on what I am doing next with my life until now. 

I feel so alone at the moment, back in my hometown. I have no friends here and my friends from university are scattered throughout the world. I feel like my life is empty. While my family loves me, I am not particularly close to them so being at home does not feel comfortable and I feel like my growth has stagnated. 

I miss college, being surrounded by my group of friends and always being in a group chat or having some little drama going on and being able to make plans with people everyday and having people to cheer me on when I would take risks. I miss brunch and concerts and gossiping and trying to get into parties and random loitering. 

Now, I feel like I am completely on my own and it is time to build a new life. My friends from college have built new lives for themselves in different cities and most of them are in long-term relationships, where they are intertwining their lives with their partners. They have their new friend groups and ""pods"" of people they hang out with. They'll answer my texts and we'll occasionally do Facetimes or movie nights, but I feel like I'm relying on them for social contact while they also have their new lives to attend to. 

I don't know what's next for me, especially in the world of COVID. I don't know how to create new relationships and connections or ""have a life"" again. I don't connect with anyone in my hometown because of my leftist politics and values so I feel even further isolated. I have no money to move because I just graduated and moved across the country to my hometown. 

I am worried that I will spend the next few months just binge watching Netflix while applying to jobs and ""wasting"" my 20s. There is nothing I feel excited about or that I am looking forward to at the moment and I feel like a child while watching my friends continue on their adult trajectories, while I hang out in my childhood bedroom. I hate that this ennui is making me look at my ex's social media page to further my depression spiral seeing him resume life partying with hot people in his country that has stopped the spread of the virus.  

Does anyone have advice, cheering up, or seeds of hope? I am scared of these feelings of boredom and I don't want to get into a depression rut of smoking weed and watching TV all day."
1564,Tw: ed,"I’m not diagnosed with an eating disorder, so I’m not sure if this is what I have. But could it be anxiety or depression that is causing absolutely all types of food to taste like shit? Everything is so bland and doesn’t satisfy me. I have no desire to eat sometimes.. As of recently I’ve been going through this period of not craving anything, literally eating only a snack a day, and feeling so nauseous afterwards bc of it. My mental states have always taken a toll on my eating habits ever since I was a teenager. It got really bad when I fell into depression in high school and just binged. Ate even when I wasn’t hungry, I would just eat to eat. And then even worse when my dad passed away last year in September.. after I went to his viewing I didn’t eat for 8 days straight. Not on purpose I was just sick to my stomach, I had no appetite whatsoever. The only reason I started eating again was bc I was over at my aunts house and she made both of us dinner, I didn’t want to not eat in front of her. And that slowly got me back to a normal eating routine. But months after and I am still going into these random periods of no appetite, like now.. Any advice helps"

1568,Need help with a friend [Very Long Post],"Hello, I admit that I find myself in need of some advice on how to help a friend of mine whose behavior is weird, tiresome and honestly, quite dangerous. This is going to be a long post but I need genuine help so thanks if you read through to the end. I will try to provide as many information as I can so that you will have a more complete idea of what is going on, so that you can make a better judgement of the situation and by extension give me more useful advice. Thank you so much for your help.

Let me provide some background information first about myself. First things first, I am a psychology student, so I am not entirely in the dark about the basics of psychology, but the thing is that I am not knowledgeable enough so that I can provide actual help for my friend. However, I think that with some advice from here, I could be able to make some kind of progress or at least be able to convince him to seek professional help. I don’t want to give off the impression that I am trying to play the therapist, but I do want to actually try and provide psychological support for my friend, even with my limited knowledge on the actual subject.

I don’t know were to begin to be honest, because this story is so confused in my head, and I have been shocked multiple times because of the things that I learned about the person I am trying to help and there are so many details that slip my mind as I write this but I will try my best to give the best account I can on this situation.

Firstly, I want to provide some general information about my group of friends, because this story involves most of them:

So, my group of friends consists of about 10 people and all of us are between 21 and 23 years of age, among them my girlfriend. I mention that because she is the reason I know most of the details about this problem since her best friend, whom I will refer to as Lisa, is in the epicenter of this story. If my girlfriend wasn’t my girlfriend I would know a lot less about this situation, but anyway.

Most of us smoke marijuana, and I mention that because I believe that it has played some kind of role, even a minute one, in creating this problem.

The person I am trying to help, whom I will call John, belongs to our group, but in the past couple of years has been slowly drifting apart from the rest of the group. I believe the reason for that is that we have different interests. Whereas most in the group are content with staying inside, or going to someone’s house and smoke joints and whatnot, John prefers to go out and have a drink, or eat at a restaurant, or go to a club. These are activities that he follows on a daily basis, and although very costly for us, he has the money and the energy to do these things every day. John has complained in the past that he is angry at us and feels that he does not fit in with the rest of the group anymore, because we would rather smoke inside than go out with him. We have explained to him multiple times, that there is no need for him to feel excluded since there are others in the group, like Lisa, who also do not smoke marijuana, yet hang out with us whenever we meet at one of our homes to which he has responded that he finds it very boring to stay inside. Additionally, we have also explained that most of us do not have the money to follow him on his preferred activities on a daily basis, but we would be happy to meet his “demands” halfway through. To be honest, we did not keep that promise, and we rarely went out with him, although that is also kind of his fault because he also rarely communicated with us after a point. This only helped though to create a chasm between him and the rest of the group.

Some additional information on John are that he would rarely be out of a relationship. Usually, he would get with someone else before he would break up with his current girlfriend. He is also known to have cheated on his girlfriends in the past, something that rubbed off very negatively on me. Additionally, something that seems weird to me, is that he has almost a nonexistent sense of humor, and rarely gets our jokes, and gets really awkward when someone makes a joke about him, almost as if he takes it personally. This to me indicates that he lacks some kind of social skills and is unable to distinguish between a joke or an irony and an actual insult.

Another thing I should mention is that John does not believe in psychologists. In other words, he believes that they are not efficient and that psychology is bullshit.

On to the actual unfolding of the event that culminated in my current situation:

Everything began about two years ago, when Lisa started having a crush on John. For about a year or so, they would find themselves in that awkward situation, were they would not openly admit they liked each other, yet they would exchange flirty and ambiguous messages, and would hang out by themselves without telling the rest of the group. It is also important to note, that throughout that year, John was in a relationship with another girl, with whom they were not doing very well as a couple for at least the latter half of that year. Anyway, about a year ago, most in our group went on a vacation, including me, Lisa and John. It was during that vacation that they got together, and for a couple of months afterwards, they were both very happy to be with each other, and they seemed to fit very well with one another, since both had very similar interests. However, after the honey moon phase started to fade out, some problems started arising. Lisa would often complain to us that her and John would fight and argue a lot, mostly about how to spend their time. Whereas Lisa would like to stay inside her home and just relax from time to time, John would prefer if they were together and hang out at all times. These fights became very common and occasionally very intense. The fights would usually conclude with Lisa backing down so as to calm the situation, but that meant of course, that John would get his way. That started becoming a problem for Lisa after a point, but the sad thing is that John was unable to realize that, and would consider things to be perfect, and that their relationship had no problems.

Things would go on like that for several months, with no new “developments” until that point in time when covid-19 started appearing and reaping throughout Europe. So, one day, John sent me a link for an online meeting since we were quarantined, that would take place through Zoom. That meeting, was a presentation that was part of a series of interactive seminars, which’s purpose was to “better one’s life” or “teach you how to be happy”. I immediately considered this to be a scam, and my worries were realized when I took part in the presentation. The main presenter was a fucking charlatan and every last one of his arguments and philosophies were utter and total bullshit. It seemed to me, that that guy prayed on people’s desperation and almost brain washed them with his stupid ideas, all so that his audience would reach a point where they would falsely believe their lives were bettered, so that they would invite more “victims” to pay for that bullshit. Every one in the audience, who had taken part in the previous presentations, spoke highly of that idiot’s life lessons and gave examples of how their lives got better yada yada yada. John was one of those stupid enough people to buy into that joker’s bullshit unfortunately. And after those seminars were concluded, Lisa complained that John had become worse. Demanding more from Lisa, not allowing her to spend time alone, or with her friends, and basically going against her every time she wanted to do something without him. He would go on to belittle her and make her feel bad for pointless things, like uploading photos on Instagram, which he considered slutty (they were not, I saw them). All this has resulted in breaking Lisa’s confidence and self-esteem, and she is now basically more akin to his slave rather than his girlfriend since she rarely goes against his wishes and actually does something without him. Of course, when John is in front of the rest of the group he behaves normally, most of the time, and shows little signs of that behavior, so anything I know about her situation is mostly because she has told my girlfriend and in turn she told me, or Lisa has told me herself.

A couple more months go by, the quarantine ended, and one day, my girlfriend comes to me shocked after a night out with the girls. It was one of the rare occasions where Lisa had managed to join them for a drink. They caught up with each other, and Lisa mentioned something to them that actually haunts me until now. She was very reluctant about talking about that event with the rest of her friends. Basically, Lisa and John were in his car, returning from a weekend they spend in John’s secondary residence. They would have a fight while they were on the road, and even though Lisa, and possibly also John, cannot remember what they were arguing about, their fight got so fierce and intense, that John got so angry, which caused him to speed up reaching almost 125 mph/200 kph in a road with a 55 mph/90 kph speed limit, knowingly and purposefully pass a red light and aiming to hit a truck, only to stop mere inched before hitting it, all the while screaming that if they were to die they would die then and there and that they should die together because he loves her and other such bullshit. Lisa also mentioned that it was not the first time that he had done something like that. John explained that he only intended to scare Lisa (I don’t believe that), but he could have easily lost control of the car. And even if that was his purpose and had complete control over his car at that speed, nobody should do that to their girlfriends for a stupid argument. Jesus fucking Christ, I drive like a pussy whenever I have as a passenger one of my friends or my girlfriend so as to not endanger them, and that fucking asshole almost killed Lisa for no reason at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think this is the cherry on top of the icing on the shitty things John has done to his girlfriend, and is obviously a display of very dangerous behavior. This is basically the reason I feel I have to seek as much help as I can, because he could easily kill someone. 

Again, a couple more months go by, and the time comes when we go on vacation. There were six of us this time, compared to the eleven that were last year. Early June we created a group chat, consisting of those of us available for vacation. This group consisted of me, my girlfriend, Lisa, John, a couple others. Late June we finally agree to go to Amorgos, an island in the Cyclades. As we are in the process of searching for a place to stay and a way to get there, John, suddenly realized that he did not want to go to Amorgos, because the ship to get there took 9 hours, and he did not want to risk getting infected from covid because of the long exposure to the ship’s other passengers. Acceptable as that reason was, John had already made plans to go with Lisa on vacation on their own, and they would anyway get into a ship, and they would stay on it for approximately 4-5 hours. Anyway, we agreed to change the destination to something approachable by car. We settled that we would go there from the 4th of August until the 8th. John didn’t like that, because he wanted to stay more but none of us could do that. Anyway, after we explained why we couldn’t stay more, we moved on and found a place to stay, no thanks to John, who was expecting everything to be organized by the rest of us, while he did nothing and ultimately constantly had complaints about how we organized the trip. He would bring up the matter of how long we would stay multiple times, as if we could do anything, demanding we stay more days on vacation. We explained multiple times why we couldn’t and although he seemed to get it, after a couple days, he would again demand that we stay longer. This continued until four days before we left, and even four days before our vacation he would get angry at us and would demand we find a way to stay more days. He was unable to understand that we could not do that four days before we left, and wanted five people to conform to his demands even though we had backed down multiple times. He was also restrained by his work, and wanted us to wait for him so that he could join us, and didn’t leave us to organize our vacations the way we wanted.

I mention our vacations because we spend more time with John during those four days, than we had for the whole year. It opened our eyes to the severity of the problem even though this trip was the worst of my life because of him. So, when the four of us got there, John was on the way with Lisa, and he would try to control which places we would visit until he got there, so as to not miss anything. The second day he would demand we go on a certain beach, which the rest of us did not want to go to, but we went anyway. He would be unable to make decisions on where to eat etc. and was a pain in the ass for all the five days we were there. On the third day, we rented a boat, which was what John wanted. Nobody else wanted that damn boat. Anyway, we took the boat, and he would not let anyone else drive it because he was the only one with an appropriate license, even though the boat did not require one to drive it. Basically, he made 5 people pay 20 euros each, so that he could fulfill his captain fantasies. The purpose of the boat was to visit as many beaches in the island as we could, which of course we didn’t do, because John was hungry and stopped the tour in the middle so that we would go and eat. Of course, afterwards no one was able to get in the water because we had eaten a shit ton of food, and so we just turned back. Throughout the tour, John did a lot of mean and stupid things. We almost hit another boat out of his seer desire to display his sailing skills, he would on occasion yell at us things like “shut up” out of anger and because “we didn’t know any better” even though we also almost crushed the boat on some rocks because John is an idiot. He got in a fight with Lisa in front of everyone for no reason, and you get the gist. After we got off the boat, he didn’t even speak to us, even though we went and grabbed another bite at a cafeteria on the port which of course was what he wanted to do. He was also late for that “bite”, as he went with Lisa to talk and argue about their fight in the boat. After we got back at our room, the four of us decided to stay in, because it was already too late for us to bathe and go out. John however, wanted to go out, and of course he dragged Lisa with him, even though she wanted to stay. They left, and came back around three hours later. When they came back, he could not find a parking spot, so John called us to move our car so that he could park his. Of course, we didn’t do that, and he went on to find a place to leave his car. He was obviously very irritated in general and very angry for some reason, which we never learned. As he was searching for parking, he would pump the gas so that the engine would rev and roar and mind you, our hotel was in the middle of a very old-fashioned village, in which lived only old people with very little sound proofing. So, it must have been around 3 am, and he would make as much noise as possible. At one point, he would try to fit his car through a gap so that he could make a U-turn. Because he couldn’t fit his car, he got out, started shouting and cursing and he took a lantern he found in front of him, smashed it and through it with force, and I think he hit another car with it. All that for a damn parking spot. Of course, the rest four of us had enough, and ganged him. We forced him into a conversation so that we could understand what was wrong. He was in a defensive stance at all times, and would spout bullshit like “I don’t care about your opinions” and he would yell at the girls specifically, even his girlfriend, to shut up and not talk. We got nothing out of this conversation, and even though he seemed to soften after a point and understand what we were telling him, the next day, Lisa told us that he understood nothing of what we had told him. In general, he displayed an inability to get himself hypothetically into other people’s situations and could not see things from others’ perspectives. 

There are two more days left on our trip but this is getting too long (3000 words, sheesh) even though there are many more details I skipped so as to not make this post a whole book. Thanks for reading what could easily be a master’s thesis, and if there is any inconsistency or question please point it out or ask me in the comments. This person obviously has anger issues, and seems reluctant to seek psychological help because he does not believe in it. So what I want, is to get advice on how to proceed from here. I believe that the best course of action is to convince him to seek professional help obviously, since I am not qualified in any way to help him but I don't know how to do that. Thank you so much!!!"

I'm a 17 year old girl and have been thinking and reading about ADD for one and a half year now with the concerns about having it. I really want to go to the doctor to talk about it when I turn 18. I really have no interest in telling my parents, because I don't think they will take me seriously.

Ofcourse I don't just think I have it. I have been thinking about things in my childhood and my behaviour in which I see a lot of 'symptoms' such as no concentration and being easily distracted by my own thoughts (I have always got in trouble for it). Now ofcourse I think every kid probably has the same experience, but it never really went away with me and am still very much struggling with it.

This might not be very well thought out by the way i'm writing this. My head is full of things I want to write out, but I can't wrap my head around it.

1576,My brother is suicidal,"My brother has been struggling with depression for 8 years, I haven't really formed a connection with him because it's hard to connect with someone who's in such a state. He's now 24 and i'm 22, that made it even harder because at such a young age (14) I had no clue what depression was or feels like. My brother has really gotten to a point where he doesn't seem like a human being anymore, he's very disconnected from reality. He has mentioned suïcide and death a couple of times to my mom when they are talking. My mother is in complete distress and can barely function anymore. I get along very well with my mom and I need to support her constantly, which also has a toll on me ofc. Because I don't have a connection with my brother, I suffer less from his situation. Yes I'd like for him to get better ofc but still almost never talking to your brother for 8 years, makes you forget that you have a brother sometimes. I also have two retake exams and somehow i'm supposed to be focussed on studying, I think is studied for about 2 hours today. I feel mentally ok for a person that is in this kind of situation. Ps. Whe're trying to get him in some sort of mental institution but that's not super easy."

I don't know if it's the new me or if it's losing the old me.

All I can see is that I was emotion less before but now my emotionlessness has formed into regret which is making me compulsive to bear things.

I've been trying to self harm by making my finger joints reach a particular point where the tendons would start stretching.

It feels bad but in comparison to the regrets I am having it is pretty normal.

I might also start using sharp objects if my mind doesn't stay focused.

Anyway; enough rambling. I'm here to vent my frustrations, desperate that in doing so I will be provided with some clarity and relief, even it is to be only temporary. The title encapsulates my daily mindspace; I'm never really at peace with myself and I couldn't recognise true relaxation if my life depended on it. I've struggled with OCD/OCPD for years now and, to me, the distinction matters little because they're both conditions that can and do make life a living torment.

My OCD is never static, and if I manage to oust one compulsion from my life, another will surely follow in its wake. Currently, I'm waging a war against an intrusive thought that seeks to undermine my intelligence to such a degree that life itself for me threatens to grind to a very sudden and messy halt. A couple of weeks ago, I lost my temper with OCD and flew into a vicious rage. Demented, I felt like harming myself in some way was a sensible course of action, so I picked up the closest item to me and smashed my head into it. Once I'd calmed down, I sought medical advice and had sustained only a superficial wound. However, that stupid action sent me into a tailspin, and now I can't shake the idea that I've ruined what level of intelligence I had, despite a qualified medical professional assuring me that there was no damage beyond the skin of my forehead. On top of that, my mind keeps stressing to me that ""headbanging"", a way in which a metalhead such as myself expresses enjoyment of music has also impacted the capabilities of my hateful pink Hell-generator. What a glorious life I am blessed to live.

TL;DR: My brain = broken. Fucking fed up with the c\*\*t now."

I recently saw a tiktok about a girl with bipolar disorder talking about the exact thing I've struggled with and it not only shocks me that someone else feels the same way I do but it also makes me wonder if it might be that I have the same mental illness?  


I struggle with making and keeping friends, I only have a handful of true friends that remain my friends no matter what but over the years, I've met a lot of people and I have this thing where I attract people for some reason? people like me and wanna be my friends and sometimes, some people get suuuper attached to me and for some reason, I get attached to them as well, we start talking a lot, hanging out a lot until for some reason, all of a sudden, I start getting tired of them. Like I get really suffocated by them and even repulsed by them and can't stand even being in the same room as them so I just cut off all contact with them and start ghosting them until they get the message and leave me alone? and I feel like such an asshole for it, but I can't help it so I've been refraining from making new friends with the fear of that happening and not wanting to hurt anyone.   


It's weird because it doesn't happen with everyone, I have 4 good friends and even 1 best friend that I adore and never get tired of them but somehow, anyone that's not them, I like them for a couple of weeks or months and then suddenly hate them, like i can't stand them, anything they do annoys me and I have no clue why this happens, I wish it didn't bc I don't want to hurt people and these people really cared for me and I know it's horrible and shitty to just ghost people and cut off all contact when we used to be close but I really can't help it bc talking to them just makes me feel uncomfortable and annoyed.

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illness aside from severe depression and anxiety over the course of 2 sessions I had with a psychotherapist but once they recommended me medication, my mom stopped paying for therapy because she's 100% against medication and even though it's been a couple of years and I'm not a minor anymore, I'm recently getting a job and don't have money to pay for a therapist. I know I must have some mental illness, or illnesses, I've known since I was a child that someone's not quite right with me but my parents always dismissed any attempt I had of trying to get some help for my mental health. I think I might have adhd or autism? I relate to every things I've read about adhd and a lot of things about autsim but again, it's just an assumption, as I haven't been diagnosed with anything since I haven't gone enough times to a professional to get the help I need. but anyway, this is only one of the problems I've been facing and I wonder if maybe someone else relates to my experience or if someone knows why I act this way?"
1590,How to switch psychiatrist? (UK),Do I need to be re-referred by my GP? I see my psychiatrist privately.
1591,How to deal with potential abandonment anxiety?,"Let me say right off the bat, I wasn’t diagnosed with this but everything I read about points to what I mention in the title. 

To get started, I (18M) have dealt with this sort of thing for the past few years. I’d say since the beginning of high school. It mainly shows itself in relationships, only to myself however. I don’t like to talk about it with others out of fear of them thinking I’m a paranoid control freak or something. 

In let’s say romantic relationships for example, it always starts out fine, but over time I get this constant feeling of nervousness/anxiety that at any moment they’re gonna drop me essentially. I don’t really know where it stems from but I always feel like I’m a day away from receiving the “Dear John” letter. On top of this I’m extremely perceptive, which only serves to exacerbate the issue, as I worry that everything is a sign that they’re going to leave me soon. 

This issue has really sabotaged some things for me in the past, I want to know how to get over it now because there are certain people in my life I really care about, and I want to be the best I can be for them. Any help is appreciated."
1592,Can’t tell if I’m just lazy or depressed,"Since I don’t have to go to school anymore, I don’t have any motivation to do simple tasks like brush my teeth or take a bath. I just lay on my bed all day. Sometimes it feels like I’m sleeping even when I’m awake. I feel like I’m in a cage, barred off from reality. Everything is hazy. I hate not doing anything but I don’t want to do anything either. 

Sometimes I get this feeling where I want to get things done. Energy. And I do get things done. And it feels good. But this feeling fades away pretty quickly and it’s very rare. 

Insignificant things my mom says make me cry for hours. Sometimes she says huge things and I don’t give a fuck. I dunno what to do. 

I hate this.

The question is, how do I force myself to get things done on days I don’t care whether I live or die? How do I stop getting these weird mood swings."
1593,Have you been disregarded by doctors?,"I have struggled with mental health, and with my health care situation for my whole life. I'd like to write about the problem of doctors who disregard or don't take seriously, the mental health issues of their patients. I'd really like to get some real opinions, stories, experiences (besides my own) to show what its like to traverse the health care system with mental illness. If you've had great doctors, those stories are welcome too! Just let me know how your experiences have been with doctors...

Thanks so much!"
1594,Severe Pre-sleep anxiety,[removed]
1595,I’m not okay..,"I’m constantly feeling down, the occasional time that i am happy is shut down so quickly and i can’t cope anymore."
1596,Fear (my anxiety vent post),"The thing with fear is that it looms over you like a dark cloud. You are afraid of scenarios that you know that will 9 out of 10 times not happen. even if it ends up being so bad like you imagined, you still can come home to a space that accepts you and all your faults. It's a curse that prevents the talented and smart from achieving their full potential purely because of the fear to fail. It prevents people from making mistakes or rather seeing their mistakes as nothing more than what it is, a mistake, and not the end of the whole world.

Fear is the inability to do tasks your age group has no problem doing. The inability to just get over yourself and do what you're supposed to do. Not because you don't want to do it, but the fact that you feel like you will explode if the task at hand isn't over fast!

Fear is feeling like your whole life will be tainted if you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. Or just plainly feeling you're not doing your job good enough. It's worrying about money, careers, family, friends. But it's also worrying if the thing you bought for fun wasn't too expensive. It's worrying if you're dressing right and if it's not much (or is it too plain?)

Fear is laughing and having fun with your friends, but afterwards worrying if some of what you said made you less likeable. It's doubting if the present you got for a friend was good enough and wondering if they even liked it. It is hard to get and keep friends and feeling like a bad one yourself for not being a good one.

Fear is panicking over the small stuff and wondering why you panicked after the thing has already happened. It's fearing that you will be late and showing up way too early even though you could've have gotten half an hour more sleep easily.  


Fear is regretting that you didn't make mistakes when you were younger so you could know how to handle it better. It's doing well in class and trying to be the perfect student even though you struggle with your studies. It's saying yes to every favor and then stressing that you don't actually want it.  


Fear is being incredibly happy that you got your degree but scared to practice your art because you think that you're not in the slightest bit qualified. It's having almost a decade of practice and still thinking this.

Fear is thinking you are garbage in comparison to your peers and being embarrassed how much farther they are in life that you are. It's also being a role model for people that think that you are such a good student and while they are depending on you, you're still thinking that you are doing a bad job and trying to mask this.

Fear is being so focused on your thoughts and fears that you do not hear what the others are saying, it's focussing on your heartbeat so much it starts beating so fast you break out in sweats and start crying seemingly without reason. 

Fear is sticking to what you know and staying home because going out and doing stuff requires your brain to work overtime and sometimes it's just too much to handle. It's lashing out when people ask too much because explaining how your brain works is so much work.

Fear is not being able to get to sleep fast because you wonder about the thing bad thing you said last year to someone still sits in the back of your mind. And even though you met with this person a lot after that and they probably already forgot it. Your brain just likes to focus on it.

Fear is getting incredibly angry at people asking you to ''just take it easy'' and ''chill out'' and ''not worry about it'' because you just don't work that way, but you don't want to tell what's going on.

Fear is still trying to function like a normal person and trying to mask how you really actually feel and a lot of the time succeeding without fail, but coming home and having a complete meltdown because of the stress you're under."
1597,I am very sensitive. I feel like I can't stop myself from constant negative overreactions and it's so exhausting and painful.,"I know I can always work on myself and improve, and that everyone feels pain and struggles, but for me it's just almost non stop emotional pain. No matter how cognitively aware I am of my biases and overreactions I can't seem to shut off the part of my brain that keeps flooding me with ""emotional pain chemicals.""

I wonder sometimes whether, when thinkers give advice to feelers like me, they understand that even if I KNOW that my reaction or hurt is totally irrational (and I'm talking about when I really *am* crying over nothing) that that knowledge doesn't lessen the intensity of the feeling, or really make me feel better in any way. And that usually I am already very aware on a cognitive level that my feelings are irrational, but the feeling itself is intense, primal, even infantile.

Despite knowing I am overreacting, I feel *physical pain* in my head, which begins to throb any time I feel intense embarrassment, rejection or other hurt. I also feel unable to hold back tears. My face gets red and hot and my heart begins to race and there is a distinct but hard to describe aching/clenching sensation.

I don't really know how to describe it other than that I feel this sudden and intense burst of shame or longing and on top of that there is my brain and the people around me saying ""you are thinking to much about it, there's nothing to cry about, you are imagining things, people love you."" But it doesn't do anything to help me feel less bad. I already know all of that stuff.

I can detach and ""observe"" my thoughts and feelings all I want. I can choose not to identify with them, but I don't know of any way to stop the physical sensations, the intense psychic pain, or the need for some kind of release, like crying."
1598,"Is there Imposter Syndrome, but for relationships rather than work?","Every article and post I read about it describes me perfectly, but when applied to my romantic relationship. 

I feel like I don't deserve that person, I feel like I haven't done anything for them, I feel like one day they'll see how awful I am and leave, every time they praise me I think ""oh God, why would you think that""? 

And yet logically, I know that I could and would and do crawl out of my skin for my partner. I just can't feel like it actually helps them. 

And yet every time I try to do research on Imposter Syndrome it brings up work or success or accomplishment, which I don't have this struggle with. 

So... Is this a thing? Does it have a name? Is it still Imposter Syndrome? 

Or is it just nothing."
1599,Grandpa won't help fix his situation after attempting suicide,[removed]
1600,I was doing really good and then a tummy bug reignited my intense hypochondria,"Okay, so about half-way through lockdown I was confronted with a complete shift in mind-set and sudden decrease in my mental health. I went from having a good mental health (let’s say good to the point that if I went to a Dr I would not get a diagnosis), but I was at an anxious disposition then and have always been - to just plummeting and having absolutely no control over my emotions. My anxiety’s manifested through intense, practically debilitating hypochondria. If I was to give a complete, comprehensive explanation of everything that happened, this could be a novel - so let’s just say that I went through my ups and downs but finally got to a stable place very recently where I was feeling amazing! I had done everything to help myself; I changed my diet to be much more healthy, I practised a lot more self-care, I read lots of things. Everything that I had done to benefit myself had all cane to fruition and I was feeling incredible as a result... almost euphoric. 

But then, of course, I got a tummy bug, and to someone with health anxiety a tummy bug is not just a tummy bug, it’s 7 different types of cancers and a ruptured colon - figuratively speaking. I’m sorry to the sensitive stomachs out there, but it’s gonna be hard for me to explain my experience without getting into the graphics and TMI’s of a stomach bug (gastroenteritis). So, I began having that horrible yucky feeling you get when somethings going on in your stomach, that unsettled cold-sweat if anyone knows what I’m talking about. I had improved my mental health so much, this didn’t even worry me, I just accepted that that was how I felt for a second and moved on! But then, the following morning I was up at 4:30AM with pretty intense waves of stomach cramps and diarrhoea. No vomit thank god! I hate vomit. But yeah, that carried on for the following morning, but suddenly - I found blood. I had had tomatoes that morning so I was begging for reassurance from my nurse mother that this was just tomatoes (AH, I’m cringing at the TMI) and she was incessantly telling me that that was all it was and that I was fine. I’m pretty convinced in retrospect that it was blood, but I don’t think it’s terribly serious as this can sometimes happen with repeated diarrhoea - contrary to the hundreds of medical websites that told me to seek urgent medical advice. I cried most of that day because of this. Just overwhelmed with stress. My mind was racing with all the different scenarios that could play out - a Dr giving me a colonoscopy, finding some sort of cancer, or me being in excruciating pain and doubling over and dying. Yeah. THANK THE LORDS ABOVE, the blood stopped. 

The following morning I woke up in the same fashion, woken by stomach cramps but this time a little later. Day went out fine, I just ate bland foods that the internet recommended, but very little (I.e the BRAT diet: Bananas, Rice, Apple sauce and toast) and this decreased the stomach cramps and made me feel generally better. Fast forward to today. I woke up fine, still early, then 5 minutes later I got some tummy pains, not as intense as before, but there. Went to the toilet, all was good... yeah. But all day I’ve had constipation and it’s just made my mind go crazy! I haven’t been able to relax whatsoever. I convinced myself multiple times that I can’t touch a piece of food because it will clog up my guts and I’ll have to go to hospital and have a really unpleasant experience. I was talking to my mum about all the things that were crossing my mind and I just began to cry because of how overwhelmed I’ve made myself. And on top of all this, GCSE results today - did good! All Bs, so that was fine. Something about constipation doesn’t sit well WHATSOEVER with my health anxiety. It gives me this intense trapped feeling and makes me feel like I’m about to go into a panic attack. I’ve convinced myself I have a plethora of different abdominal diseases, even cervical cancer. I’m laying in bed now, I feel fine, just feel constipated and have lower back pain but dear god have I terrified myself. I just feel like I’m gonna throw up from anxiety and like my throat is closing. I feel physically completely fine but I’m just so mentally trained that I’m telling myself all these horrible things and the weird feeling in my tummy isn’t helping. I feel like crying."
1601,I feel like a monster because people perceive me differently than I think,"I'm a woman in my early 20s and I've felt very misunderstood countless times throughout my life.
A summary of every single situation:
I'm speaking to someone or I'm in a group, everything is normal and I'm having a blast, later on someone tells me that I was being rude/aggressive/making someone uncomfortable/too loud etc. I end up hating myself and cry.
This has happened so many times, over years and with all sorts of people that I know that they're right. 
When I ask what exactly it was that I've said the answer is usually that it was just my tone or overall vibe. 
I've developed depression, social anxiety and I used to whisper because of this. 
I don't understand how I can perceive myself so differently."
1602,"I spend all my ""free"" time waiting for my mom to leave the house and then when she leaves I do absolutely nothing as a way of ""enjoying"" my peace and quiet. How do I stop this?","I have a real issue with myself, which is that I never want to ""do my own thing"" if my mom is around. I consider her to be judgmental so I don't like doing things around her. Now, when she leaves, I STILL don't end up doing my own thing. I feel like when she leaves I want to spend that precious time relaxing and laying down on my phone rather than doing something productive. So I feel like I just never do my own thing or enjoy my time and I don't know how? 

I woke up at 11am and my mom isn't working today so I've done nothing except idly go on the internet all day, waiting for her to leave. It's 2pm now. I need to go to the pharmacy and also update my resume today and have no desire to do either. I don't want her to ask me about either of those things so I don't want to do it when she's here (even tho I don't even have to tell her I'm doing those things) which is resulting in me sitting around waiting for the possibility of her to leave. I've been doing nothing for 3 hours and I could've done both of my errands by now without ""wasting"" any alone time cause she hasn't left. 

I don't know. I don't really know what my problem is. I want to be productive but I have high anxiety about doing things and about enjoying the things I do."
1603,"Aspergers,","I lived a pretty normal life with no acknowledged mental issues to speak of up until rather recently. (a few years ago)  
when i messed up my studies by not attending them however; my parents quickly sent me to a psychiatrist. By this time i was 20 years old. This was my first real experience with a psychiatrist, i'd gone to school therapists before due to often being alone during school hours but that was more a ""Are you being bullied?"" type of deal.  
This time however I was really talking about my mental state with this psychiatrist.   
I tried to explain how i dont have any motivation to do.. anything really. The Psychiatrist came to the conclusion that she couldnt help me. But she also had me take a test. This test revealed that i'm on the Autism-spectrum and have Aspergers. Most likely also depression, which i was given medicine for. It didnt appear to have any effect however and before i could try another type i went back to university for another attempt. this time with supposed 'aid' for my aspergers diagnosis.

Didnt quite work out that time either. Aid for aspergers or not.. The main issue was my extreme lack of motivation. An issue that didnt just extend to university or work. But to most if not all spectrums of my life.   
The First time i went to university i already dropped every single one of my old classmates from my social circle. i wasnt exactly much in contact with them in the first place however so that wasnt too large a change. But i also dropped many of my online friends. I simply could not think of a reason to talk to those friends.  
Now the second time i went up i started to find i could no longer motivate myself to do other things i used to enjoy. Even playing videogames or reading books, the only two interests i'd had most of my life, just didnt seem all that interesting anymore.  
By this point i'm also aware of how much i've messed up my education, I couldnt even work up the motivation to apply for a loan to pay my studies and was instead using up my savings. Months passed and i grew less and less interested in the future, often wondering if life would really be worth living? after all i had no interests to keep me happy. I was not interested in a family, and i saw no point in living on only to pay back society. I wasnt exactly sad or discontent. I was really just extremely bored and couldnt quite see a purpouse to continue living. But i was certainly scared of dying.  
I also started watching Isekai anime at around this time. I dont believe in the afterlife or anything as such.   
This made the idea of suicide easier as even if i didnt truly believe it; i could atleast lie to myself that maybe, just maybe there'll be a next life where I can actually enjoy life.  
Before i really managed to work up the courage all the way i got caught by my parents. They found out i hadnt been going to University. I then went to a University specializing in people on the autism spectrum but.. ran out of savings and couldnt continue. I also could no longer apply for a study-loan as i had technically failed studying twice now.  


This brings us to the present. I've gone to a new psychiatrist. But the only thing she's ever told me is to get more excercise and daylight. I've done both, multiple times over many years. they make it worse. She refuses to accept that idea so we've never gotten anywhere.  
Currently i have i have depression that comes and goes once or twice a month, during this time nothing i can imagine can interest me in any way, but at the same time i'm itching to do \*something\* and have a hard time to sit still.   
usually i end up moving between my desk, bed, bathroom and living room staring at nothing and trying to figure out what to do. It likely doesnt sound very serious. I'm not entirely sure how to describe it after all. But these are the moments i seriously consider suicide. during these times nothing feels right.  
Outside of those periods i do nothing but read books. Alot of books. Anywhere between 100 and 250 chapters a day, of webnovels that is. I've run out of books on multiple sites i've used to visit. I only really read Fantasy as a genre so there's a somewhat limited quantity. I barely do anything else, and even when i try; i never enjoy them for more than an hour or two.  
I Only have one friend/social contact i talk to semi-regularly as i lost interest even in talking to people.  
I'm well aware at this point that i'm only reading to keep myself occupied. I cant see anything i want to do in the future as far as my life goes. The only real reason i'm not killing myself is because i quite frankly dont have the courage to.  
If my life situation gets worse; i might manage to work up the courage. But what i'm here to ask; is there a way to solve this? a way to re-awaken motivation?  
Even making a post like this on reddit is a decision i made 2 years ago. it took until today before i finally actually did it, and i've been thinking about it pretty much daily for the past few weeks. 

It's really difficult to even ask for help as i'm often not even sure i want help."

&amp;#x200B;

In that spirit, I shall take this leap of faith.

While I hope to make enough money to pay the bills, to help me get by, and to allow me to support causes I believe in;

First and foremost:

I hope to improve quality of life, and change the world for the better, as much as I am able.

&amp;#x200B;

To lean this world we share toward balance, and away from intolerable extremism;

Away from hate, ignorance, malevolence, and cycles of violence and abuse.

I hope to help people see more, to understand their own weakness, to find their own inner strength to confront insufficiency, and their own inner brilliance to find wisdom.

I hope to speak at great length, and in whatever detail necessary, about uncomfortable subjects that deserve speaking about; to make life more comprehensible and more bearable for people who have felt left behind or made less, whatever the original cause.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a broken home, born into turmoil, and am quite familiar with the sense of being left behind.

My father gone without proper explanation before I was three, to prison for the the critically unhealthy and wounding things he did.

My four older siblings before I was a teenager, all much older and off to start their own lives, to escape from the ugliness of their shared history, our broken family.

My mother did the best she knew how to do, and did much of it quite well, but much damage was already done, and the world is difficult for single parents with ugly pasts.

Her own insufficiencies, all quite understandable and human, took their own additional toll.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bullied and been bullied, I have broken and been broken.

I have had to put my body between the vulnerable and the harmful more times than I care to remember, since I was two years old.

I have, in loneliness and ignorance, embraced predatory sexual abuse from another, while not yet a teenager.

I would not understand the damage already done, and to be undone, until much later.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not the first of my siblings to suggest that we are lucky to have all made it so far without one of us turning to the finality of suicide.

I do not know with certainty, but at this point, I assume we've all considered it.

I have, since I was six years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not be truly able to begin working on rebuilding myself for more than twenty years, but it is never too late to grow.

It only matters that you try, again and again and again.

It is my responsibility to put in the time and effort to do the mending, to understand the pain, the damage.

I am human, and have paved my path with many mistakes, many of them inherited from people who came before me.

Learning them intimately is what allows me to move on from them, and become stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to learn my mental and sexual health from the ground up, and hope to pass on whatever useful things I may excavate, so that they may serve You and push your life closer to Ultimate Meaning and humility and strength and passion.

The light at the end of the tunnel, not a goal, but a guide.

A lighthouse beacon in the storm to remind you: the night is dark and the crushing waves are terrible, but all hope is not lost from the world.

Fight onward.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

My gift is to see from a different perspective,

my purpose, to articulate the things I see.

To illustrate as much as I can,

to create new worlds, filled with old ideas.

To build many a looking-glass around complex subjects, so that things may be seen from new angles, in the hope of bringing understanding.

To step forward through the tall grass and look further, and tell those who come after what may lie ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a Story, many intimately interlinked stories.

I hope it can cover vitally important ideas and communicate them, in their multi-varied depth and complexity, to as many people as have interest to immerse themselves.

I do not know when it will see the light of day, but I promise You, whoever you are:

As much of it that can be seen wholly, will be seen.

I will no longer hold back what is worth expressing.

As vast and overwhelming as it is to me now, bare and skeletal, I know that I have a great deal left to add.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then,

I will speak when I have something to say, interact when I am able, and will continue to post my artwork publicly, in the hope that the world may see something they do not yet understand, but have the patience to look closely and think, and learn.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot promise I will post all of my artwork, but I hope to have the courage to do so.

I cannot promise I will post often, or regularly, but I hope to always have something worth sharing.

I cannot promise I will not offend, offense is a belligerent and cheaply-borne thing, so I shall endeavor to care for it little or not at all.

I cannot promise I will not change my mind, on any subject, as I have every right to do so.

I embrace change as inevitable and bursting with limitless potential, and encourage You do as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish strength and meaning and passion and peace for You, but remind you that these precious commodities are only found with Your own time and effort.

I love you,

Please, keep trying."

I am a mental health sufferer and have been for nearly a decade now. I suffer with anxiety and depression and I have been to the edge a couple of times, but have been self harm free for the last 9 months so very happy about that.

My mental health stems from a lot of negativity and toxicity surrounding relationships with my family - most of which I have cut ties with. I have tried lots of different treatments and tried different medications to help me through, but the one that works for me is escapism, and I achieve this through gaming.

As part of my university degree, I studied the effects of digital technologies on helping to treat mental health patients, and I found the results to be quite amazing. So amazing that I have decided to follow up on it nearly a year later and being to try to create a mental health support community via Twitch. At the moment, I am streaming games and inviting people in to chat, relax, vent, and help create a support network, whilst employing the use of escapism. So far, the support and growth has been small but steady, and people are slowly getting on bored. In time, I hope to do streams where a percentage of the donations will be going straight to a mental health charity, to help fund further support to help those in need.

I am reaching out to people to get my community to grow and create this vision that I have - a community of people all trying to help out their fellow man get through their life struggles.

My twitch is twitch.tv/tehmindfulgamer. I hope you guys can come check it and see if you want to be a part of a growing community."
1612,Cancerophobia making me go insane,"Hi everyone,

I'm an 18 year old male. Our family has no history of cancer, its just recently that a 60 year old uncle of mine got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Ever since I've developed a fear of cancer.

Recently I've started developing/probably imagining symptoms. 

I used to get headaches and start panicking thinking i have a brain tumor, but the headaches got solved when i got prescribed some typer of glasses turns out i was just sensitive to bright lights.

Now, i have some gastrointestinal problems. Constipation, excess gas and feeling of fullness having lasted me for almost a month now. I'm starting to think i have some cancer/tumour somewhere in my digestive tract. I also had haemorrhoids a week ago (this was genuine and not part of my health anxiety) That thought has made me really depressed and I've developed anxiety

I can't sleep well, eat without worry, I don't laugh anymore. Every time i go to the toilet i expect to see blood or some weird stuff in my stool that may indicate a sign of cancer but so far its just constipation. I am going crazy i dont enjoy anything anymore. I find myself sometimes fidgeting unknowingly. I'm trying to cope by playing excess video games to get my mind distracted.

Part of me tells me I dont have cancer cause im too young and there's no family history of it, but part of me leans to cancer affects anyone at anytime.

 I've told my parents of my symptoms and they just brushed me off. I've seen a doctor who just gave me anti acidity medicine for 2 weeks but I've not seen much change. 

I believe it could be psychological because when i got the haemorrhoid episode the bowel syndromes kind of disappeared for that week due to the pain the haemorrhoid caused made my mind distracted. Now the haemorrhoids are gone and I'm even worse. 

I live in a third world country so therapy is out of my options. Its hard to find a therapist let alone a good one. Should i push my parents for a specialist review and an endoscopy/colonoscopy?

Please advise me"

1614,Lyrics to a song I'm working on :,"Be kind to yourself.
What would you do for yourself, if you were someone else,
who was feeling this way?
Anyway
I just wanted to say, it's gonna be okay
And I wanted you to know, that you're not alone, cause
I feel you, I see you, I hear you, and I understand
I've been you, I've been through, many of these things too, and
I know it doesn't help much right now, but
I feel you, I see you, I hear you, and I understand

Don't let it define you. Don't let it blind you
Remember who you are
You are not your pain. You're not your fucked up brain. 
You're you

1615,"I am not even an adult yet, and I already feel worn down and tired from life. The future terrifies me, and I truly can't see a good future outlook for myself. I try so hard to be an optimistic person, but I always fail.","I am 17, and I still haven't solved my issue of self deprecation and self loathing. It is so tiring, because I truly try to discern between what is rational and irrational. I try to push myself towards a state of self awareness, but even with being self aware I am unable to make myself truly believe the rationale. And at night, especially, I recall all of the reasons that lead me to hate myself. The reasons are cemented, and I truly don't know if I will ever be able to walk the path of self acceptance. 

Sometimes I go through such intense phases of sadness and just overall self hatred that my body just shakes. I can feel my anxiety rising, and my entire body begins to itch. I start to sweat and my body begins to feel like a furnace. It lasts throughout the day in varying degrees. When I am in school, my anxiety skyrockets, and I get this tingling and crawling sensation all over my body. I am just so tired of feeling this way. 

I have no friends, and it used to not bother me but now it has just become a source of added self loathing. I just truly hate myself, and it is hard to explain to others. When I confide in a family member they brush off the severity, and maybe it's because they simply can't recognize deep self hatred because they have never dealt with it. They aren't accustomed to that level, and so they identify it as a normal adolescent reaction to growing up. 

But, I know it is just not that. I genuinely hate myself, and it has stopped me from making friends. I feel so uneasy with myself in almost every situation, and it feels as though I can't trust myself. I feel shallow, because it seems that I just spend my time trying to reflect the projections of others. I just want to please every ones subjective ideas of what a good person is. And that is the worst part of it all. I truly don't know who I really am at times. What do I want? I don't know, and it's terrifying to walk around aimlessly just trying to fulfill what others want. It has hinder my own growth in so many areas.

And I also just feel so disgusted with myself, because of my same sex attraction.  I wasn't raised in a homophobic family, and yet I still have this yearning to be heterosexual. I was sexually abused as a child, and sometimes I think that maybe that caused me to have a same sex attraction. I don't know. To this day I am still disgusted with myself for being sexually abused. I feel so deeply sick just thinking about everything that happened, and I can't get over it. I just feel like the nastiest person on Earth, and I just wish it never would have happened. Some days I can't stop thinking about it, and my mind just forces me to recall everything. 

I just don't want to do this anymore, but I am too scared to kill myself. If I killed myself I don't think my mother would be able to recover. Her life has been messed up in so many ways, and I don't want to add on to that. I truly think that if I killed myself that would be the last straw. And as much as I do hate myself I know that she would truly break."
1616,Cannot stick to a goal,"Small recap on my situation: 25yo male, 180 cm (~6'0), 160kg (~342 lbs). Been slightly depressed from 16 yo onward, then it hit me like a truck at 18. Decided to seek help 2.5 years ago, have been on fluoxetine for 1.5 years, now on duloxetine ~1 year rn. Done psychotherapy, didn't help on the long term. Studying engineering, about halfway there after 6 years (it's a 3 year course).
  
I started dieting a lot of times, always have given up. It takes next to nothing for me to give up whatever goal I have in mind and I set myself back. 
  
Example: I've been doing paleo keto (followed by a medic) and I try my hardest. Already lost 6kg (12 lbs), but whenever I get a bad day (i.e. I try to study and don't understand, or something doesn't go the way I planned or literally anything, even stupid shit, that upsets me happen, I give up. I find myself laying on bed, thinking of all my failures and such (you know the drill). I eat outside of my dieting plan, which stalls my weight loss. Then I see I didn't lose any more weight and the cycle continues.
  
How can I stop all of this? As I said, I tried medicines and  psychotherapy, but am still here. How do you guys manage to stick to a goal (like dieting or studying for an exam) without losing the will to do it (giving up or procrastinating)? 
  
I'd really like any sort of help (mental tips or even small everyday tasks that motivate you).  
  
Thanks."
1617,I’m not depressed but i still want to die,"I dont really have a reason to live, no dream or things i want to achieve. Living feels useless. I feel empty, sometimes i suddenly start crying for no reason n cant stop crying for hours. I feel no joy in living. I just feel like everyday is one more day i have to wait before dying. I’m tired of waiting. If i have nothing i’m looking forward to, why do i have to live?"
1618,I'm just an imposter,"I got all information about depression, anxiety and touretts that i think i have from the internet.

 I was in therapy, but they never diagnosed me with anything due to me being just a teenager. 

I was on antidepressants and experience depression with suicidal tendencies, but no one ever looked me in the eyes and told me ""you are depressed, you are not faking"". 
It was always exact opposite, ""you will grow out of it, just do sports"".

 No one believes i'm sick, i try to find help, but they always decline me. What else can i do?"
1619,I'm stuck abroad without a therapist,"Someone please help. I'm a student stuck in the north of england on a tier 4 student visa (I paid a 3 year healthcare surcharge and can use nhs services) and I'm in desperate need of mental health help. I don't have a GP to recommend me to a therapist (my GP was at my unis surgery and they've been closed since covid, no way to get in contact with her) and I can't afford to pay privately. I don't know how therapists work here, is there a way for me to find a therapist still?

1621,I just need to talk to somebody seriously,"Hey guys, I want to tell you something and would be great if you could give me some advices, feedback or whatever if you will just read it I will be grateful that you spent your time to read my shitty text.
Right know I feel kind of confused because I do not know of what I feel exactly. I feel fear, angriness, also I feel like everything is super unfair to me. But at the same time, today I was smiling a few times. Like... I feel a lot but this 'a lot' is like nothing. And it is not only today, since one year at least. 
I am not gonna telling you my whole life story because it will be too much. I just want to say to others (even to  people that I do not know) that sometimes I feel really bad. I feel like I should not be in this world. It is not my place, people do not understand me. I have a great family and 5 wonderful best friends, I love them. So theoretically I should be a happy person. I have family, friends, hobby, I am able to study aboard, I was traveling a lot, people say that I am a nice person with good hearth. But it does not work. I know that they will help me, I kniw that they care about me. But they cannot understand of what I feel. I know it because I was talking with them about my feelings, my problems and so on and they really do not understand me. Or I cannot explain that, it is also possible. To be honest, I was thinking about suicide, sometimes I am still doing it. But I believe one day I will be stronger, healthier and ""full of beans"". And I do not want to make my mum sad. She (and the rest of my wonderful humans) are more important than me. I am living for them. Making them sad will be the worst. I am trying to live for them and for myself but I cannot yet. One day probably I will do it, but not tonight and not tomorrow. 
Actually my biggest dream is to say totally honest with myself I AM HAPPY IN THIS MOMENT. 
You know... I just needed to say it. (I am in touch with therapist so do not worry about that). 
And I would love to wish to all of you who is reading this shit a nice day/night, power, and be brave to be happy. Hope you will be okay
Thank you"
1622,Pain from childhood trauma,"My neighbor sexually abused me when I was 7 (he was 12 then). Only recently I started telling people I trust about this. I thought about telling my mother about it, then I thought she might feel guilty in a way, because she didn't protect me. He used to hang out with me a lot, and he was a very problematic kid that came from a problematic home. They were really poor, the father was gone, the mother not completely sane. He didn't really shower and my mother said she stopped letting him visit us at some point because he smelled bad.  
 Then I realized - wait, my mom really didn't protect me. Why didn't she? She knew we were friends (or ""friends""), and she knew he was problematic. So why... I think I'm slightly angry with her.   
Another thing: I told my sister about the assault today and she thinks it's quite awful. I didn't show any feelings when we talked because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to control myself if I started crying. But on the way home I felt terrible, then I cried by myself in my room, and now there's a deep pain in my heart that won't go away.  
 I'm going to therapy, my last session was yesterday and I told the therapist about it. He didn't address it specifically. I don't know how to deal with this pain."

Sometimes when I get really upset and it’s sadness and anger I get this urge to bang my head on something. I’ve done this once before when I was on the toilet and rammed my head into my knee cap today I was sitting in bed crying after a horrible day I’ve had feeling helpless,angry, sad etc... and leaned my head forward to then swing it back and bang it on my head board. 

Tbh it was kind of therapeutic and helped me not be so upset. 

I guess I just want to know if these urges are normal or if I should be concerned. I’ve had them more recently in the past year (my parents got divorced a little over a year ago) but have only acted on them twice now."
1624,Recovery during COVID19,"  

There are two elements to an effective recovery program for ‘mental’ disorders: the core work and the implementation. Replacing your maladaptive thoughts and behaviors with positivity and empowerment holds the key to your future wellbeing and happiness. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with you, the wellness program emphasizes your character strengths and abilities that facilitate your recovery. You have always had the power to change; you need to embrace it and make it work for you. 

The COVID19 crisis makes it impossible for us to go into the community and implement all the hard work we do together, but that should not discourage your recovery efforts. Every client works within a customized platform of integrated approaches best suited for their problem and situation. Since COVID19 impedes effective implementation, we will spend more time on the core-work in preparation for the implementation phase post COVID19. 

Every challenge presents opportunity, and the platform for recovery that we prepare together will be even more durable. I urge you to resist the temptation to procrastinate your recovery during this crisis. The comprehensive, personalized attention I provide to my clients severely limits the number of persons I can help. If your condition is affecting your emotional wellbeing and quality of life, now is the best opportunity to do something about it. Get in touch with me as soon as possible, so we can create your individualized program and begin your recovery process. You deserve the best life possible, and nothing should hold you back. For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, “It might have been.”"

First, Some background about me. I’ve (19f) been diagnosed with depression and been struggling with it for six years now. It’s been a tough journey of rocking from stability to relapsing—I’ve even relapsed twice this year alone. The relapses have been getting worse, to the point where I learned how to cut myself last February before my friends had an intervention and I stopped self-harming since then. It scares me that I have the ability to go to the lowest of lows, that I can be numb enough to go through with a plan. I’ve never self-harmed ever before then, so it really terrified me of what I’m capable of. I was fine until June 2020, where I ended up in another relapse (with the pandemic and financial stress and all), and I was getting real suicidal real fast.

This is where my friend comes in. They’ve been a good college friend and we met our freshman year through a cultural club—getting closer to each other after the pandemic happened and we were forced to quarantine. They’ve become one of my closest friends and we’d spend a lot of time together. I’ve learned a lot about them and they inspire me so much as an artist (we’re both in art-related majors). I’ve basically watched them grow in their newfound relationship with their boyfriend and we’ve been each other’s supporters ever since that year.
We clicked not only because of our interests, but I felt like we grew closer because we understood each other too. They have depression, like me, as well as bipolar II. There was a sense of solidarity and a safe space, because there was no judgment whatsoever. I guess the same can be said in joining groups or communities like these, you feel like you’re not alone in your emotions.
Because of that strong bond, they’ve actually helped push me to that step I needed to finally seek professional help. I have a therapist now, and I’ve gone through a month and a half of group therapy. I’m a bit more stable than I was in February or June, but it just makes my stress tolerable. I’ve just learned better coping mechanisms that can keep me safe, but those suicidal and depressing thoughts aren’t completely gone.

Anyways, Here’s my dilemma.

They’re going into a bad relapse at this moment as well. They live in an unhealthy home environment, and our university basically went fully remote last minute. We have both planned to be roommates at off-campus housing but after the school’s announcement, we have to stay at home. I guess it’s accumulative from the stress from an abusive family, as well as financial stress from unable to terminate our leases (fuck landlords by the way). There must be a lot more that they haven’t told me as well, so I can’t assume that’s the entire story—it may be the tip of the iceberg.
Every passing day, I get so worried over them. I care so much about their well-being, but every time I try to console them, I feel like it falls on empty ears. I know this from experience too...sometimes when my friends or family talk to me it goes over my head and my mind takes over, distorting their words. I don’t know how else to get them the help they need, and it seems like they’re getting increasingly suicidal by the hour.
I’m also one of the only people they talk to, besides their boyfriend. They only trust the two of us, and they don’t want or have the energy to talk to anyone else or meet new people. 
So I usually listen to them vent their feelings bc I always offer that support. I want them to feel safe with me, to know that I’ll be there for them. 
Though it’s been like this for a month now and I’m afraid it’s taking an emotional toll on me. I feel guilty and powerless that I feel this way, because I love them and I want them to be okay. But I have to admit, sometimes it does get a little triggering? When they vent their frustrations, it sounds so familiar to how I talk to myself when I’m suicidal as well. It kinda transports me back to that dark place. After listening to them vent, I kinda get back into my own depressive thoughts and I grow a bit numb. I could relate to them a little too well sometimes, and other times I can’t relate at all. 
I only have depression, so I don’t know much about Bipolar II. I did look it up and researched it to get a better sense of the disorder, but yet again, everyone’s experience is different and unique that I really can’t judge it by some internet sources. 
And while I do want to help lift their burden, I can’t help but feel like they’re becoming a bit emotionally dependent on me? I know it’s a really bad thing to think about but I feel like it’s building up bit by bit. They constantly need reassurance, and while I have no problem supporting them, it gets a lil emotionally draining at times. To the point where they’d only eat when I’m eating (asking me if I’m eating dinner so they can eat dinner, or if it’s okay for them to take a snack), if they’d ask me if their family hates them, if their boyfriend is going to leave, etc. I’d give compliments and reaffirmations and support, but it’s always met with a “do you really think so?” Or “are you lying?”. I really really have to convince them.
Sometimes, I feel like they only talk to me when they’re venting or distressed as well..
They turn to me immediately when they’re dealing with family problems or relapsing or relationship problems. That kinda takes over 90% of our conversations now. One situation stuck with me I guess: I was really passionate about a film idea I had so I wanted to share it with them. In response I just got one message like “yeah I guess you can do more research about the topic” before they immediately went to venting about their father and I had to comfort them afterwards.
I fear that our friendship may be turning to an unhealthy route. I want to help them feel better, but at the same time, I want to look after my own mental health as well. I don’t want to be selfish. Though, I’m really lost and I don’t know what to do at this point. I want to help but I feel like I’m being stretched thin. 
They’re in crisis all of the time and are basically over the edge, so I don’t want to leave them alone because I want them safe. I most certainly do not want to say the wrong thing—usually I have to take caution in how I write messages or how I word things, in case it feeds to their depression or makes them feel even worse.
Has anyone had a situation like this? Any advice/resources is greatly appreciated. I live in California in the United States, if there are any local services in my area that I can turn to.

I apologize if this sounds selfish or arrogant of me, I am genuinely wanting to learn better and want to learn how to be a better friend in their time of need. Maybe this is a sign that I still need more therapy and that I need to recover a bit more myself?"
1631,are my problems valid?,"ever since i was a little kid i’ve been on the bigger side, and i’ve always been extremely insecure about it. in the past, i used to think “oh hey by the time im sixteen ill probably have lost the weight!”, but now that i have turned sixteen and still look the same i’ve been extremely worried and stressed about it. i feel like i’m losing time and that i’m never going to ever feel confident about my body. this has plagued me my entire life, filled it with so much self-doubt and no self-confidence at all, and i just hate myself so so so much. i feel like i rely on what other people think about me and feel like crap when i know i can’t meet their standards. the small things get to me too, like when my friends talk about all the pretty clothes they wanna buy while i sit there knowing ill never be able to fit in those clothes and look good, or when i need an extra shirt and my skinny friend tells me i can borrow her shirt when obviously i wouldnt fit into it. i dont know... sometimes i feel like im so dramatic. i can’t even say that im fat out loud because i like to try and pretend i’m not. i recently asked my mom for a therapist, because i have never told anyone about how i feel towards my body. i had a few therapy sessions these past few weeks and i’ve cried so hard in every single one because it just feels so different telling a real life person about my feelings. 

now, here’s my question. are my problems valid? sometimes, i feel like im wasting my therapist’s time because i know a lot of other people struggle with this too so is it just how the human brain works? my mom told me that she doesn’t take my “depression” seriously because she said i’ll grow out of it. she also talked about how hard other people have it right now especially because of the pandemic which is causing people to lose their jobs and all. and i know im privileged, i do. i know that i’m able to have an education, buy the things i want, eat good food, travel to places, and all those things... so are my body insecurities stupid? is it dumb that i just want to look at myself in the mirror for once and see someone that looks pretty? is it so bad i want to be able to take pictures and feel like hey i should post this on instagram i look good! is it so bad i want to be able to take goofy selfies and send them to my friends? am i an idiot for wanting to go clothes shopping and not having to worry and feel embarrassed about clothes not fitting me and wear cute fits like any other teenage girl instead of wearing the same 5 outfits? i just want to know what you guys think because im at a loss. thank you."
1632,Feeling Depressed Again :/,[removed]
1633,I feel lost,"If you don’t have time for these next few paragraphs then that’s okay, don’t feel like you *have* to read this or anything. I just felt it would be good for my mental health to at least vent to somebody that can give me advice on how I’ve been feeling lately.

First, I suppose I should give a bit of background as to why I’ve been feeling so down. All my life I’ve been dealing with an emotionally and mentally abusive mother who manipulated my step-father and all my half-siblings into treating me the same that she does. I have my real father and step-mother who lived close by, accompanied by two other half-siblings, but I didn’t live with them because my biological mother claimed custody of me from a young age. Let me begin with recent events.

Eventually, I moved out back in either late February or early March of 2020 and am currently living with what I consider the “good” of my two families. It was a nice start at first, but then things felt like they were slowly falling apart. This side of my family has always had a habit of starting terrible verbal fights over the littlest of things, and I never got used to that, and it even got to the point where I felt as if I should be the “family therapist” and try and resolve any problems that arise. This usually isn’t appreciated, as I am consistently told that “Arguing is a healthy part of any relationship” which I really just don’t see. I’ve been in a happy relationship with my girlfriend for 2 years now and we have never fought once. We prefer to very calmly discuss any differences we may have in a very civil manner. I should also mention that I think I may have bipolar depression and anxiety (I am very unsure, however, as I have never received any sort of official diagnosis. This has caused many problems within this household for the past 6 or 7 months.

My dad disregards any claims I make about anxiety or depression, and constantly blames me for not telling him about mental health issues I may be having. I have grown distant and reclusive as a result, because I really don’t know where to go, other than constant venting with my girlfriend. She says she’s okay with the amount of venting I do, as she reciprocates just as much. Though, I know that I need some sort of actual therapist or counselor or something. Until then, though, I kinda just feel stuck and hollow. My emotions seem to be dwindling and everything is spiraling out of control. I can’t talk to family because they seem to just forget about the heart-to-heart moments I’m desperately trying to have, though they’re always open to an argument.

Another thing I would like to add is the fact that every year my dad, brother and I take these personal camping trips that range from a week to a week and a half in total nothingness. I am not a big camper, but I typically accompany him because I know that’s what he would want. This year, however, I told him two weeks prior that I would prefer to opt-out of the trip. Although he said he respects my decision, him and my step-mom have been holding it over my head and guilt-tripping me to go, and get upset when I continuously tell them I would prefer to stay home and focus on important things, like getting a license and preparing for college. Things that my last two parents failed to help me with. I am 18 now, and should have all the freedom in the world. But it really feels like I’m super boxed in as of late and I’m really not in a happy place.

I really don’t feel like I’ve been intentionally hurting anyone, I just really am struggling to connect with my family, and it feels like they’re almost tired of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me mentally while I’m struggling to do the same. Either that or they don’t want to confront the issues I’m having, which seems more likely because they’ve mocked my anxiety by telling me I’ve never had it and have mocked my depression by blatantly ignoring it.

I’m not going to commit suicide or hurt myself or anything, I have more self-awareness than that. I just really hate feeling so tired and useless all the time. I desperately want to be happy again but it seems like all my efforts are in vain. Even now, my family barely even looks at me because my parents are offended I’m in my room so much taking time to myself. They don’t say “Hi” after work anymore and conversations are brief if they’re not about what I could be doing better.

This is the most lost and unsure I’ve ever felt in my life and would like some opinions or advice that might help if anyone has the time, I’m desperate."

so  how i can reach her and help her ? i dont know any idea. i sent her  some cheesy stuff about depression and psychosis but i dont wanna be  chessy; im sincerely want to help her.

atleast  i wanna convince her to go to therapy; because she dont wanna take  pills. how i can convince her to that ? what i should to do ? and im    afraid  about push her too much or saying something she can  misunderstand and   she won't talk me again

thanks for all answer"
1638,It's the little victories,"So my therapist gave me a goal last to do one thing a day to make me happy. It took a minute but I found out that I have a love for cooking and coming up with my own recipes. My parents went as far as to buy me a crock pot as an early birthday present to support me. It didn't really hit me until today that ever since I found cooking it's been easier to be productive, I'm in a good mood most of the time, my kids notice that I'm happier and my relationship is absolutely benefitting from it. 
The reason I realized this is because my 7 and 8 year old told me while I was making dinner that they missed hearing me sing all the time. Best support system ever."
1639,What could cause someone to giggle/cry when stressed?,"For the last six months I've been dealing with a lot of stress (I'm sure everyone has) whenever something really stressful happens I find myself uncontrollably giggling then crying and I can't really control it.

What is this so I can cope with it?"
1640,Feeling like crap because of other people's achievements,"A little about myself: i aspire to be an artist, an illustrator to be honest, i've never been in an art school before since the art/animation topic isn't a big deal in my country yet and i have no experience working with other people. Since most of work nowadays is globally done by social media, i have to poorly promote my work in there too.

Envy would be the right word for what i'm feeling right now, envy with tears. Whenever i send a portfolio to a publisher, somebody else gets a green light for their comic or a commission, when i finally get a client, somebody else shows off their job at x studio and how wonderful is to be them, whenever i draw something i can't feel the confidence because i know there's better people out there who can easily kick my ass.

Yes i know it sounds stupid but i can't deny that i'm not good enough to compete with anybody and i just wanted to get it off my chest somewhere without feeling guilty. Thanks for reading i guess."
1641,I wish my thoughts could just transport into text,"I wish my thoughts just transported into text so it'll be more easier but they can't and I'm just left wondering what to write

I'm not depressed I don't feel tired all the time or have suicidal thoughts or tendencies. I'm just sad really sad and I feel lonely and I want someone to hug me. Mom loves to cry she just makes herself miserable time and time again and I'm always there supporting her it has become tiresome, she can't understand what I'm feeling she just dismissis it I don't know what to write. 
Maybe its because I'm a teenager and emotions just feel more heavy and with the situation there is,  it feels worse I feel like an idiot and a dumbass I'm worthless and stupid and I hate myself sometimes. I'm tired of crying,  I'm tired of being an hypocrite I'm tired of feeling this way

I really want someone to hug me/help me
I'm not supposed to feel this way, I'm a child please stop putting all your venom and your secrets on my back

I wanna cry."
1642,Can anyone talk me down off the ledge please.....,"I’ve had the worst week of my life and today has just been horrible. I’m so done and I don’t have anyone to talk to, literally no one. 

I have no friends now, my best friend who was like a sister to me basically ditched me and replaced me with another new friend of hers, she won’t even text me. My other best friend of like 18 years seems so busy that she doesn’t even text back. 

My 11 year old came to me last night in tears saying that he had been exposed to a group on Discord app that were sharing extreme gore/snuff clips and hardcore porn. He is absolutely traumatised as he’s just a little kid and I feel so guilty that I hadn’t checked his computer in a week, I just trusted him. I’m so hurt for him. Then today his teacher noticed that he was just down in class all day and so he told her everything too. She called me and I felt mortified and more guilty. I suffer with extreme depression and I’m currently going through a bad episode. 

My partner comes over tonight and idk why but he was just snarky from the start. I was already feeling vulnerable and he just started criticising everything about me. He went to the kitchen and was like, “why is that tuna out?”, “wash that glass you mink”, “why did you buy that?”, “why are you drinking that energy drink u can’t have that”, “how much weight have u loss????” (I’m literally only a stone over weight), then when I said that I’m fine w my weight loss journey, he snarked, “you live in dream land”. I just snapped and told him to leave me alone, stop getting on my back that I can’t take it! Then he started bringing up my son and saying, “imagine talking about politics with your kid, wouldn’t be happening w my children that’s for sure”. I said, “My son is the top in all his classes, he’s full of morals and decency and literally cries over any type of gore because he’s full of empathy, I’ve done a good job with him!” Then he replied, “yeh because your parenting has done so well so far” sarcastically, trying to hint at my son seeing gore images, basically saying I’m shit parent even though i didn’t mean for that to happen, I didn’t know! 

Then later on when I finally calmed down, he asked for my phone to look at something on an app, but that was a lie, he opened WhatsApp and started reading all the communication between myself and father of my son. He was like, “see this is how ur dodgy!!”. There’s literally nothing on there, just me telling him that my son can’t call at that moment because he was taking a tantrum and then we laughed over text at how kids tantrum over anything. THATS IT!! Apparently though that alone makes me terrible. Then he just walked out and now he won’t respond. 

I can’t take anymore of this shit. It’s too much. He even said, “no wonder u get abandoned by people”, like....it’s just too much. I feel like a shit mother, a shit partner, and obviously a shit person seeing as I’m so easily ditched even though I’ve always went out my way to be nice with everyone and always be there for people when they need it. I’m just this giant pushover and I’m so tired of waking up every day feeling like shit all day. I can’t even feel happiness anymore. I can’t smile. I can’t go on feeling this way anymore.....I’ve done it for years and nothing has helped. I can’t live life if I can’t feel happiness again. Just imagine waking up every day feeling like utter shit all day, every day for years. Then forcing yourself to put on an act so u don’t come across as completely miserable. My partner is the only person I have left.....and now he hates me. Honestly the only reason I’ve stayed this long is my son. He is my everything. I wake up every day for him alone. I just find it really painful that I have to go on feeling this way...
I don’t know....I just need someone...anyone to give me some words of positivity right now. I’m so alone in darkness....in my personal hell. When does it ever get better?"
1643,"I'm not feeling right, but I'm not sure what feeling right ever was.","I'm not depressed, or at least I don't feel depressed, but I'm not feeling right at all. I can't explain it properly, but I'm going through every emotion possible all at once. I feel care free and extremely emotional all at once. It's getting a bit too extreme. It's extended to everything, I feel like I'm melting. Struggling to keep my job at this point. I'm convinced I have some form of dementia, but I'm 32, and I work with people who have dementia so maybe I'm just getting confused on the whole issue. I can't cope very well at the moment. My brain feels like it's resetting or hiding things. It's consuming my life. Not sure what I'm even posting this for. I just need to say it I guess."
1644,"Is there a word for when you have always felt ""abnormal"" for your whole life? You ""want to be like other people""?","Hi all,

I've been trying so hard to deal with this my whole life, but I really don't know where to start.

Context:

I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphia (I really, truly, genuinely think my face is deformed--it is extremely distressing to look at). I also have a few other anxiety disorders, and was diagnosed with PTSD as a child due to severe sexual and physical abuse in the home.

Question:

With all this said, due to being body dysmorphic, I believe I look fundamentally deformed--it's not just a belief that I'm ugly, it's profound feeling that I'm actually horrifying. But it doesn't stop there. I also feel this way about my personality. I feel so deeply different to other people--not in a good way. I'm not okay with being ""different,"" or ""quirky."" I've gotten feedback that I do indeed look ""unusual,"" and that I am ""quirky,"" and different--it is so deeply disturbing to me that my fears are real. I want to be like other people. I feel profoundly like I'm not like anyone I've ever met. I feel so disturbed by this. I want to be normal. What is the word for this? Can anyone relate to this? What is this?"
1645,Have I lost my mind at 27?,"My friend has a Mazda (CX-9 I think?). It is a push button start. We got out of the vehicle and walked into the house.

5 minutes later I took a bag of trash out to t he road, and noticed his car was still running. I even bent down towards the hood to make sure that was his engine I heard. It was absolutely running still as it got louder when I put my ear to the hood.

When I went inside and told I’m he left his car on, he was shocked and said ‘that’s not actually possible since my key is on me’. He went outside and for sure, the car was not running.

I am entirely sober and absolutely clueless. Never been concerned for my mental health before. What the fuck is going on."
1646,Do I have this conversation over the phone or text?,"For someone who has such bad social anxiety and can't make my own haircut appointments, whenever I have serious/deep talks with my friends, if we can't talk in person I'd much rather have them over text.

Not to say texts are genuine, but if I'm trying to ask like real questions/get answers out of someone, I'd rather talk over the phone to get a 'real' answer that they can't ignore my text and think about and possibly change their answers. Not to say someone can't lie over the phone, but I feel like they're put more on the spot and more likely to tell it to me straight over the phone, plus you can better portray tone of voice over it (and I always give a lot of exposition when I talk, lol)

However, on the other hand I love texting because I can go back and read what they've said, whether it was a meaningful conversation, advice, or a thought that I always stress/over think about like if I think someone's mad at me, and I ask them and they give an answer I can always go back and re-read it when I think of it again, so I don't have to be that annoying person who keeps asking them. (I only ask those who know about my mental health and I feel comfortable asking that question to, but not comfortable asking every time I think it...which is often, haha).

So like, I have to have a serious talk about someone about an issue that has come up and I would love to have it in text to be able to go back and re-read and look back on, but also want it to be over the phone because I want a real/raw response and to be able to talk.

I also, going back to social anxiety, have a hard time saying what I think even if it's someone who knows me really well and knows my struggles talking, and so I have a lot of pauses and ""ums"" and ""I don't know's"" when I do know, and texting makes it a bit easier to say it faster without the breaks.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; when having a serious conversation, I like phone calls because I feel like I get more real/raw responses, but I also like texting because I have it to look back on...I'm about to have a serious conversation, should I text them or call them?"
1647,I don't know how to deal with my anxiety anymore,"For reference, I am a university student finishing their final year in their undergraduate degree.

For several years at this point, I get into these ""moods"" where I start to get extremely overwhelmed and anxious with life, which eventually leads to me becoming emotionally numb, and not really caring about anything. In the past, I would attempt to deal with this situation by radically changing my behaviour. This would mainly consist of setting up a brand new ""routine"" that consisted of planning and structuring all my daily activities. This schedule would consist of everything, from wake up times and exercise to brushing my teeth and eating. While this would work for maybe a couple months, I would eventually start to get over ambitious with my schedules, and would not be able to keep up with everything, which would lead into the anxiety.

Well lately, I have been feeling like there is no point in trying to fix myself. I just feel trapped, because I know that I won't able to keep up with these routines I create for myself. I just feel like a miserable failure, because I don't know what to do anymore. I literally spend my days sleeping in until noon, hating myself for sleeping in and wasting my time watching stupid videos on youtube. I just can't motivate myself to actually do something useful. I have a job for the summer but my production has been abysmal. I'm not sure if this is a result of the current COVID-19 situation (I have to work from home) or because of my current mental state. 

To add to all of this, I had to deal with a traumatic family situation, which has really messed with my relationship with my parents and younger sister. This situation caused me to lose a lot of trust and respect that I had for my father, which for some reason I feel guilty about. I can't tell anyone about what happened because I don't want to drag down the other people that were affected by this situation, which means that I can't deal with any of these feelings I have been having.

I wake up everyday with a knot in my stomach and my mind racing. I hate my brain for being like this. I am terrified that I'm going to be like this for the rest of my life. I want to be able to get better, and just feel like a normal person again. I'm sorry for this being a bit of a mess of a post. I just feel like my brain is going haywire, and I just want to fix myself."
1648,Wearing a face mask has helped with my social anxiety,"I kind of dig the mask look. We all look like Mortal Kombat characters. Hahahah.

But yeah. Wearing face masks has really helped with my social anxiety and self esteem. It covers half of my face and I don’t even have to worry about how I look anymore. Because of social distancing you limit your interactions which has helped in not having to deal with social anxiety that often. When I wear a face mask I look like everyone else and fade into the background... which feels good."
1649,I should be happier than I am currently,"I hate feeling like this. I have so much going for me. I have a girlfriend who makes me happy who I’ll see when I return to school, I can just relax at home for the next few weeks, I have consistent friends, but I just can’t seem to feel happy. It might be my house, it might be that I’m hundreds of miles away from my girlfriend, it might be a myriad of things, and yet here I am, laying in bed, feeling depressed for the second time in two weeks, and this sucks. I’ve been trying to keep myself busy practicing software and such, but fuck man."
1650,What’s the deal with Naltrexone?,"Anyone have any experiences they’d like to share? I’m thinking of asking my psychiatrist about it, especially because my drinking has gone back to “out of hand”. I went to inpatient for suicidal ideation (bipolar) and they also told me I was abusing alcohol (which I didn’t think I was, but now I see it). I know it played a big part in this record breaking depressive episode. 

I’m also on lamictal, wellbutrin XL, and seroquel as needed."
1651,WORK PLACES. NEED. TO. GRANT. EMPLOYEES. MENTAL HEALTH DAYS.,"And I’ll say it louder for the people in the back!!!😤

Can’t tell you how many days I’ve absolutely dreaded going to work; not because I was sick, and not because I had anything going on other than that I just felt so *drained*.

Thankfully, I’ve seen a few companies lately express their concern with their employee’s mental health, and offering ways to reach out. But I still have not seen anyone grant days off for such things. Sometimes it’s not about having someone to talk to, and is more about just taking a day to relax and get your head back on straight."
1652,I really need a hug,"I've been going through so much depression and pain lately, I haven't felt happy in weeks. Recently two friends of mine died, I broke down this morning from the news that someone else I know is now gone, I feel worse because he tw: &gt;!killed himself and I also feel like I could've done more to help him since I've been trying to talk him out of it for months!&lt;. I've also been struggling with self-esteem issues and tw: &gt;!digital self-harm!&lt;, I have autism and there's a huge stigma that people like me on the spectrum are ""creepy"" or ""cringey"", and I've seen so many people on social media say this stuff lately and it's been making me feel like I'm worthless, especially since I was bullied growing up for my condition. I just feel so awful right now."
1653,All my spoons are full. [LONG],"I am so emotionally spent, and it's one of the worst times for me to be feeling this absolutely drained on life and overcome by information overload. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a transfer student who got into my number one choice school, and I know one of the major reasons I got in was my long list of volunteering and internships with nonprofits and charity organizations, and my personal essays wherein I poured out my sincere desire to dedicate my life to social equity and justice. I meant every word, and I have for years felt a deep need to help others, and I part of doing that is be always remaining informed about what's going on in my community, in my country, and in the international community as well; and that's the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

As COVID started to have its effects on America and millions of people lost their jobs, I went through wave after wave of emotions that lasted for days on end - rage, fear, worry, melancholy - at what was happening to the people around me. I was fortunate enough to be financially secure (essential worker), but my heart broke as each day I was met with more stories of hardship and avoidable death, and I felt a deep sense of what I can only describe as survivors remorse. I couldn't go on social media, it was too hard. Then George Floyd was murdered, and I watched the video (I broke down and couldn't watch all the way through) and the protests, riots, lock downs, and arguments dug into me even more. Then, suddenly every day it felt like news agencies specifically sought to share stories of innocent black people losing their lives (I'm black), and as I learned about more and more *and more* cases, I felt increasingly more depressed and less valued in my society. In my world. And having to endure arguments with people who dismissed the subject of systematic racism was just tiresome and unbelievable; and for the first time in my life, social justice, being politically informed, and being an active member of my communities seemed *exhausting*. I needed a break from being *so* informed, and so for the first time in years I stopped learning about what's going on in the world around me and would shut down conversations people wanted to have with me about current affairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now, school is going to go back into session soon, and my major involves being politically literate and informed, but I just *can't*. I read headlines about petty politicians and political theater and I cannot work myself up enough to just read the damn articles or do the research. I just don't want to know; but then I also don't like not knowing what's going on in the world around me. I just started learning more about the Breonna Taylor situation, and I trudge through it because I feel like it's important to know to remain informed, but *shit* it's depressing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the Eden the Doll situation happened, and I just watched those videos too and broke down for an hour. I will never, ever understand the psychology of people who can watch others being hurt and not feel absolutely overcome with the need to help, but rather, feel empowered. I'm just not made that way.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, headlines like these, stories like these, fire me up. They give me motivation to strive to help those weaker, less privileged, or less informed than me so I can use my knowledge to help them. It reminds me to keep going, to keep striving to make the world a better place so that these stories and headlines become fewer and far between - but right now, I just *can't.*

&amp;#x200B;

My spoons are full, and I feel so utterly ashamed. I feel like I've stumbled and can't get back up. Like I'm giving up on the communities I swore to dedicate my life to protecting and empowering, and leaving my journey before even really getting onto the path - and I just feel so guilty and lost. This is a huge part of my identity, but I just need to tap out of the ring right now, and I'm scared if maybe the thing I thought I should dedicate my life to is a bad idea if this is who I'm going to be now, or if I'll have months like this where I'm just totally useless and drained on information overload and emotional exhaustion."
1654,There's nothing I can do,I have so many issues. Mentally and health wise and I feel like everything I try always goes wrong. I have been trying so hard. I always try so hard. Tonight I was walking trying to get some steps after being unable to for a few days because of horrible back pain and I slipped and fell and hurt the dog and she can't walk and it's all my fault. I hate myself so much already. Why does everything I do always turn horrible? I'm a human waste of space and can't even work a normal job. I don't know what to do.

1656,"Not sure if I have something, but I’m just going to put this here in case someone knows something I don’t. Which is likely.","Okay, so I just had an incident where I couldn’t find any of my family members and immediately I jumped to the conclusion that they were dead and I was going to find their bodies, every pile of clothes looked like a body and every noise I heard had something to do with a killer. I even began to type weird things I saw into my phone, ex. my moms phone on a random railing. Turns out they were literally just across the street.

A lot of other things happen to, most commonly I think I’m being watched through a window, doorway, or security camera I don’t know about. I’ll constantly see shadows in my peripheral vision and immediately assume it’s a killer. I’ll sometimes hear just random screaming in my ear first thing when I wake up when there’s nobody there (don’t know if that might be related but I’m putting it anyway.) Sometimes if I’m in the car with adults I’m scared they’re going to take me into the woods and r*pe me or something. I don’t know what to make of all this, so I’m here for second opinions I suppose."
1657,I am very scared of events happening around me and I don't know if they're real or not.,[removed]
1658,Today I met an old friend,"Today,   


I met an old friend.   


I haven't seen him in years, I always tried to get in touch with him but all I ever got out of him were short one off texts. He basically dissipated after his father died  


Two days ago he went on a facebook tirade after not posting for years. He posted more than 60 posts in a span of about 12 hours. Everyone was worried sick, no one had actually seen him in years but the general conscensus was that he was going to off himself. His posts were erratic and hard to follow, in them he mentioned that he shouldn't have been imprisoned because he was gay (no one ever suspected he was gay, and no one would have really cared if he was), he hated some random politician no one has heard of, he said all of the fake friends should stop helping him, that he needs help, someone please help him, the rest are a bit crazier but they follow the same basic pattern.   


I was late to the party as I hadn't been on facebook that day yet and I got a call, I read the things and it seemed like ramblings from a mad man.   


I decided that enough people messaged him and I should give him a rest and try the next day. I did.   


He actually replied. I was thrilled, thank god he didn't kill himself.   


So I went over to his place.   


I was there for four hours. The apartment looks like a hoarders apartment, I don't think he has any clean clothes left as he was in his underwear the entire time and the entire apartment smelled like piss.   


When he said to come over he said to bring him something to eat cause he was hungry. So I brought him some fast food. He was hungry because he couldn't cook anything and the fridge looked like someone shat in it.   


I was there for four hours. Just talking to him. I tried to be welcoming at first and at some point try to give him some encouragement that not everything was going to be given to him.   


What I learned during those four hours: his father fought the nazis in the 90s, specifically Hitler, Himmler and the rest of them, he was supposedly hospitalized 7 times where they beat him up and tried to beat the gay away (no one in our country really cares about the gays, maybe about marriage), he was promised by Bill Gates that he will get him to America and that he will get a lot of money for it, the NSA, CIA and after I mentioned I have a chinese phone, the chinese were also after him, when he would show me his ""mementos"", he used a native word that is hard to translate, it's a very weird word to use, he would show me photos of his dad and then he'd cry about how his dad used to say ""that is my seed""(also used a local word).   


I actually managed to convince him that we can smoke on the balcony and that no one was going to shoot him.   


I promised him that I would bring him some food that he wants tomorrow, and he somehow thinks that I am going to become some kind of person to bring him stuff...since apparently I can go outside and not get shot. He also wants me to get him to America, because that's what he really deserves and clearly Bill Gates wants him there. He promised. I basically told him that Bill Gates lied to him and that he wasn't going to America. He took it surprisingly well...I mean he didn't freak out, he basically then just shifted it onto me, like I am going to get him to America.   


He used to have his mom taking care of him, I never met her, but a much closer friend to him has.She was supposedly a really good woman. The crazy dude doesn't want to meet with him because he thinks that the other one poisoned him with plutonium, like so many others.

He talks like she abused him all the time. Talking to him, when I asked him where she went he just said they took her away. After putting it all together, I'm kinda scared about what might have happened to her.   


What I gathered from the conversation...what I think is/was going on...The father died, this somehow broke the son who fought he disappointed his dad because he was gay and he wouldn't get to have kids. Eventually the mom left...hopefully just left...after he started going nuts...I doubt the hospitalizations were real...although the shrinks he mentioned I think were real.   


What do I do? I actually have the next week off...so I can actually spend time with him try to figure things out...clean out his fucking appartment...or is it a lost cause?  


I'm afraid that if the police come, or if someone from the government comes that will shatter whatever is left of his sanity. What do I do?  


PS: Sorry for the rambly nature of this post...I just got home...its 3 am. I just...never actually saw this kind of crazy."
1659,Confused. Conflicted. Do I cut out family?,"I’m going to try and lay it bare as best I can, but I am reaching a level of frustration and have for some time. I’m sorry if it’s long, but my home life has always been... complicated, to say the least.

BACKGROUND:

Kind of sucks, I guess. Born immigrant from Egypt that came to the USA with my mother, myself (26F), and my sister (24F). We will call my sister Sarah to make things simple.

Growing up was rocky at best with my biological father and my mother always fighting for the 8 years we lived with him. It was often bad enough that we could hear them yelling and hitting each other. So you already can imagine how Sarah and I grew up in that household (ashamed to admit I had my own period where I’d beat the crap out of her; not a phase that lasted long).

As sisters, we were never close, not really. Around 7th Grade was when my depression started coming to light. My mother, in all her supportive glory, would often tell me from then, up until her death, varying degrees of “stop being lazy,” “you have no reason to be depressed,” and “if you don’t get it together, I’ll disown you.” My four years of high school were spent being physically beaten for things like “talking back,” and if my room was “messy” she would take whatever clothes were left in the closet and throw them to the ground. The irony is after every beating, she would also ice where she slapped, hit, punched, etc so that there would be no bruises. Teachers never knew and I wasn’t keen to open up to them given my view on authority figures was trashed by that point. I joined Colour Guard with Marching Band for a year and enjoyed the hell out of it... up until the repeated comments from my mother telling me how “expensive” it was and never attending a show even once in my time doing it. The one time she did, she didn’t seem impressed and it showed. I repeatedly asked if she wanted me to drop, and she would say “No, no! It’s fine! You’re having fun!” I grew up being compared and equated to my biological father, who my mother hated for reasons I don’t know and will never know at this point.

And Sarah grew up the opposite. While I grew up never being allowed to hang out with friends for even an hour after school, my sister grew up going to parties, all the dances, attending choir, etc. My mother attended all her choir shows and forced me to come along and watch, never complained about buying her new dresses for the shows. She made it a point to chide me for complaining about attending (me, teenager, angst, I hated the vast majority of the people IN choir) and tell me all about how Sarah sacrificed her singing lessons so I could do Colour Guard.

I hated being around the both of them together. They could shop for hours and I’d be forced to go along. Sarah called me lazy, and would often daily me to “jump off a cliff” during the height of my depressive phase. My mother didn’t care, and she didn’t stop it, saying Sarah was only kidding around. When I entered my bicurious phase, both of them screamed at me: Sarah, calling me a fag, and my mother telling me I would be disowned if I didn’t “knock that shit off right now.” I never brought it up again to them. When we got a new dog, I tried to train him using positive reinforcement and a clicker that we were taught by a dog trainer we had hired: I got mocked for it, constantly, to the point I of course, being the angtsy teenager with obliterated self-esteem, gave up on it. I was forever blamed for the dog misbehaving, marking on everything, etc. No, they didn’t pick up the training themselves.

Throughout this, for the record, I had a stepdad. We’ll call him Joe. Joe and my mother married because, and I quote, “the sex was good” and my mother was willing to screw him more than once. My mother was looking for a man to help shoulder the financial burden of raising two kids in the USA, as well as a sponsor so we could become legal citizens. My sister and I liked him initially because he was willing to play with us. I now resent him, to an extent, as he often was either arguing with my mother for not giving him enough sex, and constantly telling him not to do X or Y. He also holed himself up in his man cave whenever my mother would beat on me. Never addressed it, and quickly lost my trust as he would tell my mother things I told him in confidence... which would make the beatings worse.

When my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian Cancer, things didn’t improve. Constant fights, screams. Sarah’s anger problems became more apparent as she would constantly tell people to go die in various graphic ways. She’d slam the door, ignore our dogs further. Joe withdrew in his own way and was only ever available when it came to taking my mother to her chemo and doctor appointments. He regularly went out to either drive for a ridesharing service to make money for all the bills or screw women. I worked a minimum wage job first in food service, then upgraded slightly above minimum wage to a private security job. Still: I wasn’t making more than $11.50 an hour, and I live in California. I barely managed to buy food for the house and not drown in my own credit card debt trying to make sure food existed. For two years, we weren’t a family, and it showed. I’m not proud to admit I withdrew as well, and struggled to help between working full time and snagging up any overtime I could get *and* get through some college classes.

Come two years later, and my mother passed away from complications relating to her cancer. I had thought Sarah and I starting to get along better — and to an extent, we sort of have. Little things piled up at first: she’d take any face cleaners I had in our shared bathroom and threw them into my room, claiming I was ‘messy.’ Then she’d keep moving my car keys, my purse would get thrown into my room. Left my work boots on the floor, away from nose level, in the garage we as a family all exit out of because of the sheer smell (8+ hours a day, 5 days a week)... and she’s insist on dumping them in a messy pile atop yet more shoes. Won’t take no for an answer. She complains I’ve been doing laundry for “days” if I do my laundry at all. I put a lock on my bedroom door as she had (and still has) a bad habit of shoving and leaving the door open at 4 AM to let out dogs in on her way out to her job (my shifts at work end at midnight). She picks the lock every time. Leaves her slippers out around the house but throws mine into my room if I forget them downstairs for whatever reason. Complains the entire time I’m cooking — even if I’m cooking for us — that I’m ‘messy’ AS I’m cooking (this never changes whether I clean all dishes up at once after or if I clean as I cook).

She gets mad that I won’t wake up at 5 AM to wall the dogs with her. I’ve told her I’ll do it in the evening. She gets mad that I complain about it. Again, my shifts ended at midnight. Try to tell her to leave me alone, and she rolls her eyes and says “Oh boohoo, you can sleep in” (regrettably doesn’t work like that, and I’ve gained a wonderful 9 PM to 3 AM sleep schedule now that I’ve been promoted to Assistant Director).

If I cook in the kitchen while she’s downstairs: “Why are you always in my fucking way?” She has held a knife up to me once for this offense (parents never believed me, since I never called police on her... because of course people just easily call cops on their family members).

If I’m upstairs in my room to avoid conflict with her: “Why don’t you ever sit with meeee?”

If I can’t afford to help buy food for the dogs: “What do you spend your money on?? You’re so bad, holy shit.” Keeps asking me to buy her snacks and the dog food. I can no longer afford to go to college as a result.

If I question why she’s out of money after a paycheck: “What the fuck, that’s none of your business, you’re so fucking rude!”

The kicker: she wants to move out of state and will not allow me to keep even one of the dogs we both grew up with, claiming I’ll kill them. I’ve come to accept this and have told her “good luck, have fun.” I’m not even an option if she has an untimely death: she plans on sending them to a friend in another state.

... That’s probably enough information to get the idea of my relationship with Sarah.

I’m not a saint. My room is a pigsty, I’ve gained far more weight than I want. I’ve withdrawn most of my help when it comes to the dogs since Sarah wants to claim I don’t help (she still asks me, monthly, to help pay for their food; not gonna let them starve, so I pay for it).

My friends say she’s horribly toxic. Mutual friends I share with Sarah tell me that’s “just the way she is” and “she really cares about you.” I can count on one finger the number of times I’ve genuinely felt like she’s ever cared. I can no longer count the number of times I’ve felt disrespected. Every time she buys me drinks or food feels like an appeasement and a trap, and not something out of the goodness of her heart. I don’t trust her, don’t know her, and honestly have reached a point where I don’t want to.

Sarah is also the only family member I have in the US. Joe doesn’t count because he’s at this point actively trying to kick us out of the house we grew up in so he can move in with his new girlfriend (sweet lady, truly, and she makes him happy, but fuck him on most days). Sarah is planning on moving out of state with all the dogs to chase after Vet School if she can get in. Extended family is all in Egypt and we really don’t talk much — we went 13 years without speaking until my mother’s passing.

Every vacation, every getaway, every time I leave the house without Sarah, is freeing. I can’t stand living with her. We obviously don’t click a d never have, and I don’t want to abandon my life in California to follow and chase after her going to vet school in another state, especially when I’m currently working for a great company with a lot of advancement opportunities.

So. I pose the question, I guess.
Is cutting my family out of my life the right answer?"
1660,I’m starting to genuinely resent being a nice person and want to start being cold and assertive.,I’ve spent my entire life being taken advantage of and feeling bad if I can’t or don’t have the time/money/energy to help someone and give too much of myself without appreciation. I’m tired of it. I want the ability to look out for myself and not feel bad about it. I want to advocate for myself without guilt. I want to tell people no and let it be their problem with 0 worry from me. I want people to back off from me without feeling like I’m hurting their feelings like I should even care. I’m always worrying about how everyone else is feeling and giving them the benefit of the doubt that they care about my feelings too when they clearly fucking don’t. I am fucking sick of it. Fuck being nice.
1661,Uhhh oh no!,"I am suffering from depression and anxiety yet  I'm only 16. Growing up I was abused emotionally and physically, i never talked about it. This is a random post for myself and I don't expect anyone to comment or like."
1662,I feel like im being mentally abused by my father.,"Ever since I can remember, my dad has always been a yeller. But i was little then, and I just thought that because he used to be in the military, and was a cop (at the time), that it is probably because of that. Now that I'm a little older (15) I can realize stuff now, and I feel like I'm being mentally abused by him.

I want to say first off that I'm not saying he is a bad father. He has worked his ass off to provide for our family. I live in a good house, I go to a catholic school, I eat good. I know, what is this kid complaining about, he has a privilege that most don't, he shouldn't be complaining. But here is the thing, I would rather live in a shitty home, go to a public school, and have nothing, if he wasn't the way he was. If he wasn't how he is now, and how he treats me, I would rather have nothing, because I would be happy that he shows me the amount of affection I see other kids get. If I were to tell him that, he would tell me the list would go on and on about the things he has done for me, but I dont care about the money that he spent on me. That isnt love.

I have a few reasons on why I think what I do

1. He is always yelling or getting mad at everything everyone does in the house: He yells if people have to ask him to repeat something more than once(When he constantly does that.) He will yell at you and be mad at you if you forget something(When that is something he is constantly doing.) 
2. He is always suspicious and thinks that we are all lying to him: It makes me feel like I'm never trusted.
3. He brings me down and it makes me change the way I am: He has called me a ""fag"" for the way I used to part my hair, so I started to change the way I was doing my hair, (for my entire life up to when i was 12 when he called me that) He has made fun of the way my jaw is shaped, and I feel like I can never have a good picture now, because it is all I see, and I want to change it so he doesn't think that way
4. I am always the one who is wrong in everything because, ""he is older than me"": I was told by him, ""Whether you like it or not, your always gonna lose."" And it makes me feel like everything is my fault. I am always apologizing for everything, even with things that I shouldn't apologize for. My girlfriend tells me that I say sorry too often.
5. He lies to make himself right in situations: Just the other day, I made myself food, and I didnt know he wanted anything. I told him, ""I can go back upstairs and make you something, because I didnt know you wanted anything."" But he wouldnt let me. He ends up waking up my mother, who is asleep, and asks her to make him food, because I refused to make him any. And I cant say anything because I know, ""I'm always going to lose.""

I feel like I have so much anxiety for no reason. I woke up having an anxiety attack in the middle of the night one time after he yelled at me that for something. But I cant say anything because, ""I'm always going to lose."" He tells me I have anxiety for reason, and that I have nothing to have anxiety about. But what he doesnt understand is that I have anxiety because I am always worried that Im going to get yelled for everything.

I tell my mom how I feel, and all she can tell me is, ""Forget about the things he's done."" But she doesnt understand that it is hard to, because ive experience it my entire life. I cant just, forget about the past and POOF its gone. But she doesnt understand thats not how it works.

I cant have a conversation with him about it because, ""I'm always going to lose""

My mom tells me that I just have to deal with it until I move out. But I dont know when that will be, and i cant be living in an environment where I am always wrong, I cant be trusted, and that I cant do anything about because, ""Im always gonna lose."" She tells me that I cant talk to a therapist, or a priest about it, until I move out, because he isnt gonna let me talk about the shit he has done, to someone else. But I NEED SOMEONE NOW,not in 10 years, I need someone to talk about how I feel now. So I feel like this is a good place to get some advice. I just hope that my dad doesnt see this, because I'm gonna feel like the worst person in the world."
1663,Boyfriend doesn't understand post-surgery pain and emotions,"Hi, all! 

I had major surgery on my spine last Monday and it was a success! I was able to go home from the hospital after a few days on pain meds. The first few days home sucked, both pain-wise and emotionally, but I'm feeling better now. I'm just still tired and hurting some. 

My mom and I went to the zoo today to get out of the house and, I mean, animals are always nice. We also stopped by the hospital to give little thank you gifts to the nurses who helped with me and then ate lunch on the way home. I had a wheelchair at the zoo that I sat in periodically, and was relatively comfortable in the car, but I'm exhausted and have a migraine now. My back is also super swollen. 

I tried to vent to my boyfriend of nearly a year about my surgery and all after getting home from the hospital and he just told me to ""stop complaining"" and that ""others had it worse"". I know there are far worse surgeries, and I'm glad that mine was a success, but I'm still in pain and trying to deal with the emotional repercussions.

Today, ten days post-op, he started in on when we could have sex again. I told him that I don't want to risk anything until I feel better or after my post-op appointment in September, but he's still insistent on at least trying. I do miss it, but it's the last thing on my mind right now. I just want to curl up in bed with my ice machine and cat and sleep. 

I don't want to starve him of intimacy for so long, but I don't feel comfortable getting back to it yet. I don't know what to do."
1664,I think I’m headed towards depression?,"Hi all,

I’ve been working from home since March and will be doing so for at least the end of this year. My husband and I still live with his parents and we’ve only been married for a little over a year. It is difficult navigating the current crisis and how to do marriage. I am only speaking for myself because I am not the type of person who likes being cooped up. I want to have the option/freedom to go out and about, but I am saddened that I can’t anymore. I really am having such a difficult time dealing with it all. From wanting to be able to move into my own home and just being motivated to do things again.

I have not been taking care of myself and have become empty. The things I once loved doing, I find no more passion and desire for. I’m just going by the motions. When I was in college, I hit major depression and would not get out of bed for days. My mom who did not understand how MH can affect people thought I was being lazy and yelled at me multiple times. I’m afraid that, that is going to happen to me soon. I’m wanting to sleep and not get out of bed. Feeling hopeless and jus wanted to vent."
1665,Is it unhealthy to try and support others when you probably also need help?,"I’ve always had a habit of trying to offer support to others, despite if I’m in a very poor mental state. I really don’t know what else to put here, besides, like, is it a bad thing to do, or does it depend on the situation?"
1666,I got my diagnosis yesterday,"I was already aware of my Bipolar disorder but this summer has been a whirlwind of psych ward, group therapy and one on one therapy.  Turns out my Bipolar is Rapid Cycling, I also have GAD, PTSD, Panic Disorder and Personality Disorder traits of BPD and Schizoid.  I agree with the diagnoses, but not sure therapy or medication is helping."
1667,Waking up to Emotions at a 10?,"Does anyone know what this is? Sometimes I wake up feeling like I'm in the middle of a panic attack? I wake up with my chest heavy, shaking, almost feeling completely scared, and incredibly sad, along with an overwhelming sense that something bad is gonna happen.

It usually happens on the day I'm leaving my bfs place (we live in different cities and sometimes only see each other once a week or once every two weeks) or following/leading up to an event, but also randomly.

It usually goes away throughout the day, but I just wake up feeling terrible, exhausted, emotionally drained, and sad, and really nervous. It almost... hurts, more specifically my heart, it feels like my heart hurts? It typically leads to crying, being overly sensitive, I even sometimes just get aggravated and mad at small things. It just really sucks, it's like waking up with a feeling of DREAD and incredible sadness. 

Am I literally waking up in the middle of a panic attack? Something else? How can I prevent it?

TIA 🧡"
1668,To those with bipolar II or people who are smart,What do you do on days that you just cant sit down and chill. Im managing a business while studying. On days that i dont have stuff to do. I just cant calm down what should i do best. Im cycling through emotions really fast. And regretting wasting time etc. But im still very productive. But nothing seems enough.
1669,Some positive words i want to share with you about anyone feeling suicidal,"Many people see suicide as the only option left in life, but its not, it is just your current thoughts and beliefs that have lead you to this conclusion its the only option. Is it the only option though? The answer is no. It’s like being in a large dark room and you feel your way around and find a door that you open and it says ‘suicide’, it’s the first door you found in the dark, but in this dark room it is also full of other doors, other options to move your life and how you feel right now to something greater in the future. Feeling so low and distressed its feel like an easy option to take the first door.

What causes you to feel this way? This may surprise you, its not the events of life that is making you feel the way you do, it is your thoughts about the situation, that then cause emotions. 

First the thoughts, then the feelings. Thoughts alone don’t make want to consider ending your life, it’s the overwhelm of emotions that you don’t know how to process and are causing you much stress, fear and pain.

When you are stressed, your brain cannot think logically. A part of the brain called the amygdala is activated, this is called the fight or flight aspect we all have. When it is active, the body releases cortisol a stress hormone which floods the body and we do not think clearly as a result. This part of the brain is useful if we sense danger and need to escape from something, but when it is our own thoughts that is the danger, we cannot run from ourselves. 

The thing is this can be changed, and you may feel that its not worth changing as you may already have a belief your life is ruined. That is all that feeling is, a belief you have.

If you feel you are the lowest point, then that means you can only go up and improve from there.

A lot of the reasons people feel so low is because they think they have failed in life in some way.  
 This idea of failure we learn in our society is only an opinion. 

Thomas Edison would have considered to be a failure many times working on his inventions. He failed a thousand times trying to create the first light globe. What he said when asked about it was this:  
 ""How did it feel to *fail* 1,000 times?"" *Edison* replied, ""I didn't *fail* 1,000 times. The light *bulb* was an invention with 1,000 steps."" 

Here are some other great quotes:

""Great success is built on *failure*, frustration, even catastrophe.""

""Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.""

Failure really is the road to success if you understand that failure is a necessary part of life so we can grow. A large part of life is to learn so we can grow. When people first ride a bike they fail, and through repetition they eventually succeed.

Hearing this may not make you feel any better yet, but keep reading as I want to help you see more clearly whilst not in a logical state of mind.

Lets say you are experiencing great loss at the moment. Perhaps you lost a relationship, a job, a business, your house, car etc. The feeling of loss we learn means we have failed, but ask your self this; is what I am thinking actually a fact or is it just my belief or opinion from my thoughts and emotions? I can tell you that it is not a fact. If you say you have failed and I say you haven’t then who is actually correct? Truth is both of us based on our beliefs and perspective.

It is never too late to start life again from nothing, age is no restriction, nor gender , nor race. If you think they are then again, it is your limiting beliefs holding you back.

Colonel Sanders who started KFC did so when he retired and received his first social security check. When he saw how little the amount was he said to himself “I can’t live on this” and then put together some recipes and started KFC. That was in his 60’s.

Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Vehicles went broke 5 times before building it back up to a successful vision. There are many people who have lost all their money and earned it back again, people starting business at any age.

You too can do this, anything anyone else has done you can do too, in your own unique way.

When someone works out at the gym, to grow their muscles they need to keep pushing weights until the muscle fails. For body builders failure is a good thing as it needs to happen so the muscle can tear and grow to be bigger.

All of our lives are the same, the challenging experiences of life are like the muscle failing so we can grow. 

I am not making some wishy washy statement here either, it can be challenging and even bizarre to think of loss not as failure if you have always seen it that way. As I mentioned earlier life is about lessons, so what can you learn about life and yourself from this loss? Everything has an opposite, loss also means gain. In loss there is always a gain in some way. 

It can be hard to face that and see the good in situations, especially when emotions are at a low point. 

If we could remove all emotions and thoughts from our bodies, then nothing that happens would be seen as good or bad, it would be just an event. When you feel sad about something, it is the emotion giving you the experience, if you could not feel sadness or happiness then events would have no effect on you. I am saying this to demonstrate that it is your emotions creating the experience, and the emotions come from your thoughts.

So what are you telling yourself at the moment inside your head? Events can trigger thoughts, the thoughts create emotions, emotions create an experience. 

What is needed really then is to change our thoughts and perspective. You may think that what is happening outside of your body and mind is what creates your experience, but its actually not, its how the events are processed within you. Most people are used to this experience, something happens then people react and feel a certain way.

The reason is we attach our joy and peace to things outside of ourselves, so when conditions change you then have a corresponding emotional effect. All things are really symbols of what we give meaning to. If you lose your job and title you may feel really down. This could be for many reasons as the job may be a symbol, so losing it could mean; feeling you aren’t worthy (self-worth issues), lack of security (creates fear of uncertainty), feeling useless (lack of purpose), loss of identity (defined yourself by only your work). Perhaps you worry about what others will think too, how they will perceive you, and then how you perceive yourself. 

A lot of things can come up in big life changing events from within.

When you feel emotional pain, it is only to bring to your conscious attention that something needs to be addressed from within. If you cut yourself and it causes pain, the pain is to signal to you that it needs attention.

Where we go wrong in terms of our emotions is when we are afraid to feel them. They are actually trying to help us grow, giving us pain to say “hey, there is an issue we need to address”.

We aren’t taught to recognise challenging emotions this way. Most people learn in an unconscious way to numb their emotions through using escapism's such as alcohol, drugs, gambling, sex etc. 

Nothing will change if we don’t face our pain. Yes it is painful, but don’t be afraid of the pain, if you can learn to stand back and ask yourself some quality questions you can really start to clear these things out.

Asking yourself:

Why do I feel this way?

What does \_\_\_\_\_\_ mean to me and why?

What are some possible solutions to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

What is the evidence for this thought? Against it?

Am I basing this thought on facts, or on feelings?

Is this thought black and white, when reality is more complicated?

Might other people have different interpretations of the same situation? What are they?

Am I looking at all the evidence, or just what supports my thought?

Could my thought be an exaggeration of what’s true?

Am I having this thought out of habit, or do the facts support it?

Did someone pass this thought/belief to me? If so, are they a reliable source?

Is my thought a likely scenario, or is it the worst case scenario?

These questions are designed to try and get you to see differently than your current thoughts are creating for you. As I said earlier, everyone has an individual way they see the world, your way is only one way, there are always many more.

When we suffer its because we are strongly attached to a preference on how we want the outer conditions from our mind to be in the world. We may want the relationship we once had, or the place we lived, or job etc. and that’s fine to want those things, it is only when we keep holding on to them when they are gone that creates emotional suffering. It can still take time to get over things, but keep optimistic about life. There was a time once when you had no idea you would ever meet the person in the relationship you had, or you may not have ever expected to live where you did or have the job you did. All of those things were once in your unknown future and you still have an unknown future also full of new and great experiences. These experiences will also be experienced as emotions, but super positive feel good ones. 

Life is a series of ups and downs, nothing is permanent life is always in a state of change. Changing of seasons, changing of the weather, our own changing from time of a baby to adult and all our tastes and preferences on the way. If you are in a tough time right now, tough times don’t last forever either, just remember over your life how this is true already.

It is a challenging time for many at the moment, don’t give up on life, just give up on unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about life and yourself. You don’t need to have answers right now, have it all worked out. Do what seems the most logical step towards improving your life this day.

You can and will make it through this as a victor and champion that is already within you, have a great success story to share with others. See your challenges as a heroes journey, one for you but one to share and help others too, you matter and have a lot to give to this world.

Just take care of yourself, reach out if needed to others. I genuinely believe in you."
1670,Nothing feels right anymore,"Hello, I have recently started to notice that nothing feels right to me anymore. I am diagnosed with major depression, but is it possible that it suddenly acted up extremely severely? For the last two weeks, everything has had a “dark glow” for me, I don’t feel like myself at all. Everything seems so off. Right now I can’t sleep, because I’m suddenly scared of the dark. I have never been scared of the dark, but tonight I’m basically horrified of it. Nothing seems right to me for some reason anymore, can anyone explain what is going on?"

1672,People don’t understand how hard it is to get the right medication,"So I am not on any medication myself right now but am being treated for an eating disorder, depression and anxiety. I’ve watched two people close to me go through the process of being getting medication and the right combination. 

I also started work at a mental health worker at an inpatient psych hospital which treats severe and acute patients with a variety of mental health issues. We have severely actively psychotic and disorganized patients. Most of my patients are bipolar or some sort of schizoaffective disorder and I’ve realized that the general public doesn’t understand how hard it is to find the right medication!! 

Why isn’t there more awareness about how difficult this process is?? How it can take years and years to get the right meds and how that entire process of a rollercoaster? Even for “less severe” neurological disorders. My bf became depressed his senior year of high school and had severe anxiety. He almost didn’t graduate and he deteriorated fast but all the needed was an ADHD Med and a simple anxiety med. that’s it!! It took TWO YEARS to get the right med, and get it balanced. My best friend became severely depressed her junior year of high school and got access to resources and medication right away...it’s been FOUR YEARS AND she is FINALLY responding to the right medication...and only after a severe weight loss. 

My patients charts are often thicker than novels because it has taken them 20+ years of trial and error with medication. Most of my patients are homeless and/or addicted. Most of them are just poor and it’s taken them so so much longer to get access to experts and decent resources. It’s tragic. 

As awareness for treating these diseases goes up and support for getting the right treatment, people need to be more aware of how awful this process can be for some...also since medication is thought of as a “quick fix” for mental illness. It is a necessity for those who need it but it’s not an easy process on your physically or psychologically. I wasn’t even aware of how common it is for people who have experiences like my friends until this job and I was only vaguely aware of the process before then. 

What are other people’s experience with medication? Did some have a simpler time and just tried one or two meds and they worked?"
1673,Interchanging Between anxiety and depression,"So before I used to have medium to high levels of anxiety (poor way to put it but I’m trying make it simple) and then I started becoming very depressed for many reasons but as my depression worsened my anxiety got much less. 

Now after a while I’m starting to improve on myself and depression and it’s getting much better but now my anxiety is going through the roof again as my depressions gotten less. 

Does anyone else experience this? I now have the worse anxiety I’ve ever had but I’m improving so much depression wise. They keep interchanging, when one gets low the other gets high. What’s going on?"
1674,I need some help,"I feel like I’m going crazy. I have adhd, tons of anxiety, and I’m bipolar. I feel stupid all the time, like I’m incapable of sounding even remotely smart. I can’t sit still, sometimes I just get up and walk about my house and think, and my family probably thinks I’m crazy. I’ve been taking my bipolar meds later and later because I keep forgetting so I go to sleep later. My anxiety has gotten a lot worse since I’ve switched to bipolar medication. I have a TON of body image issues, I’ve on the verge of just not eating at all. I’m sorry if this seems like too much, I just feel like I’m going crazy and that people think I’m stupid or weird."
1675,I feel stupid and I can't stop worrying. Please tell me if I'm doing the right thing.,"I start college on Monday, I'm majoring in business and it has now come upon me that I know NOTHING. I literally had to be reminded of the basic concepts of economics, accounting etc. and still have a hard time grasping these basic concepts. If I can't understand what my classes are for, why am I even trying? It feels like I'm doing something wrong, I keep asking my parents and people around me for advice but they get angry and tell me I should figure everything out for myself. I'm incredibly worried and I don't know how I'm going to get through college. Please give me advice, it can be on anything."

I have a high libido, but I hate hookups, and have only been in long term relationships. I'm 28 and have been in four serious relationships, and in all four, the sex has been an issue.

1.) Serial cheater. Never satisfied with me, always wanted someone else.
2.) Horribly selfish. Ignored my needs and used my body for his pleasure only.
3.) Low libido, said me wearing lingerie stressed him. 
4.) Great sex for first three months, now doesn't want to have sex more than once a month.

I feel like shit. I feel like I can never express myself sexually. I'm angry, I'm hurt, I'm resentful, I feel like I'm never good enough."
1681,Endless bullying from childhood to early adulthood has destroyed me,"I never graduated high school, if I kept going I would have either killed myself or someone else, it didn’t stop outside of school, it continued outside, where I worked, where nobody who new me worked, and it started immediately, and honestly didn’t stop until I was about 26. I used to have a good work ethic, but over the years it has deteriorated, to my bosses I was a loose, regardless of how hard I worked, and that never changed, now I go into a place I keep my head down and do my shit, but honestly I’m incapable of taking any pride in what I do, I know it’s irrelevant, I loose motivation, my anxiety creeps in, and I bail. 

At this point I’m about to be homeless, I’ve lost every ounce of motivation to try, it always ends in failure. For a long time I pointed to myself, but looking back at my 33 it’s just like fuck, literally 90 percent of the people I’ve come across have looked down on me, or not taken me seriously, even my own fucking parents, at this exact moment I have 4 people in my life, my gf hit son and my 2 boys who I only see on weekends. 

How can I get this bitter taste out of my mouth? how can I pull myself out of this and get back to work? it doesn’t happen anymore, but honestly the damage seems to be done, and I have no motivation to try and undo it again, the idea of being up only to fall again is fucking depressing, I know the drill and frankly just don’t want to be a part of it."
1682,Questioning reality,"Sorry, I didn't know what to flair as.

I don't know where to start with this.

I've known this for years but I saw a video that's making me question whether or not it's actually happening.

So, for a few years, I've been able to tell my thoughts are being altered. I can't tell what thoughts they are but I know someone's fucking around in my brain and making me think things I don't want to be thinking. I hate feeling like this and I wish I could make whoever it is stop because I feel so scared all the time.

I don't even know what im supposed to be thinking and feeling at this point because I know they can change any of my thoughts and beliefs and I'm so scared. I don't think it's necessarily the government because I'm anarcho-punk and pretty outspoken about it, so I don't know who then.

I saw a video on tiktok(I know, I know) talking about types of delusions and I??? They described people who feel like I do for one of the items on the list. I can't find the video again cause I kind of angrily exited out. It didn't sit right with me at the time and I dismissed it, but now I'm wondering if I'm actually just delusional.

I've never told anyone about these beliefs and about the editing/control and I don't know where to go from here.

I know none of you are really qualified to diagnose me, if there's anything to diagnose, so I'm really just looking for support and if people have gone through what I'm going through.

It's been a hellish few weeks for other reasons, and I feel like I'm losing my mind."
1683,I need help learning to love myself," I have been suffering from a conversion disorder presenting as PNES (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) for about the last year. After diagnosis in January 2020 I was told cognitive behavioral therapy would be a very good treatment plan. I had never tried to get it treated until early July when I started having paranoid delusions and suicidal ideations which I believe to be linked and originating from my disorder. Since the beginning of starting therapy I have consistently been experiencing worsening symptoms to the point where I just have a disembodied voice screaming at me to kill myself and other demeaning things basically 24/7. My psychologist and I have determined that I hate myself to an extreme degree. How can I change this and start loving myself asap? I fear if I cannot love myself soon while stirring up all my past overlooked emotions in these therapy sessions the disembodied voice might get what it wants.

I am still able to recognize when I am a danger to myself and have a pretty good grasp on controlling suicidal thoughts so no need to be unnecessarily worried."
1684,Someone help me please,So I don’t really know why this happened and I want someone to help me make sense of it all. So I was really irritated today my college messed up a few things and so I was pretty stressed out.(I was in my car) I tried to breathe a bit to calm down but I saw a straw wrapper in my car. My neck started twitching uncontrollably like my head would go to my shoulder quickly and I would scrunch my face up. I couldn’t help it. And after I saw that one wrapper I noticed another and some crumbs (me and my bf were eating breakfast) and I felt surrounded and I kept twitching hard and it hurt a lot and when I get upset I don’t like to be touched sometimes so my boyfriend tried to calm me down and I snapped at him on accident and the whole thing was a bad experience. (He knows how I can get sometimes I’m not asking for relationship advice) I was just wondering if this is normal when people get irritated or if this is something more? The twitching only stopped when I cleaned everything up

1692,Fighting CPSTD is a different kind of battle when you’re pregnant,"I’ve been having panic attacks since before I knew what panic attacks were but good lord the tightness in my chest, inability to breathe, and body trembling never fail to take me off guard.

I’m pregnant, &amp; 5 weeks out from my due date. My body is just about at its limits as far as this pregnancy goes. I’m small framed and this child is consistently kicking and sitting inside my rib cage. I have a constant lower back ache despite how much rest or exercise or posture correction I try. Don’t even get me started on lightning crotch, contractions, and heartburn.

My dad, who’s been my main abuser since childhood, has decided that he wants to develop a pill addiction in response to my first pregnancy. The last time we spoke he called me an ungrateful bitch because I told him we should talk about serious matters (he wanted me to move into his house with my boyfriend and step kids??) when he’s sober. He’s convinced coronavirus is a hoax; racism doesn’t exist.... the list goes on. He’s completely unhinged at this point.

My ex called tonight to let me know that my rapist and his friends are *still,* 4 years later, trying to find people to testify against me at trial and attack my character. He was approached for the 3rd time by my rapist’s friend while grocery shopping today and asked to speak to the defense attorney. 

The step kids are going to do homeschooling for the first semester this year. Which is great, except I’m due 2 weeks after school starts back, which means I’m going to be navigating teaching them from home 50% of the time, breastfeeding, as well as all the household stuff and paying bills and responsibilities I currently have. 

Oh, right, and I’ve been stuck in my house since March with this COVID stuff. Stepped down from my management position at work, gave up literally any vice that I’ve ever used as a coping mechanism in order to be “healthy” for the baby, and I’m technically high-risk for COVID so I can’t even physically have my support system nearby, except my boyfriend. 

I feel like I’m about .5 seconds away from completely shattering about 80% of the time, &amp; the other 20% that I don’t feel like I’m mentally a piece of glass teetering on a high ledge, I feel completely numb and like there’s no point to life anymore.

Yeah, yeah, talk to a therapist. Except the closest trauma specialist is 2 hours away, and is out of network for my insurance. The last one I saw diagnosed me with CPSTD and then said “well I’m really not qualified to treat trauma patients, what I do is more generalized... but I’m here if you’d like to talk.” I’ve probably gotten more out of this random vent on a mental health forum on reddit than all my years of attempting therapy combined.

1696,In serious panic mode. Need to chat.,"I found out my finace has been deleting things like girls he searches on his phone,  found out hes sending pictures of said girls to his friend because he finds them attractive, then deleting the searches. 

So to be more specific, today he ended up ""running into student painters"", chatting it up, and likely flirting with these girls, he searched them on facebook, saved the pictures to his phone, and sent them to his buddy and was talking about how attractive they are.  He ended up clearing his search, but it said in his phone history that he cleared 2 girls names from his facebook search. Thats when I got upset. Why are you hiding things? Afraid of how I will react doesnt justify telling me I'm being paranoid, or that I'm flat out wrong and crazy to think you'd lie because you wouldn't jeopardize what we have(our family and the years we've spent together).

My issue is that this isn't the first time he's lied when it comes to girls. Seems to be the thing he doesnt want to be honest about with me. So there's no trust left. I dont know what to do when I feel like he's capable of hiding things from me, and it seems l've been right about some things, but our family..
He's manipulated me into thinking it was just me so many times when I've had the same gut feeling and confronted him about it. He's also sworn up and down and then has been caught in a lie. And listen, I know he may not have cheated(as far as I know), but how do I know he wouldn't go there if theres no trust. 

Feel so broken right now. Could use a little guidance,  and feedback."

1698,Could you share your experience with therapy and being put under medication?,"I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for quite a long time and I wanna try going on therapy. Could you share some of your experience on this and also on the medication you've taken?

I wasn't feeling too comfortable thinking of going to a therapist since I had a terrible experience at the well-being department at my university (they have certified counselors). I just felt like the counselor wasn't even being focus on what I was saying but rather asking some really irrelevant questions (for example: how I got a really good English speaking accent ???!!!). Since I was being suicidal, she suggested me to go to a therapist and she said that she also has to contact someone close to me to accompany me when I go on therapy so I give her my friend's contact. However, she keeps insisting on calling my parents but I didn't feel comfortable telling this to my parents at all. Yet, the university has my parent's contact so she said that I either have to call one of my relatives or she'll call my parents. At first, I wasn't feeling like being listened and then I - an 20 years old - was threatened to be called on parents?!!!. I told her I don't feel comfortable with it (my mental state is mainly caused by things around my family) and tell her I won't go to therapy if noticing my parents was that necessary but she wouldn't let me get out of the room unless she gets to call my family even if I don't go on therapy. And I went on having a meltdown right at that moment but she looked like she couldn't care less. After crying for 2 hours straight, I have to call my sister, who has committed suicide once and still quite depressed now (this is why I didn't want to call her at first, with all the complex already, I don't want to put any burden on her shoulders) but I couldn't think straight at that moment so I went on calling her (I felt terrible so I tried so much to cheer her up after that and she seems fine then). I mean... Is this what normally gonna happen when you meet a counselor? Am I just being too sensitive? Will the therapist ask me to call my parents?..."

1701,abandonment issues,"TL;DR can someone threatening to leave or saying they’re gonna leave you cause abandonment issues? 

for some context, i’ve had separation anxiety for basically my whole life. it really started when i was 5 and my best friend moved. doesn’t sound that bad but for some reason that really jump started it. i’m 17 now and still have the same issues. i hate being away from my mom and my sister although i’m getting better with it. so i guess that plus my clinical depression could cause fear of abandonment but i’m really wondering if something else could make it worse/cause it. my older sister can be pretty dramatic and whenever we get in big fights (less often nowadays but more common a few years ago) she would always threaten or say she’s gonna leave me. she’s 13 years older than me and basically raised me alongside my mom. she’s got quite a temper and has told me things like that several times. now i usually don’t even talk to her about things she said/did that upset me because i don’t want to fight with her. i remember one time when i was 12 i was in the car with her and my mom and she started screaming at me because i was being “rude” to one of her friends. it was like 1am and i was super tired. anyways she went on and on about how she was done with me and she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. so basically i’m wondering if the combination of all this could cause abandonment issues. it’s weird i’ve never really considered it but idk?"

That and the fact that my head keeps thing up the worst scenarios I'm just so stressed. Not to sound like mr.tuff man mc.gee but my emotions are normally in check and I've never had to deal with any mental health stuff before. However, now that I'm stressed all the time I get very nauseous and feel like I need to puke(but don't puke). Is this normal when your stressed?"
1704,So I just had a self-loathing episode for the first time in about a month.,"(TLDR at the bottom. Sorry I went on a bit of a tangent here, I have a lot of bottled up stuff because that's just how I don't handle emotions. Also I typed this on mobile so the formatting might be a bit fucky. Also also, hi first post here.)

Hi, sorry if this is worded weird or anything, my brains still a foggy and tired from sobbing a few minutes ago. But still, I'd like to see if anyone's willing to give some sort of advice or just let me vent maybe, idk we'll see when I'm done typing.

Some of backstory first I guess, I've had extreme anxiety my whole life due to my chronic illness (altough I didn't actually get diagnosed with it until my mid teens. Currently I'm 17.) And when I hit my teens I ended up with depression as well, due to the feeling of not going anywhere in my life. After spending all of 2019 cutting off everyone I know outside of my immediate family (and honestly I would've cut them off too if I wasn't financially dependent on them) due to my worsening depression and anxiety, my parents finally put me on some antidepressants (even though I probably need antianxiety meds more but whatever I'll take what I can get) about a month or two or three ago.

I've also been homeschooled my whole life; altough, my parents weren't exactly the best teachers. I still don't know how I'm going to be able to get into college like my parents want me to. I honestly don't know what I even want to go into. When I was younger I wanted to do art, and my parents were actually very supportive! But I just didn't (and still don't) have it in me to be able to draw to a commercial standard, so I gave that up and have just kinda been drifting without meaning for the past few years.

Which that actually segways into the current issue. I've been drawing again, and I finally found it fun again; ""found"" being the keyword. Earlier tonight, I was drawing and I thought my ink was dry. I was erasing the sketch and I didn't smudge most of it, and the pen I was working with Normally dries quickly. So instead of waiting a night to let it dry, like I do with most pens, I just went straight into coloring with my markers. It was fine at first, I got most of it done before moving onto the face. But once I started coloring in the skin, the ink started to smudge. And when I say smudge, I dont mean a tiny smear or two, I mean her skin looked gray. I tried to use a colorless blender to maybe pick up and lighten some of the ink, but it was too late by that point and just made it worse.

After that, I got frustrated and just smeared the gray color all over the rest of the drawing with the blender, then glued a piece of paper over it. I was incredibly mad at myself after that, my brain just kept going on and on and On about how much of a fucking dumbass I am, and that this is why I quit art and that I should just die because I'm a useless lump of flesh and bones who seems to always be a fuck up. While scratching at my very sensitive skin the whole time leaving red marks.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I just had my first self loathing episode in a while, and would maybe like to see if anyone has any advice to maybe stop doing this whenever I fuck up my drawings or anything else I do.

TLDR: Fucked up drawing then had self loathing episode with some suicide ideation on the side. Is there anyway for me to get my brain to stop overreacting to everything like this? Or at least get it under control faster when it does happen??"
1705,I need help,"I had a dream where I owned a mother pig with hundreds of piglets. I had the sudden urge to give them all a painful death.

Google makes it kinda seem like an episode of anxiety laid on by heavy amounts of stress and I agree but I just wanna know if anyone knows any ways to help me out. I have days where I am fine and nothing bugs me and it is a perfect day but I have days like today where I am just a sweaty ball of anxiety."
1712,"The past week has been the worst week of my life, but life has never been ‘better’.","I don’t know where to start.
I’m 14 and trying to speak from my own heart and not from the little voice in my head telling me “edginess is cool”. Because I know it’s not. This is genuine. 3 minutes after writing that line and I’m still  trying to think of what to write next. First off, I think I may be depressed, but I’m way too socially anxious to ask, or maybe I’m not socially anxious and just looking for attention, but from whom? I’m not telling anyone anything. My mind has been a jumbled mess of contradicting thoughts each arguing with the next about which side of me is really talking: the social side that I provide in public and around non-family members, my internal self where I share my personal thoughts with only myself, or the dreaded “socially-imposed” self, the one where I can’t help but do exactly what the crowd wants so as to not drag attention to myself. I don’t know if I’m depressed. I don’t know if I have anxiety. It seems like I do, but if I ask and I don’t, people will think I’m a crybaby going out of my way to get attention, which is damn near the last thing I want in this world. Same with the depression thing. I’ve been suppressing suicidal thoughts since I was 11 years old. Eleven. Years. But none of them have actually been genuine considerations as actual options until about a week or two ago, when I essentially melted down to nothing in the bathroom, of all places. I wanted to slam my fists against the wall, but it was late and I didn’t want to wake anyone. I wanted to resort to hurting/scratching myself to get out a kindling rage that had been brewing within me for as long as I can remember. Maybe not that long, that was just obnoxious. By the way, I’m making an effort here to not delete any text so everyone can see the cascading madness of my inner thoughts. That was obnoxious and I apologize. Back to the point — I think that night may have taken a significant toll on my already extremely unstable mental condition. Previously, I would be embarrassed to say “here” for attendance at school, now one can only imagine how unstable I feel with every single aspect of my character. That was edgy and I am again, sorry. I don’t exactly know what triggered the violent outbreak of emotions that night, but with little to no way to share or disperse them without hurting my own social reputation (this is a whole other issue that I will touch on in more depth later) I have just let them sit within me and I do not think this is healthy. What I’m about to say next is possibly the scariest thing I have ever thought. The following happened two nights ago. My family owns an electric bug net, to swat away flies and the like in a single “shocking” blow. Why the hell did I make a pun there, see, this is the sort of thing I struggle with, maintaining all 3 of my self-imposed personalities — nevermind. Back to the story.
I had brought out this bug net one night, as I had been annoyed with a mosquito flying around the room I was in (don’t ask me how it got there) but it flew away before I could hit it, so I left the net on the table in front of me. Turned off, of course, but it simply being there was enough. Later that night when I was getting ready to head upstairs and go to bed, I noticed the net still sitting there and had the idea — and no, this isn’t the edgy side speaking — to turn on the net and press it against my face until I fried from the inside. I did mean it when I said it was the scariest thing I have thought. Obviously, I can’t do this anymore. I can’t just let my emotions sit and build up pressure, because sooner or later, the volcano will blow and I’m afraid my life may blow with it. Please, please, help me. There is so much stuff that I want to add to this, but at that point it would be redundant - everyone understands the scale to which this is happening now and I don’t want it to seem like I’m ranting for no reason. And, I’ve just remembered that I mentioned that I’d touch on my concern over the social status issue. Take a look at my goddamned username, I’m so insecure that I have literally created an entirely new account just for more personal issues. Apparently I can’t even be comfortable with an anonymous online presence having feelings. I am so sorry that this went on for so long, but at this point, I am desperate. Please."
1713,I am like a preacher who doesn't believe in God. I don't always practice what I preach.,"I am very good at hearing someone elses problems, performing a short psychoanalysis (if you want to call it that), and telling them what they need to do to help solve their problems. But I can't do the same thing for myself as effectively. I have been trying lately, and don't feel like I've made as much progress as I think I have. What techniques can I learn, or questions can I ask myself, that will help me with this?"
1714,I'm struggling,really not coping with my ocd and anxiety it's effecting my mental health I can't do this anymore
1715,Productivity. Medicine working or mania?," I’ve never been productive. I would start things and immediately get bored. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to do whatever, i just dis not have the mental energy and i would get easily distracted and move on to something else. 
About four months ago i was diagnosed with adhd and have been slowly increasing my medicine.  I can tell a big difference, especially when i talk and read. 
My concern now is because for the last week or so, i have been productive- abnormally (for me) productive. An example is i worked in total 5 hours on  filming and editing a youtube video ( TWO OF THEM!!)  ive picked up on animating and i have animated more than i ever did in my animation class.  Ive went to all my doctors, ive cleaned everything, donated everything that does not bring me joy and i have helped paint the stairs. It may not sound like a lot, but its a lot for me.  What makes me the happiest is i am seeing the projects through. But this terrifies me.  If this isn’t the medicine, it might be mania. And just like a pendulum- if i feel this good, then what is the bad going to look like?"
1716,Help needed,Hello I'm 15 and I'm in a bit of confusion right now mainly on god religion reality itself and life after death mainly I'm questioning whether a god exist or not what religion does this entity belong to does it want to be worshiped could this entity just be a creator only focused on creating life or is it an entity that wishes to be worshiped and feared I'm on and off with religion right now especially Christianity because I always think how can a god give it's creation free will then punish it for having it or how can god send someone to hell for all eternity for either not believing in him when the person probably only lived in there 50's or 60's I'm also scared about saying anything against this god because I'm scared that I could be wrong and be punished for it my other problem is that what if I did all of these things for nothing and I die and I see nothing which I am comfortable with now thankfully after alot of anxiety and depression I have become self aware of my mortality during that time I was so desperate for answers that I converted to Christianity and when I converted I noticed all of the horrible things I've done when I was younger and felt deep shame and guilt from it things that I still think about now then I though about my existence and everybody else who is alive I though about things such as what if life is a computer simulation and everyone including me is fake or that I'm the only real person and everyone else is fake which was very troubling for me especially during the time I was anxious about death it just made me think that the tears I had she'd didn't matter and that even though people were there for me non of it was real to begin with anyways let me stop rambling can anyone give me advice?
1717,Please help,"Hello, lately ive been having extreme mood swings, i sleep throughout the day and I’m constantly watching what i eat, if i feel like ive ate too much i throw it up. I dont know how to seek help nor do i really know whats wrong? Im in a constant cycle of thinking too much, being up all night, and now my weight is an issue. When it comes to my mood swings, one minute I’m happy and then the next I’m feeling hopeless. I sleep most of the day or lay in bed. Not productive at all. I dont know how to get help and its causing me to ruin relationships. Im sad and just need some advice"
1718,I think something is wrong with me?,"I’m 28 and I think something is mentally wrong with me.

Whenever I lose something, I pretty much tear the apartment apart and look multiple times in the same place. If I can’t find it, then I start panicking and eventually start yelling and screaming. Then I start ranting about how dumb and disorganized I am and that it is BS that I can’t find whatever I’m looking for.

I do the same thing when I can’t find something cute to wear. I would dig through my dresser and mess up all of my drawers, throw clothes on the floor and then try on multiple outfits.

Then I’d get mad that there’s clothes all over the floor and either leave them there, or shove them all back in my dresser and later on be pissed off that my dresser is messy.

For example, two weeks ago I was getting ready to go. I tried on multiple outfits and I was mad that I looked fat in all of them. Then I started ranting on that it’s BS that I’m fat because I eat healthy and work out and that my body is stupid and that I’m cursed with fat genes. I do realize I’m ranting and tell myself to stop. Then I couldn’t find my wallet and I started having a panic attack and was yelling and crying that I couldn’t find it. I looked in my car three times, looked all over the apartment and it turned out to be under the seat in my car. My boyfriend sat in his car waiting for me and it was so embarrassing how I acted. (We live together so he knows how I can be).

Sometimes I catch myself yelling really loud for no reason. Like I’d be walking bear foot and I’d step on something and like a normal person, I’d react to it but for me I yell REALLY loud and get mad about it.

I get mad when I’m driving and if I stop at every red light, it pisses me off. If I miss a turn, I scream for a second and then I’m fine. There was one time I missed an exit so I was stuck in traffic and because I missed that exit, it took me 40 extra minutes to get home and I was basically having a temper tantrum in the car.

There’s some days where I can feel my irritability rise. I feel like I get irritated over the smallest stuff. Like if my hair tie breaks when I’m putting it up, I get mad. If my car keys fall to the ground I get mad.

I never yell at anyone. My bf and I never really fight and I’ve never yelled at him or raised my voice or anything. I have a full time job at a psychiatric hospital and I’m a really active person. I hike, camp, backpack, kayak, mountain bike, work out.

Sometimes I think maybe my job is causing increase irritability and stress. I mean, I work on the most violent ward at a psychiatric hospital and sometimes I think I act worse than them! So I did apply to a new job somewhere else and they want to hire me.

Do you think something is wrong or do you guys act like this sometimes?"
1719,"I'm not scared of dying, but afraid to start over.","So I'm not scared of dying, I really don't care. But I'm scared of having to start over on life. Since we don't know what happens after death. I'm scared that I'm going to be reincarnated or still live in the afterlife and I just don't want to deal with that. I dont know if that means I'm suicidal but it just scares me to think that I'll still have to deal with things after death. I just want the afterlife to be calm and I don't have to deal with everything anymore but there's no guarantee that that's the case. And I want to now if this means I'm suicidal or not?"
1720,does past ab*se in therapy get people in trouble,"So I'm starting up with a new psychologist because I was referred to them and I have recently had my memories unblocked.

I'm a little worried. Thanks, have a lovely day."
1721,First Counselling Session,So I’ve had a lot of issues for a long time and I’ve decided to finally see a counsellor. It’s free because of my uni but only for three sessions. Anyway I’m absolutely terrified and don’t know what to expect. I don’t know how to start or what I’m supposed to say. How much do I tell? I don’t want to seem attention seeking but that’s what I feel like every other time I’ve tried to tentatively reach out for help. I guess I just want to know what other peoples experiences were like and some advice on how to make it easier please?
1722,I’m losing my fucking mind,"I’m sick of feeling shitty, I just want to get drunk and high but I’m “not supposed to do that anymore” according to people who don’t even fucking talk to me anymore. It’s real easy for people who have shit to talk about how I just gotta “keep at it!” and shit like that but I have fucking nothing and no one, I never really have and everyday is a fucking waking nightmare. I’m sick of being sober and doing all these things to “improve myself” when my life is still a living hell 99% of the time. I can’t even get drunk anymore though because I’ll be haunted by the imaginary fucking disappointment of a friend I haven’t seen for almost a year. My brain is fucking screaming and I’m so fucking frustrated I wanna bite my fucking fingers off."
1723,Need help getting anti-depressants,Does anyone know the cheapest way to get a script for an anti-depressant sent to my local pharmacy with refills? I’ve been spending way too much during the 1.5 years I’ve been taking it.

1725,Can someone help me figure out what is wrong,"This isnt as serious as the title seems, Im just worried that this problem might be bad or might progress into something bad, as of right now it is just an inconvenience for me. Every time I watch a show that I really enjoy, after it ends it is the only thing i can think about. All I want for the few days after I finish it if to revisit those characters.

I would like it if anyone could help, im going to bed right after posting this so I wont be able to respond until morning."
1726,What would cause someone to need constant reassurance and be very sensitive but not want to show others they are sensitive,I always think over and over again about what people say to me. I’m really sensitive but I don’t show that to others. My roommates mom made a joke saying I’m “90% angel 10% devil” and on the outside I laugh bc I know it’s a joke.. but on the inside I start worrying about if she thinks I’m mean. I want to know if my friends think I’m a nice person but I’m too scared to ask because what if they say no. If someone says something rude about me I don’t want to call them out so they don’t know it hurt me.. I just kinda freeze.
1727,Can I be depressed if I have a good life,"Is is possible to be depressed with a good life? I(17m) have an objectively great life, with great, supportive 
 parents, good grades, a tight, non-toxic group of  friends, and a good athletic life. Even with all of this, the last 3 years of my life have been consumed by a kind of sad numbness. It’s not always terrible, as I am perfectly capable of having good days/weeks where I’m happy and energetic, but other days I’m sad to the point that I can’t focus at all during school or doing homework. When I mention it to people, they tend to ask me what happened (I have no idea what started it) or bring up how there’s nothing for me to be sad about. I’m even in the process of getting recruited to one of my dream schools for my sport, and can’t help but think I should be happy because of it. 

I haven’t gone to therapy/told my parents yet because I’m supposed to be the strong older brother(younger sibling is on antidepressants/has an ed), and also because I don’t want them to think they went wrong somewhere raising me."

1729,My girlfriend needs help but can’t get it,[removed]
1730,I need help,"This is going to be a long one. 
I am a suffering human being that needs help or at least someone to talk to. Please.

I was affected in the uterus of my mother from my abusive dad. I then grew up in a house of severe domestic violence and horrible, heated arguments until I was about 11. Many times a year. 

I was as young as 2 years old when my mum took my brothers and I to a women's refuge to get away from my father. We moved back and forth multiple times from him. This obviously affected me as well as the domestic violence, fearing my mother would be killed by my father sometimes. After their brawls my mother would disappear for hours on end, leaving me with abandonment issues.

As I grew up as a child the abusive behaviour also got turned toward me, being taunted by my father with the wooden spoon over miniscule normal children tantrums to being pushed onto the ground. I also would get psychologically abused by my mother calling me evil as an 11 year old child and disregarding my emotions, also verbally abused by her when she was angry at me, called me names, physically assaulted me by throwing objects at me, kicking me and punching me. She sent me to school with a hand print on me. She also would tell me she was a witch and that she wasn't my mother sometimes, just to get a reaction out of me.

As a 20 year old adult now I cannot hold my mother accountable for her actions or bring them up as she is in denial from the pain of her actions and will gas-light me, and tell me I am a liar and that I am making my trauma up in my head. My father tends to do the same to me. 

But yet, as an adult, my sole purpose seems to be keeping my parents from comitting suicide because they can't deal with the fact that they fucked up their youngest daughter so much. They have both been suicidal around me. 

All in all, I am here today with problems with regulating my emotions, I horribly and severely suffer from panic disorder, borderline personality disorder and the so-called ""daddy issues"".

I also suffered from anorexia as a teenager as I was an overweight child, I was extremely lonely and have always felt different from my peers, which means a hard time making genuine friends who actually care about me the way that I care for them.

I have ZERO friends as an adult now.

I started with dating really young as I yearned for that specific special and loving connection as I struggled with friends, and have been terribly hurt by immature and selfish people in the past.

I had my first real true love at 17, my first real relationship where we sacrificed a lot for each other. We committed. Looked after each other, shared a house together, wanted kids, and really just truly loved each other unconditionally. We still love each other to this day. 

But unfortunately this person also came from an abusive childhood and teenage-hood of drug abuse, and with us both not being healed, slowly but surely turned our relationship into an abusive but yet co-dependant one too. 

This partner has hit me, head butted me, pushed me on the ground and off our bed multiple times. They also sexually assaulted me out of anger in my own bed which I really struggle to deal with internally, and I usually just push it to the back of my head. 

So to sum it up, I am just absolutely fucked. I have been through far too much for me to handle. I am tired of being strong. I feel cursed. And suicidal. I have nobody to distract me from my thoughts on a daily basis. I am always alone.

I NEED HELP."
1731,Crisis Trained sharing Suicide prevention tips,"I commented this on a recent post but I haven’t seen anything like this on the sub so I thought I’d make it a post too


Psych student, social worker with at risk kids, and suicide prevention trained person here. If you are ever concerned about someone being suicidal, NEVER try to guilt or shame them out of it because it will most likely cause them to panic and either follow through or never improve. Always talk it with them and be very direct. The first thing you ask is “do you want to commit suicide?” Don’t beat around the bush, someone’s life is on the line here. Ask if they have a plan and what it is. If you can see the plan (like a pill bottle or a rope), stand in the way of it so they can’t see it and talk about what’s going on. How are they feeling? What in their life is causing them so much pain? Why do they feel this step is necessary. If you have the ability to do so safely, remove the object from the room. Call specialists if you still need help. Assure your friend that everything will be alright and that you are their for them. DONT TOUCH THEM. DONT GET YOURSELF IN HARMS WAY. STAY A DISTANCE THAT IS APPROPRIATE. If they are fully disengaged and need a hug afterwards, you may do so if you have a close relationship with them, otherwise put a hand on their shoulder. If they are holding a fire arm, try to talk to them somewhere safe like behind a door and call 911. If they have cuts on their arms, have them bandage themselves and call 911. If they have overdosed, call 911 and lay them in recovery position. If they have hung themselves, get them down immediately, call 911, and start CPR immediately."
1732,hospitalization mentioned,I saw my psychiatrist a few days ago and when asking about my thoughts they mentioned the potential for hospitalization if things get worse. I’ve never been honest with anyone in my life about the severity of my thoughts and now I’m terrified to even talk about it. I don’t want to be hospitalized but I also can’t stand my thoughts being so loud.
1733,Does therapy work for you?,I stopped seeing yet another psychologist/ therapist. I have tried 4 or 5 so far. I feel like nothing they have to say helps me. Talking about things doesn't help either. It just makes everything worse. I know these things take time but even after months I see no difference. Just extra frustration because I feel misunderstood and helpless. I'm just wondering why I can't be helped. I mean I keep listening about how helpful therapy is and I don't know why it doesn't work for me. DAE feel the same? What has worked for you if not therapy?
1734,Random rant because I'm emotionally exhausted,"I feel people treat me like shit because I'm nice. Even my family (who're not bad people) take me for granted because I'm not dominating and very easy to dominate. I hate conflict, so I'm the kind of person who will let people say trash about me and I just laugh it off and i HATE myself for this. Why am I such a pushover? I feel like I have no respect and I just want to runaway and live on a mountain, faraway from people. 

I WISH I was a mean person, at least I wouldn't be like this. I wish my conscience would die and my brain would stop telling me to be a saint every second and I'd rather stick up for myself."

Here's a check-in writing activity for you: 

1. How are you feeling, this Friday? How did you feel this week?
2. How have the feelings been showing up for you (physically or mentally)? 
3. What steps are you taking to cope with, or to move through, those feelings?"
1736,I realized the reason that I don't want to get better is that depression is my personality.,"Depression gives me an identity. If people think I'm depressed/mentally ill it distracts from everything else. If I want to die, it's because of serotonin/chemical imbalance. I don't need to reveal my insecurities, that I hate my looks, my thoughts and feelings, that I reject my sexual orientation and gender identity issues, that I hate being a degenerate. It makes me dizzy and nauseous just to think about it. So I'm just depressed and every of my actions is explained by depression. It's easier to live like this and ignore everything else."
1737,How do you cope with not knowing why a bad thing happened to you?,"Long story short, my first teaching experience was awful. After three weeks (and losing 20 pounds), I had a panic attack and quit.

It's been three years. I had to move back in with my parents after the event. I've picked a new career, am earning certification in it, and applying for jobs in that field. I'm on antidepressants and in therapy. All good things, yes, but I feel like a recent college grad trying to figure out my way in life when I'm nearly 10 years out of college and can't even support myself.

I can't figure out why this happened. I thought I could use it as a way to help other teachers going through similar things by blogging about my experience, but nothing really came of that.  I still live at home. I still cry about it all the time. I just can't figure out what good could come out of this. I can't figure out who was at fault (the other teachers? the admin? me? some combination?) — or why I care so much about the answer to that question.

How do you cope with not knowing why a bad thing happened to you?"

1742,Is it normal to feel a little off while switching antidepressants?,"I recently switched off of Lexapro to Prozac because Lexapro was just making me feel much worse. I felt completely numb and had no energy. 

Anyways, I’ve actually been feeling kind of good, but there are times where I also feel a bit off. I switched about a week ago I think. 

I’ll get a little dizzy every so often, and I’ll get this weird feeling at night that I used to get before.

1743,Poem on mental health,"#poetry #poetrycommunity #mentalhealthawareness #expressyourself
https://www.instagram.com/p/CEJJu7rnEoO/?igshid=1ktnw3ftgx5mq"
1744,Sharing. A lot,"Hello

At this point I don't even know if any of this would be understandable. I was trying to talk with my sister, but I ended up just sending her voice messages becouse she wasn't avilable, and I realised how chaotic rambling they are. Im gonna try my best here, but please, feel free to ask any further questions.

So, for start.

I joined this community after an incident that happened on this week Wednesday. I was at my work (I work at fast food) and we havent had mych to do. And out of sudden, I felt a huge drop in terms of attitude. In a snap I became very angry and sad at the same time, without any reason, just like that. I started counting seconds, and every second and minute of my shift just prolonged into the abyss. When it finally ended, and I get home, I almost immediatly fall into the bed and proceed to sleep for 14 hours. And I wasn't even tired, I just slept out of spite.

Thursday was a little better, and at the end of the day, I came back to my ""normal"" state. When im writing this, im in a fairly good mood. 

But what happened scared me ,becouse it was the first time since 2016 when I was close to having suicidal thoughts. 

In 2016 I've had a suicide attempt. Failed, ofc, becouse in a sudden burst of rational thinking I called emergency number, and was taken into a hospital. Since that, I'm always having a voice that keep me away from that space. Like, until the Wednesday incident, I always was able to stop my thoughts, no matter how bad they are, into thinking that suicide might be a good option. 

I've had, in my past years, fairly large numbers of these ""drops"" of attitude, but they never were so severe. I could wake up and even get some things done, but then I just, out of sudden, feel like shit, and I just put my pajama sweater on and browse Internet midlessly. 

I don't know what might be my mental health problem, or is it even mental health problem. 

I think I might be suffering from depression and anxiety, I've had a few panic attacks also, but the thing with these things are that they never were properly diagnosed by a licenced specialist, so it's just my own self-diagnose after reading a bunch of on-subject books.

It's not like I did not tried to reach out for help.

* I contacted several psychologists that offer are covered by my insurance, but none of them were avilable, and Im not having enough money to have an apointment with a private one. 
* Im about to ask my primary care doctor for a refferal to a psychiatrist, but I don't know if it's a good idea. By that I mean I don't even know if psychiatrist would tell me what's wrong with me.
* im also a part of LGBTQIA+ community, and there is a smear campaign ongoing in my country against the community. Society is very anti - LGBTQIA+ people, and Im also scared that psychologist that will finally get to me might be that kind of people. I guess I just don't want to worse my mind on this space now.

Im a student on a last year of my first degree, and I was planning to do a Master's degree in my country too, but the situation is getting worse and worse, and I suspect this might be becouse of situation in my country.

At this point I would accept any advice."
1745,Unsure,I don’t know how to feel anymore or what to do. Feels like I need to be medicated just to keep myself under control.

I just feel so incompetent since most of my orgmates are so effective in their work and capable of making good projects; whereas I can barely answer any questions right when my projects are evaluated by the organization heads. I have also been feeling like I am walking on eggshells, perhaps it is my anxiety or I am just overthinking scenarios, but who knows. 

So I just want some advice for me to cope with this feeling of anxiety and incompetence. Any replies will be highly appreciated, so thank you very much in advance."

1754,I have a depressed friend who has a crush on me.,"Quarantine has been taking a toll on this one male friend that i have. We met this year through an extracurricular, i was never particularly close with him before quarantine but we got to know eachother through online games and he began feeling comfortable coming to me with him problems. He’s told me that he’s been feeling distanced from our group and that he feels alone and isolated, that he doesn’t feel comfortable talking to anyone but me. He’s a really kind person, he’s always looking out for other people but he has a lot of social anxiety and has never had any close friends before so he doesn’t really know how to open with to people. Lately he’s been declining and i’m really struggling on how to help him without leading him on. He’s dropped several hints that he has feelings for me, but I can’t reciprocate his feelings and I don’t feel ready for a relationship. I’ve told him that I’ll always be there for him if he needed someone to talk to, but i dont want anything i say to be taken the wrong way. He’s expressed that he wants to spend more alone time with me and i dont know how to say that I’m not interested. He’s a great friend and i care about him, i want to be able to help him with his mental health since he feels comfortable talking to me, but I always feel like i’m leading him on every time i tell him that he’s important or that i’m there for him if he needs it. I really don’t want to tell him that i know he likes me and that i’m not interested cause i want him to be able tell me when he’s ‘ready for me to know’, but i’m also really scared of what rejecting him might do for his mental health. I’ve been dropping subtle hints by saying I’ll always be there as a friend and remarking on how complicated and convoluted relationships are and how I couldn’t see myself being in one, but i dont think he’s really picked up. He asks for hugs and has expressed hanging out one on one, and i just don’t know what to say. What should i do?"
1755,"My family's having me come over, but I'm afraid to tell them how I really feel. What should I do?","My family lives too far away to visit often, so when I do see them, it's in the form of a weekend-long stay at their farm house. Lately, my mental health has been an at all-time low, so spending time with my family would seem like a good thing.

The problem is I've reached a point in my depression where I don't see a future for myself anymore. I want so badly to leave this world, but am too weak to actually do the deed. It feels like every force in the universe, from my own cowardice to my empathy for my loved ones, is keeping me in an existence I want to be in. Now, my family is not the source of my depression. They've always been very loving and supportive, and will want to do fun, positive, and constructive things with me, like watch movies or go for a walk in the farmers market. That's all well and good, but it doesn't do anything to change how I feel. Once the fun is over, I'm still in the same situation I was in before. No passion for the things I used to enjoy; never seeing my friends anymore; no fun events or places to go to in my home town (they're all closed/cancelled; and just the world overall going to complete shit, COVID-related or otherwise. I'm still going to be wishing I wasn't so afraid of death. I wish I was desensitized about what happens to your body when you die so I wouldn't be too grossed out to actually go through with it.

My biggest fear is that if I tell my parents about this, they're going to think I'm a danger to myself, and insist that I go to a psych ward, which is the LAST thing on my mind. I've already been 3x this past year, and all it's gotten me is more medical bills I can't pay off. I also just hate the environment, being cooped up with people more unstable than me, and forced to sit through the same tired talking points in group therapy that feel good at the moment, but don't actually change anything. I've also had doctors who were on major power trips, treating patients like inferiors, and I do NOT want to be under the mercy of a complete douchebag again. I know I probably NEED my family right now more than ever, but I can't see it going any other way than tons of drama and emotional meltdowns because I hate my life and being forced to be in it.

What should I do? My mom's coming by to pick me up this afternoon, and it'll be a 4 1/2 hour drive to their place, so it's not like I can leave whenever I want to. I am going to take a train on Monday evening back home.

Note: I've tried asking on r/depression_help , but there's hardly ever any activity there, so I thought I could get more answers here."
1756,Does anybody have any good sources for fighting depression?,Either decent books or websites?
1757,I have a serious problem by being obsessed with a girl...,"I tried asking her out and it didn’t happen. Yes, I know now it’s not the brightest move to continue talking to her afterwards; but the truth is that I still really love her. I’m afraid of myself. Sometimes I fantasize about working out so much and training in MMA or something to just be a juggernaut of a man so I could track her down an kidnap her, and no one will be able to get in my way. I got that idea after I found out Evel Knievel kidnapped his wife 2 or 3 times before she finally returned his feelings. 

The thing is, I’m not really so stupid to lack self awareness. I don’t see her as the Madonna type, pretty sure she’s fucking a bunch of dudes, I know I might be falling far an ideal version of her; but these feelings are very real nevertheless. My game plan now is to work on myself to the best of my ability so I could have it all together. Once I have a good career, dream bod, more cultured, more educated, better social skills/network, and skilled at hobbies (guitar/skating); I think I’ll try to call her and see if she wants to have a date then. It’s just hard to live like this knowing I’m so young (21) and have such stupid goals like this that will most likely fail. I’ve even thought of just never dating anyone ever at all if I can’t get her just in spite of the world... 

So, all you pseudo intellectuals try to figure me out. What’s your unprofessional diagnosis for a mental illness I could have? What should I do to just be normal?"

1759,I feel like I’m living in a horror movie sometimes,"I try not to vent or ramble with these things but I might end up going off; I’ll be talking about some fear that is taking over parts of my life, I’m not sure what to do about it.

When I was about 10 or 11, I had a terrible nightmare involving the painting that hung up on the wall by my bed. I woke up and saw it there, and was terrified ever since. For a couple weeks I didn’t sleep in my room, and would run in to get clothes and run out without making eye contact with it. I didn’t feel comfortable telling my parents why I was acting that way since they are not accommodating with mental health things, or just with understanding more obscure thoughts, I guess. But I did have to tell them and they moved the painting away to my dad’s closet.

Sometimes though, people without telling me, would move the painting. Every time I would come into contact with it, I’d become paralyzed, sometimes by minutes at a time, just staring into its eyes and entrapped by fear. Nowadays, my heart just beats out of my chest and I bolt out of the room, usually finding myself at the other end of the house in such a quick manner that I’m wondering, “how did I get here in a blink like that?” The time between places is a blur, and I need time to calm my heart down and catch my breath. Sitting for a while.

This summer I stayed in my old childhood bedroom, and there’s a different, very nice painting over my bed. But sometimes in the dark, I would see just the frame of the picture, and would flinch so violently to turn and see, for it to only be this other harmless painting. And more often I will see just a picture frame and turn so violently to face it, this weird unsettling instinct that puts me on edge. And it overall makes me upset that my mood gets ruined by something that’s not there.

It doesn’t help that over the years, people have played on my fears by “pranking” me. No one takes my fear seriously. They would sometimes set it somewhere to scare me, or even make it where I can see the painting when I look in the reflection of a mirror. I did have the misfortune of having to see the painting three times this summer, and now, my brain has got me started back to the nightmares after all these years.

I’ve had two nightmares about the painting, after all these years since the first one. I just feel so haunted by it that even thinking about what it looks like makes my heart go up. I don’t know what to do about it. Every horror story says basically that if I burn the painting, the spirits of it will haunt me or eat someone’s baby or something. Maybe we could give it to someone else but why would I wish this same fate on them? The entire scenario has me feeling paranoid, and like this article title says, as if I’m in a horror movie. I’ve always been bad with paranoia and dark movement in my periphery, but this particular thing takes it to a new level with my fear and anxiety. It’s the embodiment of all of it.

I can provide more info if anyone needs that to help me out... but, can anybody help me out? Or give me some advice?

I’m no longer at that house, the painting is in another state but still I’m stuck fearing it."
1760,Tragedies don’t affect me. Loss of life to others really has no bearing on my emotions that day. Is this a condition or do others feel this way also?,"Hey, 

I have tried googling this but I just can’t seem to find the right information or details that accurately describe how it feels.

I’m not a psychopath (I hope not). I do feel emotions, I do get happy, sad, angry. I have a beautiful daughter that makes me so happy, I’m separated from her mother and I get extremely frustrated when I don’t get to talk to her for a few days. I have another daughter due in 4wks with my new partner and I’m so excited for that also.

There has recently been a tragedy in my area. I coach a little girl that unfortunately passed away along with her brother and father. Her mother that helps out with the team survived. My daughter and my partners daughter have been friends with this girl since pre school, about 4/5 years now. I heard the new this morning. I don’t seem to be affected by it, I feel sad because others are sad. Not necessarily because i am upset.

It made he think about other instances when other people passed away that I knew and how I felt. I can’t remember a time I was genuinely upset like others seem to be, I’m not sure if people put on an act as they feel they should be showing these emotions to others or they actually are affected by it.

Unless it directly effects me it doesn’t seem to change my mood in any way. It seems very selfish/ self centred. Is this a condition or is it common? I have probably done a terrible job of describing this."
1761,Downhill,"Everything was up for a while, and then I made my last post. After doing that things have steadily gone downhill. My friend groups have been dissolving and leaving me behind, my home life has gotten much worse, and I feel excruciatingly lonely. I’ve tried making new friends but I always feel overly needy or annoying. 

My father has tried to do some things to to be nice or show he cares on occasions, but he immediately goes back into his previous ways of being mentally abusive. It hurts me that I can’t even accept my father’s affection anymore like I could when I was younger.

Just when things were looking up, life decided to sucker punch me. I wish I could go on with life without depression gnawing at the back of my mind. Thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to read this."
1762,Feeling a bit more stable right now,"I'm still fighting the urge to start a fire in an abandoned house down the street from me and I'm fighting the urge to run into that burning house and take myself out in the most ironic way possible.

But...

Today we went downtown to conduct some business (the place was closed...freaking COVID) and a young lady, 18 years old, and newly pregnant (she had papers from the local hospital so I believed her and nothing about her came off as shady) came up to me and asked to use my cellphone. She even sat down right next to me (that showed me I could trust her) and made some calls. A police lady showed up (yep...had positive police contact) and told her where to go. Then my hubby, who was standing away from us this whole time, looking like he didn't want to be involved, actually volunteered to take this young lady to this place (it is a shelter and helps with food and stuff) which was literally a few blocks away. I never loved my hubby like I did right then. He really knocked it out of the park and made me proud! We dropped the young lady off at this Center and since I had just gotten money out of our bank, I gave her $10 towards something to eat. I was glad to give her that. It didn't make much of a dent in what I had on me and it was the least I could do to help her at least in that moment to get something in her bc she was also eating for 2. She was telling us that she is keeping the baby and looks forward to taking care of it. I know this Center can get her back on her feet and get her a job and someplace to live, so I have great hopes that she and her baby will be ok.

Anyhow...I am not posting to brag that I did something nice today...

I truly felt like I was this girl's angel... I was put in that spot at that moment for her to find me. :) It feels really really good to have helped not one, but TWO people! Well...a person and a person to be. She is only about 5 or 6 weeks pregnant. 

I feel like I matter a little more. This actually happened yesterday, but I've been up since about midnight (it is just after 6 am now) so my days are all jumbled up.

I knew yesterday was going to be a strange-ass day lol. I think I even saw a TikTok where the person said something significant would happen...

😳😳 Hmmm.

That's all for me. I will be going to sleep soon (around noon) and sleep to just before midnight, when I will get up and do it all again."
1763,I need help but the school I go to is closed right now,"I need help. I know it, but I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have friends, I don't have a girlfriend and my parents just got divorced and live 10 hours away. I don't know what to do I'm going crazy the only thing I liked doing is gone they closed the gym at my school and now I just sit around the house and work up the courage to end it. I hate waking up everyday so I can see my roommate with his girlfriend laughing and having fun. They felt bad for me and tried to make me a tinder but they got 0 matches so that was fun. I just don't really see how this could ever get any better. Everything sucks but not just right now, I've felt this way for years im just at rock bottom now I haven't slept in days im losing my mind."

I'm getting so stressed out thinking of attending classes. The same feeling you get when you're on top of a cliff and someone asks you to jump. 
I've always been an introvert and I was happy at first that I didn't have to go to college. Home was my happy place. But now since college is AT home, it's like I've lost my only safe place. 
I've been crying myself to sleep. I don't wanna do anything anymore. 
Just one week has passed until now. I'll probably have classes like this for 3-4 months. I have no idea what I'm gonna do."
1765,My mom is delusional(?),"Ever since I was young, my mom will tell me to pour the water she prepared onto myself after I finish bathing. She made my sister and I wear necklace because it would protect us. If we don't she would try and manipulate/ guilt trip us into doing it. She is not well educated and only finished her high school and went to work after that.

At first, I thought she was just religious but later I found out that she made us do that because she believed that my father was doing 'black magic' that would benefit him (or something like that) which will then 'cause harm to her and my sister and I' She also believed that my father is also 'causing her to be unable to make money and thus unable to move out' and used to believe (and probably still does) that he has a mistress outside. She also thinks that he used the 'black magic' to make her love him?? She showed me evidence that my father is doing the 'black magic' which most people can probably dismiss it as just a normal thing. (Eg salt in the bathroom cupboard which was put by me, unknown dark stain on her bed sheet) After she found out I was the one who put the salt in the bathroom she still believes my dad is a bad guy. There's alot more stuff she believes but too much to write down.

Then I also found out that she has a friend who used to work with her and currently living in another country. The friend, I'll name her friend A, also believes in whatever my mom believes. Friend A (probably) recommended her to someone who can 'remove the black magic' every month and she pays the person quite alot. I do not know how much but it is more than 100 dollars. She will ask me/sister and try to get me/sister to lend her money cause she doesn't earn enough so she could pay the person to get rid of it. Every. Month. She does repay me but still owe my sister sometimes so my sister now refuses to lend her money.

At this point I don't know what to do anymore. I asked her questions about the delusion but the stuff she says kind of goes in a circle or she just says 'its not good to say it out'. Its been happening my entire life. She still does get us to pour water or some shit and I still do it because if not she will scold which will trigger my anxiety. My sister will refuse her. She also visits a psychologist but I'm not sure what it is for."
1766,Will Anyone Give Me Advice? And Education About Dissociation.,"\[TW: Mention of car accidents\]

Hello all. I'm fairly new to reddit.

I'd like to seek assistance where I can actually get it...I can't go to therapy or a psychologist because of my parents and my finances. They think every thing except depression and PTSD is pretty much bullshit. I thought it'd be best for me in the ""now"" rather than the future to ask. I feel as though I'd regret it if I didn't inquire on my own path.

Anyways, a little background: I've dealt with—most prominently—depression, anger issues, and anxiety. More recently, since March, I've dealt with what I believe is PTSD. I was in what could have been a life-threatening (I guess all car accidents are life-threatening) accident, and got lucky by just the turn of a wheel and a hit to the small embankment of a country road with my older sister (I was the passenger..). Thankfully, nobody was hurt; just a concussion on my end and minor seat belt burn on her end. I don't believe in God, but I think it was a sign to give myself a chance. Though, most days I wish I wasn't given this second chance, if you'd call it that. It sounds selfish.

Not even 2 days after, the first love of my life (as a teenager, it sounds cringe but that's how I feel about him) left for the army without telling me. No closure or anything, and we weren't official. I can't help but feel stupid to think this, but I do think he did want to be with me. It was just wrong timing because he was graduating; especially with COVID-19 just flaring up everywhere. After he left in March, I didn't want to get out of bed. I didn't want to eat. I wanted to sleep all day yet not sleep at all. I still miss him, and I'm still not over him even after a little over 5 months.

After my car accident, I immediately got nightmares, and it felt like I was in shock for almost 3 months. I don't think that adding a fear of selfless selfishness and abandonment helped either in the beginning.

Every time I'm in a car, I become uneasy no matter what speed we're driving at. I have to either shut my eyes the entire time or keep them wide open, unable to decide which one helps me better because I remember barely blinking during the accident.

I still get nightmares. I don't know how to move on.

I honestly feel as though I'm absolutely nuts. My brain practically tortures me with nightmares that picture the car accident far, far worse than it was, and tricks me into believing it was that bad. It often seems like that happens often with other things, too. Smaller, minuscule scenarios though.

To move on, I'd like to close this with the topic of dissociation.

Ever since my car accident, I feel like I've been way too out of contact with everything. Physical objects, anything. I've no idea if this is an actual dissociative disorder, so that's why I thought to ask here. I've done a bit of research, but even though I can relate to what research articles explain, I can't seem to grasp the concept.

All I want to do half the time is feel something. Like, jump in and out of train tracks while a train is coming just to feel something type of thing. (I will NOT be doing that, I'm over being suicidal because I think of my family and how much they care. It's just a feeling. I want to feel something because I often am numbed out for what seems like no reason, yet all the reasons at once. 

I generally do not act on feeling anyways. I'm sorry, just a little PSA.)

I absolutely hate self-diagnosing, and that's not what I'm here to do. When I graduate, I plan on going to see a psychologist and doing therapy if I can't move past this. However, I do like being aware, and that's what I feel I haven't been at all lately. I feel like objects I touch, I'm not really touching. For example: Someone's hand, a spoon, food in my mouth, the stairs.

Another thing is that I feel like my body isn't mine. I zone out, and tune everyone and everything out too. Sometimes I get way too over-stimulated by noise; whether it's someone talking to me normally, or many noises all at once, I shut my eyes and cover my eardrums with my fingers like a child, and tune out.

Those aren't very extreme phenomenon for me lately. Everything I listed happened way more often, way more extremely until July. The ""sensory-overload""-esque situation with noise has been a new thing, though. It could be because of stress lately and family issues, but it's a problem for me nonetheless.

There's so much more I could tell, but this is already long enough and fits most of my thoughts in. I hope someone out there is reading and listening. I would appreciate any advice on how to even deal with all of this. I would also like to know if what I said does seem like dissociation; I heard it's common when dealing with PTSD. I just need some pointers, advice, et cetera.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for letting me vent and post this. I'm glad mental health communities exist."
1767,COVID is taking its tole,"I received a letter and have been shielding since March. Things are opening up but I still have not even gone to a shop. People around are inconsiderate, they don’t distance properly and they literally just don’t give a shit even if I’ve obviously waited to the side trying to get out the way. When I ask people to maintain a distance some people kick off it’s actually fucking mad. Everyone in my area is scummy and there’s loads of crazy people. It’s so densely populated even getting out my car is a hassle.

I’m starting to get dreams about going to places, a restaurant or something, and people being too close and not being able to put a mask on. 

I’m not scared of going outside, I’m scared because I know other people don’t give a fuck and I can’t control their movements. 

Im feeling like I’m never going to escape my prison of a flat"
1768,okay i don't know what is happening tome anymore,"I(18m) posted a few days ago about having really violent intrusive thoughts, even tho I myself am not a violent person. The thing is it keeps going and I can't stand it in my head brutal images about hurting myself or others just pop up, like if I see a knife for examplo my head imagines all kinds of thing to do with it. I'm starting to feel anxious all the time and my axiety meds aren't working anymore and I'm having a really hard time sleeping becuse anxiety+these thoughs and I'm tired, idk what's happening anymore but I'm afraid to tell my dad because he might think I'm crazy or he'll worry too much and I don't want to be a burden to him. I was doing so good since last year with my mental health but now I'm starting to do downhill again I feel like shit."
1769,My mom is always sad and exhausted and I'm pretty sure it's depression. She won't acknowledge it though and won't accept support. What can I do to help her?,"I haven't seen my mom truly happy or fulfilled in maybe 10 years. She is always exhausted and sad and can't sleep well. She isolates at home and is stressed by her job she doesn't like. She doesn't have friends or any social circle outside our immediate family.  She used to travel and go out but now that time is long over; it seems like she was a different person back then. 

I care for her so much. I want her to be happy. She is such a unique and amazing person but she doesn't seem to see it. She puts herself down a lot. And she won't acknowledge that this is a real issue, one that something could be done about (eg therapy..that's not at all an option for her). I really don't know what to do about it. 

Whenever I ask her something about herself or if there is anything I can do for her, she gets taciturn and changes the subject quickly. I can't get through to her on this.  I have suggested going on vacation with her or going on a day trip somewhere, I've invited her to come visit me, but she always rejects.

The thing is, she's is very 'well functioning', she does her job, she takes care of the household, she doesn't neglect anything or anyone. And because it has been going on for so long, it's kind of become ""normal"" she is this way. Her sadness  gradually ""sneaked"" its way into her life and now ""that's just the way she is"". And also because she doesn't really acknowledge it as a problem and doesn't want help, it feels like our family has just accepted it.  My mom never wants to be the center of attention, she doensn't like talking about herself, her life and she doesn't want people worrying about her, so she usually waives any concerns.

Of course I can't diagnose my mom -- but no matter if it's depression or not, she is not enjoying life and is not happy. 

I hope that she will feel better when she retires, but she has to work at least 3 more years to work and changing her job is not really an option for her, because she would basically lose her pension and assurance. Plus she doesn't really have the strength to look and apply for new jobs. 

I'm posting here because I'd really like to hear from people who have suffered / suffer from depression, what are things people around you can do to support you, what can they say? How did you realize and accept your depression?

Or has someone been in a similar situation as me and what did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be deeply appreciated!"
1770,"Why isn't bias, discrimination, sexism a mental disorder?","But those suffering from being discriminated against are labeled with a mental disorder?

Many women face physician bias in medical care ('it's all in your head'). But when the woman is faced with disability after being misdiagnosed, they are labeled with a memtal disorder, even 'psychosomatic '.

It seems like in these cases, the physician with the bias is the one who has the mental disorder. Why not treat the physician instead of all the physicians victims? If the physician is cured, there will be no more victims."
1771,I like being sad and depressed and a mess and I don’t know why. Is this normal?,I’ve been depressed on and off for a good two years now. although I’m sick and tired of it and can’t seem to pull myself out of it I don’t want to. I guess In a way it has become part of me and a part of my personality even though depression and mental illness is not a personality. At this point it’s not just depression that I like it’s the overall feeling that my life is shit and just in general being a human mess. I don’t know if this is normal and I know I need help but I don’t want it because I like being in this dark place but don’t at the same time and I know it’s not good for me. I’m just confused about what I want and what to do. Sometimes I wonder if I’m depressed at all because I’ve been depressed for so long now that I think this feeling is just normal. What if I never come out of this giant depressive episode? What if this is just I how feel from now on? Is this normal and does anyone else struggle with the same thing?
1772,"I always find myself tempted to feel sorry for myself and get upset, how do you cope with this?","Often, especially when alone, I always wanted to think that I'm pitiful even though I am really not. I once saw a recommendation of a book but I cannot commit to reading it."
1773,Am I a horrible person or is this linked to something,"I am extremely irritable and agitated, even more so than usual, which means I get annoyed by the smallest things which makes me feel horrible. For example:

My Nana tends to smack her lips a lot but not like usual like it always sounds so moist and it really gets to me. I can hardly stay in the same room as her when obviously I should because shes my Nana.

Also, my Mum tends to breathe really heavy and this really annoys me but I know she has asthma and that's why. I tell myself that all the time ' you can't be mad or annoyed with her she can't help it' but that just makes me feel even worse.

Am I a horrible person? Id really appreciate your advice on how to better myself with this or your help to figure out what's going on. Thank you"

1775,No Student should be left behind,"This is the reality right now here in my country. Most of us students don't know what to do anymore sometimes. Not everyone can afford wifi. Not everyone owns a laptop. Not everyone will be accepted in a job. This is just heartbreaking.

Trigger Warning: Suicide

A 21-year old male student residing in Sitio San Antonio, Barangay Fidel Surtida, Santo Domingo, Albay, has died of suicide. In an exclusive interview, the mother had to tell her son to temporarily stop schooling this year due to poverty and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. She was still in shock as to what happened and she can only refer to the stress her son felt of not being able to enroll this academic year. The victim's parents only earn a meager income as a ""para-graba"". Currently, they are asking for financial help for the burial of their son.

However, this is not the first education-related case of suicide in Albay. Last June 16, a 19-year old Grade 8 student residing in Sto. Domingo, Albay also died of suicide. The victim was worried about the high cost of pursuing his education through online classes, particularly buying load and internet charges.

1776,What happened to me in college? The physical weight on my back.,"Back in college between my Freshman and Junior year, 2013-2015, I didn't realize it at the time but my mental health was a mess. At the time, I was 5'3 and about 115lb. I went cold turkey off my Celexa as I didn't think I needed it anymore, I would only be able to sleep \~4 hours a night and feel completely awake the next day, I was binge eating when I got home from school and I would hide my eating from everyone (I got to a max weight of about 125lb), and I was a very irritable person and would snap at just about anyone. As unpleasant as all of that was, and although I can't fully explain why I did all of that back in the day, the weirdest thing I would experience back during this time was the feeling of this crushing weight on me where I could barely walk as I was walking through campus. Let me describe this in more detail:

I was a small girl, sure, but I would be carrying my backpack with hardly anything in it, maybe a laptop and a book, and I felt like my legs were going to collapse under me. I could feel myself walking so slow and I could feel my knees giving in. I would panic and look for the nearest bench to sit down on. It concerned me a lot at the time and I would even had bad dreams about it. I would have dreams that I would be walking through campus and I would just fall over and by unable to pick myself back up.  

I have never experienced anything like this outside of college. My mental health is a lot better now and I am back to taking my Celexa. I don't binge eat anymore and I sleep just fine at night. It just bothers me to this day that I could never figure out what my problem was. 

Could anyone be able to identify what happened to me back then that would nearly cause me to physically collapse with hardly any physical weight on my back? I'm almost certain it was tied to my mental health. Thank you!!"
1777,How can I be happy,"I feel like just going out in the middle of the night for a long walk. Where i am we have a curfew from 8pm-5am because of COVID but i don't really care. I don't get into calls with friends because i'm scared and it only makes it worse. I'm 18 in a couple months and i'm worried then i'll just drink to feel better, even though i tell myself i shouldn't.

I just want something to distract myself enough so i feel happy and like i have a purpose."
1778,Mental hospital? I’m terrified,"I think I need immediate assistance, and the best way to get that would be to go to a mental hospital. Problem is, I’m terrified. I’ve been four times, two of those experiences were awful and almost traumatizing, and I’ve never been as an adult. Which also scares me. Can anyone reassure me? I don’t want to go but I’m very unstable and there’s not a day where I’m not close to downing all my pills and killing myself. 

I have a therapist I see once a month (as if that does anything) and a psychiatrist. But I tried to get in contact with my psychiatrist to tell her I need different meds because mine are causing problems, but she doesn’t ever get back to me unless it’s our appointment date. That’s aggravating. And I’ve tried getting more then once a month therapy but they keep sending me in a circle of “call here” “go there.” And I’m getting nowhere. It’s so frustrating. No one seems to be taking me seriously. I’m so close to offing myself, I’m in mental turmoil almost everyday. I just want to be better. That’s all I want. I want to smile and laugh and have it be genuine. I’m at a loss"
1779,"I'm still functional, but I can feel my health declining (Possible TW)","It has been two years since I moved out of my family's home for college, and since then I made numerous posts about various issues I've been having.

Since I moved out I've had two suicide attempts (first one ever a little over a year ago). I've been having trouble taking care of myself, doing college work, and maintaining any kind of positive relationships.  
The past couple of months I feel like I've been even worse off. Even though I moved to a new apartment, got a new job, and got a loving boyfriend, I haven't been getting any better. I've been having stress induced migraines and vertigos, I've relapsed big time and harmed myself, I've had spurs of rage in which I uncontrollably broke my belongings. At work I'm jumpy, constantly expect someone is going to hurt me if I mess up or yell at me.  
Some weeks ago I had a blackout moment during which I guess I tried to hurt myself, and had my bf stop me. Yesterday I was beyond convinced I was going to get fired for no reason now when I think back to it.  
Food has also been an issue, and I've been having breakdowns for being hungry, beating my stomach for it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a lot. There's so much in my head, and I'm tired. I'm still managing to get through my days, but I feel like I'm dragging my own corpse. The blackout and paranoid spell are getting to me."

1783,A vent I suppose,"Not sure what prompted me to do this but here goes, also I almost never use reddit so forgive me if i put it in the wrong place or screwed up somewhere.

I have written down some issues that i believe that I may have and a more in depth discussion as to what i mean by them. It's been a work in progress for years trying to even get any amount of these into a somewhat coherent thought and felt like i wanted to share this with someone. I don't know who i can share this with irl without people getting overly concerned etc and these aren't the full list of issues, these are more along the lines of an incomplete list of crap I've had to deal with for as long as I can remember (which i suppose may not be saying much since one of them is memory). I don't expect anyone to bother reading all of this and I'll be fine with someone deleting it but i thought I might as well make an effort to get it off my chest. Sorry for that long intro, here's the list:

Anxiety/OCD?:

As a Child I had a large amount of anxiety for little reason. everything felt like it was too much. I started developing ""ticks"" or odd behaviour. The biggest example I can think of was if something happened on one side of my body like my right hand, I had to do the same to the other. It got worse over time to where I would have to do the same thing but in reverse - what I mean if i bumped my left hand id have to bump my right hand, then I would bump my right hand then left again. Odd little things like that. I don't remember if it was suggested to me or if i did it on my own but I would have to write every thought down basically and feel anxious over basically nothing. I more or less ""grew out of it"" and no longer have odd behaviours like that and I am nowhere near as anxious however more or less over the past couple years i've been anxious about things more

Borderline personality disorder:

Besides this running in my family (both my father and older sister), I feel like I have very drastic and quick mood changes fairly often. Like for about 5 minutes I'll forget something is awful but then go back to that. I feel like occasionally on different days I'll have very different opinions on things regarding myself. For example, I've noticed I can be very gullible sometimes but also a very harsh skeptic soon after. I don't entirely know how to describe this and I don't really have examples that I can think of but I notice when it happens sometimes and more so after the fact. 

What I call unintentional perfectionism:

Ever since I met a person called ROWAN (person from mums highschool who turned into a psych or councillor or something, Not entirely sure anymore) I think I've started to realise something. He once told me he thinks that I am a perfectionist. I have an insanely high standard for nearly everything and I give up easily because nothing comes close to how I have things pictured in my mind and I'm starting to think he is right. I abandon card games quicker and quicker as I find that my hand is complete garbage or I get annoyed at my pc or internet because it isn't absolutely perfect and lags the tiniest amount or doesn't do something exactly right. I can't think of many examples of this but there are far more making me think he might be right.

ADHD/ADD:

I find things very difficult to focus on. I'll have a train of thought during a train of thought and confuse myself. I'll be having a conversation and have a thought and I'll be able to react to the conversation but don't know/remember what they said. I have trouble focusing on what people are saying more often than I feel like is normal. I'll jump between activities like I'll pause a video half way through because I thought of a song I needed to hear even though I really prefer finishing things off

Forgetfulness:

Think this one is a mixture of things causing it but I've been forgetful my entire life so it isn't entirely just things that I'm doing now like depression or not having proper sleep. I'll be halfway through a thought and instantly forget what I was saying. I forget really important things really quickly and don't feel like I know what I'm doing at all. It honestly feels like my entire life is little more than a blur. I swear I'll have dementia by 40 (23 now). It's hard giving your own life value if you don't even remember it.

Mental blocks:

Sometimes I just simply feel like I cannot function when things are overwhelming at all. Stress causes me to just sorta shut down and process things I don't even feel like I have thoughts properly when I'm like this sometimes. I just don't seem to be able to handle things I find difficult or I don't learn etc when I have basically any amount of stress. This seems to be the case mostly for important things but even affects stuff that I WANT to do. (as I'm writing this something doesn't feel right I don't think I'm properly explaining it or I might be exaggerating it but I don't want to delete this and try again just in case) 

Terrible thoughts:

My brain thinks of random horrible situations and my brain acts out what I think would happen. I even say the things I'm thinking I would say outloud. It could be anything from hitting someone to a relative or ghost (my cat) dying to all sorts of things

Wanting punishment:

I am not 100% sure but I feel like part of me wants to suffer. I can't tell if it's just a masochism thing, I feel like I deserve bad things or if I suffer people will feel sorry for me and I won't need to do anything. I genuinely am not sure what this feeling is but there is something there that wants me to suffer and I don't entirely know why, regardless of the reason I hate it.

Selfishness?:

Normally I would consider myself a fairly generous person but I've noticed that when given the chance, I can be extremely selfish and wanting. I was extremely selfish at around 14 with my father because he often let me get what I wanted however I wasn't anywhere near as bad with mum because she wouldn't let me do shit I shouldn't have. I seem to get selfish when someone gives me something. I often refuse etc and some of it is because of how I noticed I can get selfish but sometimes I just want to take whatever. 

Apathy/Sadism:

Sometimes I feel like I want people to suffer even though I feel often fairly empathetic. I can be very apathetic and sometimes it can be frequently. I have dark thoughts reasonably often as stated before and I feel like it's more than the ""usual amount"" as I've been told its very common to have violent thoughts etc but this feels different. Again possibly related to bpd but I feel like I change as a person at least some amount when like this.

Very quickly, if it turns out that I am wrong about having BPD and ADHD/ADD, I do not mean to offend anyone that has those conditions. This is simply a guess based on a lot of thought on the issue and not a professional opinion so I am very well aware that I am quite probably wrong."
1784,"Porn, Instagram, etc..","Hi, I feel down when watching gay porn or watching attractive guys on social media. I'm a 32 year old male, I feel like I'm not in that game, I feel ugly ( though a lot of people tell me I'm handsome). But, most of the time I don't feel like that. And when it comes to relationships I think I will never be in one. I haven't and I will never be in one. It's like, everybody are in a race of ego in social media and even porn. ""How desirable I am?"" I ridiculously try to be in that thing, but I don't have the body, not the skinny one or bear type one. My belly and my pecs are ugly, my nipples are too big I think. Plus there are things I can control less and less in my life, like food, habits, and the clarity in my mind to choose what's best for my life. And this virtual world is pushing me even deeper"
1785,Am I right to hold a grudge against my mother and how to let it go?,"I am a full grown, relatively younger male. I am 33. I have a decent relationship with my mother. However, I maintain it by holding my grudge against her quietly. Hear me out. When I was a child I was emotional kid. Was by far the best student of my generation, best in school. I was always honest child also. I had great deal of empathy for others. I even helped my bullies pass some subjects. I didnt hold grudge against them. So basically I was a good kid. But my mom always criticized me. I was never good. She never even once said anything good about me. I have always felt like she hated me for whatever the reason. When she got angry she used to tell me ""I hope you will never be happy in your life"". She sometimes called me ""a bum"". I was never really a bum. I am not a bum now either, I am a law school graduate, employed. I do have some anger in me, but I control it and I dont hurt other people with my anger. I go for a run, or for a coffee with friends if I feel down. She also always said ""you should be ashamed of yourself"" when I didnt want to listen to her in some things which for me were wrong. With time I lost confidence in myself. I held anger. I did have a great father. He passed away in May 2019. He was my best friend and I have learned great deal from him. We had same values and we were very much alike. He was also not a conformist, like me. If something is wrong, it is wrong, and we would not accept it. My mother, however, is a person who always said ""but what would people say"" in regards to some behavior or action and she will usually choose what general consensus decides, even if wrong. We are very much different. She never could accept me as how I am. I always felt I am not worthy of anything. I started rebuilding my confidence and my own view of myself. I know I am a good person, I am good looking also (dont take it in superficial way because I am not), and I am decently smart. I have to repeat some of these every day because I have always said to myself when younger ""what a moron"". I needed to change my own thoughts that I was taught as a child. She, until this day, will not accept that she did anything wrong. She also respects more our entire family than me. With them she speaks gently, nicely, and with me she can still be very criticizing. She also never appreciate if I do anything good, in terms of work, job, relationships with other people. Or if I have any difficulties. She will always acknowledge difficulties of my similarly aged cousins, and will emphasize how they have some difficulties, even that I have same or worse in life. She never accepts that. I am quiet with her because she is my mother. I am smart enough to understand that she has made mistakes and that I obviously have issues about this. And one more thing, disregard my English, it is not my first language. 

I want to add that my mom did good things too. She was not some monster. She was amalgam of good and a bad mother. I think she struggled with her own upbringing by her own mother who was very strict and conservative, and with that ""what will people say about your behavior"" attitude. 

I have two questions: 1) Am I right that my mother did things wrong (from little details I gave in the post) or am I exaggerating? 2) Whether I am right or not, how to let go the grudge?"

1787,Should i talk to my doctor about seeing things and severe anxiety?,"So. When i was a kid i used to see things all the time. I'd walk into a room and some awful demon looking thing would flash in my head and then disappear. It went away when i got pregnant and now its back again. 

The last few nights I've been interpreting sounds i hear as someone being in my house, i try to do things in my kitchen and pictures of this demon thing with a very large black tongue and long fingers curling its hand around the doorway, its almost as if it flashes in reality and then its gone but still leaves it seared into my brain. I don't ""see"" things as in like, walking talking like a regular object or person, its always just flashes of things and then its gone. But it still scares the absolute shit out of me. I was laying in bed last night and i had to put my head under the covers because i was convinced that that demon thing was right around the hallway and it was going to walk into my view any second. My eye mask was laying beside me on the floor but i was too afraid to stick my hand out of the cover and grab it. 

These ""flashes"" cause me severe distress and anxiety. I don't know what to do anymore. Is this normal or should i bring it up at my next appointment? I also have bipolar disorder which causes anxiety as well so i can't tell for sure if this is a problem or not. Help?"

I feel different. I feel like I’m at war with three versions myself. Like I don’t understand who I’m.

Majority of the time I feel like I’m just blah, and emotionless. if I’m not then I go through stages of rage, anger, and irritability. And then every other month or so I get this random sprout of energy. I can talk to strangers at the store, and down to do whatever.  I can never maintain one version of myself and be content. Like I’m annoyed if I’m happy annoyed if I’m negative. And I don’t know how or what to feel. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m a fuckin mess

I stopped drinking because I felt like I became a completely different person than I want to be. I became angry and irritable, or I found myself becoming slutty at parties and just saying fuck it all. Very negative version, “fun” version. 

I catch myself knowing not to be the person who is so angry all the time. I try to reinsure myself discussing problems, and communication is the best way through any problem, and be positive so all the sad angry negativity doesn’t take over.

Yet once I’m kinda sad? I basically tell positive Polly to go fuck herself, so then I’m at war with myself between negative version and a positive. But then I also have a harsh Realistic version, that I’m like “alright your actually probably on spiral into depression. Be aware. “
I feel like I’m at war with three versions of met self. Is that normal? 😂😬"

I am not very sensitive to these matters, but it was disappointing to hear it coming from her.

This is 5y of my life now, I am losing my life due to this, but I just can’t get over my intruding thoughts, is there anyone who can really give a solid yet quick remedy?","This is going to be long, but for those who read it and answer, thank you from the bottom of my heart, as this is my last resort before i go to a therapist or something like that. The story has a plot twist so it’s kinda a cool read? 

What can I say, I am a man with many friends, adventures, with a stable family, and even have hobbies (gym, beer crafting and drinking, movies, basketball). And I am a complete and utter mess. 

My high school love is just too strong for me to live. I have currently 6 years passing by, without anything funny and new. Before her, my life was completely opposite. I was free, I felt free, and I never had to explain myself for myself. Then there was she, a dream come true to a boy craving for attention. We became best of friends, and she listened to everything i ever told her, my views, ambitions. In a year of our friendship i fell in love, she is year after year more and more perfect literally by world standards, and to be honest, she was the only person that ever gave my life that much attention. Our HS love tho, was bullshit filled with jealousy, fights, emotional abuse, one sided. She didn’t allow me anything, and being a petty man that I’ve become for her, I listened, I stepped over everything I ever believed in and said to myself, fck it, the sex is perfect, and I even believed her when she told me go search for someone, you won’t find anyone better. 

After HS we broke up, and I went on my first holiday, I immediately found some chick that liked me and when we got to bed, I ran away. 

Coming from that holiday i called my now ex, and we started dating in the most toxic way possible. She had a guy friend who was crazy over her, and in her alcohol induced gibberish like always, she made me feel like an ant, by calling him to call her a cab. I kicked her out of my house, and she was begging for my forgiveness by literally crawling to my feet (I can’t believe what I’m writing). I said okay, I take your drunk shit to your home, and go to my home, and that’s it for us. In the cab she starts the sexual things, and now my dick is in control. 
We go to her home, she drags me in and fucks my brains out (she is 10/10, and is literally doing every single of my desires and fetishes in bed).

That reunion lasted about a month until my ego was sexually satisfied, and then we start to fight again and break up again. 

College starts, new me right? Fuck no, i try to be as normal as possible, attend parties and stuff, but i can’t im mentally blocked for new women, for new adventures, always running away just not to see her again. We meet by accident sometime later, and guess what? Fucking our brains out. When i talk about this, i really get so horny that I’m starting to realize i have sexual problems. I’m getting too horny and really just want to bang her. 

For the first 2 years of college, we were 1 month fucking, she starts showing emotions, I run away for 2 months. Rinse and repeat. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I always knew this was a huge problem, the thing is, i can’t find any possible way to end this. 

Here comes year 3 of college (last 12 months). I get tired of our on and off sexual shit. I realize I love her and maybe our lives are meant to be. Maybe the reason I keep coming back is to take revenge for that night. So i literally have a chat with me and forgive her and myself for everything. Write the last letter to her and express everything about this in it. I felt free. 2 days later, she answers with the letter of her own. And as soon as i got out of apartment, the whole building smelt like the perfume I gave her long time ago. I knew the letter was there. So we reconcile, full of love, reality, but and fear. Life was passing and she didn’t move on, same as me. Everything is perfect again, but this time, I felt my heart is in it’s place. 

So couple of weeks in, we’re still not sure in everything, promises are too surreal, and our relationship is yet to really start. In the meantime we are reliving perfect life with new friends and new stories. I am very happy.

My friends on the other hand noticed that i’ve changed a lot. We never hang, cause i truly can’t find myself in that party lifestyle. I get sad, and want to prove everything is okay.

Here comes the devil. So during my college some girl falls in love with me (idk why?) very clingy, boring, not attractive, but a good friend. 
In my first night out with friends in a long time, she and her 2 friends call us 3 to go and have some fun with them, casual. And since we all know each other, why not? I tell that to my girl and she is okay with it. We go there, and I get fucking smashed. Literally no brain. And in my frustration (?) with my friends and that boring friend constantly showing interest, i get so mad, i just fucking kiss her, and go home. 

What the fuck? 

I wake up, I am crying, dying, destroyed. That period was the period I was 100% sure I was about to get some serious illness. It hasn’t been even 3 weeks since she and i were together and I go and do something like this? My friends talk to me and apologize for forcing me on a night like that, saying they never expected something like that since they know i dont at all like that chick, and since im truly loyal. 

This is the start of my problem. 

So that same day i get into a mini fight with my girl that revolves around what the fuck were you doing that late at that chicks house. I explain it was fun and i dont really believe in that type of controlling behavior when love is much more important so we set the problem straight and it was good. 

Since it was the start of the relationship, I got very scared if i tell her that i might lose her. And in my deepest agony, abyss, darkness, i muster up the strength and vouch that I will in turn for not compromising myself for my stupid mistake, be the best man to her that i possibly can.  

And so I did just that. 
It was perfect, we had the most amazing time and she was happy, as was I. I was frightened that it might be heard around town, but my prayers were heard and it wasnt. I thanked god for everything, and kept my promise of being the best boyfriend out there. We travelled, we partied, we went to nature adventures. Oh man it was great. But when there were college parties, I didnt go, again in life i ran from myself and the possibility of her finding out for my stupid mistake. So my fears were there, but i kept my composure. That lasted for 10 months, and we had our few fights, but it was okay. 

Our last fight 2 months ago, happened when she finally started following me on gram. (She is crazy about instgram). She starts bugging me about some pages that are erotic, but i’m addicted to erotic shit. So she bugs me and thats when i decide its enough. 

Man, 2 years of HS you controlled me, now again you want to control my instagram? I’m sorry booboo, but im getting old for this crazy bitch shit. And btw, i have like 100 followings/followers, and post 0 shit, and never look at gram, so I get even more mad that she is now trying to control something i keep in check. Plus, her jnsta is 2k followers , that jerk to her fucking hot pics. So fuck off baby.

We meet up, she cant get over the instagram shit, and we decide its best to break up. We talk a bit about past, and we get to common ground saying it was perfect, but our egos clash once more.

So that was the end. 

Now, I’m miserable, can’t study again, can’t workout again. I sleep 10h a day. Workouts induce me tiredness driven headaches. My apetite is 40% weaker, i lost weight. I see no point in life once more. 

I’m thinking, should i tell her about that minor mishap from the beginning? That is the first bug that twists my gut just when i think about that scene. I’m afraid she’ll find out? I’m just basicallt anxious. Is my real reason i can’t let go just because i still feel slight guilt over THAT? Then it hits me, wtf should i tell her? Its over, it doesnt matter, it wont do any good nor bad. I’ll just look like an idiot. What is the reason im telling that?
Do I subconsciously want more? Do I really want that body again? Do I want her? Or am i just finding ways for my sorry weak mind to dwell upon just so I can remain sad and unproductive. 

I’m losing my grips with this world, I run away from problems and i feel lost. Everything is so hard and im in great emotional pain, and starting to blame myself again for everything. I’m not a “good guy” that is white knighting this situation, by telling the world im the golden boy pls help. No, im aware i made mistakes, but the mere process of self forgiveness and healing is hard. 

I want my old self back, not really caring about her opinion on stuff. I want her not to care also, I don’t want to live my life running away from girls. Running away from challenges because i always see her face judging me. Always, whatever I do, it’s like her fake moral is induced in me. Everything she believes about life is fundamentally wrong. I miss her as a friend, and as a sex partner. BUT I WANT TO BREAK FREE FROM THESE LOVE CHAINS THAT ARE MAKING ME MISERABLE. People ask me if im okay, even when i am, just because i have lost color on my face and happiness in my eyes. I’ve heard numerous times that i look sad. It is starting to tear my gut apart and i can’t find a safe path that is not filled with these intruding thoughts about her finding out about my stupid dumb mistake. I gave my all, and it didnt work, WHY DO I STILL FEEL LIKE I OWE HER SO MUCH?
I am literally physically in pain. I force myself to train, to go out. But afterwards i get this headache and my energy becomes 0. I lay tired, wake up tired. Just repeating the intruding thoughts. I meet new people and on first glance we like each other, but i just am afraid, and dont even know how to behave after. Idk what to talk about. Im lost, very very lost.
  
Man i’m stupid. Pls help. This was a long one."
1797,Never felt loneliness,[removed]
1798,How do I stop my mind from repeatedly focusing on/wandering to negative places or thoughts when I’m not even aware I’m thinking of it until I realize I am overwhelmed about something?,"Late November 2018 I started a depressive episode and with the help of my amazing wife, lots of time off work, and more work on myself than I care to go into detail about, I finally feel (mostly) like myself again. But depression never really goes away and I’m still struggling with my mind wandering to those bad thoughts. 

Eg. I could be at work minding my own business, and all of a sudden something that I know isn’t true and I know doesn’t matter to me, starts to overwhelm me and situations start to unfold in my mind that would probably never even happen in real life. I shut it down by telling myself the reality of the situation and that those thoughts aren’t real and the thoughts and feelings go away. However, minutes later those thoughts creep back into my frame of mind without me being aware of it happening. 

This cycle really takes a toll on me every day and I was wondering if anyone has experience with this type of issue or any tools to help you stop the cycle?

Thanks in advance :)"

1800,"Back at college, but still not feeling right","I’m sorry I keep posting these walls of text. I’m pretty sure there are plenty of people on this sub who deserve help more than I do. But if you want to read then by all means, go ahead.

I finally got back up to college and have settled back into my dorm. I still don’t feel... right however (see my previous posts to see what type of wrong I’ve been feeling) I’m glad to see my roommate again, (or at least, I feel like I should feel glad to see him, but this numbness is still there) sometimes it feels like I’m only telling myself I’m emotionally numb, I don’t know. When my mom dropped me off, I was extra irritable for some reason and was full of stress and frustration. I was rude and snapped at my mom a few times. Then when she was leaving, I felt nothing. No sadness that I wouldn’t see her again for a while, like I usually feel. Looking back on that incident makes me really upset at myself. Why didn’t I feel anything when I hugged her goodbye, why did it feel fake? 

Later on as I was unpacking I was still extremely frustrated at everything for some reason. I finally feel an emotion and it’s stress and anger. I just want to feel good again.

I have all these memories of past years of college where I actually enjoyed myself. Goofing off with my friends, joining clubs, doing interesting things, taking interesting classes, and now it’s like that’s all gone, like the person who enjoyed those things was a different person. A better person. 

Now I have an anxiety attack, or at least feel weird whenever anything violent or death related is mentioned, (or anything sexual). I don’t know exactly when that started, it’s probably the result of me being stuck in a loop of rumination. I used to know when violent or sexual things bothered me and when they didn’t, but now it feels like it’s all the same. At the same time, I’m depersonalizing pretty bad and everything outside myself feels so foreign now. All my old interests and hobbies are doing nothing for me, in fact, some are making me uncomfortable now, since it feels like anything involving any sort of violence makes me uncomfortable now, and even the most benign of videogames and movies have violence. 

I think I permanently damaged myself and my view of the world, simply by looking at myself one time while also being depressed. I’m worried that I ruined my senior year by THINKING. This is my last year of college, I had my whole life ahead of me, and I ruined it all in a month. In an attempt to improve myself. 

I was fine before July. And this is my life now. I can’t enjoy the things I used to anymore, I can’t enjoy the limited time I have with my college friends anymore. I can’t enjoy the classes I took anymore. 

In an attempt to fix myself, to remove a part of myself I didn’t really like, I ended up removing everything else instead. I feel like I was better off before, faults and all, than I am now, a person who is only the faults. 

I just want to go back to enjoying the things that I liked, violent or not. I want to go back to feeling like a person with emotions that could connect with others, a person who could laugh at stuff without feeling guilty about it, a person who doesn’t have to evaluate everything about themselves every two seconds. But I feel like I opened a can of worms and now I can’t go back to the person I was. I can’t go back to being blissfully unaware of how many of my interests were influenced by the dark side of myself. I got myself too deep and I feel like I can’t escape. I made too many connections in my brain and I can’t break them. 

I want to go back to watching anime and playing videogames and reading comics and drawing and goofing off with my friends and playing DND but now it feels like I can’t. And I did this all to myself, so it doesn’t even feel like I deserve help. My mom said that I’m punishing myself and I think she’s right, but I don’t know how to stop. I think there’s a part of me that actually believes I don’t deserve to be happy or connected with other people, there’s another part of me that wonders if I ever was truly happy or connected with others, or if it was some elaborate lie that even fooled me. The awful thought that my entire personality is a fabrication. That all of the interests I had were fake, that all of my opinions only exist because that’s what my friends thought. That the only part of me that was real was the dark side of myself that I wanted to get rid of. I should have just accepted myself, but now it feels too late. 

There are times when I feel like giving into my interests or my competitive side will make me go too far, or something. It’s difficult to explain. I feel like I tricked myself into having no emotions, or the more chilling thought that came right after: what if I tricked myself into thinking I had emotional connections and now that lie has been uncovered. 

I’m afraid if becoming a bad or violent person, but it feels like that fear is almost shrinking every day. There’s a fear in me that if I do try to go back to normal, in this emotionally disconnected state, that I’ll be faking it for the rest of my life like some sort of sociopath. That I’ll never be “myself” again. 

I keep thinking back to times in my life when I was happy, and my brain then goes “are you actually happy then, and if so, is it just because you got something you wanted, how selfish and horrible is that?” Or it goes “you got excited by a movie or show with violence in it? You even thought it was funny? Wow, psychopath” 

Now that I think about it, there were plenty of times when violent or scary stuff made me uncomfortable. When I got really upset when an animal died in a movie, or when my dog went missing for a day, or every time I got upset when I accidentally stepped on a bug. Or all the times I saw a trailer for a horror movie and got creeped out. I’m trying to hold onto those feelings, the ones that made me feel human. But it feels like that’s gone now. Like I convinced myself I’m not.   

I think I just dissociated while feeling depressed, then panicked and googled, which only made it worse. 

I know I’m still a person, I know I’m still me, but I keep spiraling into these freakouts. 

I think these reddit posts might be a good way of journaling for me, since I can get feedback from real people (without worrying my friends or family too much) but it also feels like I’m taking away from people who also need help. I’m not sure if I should continue here or maybe try somewhere else."
1801,How to get help in the UK as a teen?,"i just want to feel better again like i did 2 years ago. i just feel.. nothing. my mind feels heavy, like a weight on my forehead. im tired, can't concentrate and don't want to write this but i guess i finally feel like i need help.

i don't want to involve my parents, i don't want it to be a big issue. i don't want to seem needy of attention. is there any way to get help, to get diagnosed and know for sure whether im depressed or just a lazy piece of self-loathing shit?"
1802,Trying to move... feel paralyzed,"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any help you can give. I have a myriad of mental health issues but for the most part can at least function most days. However, I’m trying to move for the first time in 7 years. I used to move a lot but since it’s been awhile it’s much harder this time. 

My issue is that I was doing well packing and organizing and getting rid of things but now I’ve hit a mental wall and moving day is 4! days away and I honestly feel paralyzed. The last few days I haven’t been able to pack anything and I don’t see how I can get it done. 

I don’t know what’s happened to me. Any advice would be helpful I’m really at a loss for strategies."
1803,Is there any way that I can help my boyfriend who is struggling with depression?,"We have been dating for nearly 3 years and he has been struggling with depression for much longer than I have known him. However, I have seen it getting worse in the last year or so. We have talked about it on several occasions and he says he will never consider therapy an option as he doesn't believe in it. He also has a strained relationship with his parents, so he will not talk to a doctor about any potential medication as he is on their insurance and doesn't want them to know about his mental health struggles.

Recently, he's taken to saying that he wants to die. I at first thought he was joking, but when I asked him to stop saying it jokingly as it makes me uncomfortable he said he wasn't joking and actually wants to die. I fear if he doesn't get professional help it will just continue to get worse. I try to help him as much as I can by offering support and doing research on ways to help alleviate stress that triggers him to feel worse, but I am by no means a professional and feel as though I am at the end of my rope.

Is there anything I can do to help him? Any resources I can give to him that might finally help him to realize that he can get help, and deserves to get help?"
1804,Bipolar mania/psychosis ruined my life,"Long story short, I racked up 47,000 dollars in debt in about a month and a half while I had a 3 month episode. I bought a car, lied on the loan application about my income, maxed out 6 different credit cards all while I was not of sound mind. I could go through all the different delusions I was experiencing, but it wouldn’t make any difference. I’m unemployed, about to be 21 years old, and I live with my parents. They’ve tried telling me everything is going to be okay and to just look for a job but I don’t believe them. I’ve spent the past month on the couch doing absolutely nothing, depressed about the amount of debt that I got myself in. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare. I barely have any energy physically, I barely eat, I hardly sleep, and from the time I wake up until I shut my eyes again, I’m stuck feeling helpless about my future, about this debt I’ll never be able to pay back, about my body I can feel is withering away, I just see no way out. I wish my loved ones could’ve put me in a hospital before the worst of it occurred, but I’d refuse and insist I was just feeling my best and they couldn’t see it. In my head I felt like I was some sort of super hero/secret agent with an unlimited bank account and unlimited possibilities. 

I feel hopeless. I feel like I’ve ruined my life. I haven’t socialized in months, I haven’t worked since March, and I’ve ruined myself financially. I don’t know what to do. Every day my mental state gets worse and I don’t know where to start to get my life back together. I wish I could explain the state of mind I was in a bit better, but the main idea is I was no where near reality. I was donating hundreds, probably thousands of dollars on twitch, buying car parts, buying hotels, buying flights, a lot of which I didn’t even use. I drove a car I bought for 1000 dollars halfway across the country before it broke, I bought a 200 dollar Uber to the next town to stay at a Hilton because I thought people were paying for my hotels through my account, then I bought a 400 dollar Uber to an airport with a flight home the next day. I ended up missing that flight and buying another one without cancelling the first one. I did so much stupid shit man. Idk, I just don’t see myself getting back on my feet and soldiering on when I’ve committed bank loan fraud, will probably get sued by creditors at some point over the next few months, and barely have enough money for my phone bill, insurance, etc. The truth is, I want to die most days."

1806,Very ashamed of a phase I went through a couple,"A couple of months ago I went through a phase where I was obsessively copying my brothers friends personalities. At the time I was kind of an idiot and I was hanging out with bad people who had no aspirations whatsoever, to be honest I didn’t have much aspirations myself. My brothers friends were all really cool and funny people and were all in a band an I was developing an interest for music so I really looked up to them. 

Honestly I didn’t know who i was, all I knew was who I didn’t want to be and who I wanted to be. I had very low self esteem so I never trusted my own judgement. I would follow them on Spotify and only listen to music that they listened to. Probably because I thought it would make me more like them. I also started trying to dress like them. Do everything like them! I would always ask my brother questions about them and figure out irrelevant things about them so I could copy. 

A few months later things look a lot better for me. I’ve kinda gone my own way and started to build my own personality and feel comfortable I’m still very interested in music and I play guitar and bass. I still really look up to them but in a healthier way. 

However lately, I’ve been feeling very ashamed about this whole copycat phase of mine. Even though I’m kind of done with it for the most part, I keep thinking how creeped out they would be or how much respect they’d lose for me if they found out about it (which I know they won’t) but still I keep looking at myself as a weird desperate person and it’s not helping with my self esteem. 

Do you think what I did was creepy? Do you think you might have any idea why I might’ve gone through this phase? And should I really be ashamed of it right now?"
1807,Get sad from thinking of ex,"My gf broke up with me 2 weeks ago and we used to enjoy and share things together like Doctor Who saying we were like one of the couples from the show, we’re not together now and I can’t watch my favourite show without thinking of her, and I tried to learn Swedish for her, including swears lol, and now whenever I even think of Sweden I start to miss her, can someone offer any advice?"
1808,"29, F – hope?","I am 29, a single smiley and fit woman. I exercise on a regular basis and eat well (lots of veggies little meat and almost no processed or fastfood). I have a beautiful apartment, with a little terrasse, an amazingly unique and loving cat and since a few weeks a roomie too. A stable job, a stable income and no debt. I just returned 2 weeks ago from a holiday trip and I live in a country that is super safe and very beautiful, other people spend a lot of money to come here for vacation. I'm extremely fortunate and lucky to have all this in my life.

I have been depressed since I was 11, in psychotherapy for depression since 25, it's been a long way. This spring was my last session, and I have been doing super well for 6 or 8 month at that time. By now I have had a great year even, overcoming the small dips by myself.   
Currently my employers have us in two groups, which switch around home to office weekly. It is a home office week, and it has been rough on my mental stability. 

Still haven't fully unpacked my luggage since my return from my holiday trip. My room is a mess of fresh and dirty laundry, and it has been getting worse the past two weeks. That was the first sign of it. 

Recently deleted tinder, because that's the worst thing to do when you are down: mess with strangers and run into bad situations. I tried meeting some friends, but I feel deeply disconnected with most of them by now. My new roomie seems super busy, and I can't be a burden to her when she moved in to get away from her abusive family. 

So what could be done now? I tried watching some content on youtube that always calms or inspires me. I tried watching a uplifting show on netflix, it held me up for a bit but suddently I lost interest. I tried masturbating to calm myself down, because by now I was getting anxiety and panic attacks from overthinking. But it makes me tired. All I do is lay in bed, forget about time, forget about myself, fall in and out of sleep. 

I started to forget to shower, or brush my teeth twice a day. Forcing myself to do so costs me an immense amount of willpower. Cooking hasn't happened in a while. I crave instant foods and take out, I even eat some vegetables raw from my fridge because I am too apathetic to quickly boil or fry them.

I tell myself I don't have close friends to talk to, but I do have one. Maybe even two, but I don't know it yet because the worst thing that could happen is that you lose those very few for being too much of a burden. I don't have a support system like family or a very close friend. Nobody considers me their 'bestie' and neither do I. 

I called in sick the past two days because of a stomach flu. But actually it wasn't a stomach flu. I have been experiencing increasing pain in my joints and organs and extreme brain fog for days. I've been eating, but my mouth and my stomach feel numb. Overeating to the point of pain, but still feel like it isn't happening to me, just to something that I am dragging along, my body. 

My mind is falling into an alarming downward spiral. And I am suprisingly aware of it. 

Here I am on the couch, with my laptop, and just a moment ago I watched ""Cara Delevigne's Powerful Life Advice on Overcoming Depression and Anxiety (MUST WATCH)"". When she talked about wanting to disappear, I felt awake. suddently my eyes filled with tears, suddently my mind was clear. 

And all the uncertainity, fog, apathy and aching faded against the crisp and vivid realization:  I want to die, make it all go away.

So what do I do now? Sitting here with the Laptop on my couch, typing into reddit. 

I want to tell someone about how I feel. I know there are others like me, who can pretend to have a complete and successful life and still be fatally lonely. I get you. 

Maybe it is time to go back in for more therapy. What a defeat.

Maybe I will have to fight these heavy waves of uncertainity forever for the rest of my life. 

But right now it is not important to get your work done in time, have a lot of secure friends, a forever solution to depression, or finding a satisfying meal. 

What really counts right now is survival. We have to be serious about surviving. All we gotta do is hold our breath and wait for this wave of uncertainity to pass over our heads. 

And to know that in a few days, in a week, in a month, maybe with a few pills, this feeling will pass and I will be my true self again. And look forwards to it. 

Not like we didn't already do this so many times before, right?"

I am on antidepressant medication now, which is helping quite a lot, but it can be a hinder too. I have lesser time to study and to do my things, basically force to sleep up to more than 8 hours every night and feel drowsy almost everyday. I struggle to keep myself awake in the morning. 

However, comparing to waking up feeling depressed and afraid to step out on to the public transport and meeting classmates or even passing by people in the past, the medication are doing their jobs well, pushing me to meet my friends and giving me the courage to meet new [f](https://faces.So)aced. So I'm quite thankful for it, not regretting my choice. 

 I would like to encourage people who may have recently been diagnosed with any mental health illnesses to give medication a try if they are still contemplating. 

Anyways, I would like learn more about the Singapore National University Hospital Psychotherapy, please respond if you have been there for help. I would like to receive some advises from the community here too. Thank you in advance. 

1. May I know how does it like to have sessions with NUH Psychotherapist? 
2. How long will I have to wait before I could be contacted for the first workshop and subsequently, psychotherapy sessions with treatments such as CBT, DBT,  TMS and etc?
3. What kind of treatment would you recommend for me to start on before attending the sessions if the waiting time can be up to more than a half a year?
4. Do you have any tips for the drowsiness? Any way to reduce the side effects?
5. I still struggle with focusing and concentrating on work. I felt like my vision is always block by a blurred screen and I couldn't get all my attention when someone is talking/moving about in the same room. I don't have a room for myself cus we just couldnt afford a larger house but we at least have a roof over our heads.

1813,One bad moment almost always puts me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. Does anyone have a solution to combat this,"A near lifelong peeve of mine has been my emotions, and i don't know what causes it. If something bad happens such as a small quarrel with someone or even just an inconvenience that rubs me too much the wrong way, i'm just in an irreversible bad mood for the rest of the day. Anyone trying to cheer me up just makes it worse.

It's specifically urking me today because it's my husband's birthday, and for some reason he got all snappy with me out of nowhere over something to do with parenting our son. I'm in a sour mood now, and knowing myself i probably will be for the rest of the day no matter what i do to try and shift my mood. I hate this about myself and don't know what i can do to change it, i didn't want this happening on my husband's birthday. Yeah i did ask him what he got all snappy about and he just brushed it off saying ""i wasn't snappy"" and is now angry at me, and stupid enough now i'm pissed even more. I do recognize its a problem, i just dont know how to deal with it.

INFO: i've had severe clinical depression in the past and it always sort of lingers with me and never completely went away, but i don't think this is the cause. I've been through a lot in my life, and am still dealing with anxiety. None of these things I really equate to being the cause of these emotional problems but maybe i'm wrong. Hell, maybe i've got some problems i didn't even know about"
1814,"I'm tired of ""what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.""","If that's true, I've had enough lessons. 
Literally these past few years, despite me readily accepting my mental health has been traumatic as f**k. To where all my therapist says when something new happens is, ""You're a human. You're a survivor. This will make you stronger."" I've heard it so many times, I'm literally tired of hearing it. 

I wake up every day feeling afraid, because I can't stop thinking of the emotionally and physically abusive man who tormented me for months then just disappeared. I literally can't get out of bed for awhile. I don't even know why I dated him, yes I was vulnerable but I've done so much inner-healing I was already recovering from a bad situation and I just hopped into that relationship blindly.

These days I can't even find inspiration to do what I love. All that is occurrent is the opposite sex wanting to ""hang out."" Everything in my life is so superficial, even my interactions are all based around sex. I don't want to partake in it, I can just clearly see their intentions.

To explain all it has done it breed hostility and hatred, and won't solve the problems of hygiene or our relationship as experienced by my not showering while they were gone on vacation and our countless fights. He always comes back with then don't live here, which I can't do, there is nowhere for me to go and I can't take care of myself very well as evident by my lack of cooking skills and see above.

Am I going crazy? There is more but I don't think it's entirely relevant, save for I have online classes THEY wanted me to sign up for and it's very hard to do anything productive nowadays without the internet."
1820,I think I am hearing things,"Hey everyone I've been noticing something here recently and I've been worried about saying anything. When things around me are quiet I hear what sounds like people chatting from a distance as if they are in another room. I can never make out what is being said but there is a rhythm to it that sounds exactly like talking. There have been many times that I have startled my wife because I jump up to look out the window and see who is in my yard but there is nothing. 
I know I am different already as I have Asperger's but even so I don't feel this is normal I feel like the voices are talking about me I feel like I've done something wrong I'm just a little scared and a lot confused I didn't know where else to ask for advice"
1821,Goodbye,"This is the last post on reddit im going to make: My brain feels like rock, No emotion gets in and No emotion gets out. It feels like im living in a bizarre paradox, im stressed, anxious and depressed. I feel like im not enough for everyone i know, I feel like a outsider, and the more i feel like it the more im becoming It. Tonight all that pain is going away, im finally gonna get to rest In peace."
1822,Mental Healthcare Navigation,"
Hello!  I was wanting to make myself available for individuals struggling to navigate how to get help, what kind of help, and where to get help for all things mental health. I’m familiar with all levels of care from individual therapy to inpatient level of care."
1823,Looking for help!,
1824,Idk what to do,"I’m 18 and my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me a couple months ago and up until now I’ve never felt truly alone. My best friend has always been there for me and gives good advice but on stuff like this he’s not the best, so I don’t really have any one to talk to about how I feel so I’m posting here because fuck it.
After the break up I wasn’t that hurt because I saw it coming and I was out of town with the friend I mentioned so I had some initial support. We drank and partied and it was fun,but when we got back everything was different. It was like as soon as I walked into my house reality set in and I felt like a shell of my self. It was weird how fast it hit me, for the next month I couldn’t do anything I didn’t want to do anything I felt like I was a fuck up and I didn’t wanna bother anyone so I locked my self in my room and didn’t come out until every one went to bed. I just felt completely empty inside it got to the point where I felt like life wasn’t worth living so I started drinking and smoking weed... A LOT. After a while that’s the only way I could sleep or eat and at this point I started not to get over the break up but more like not caring, then finally my friend was like “get the fuck up we’re going to hangout and get you out of this shit” so we started hanging out again and I started hanging out with other friends to. For awhile this helped and everything started to get a little better, but after awhile I started getting paranoid and depressed again and the feeling of loneliness is still there even when I’m around people now. I feel like they just hangout with me because my other friend is there and my house is the only one they can smoke at. I feel like I’m not good at anything or even deserving of life at some points but I don’t want to die I just wanna feel like my self again, I just wanna be me. Idk I’m not really on here for answers or anything I just needed to vent ig but if you have any advice or story’s of your own I’m always open to listen."
1825,Looking for guides &amp; resources on helping other people who struggle with mental illnesses,"Hi there, 
I struggle quite badly with anxiety and depression, I have good friends and family and am seeking out therapy also. 

The thing is my bf who means the absolute world to me struggles with supporting me and being empathetic. He has had problems of his own in the past and I’ve always been there for him. The times come where I need his support back and he’s struggling to provide it. 

I know I need therapy and I try not to load everything on him as that’s not fair. He doesn’t think he’s capable of empathy and he doesn’t know how to approach giving me support when I’m low. He’s a very logical man and likes to research things, I firmly believe he can learn how to offer more support not just to me but all the other important people in his life too. 

I’m looking for any guides, articles, research etc that I could share with him. Any advice on how to support &amp; talk to anxious and/or depressed people would be greatly appreciated!"
1826,Panic attacks and breathing,"I’ve been experiencing shortness of breath lately (not Covid, just been tested and came back negative) and think it might be due to anxiety. When I experience it, the only thing that has helped so far is using an inhaler, and even that isn’t a perfect solution. I’ve been seeking a therapist for awhile, but everyone I’ve called has a full caseload. I’m unsure of what to do next. Doctors ruled out any life-threatening physical causes, and I’m going to follow up with my primary care doctor next week to see if there’s any possible physical cause. In the meantime, if it truly is anxiety, any advice? Resources? Thoughts?"
1827,How to care less about what others think about me?,"I care wayyyy to much about people's perception of me. I know cognitively that it doesn't matter, but on a really deep, primal emotional level I feel like their perception of me is the most important thing in the world. I feel incapable of making that feeling go away and it is hard to deal with. I don't understand how people say to just not care so much. HOW?"
1828,The devil inside of me.,"I have PTSD I believe. 

I looked in the mirror one day and I saw my eyes turn a different color. I swear having PTSD is like having the devil inside of you. 

My life has does a 180 only for it be a 360 and be the exact same as it was before. When I look backwards, I feel everything I went through was suppressed.  

Can PTSD also lie dormant and become worse over time? Can make you the enemy to other people who don’t know what’s wrong? I have a feeling many people will be mad at me but it’ll all doesn’t add up to being “on time” has anyone had the devil inside of them because of this? 

I went through another life change (moved from my 12+ year home.) into my friends home of 7+ years and I have the room to the left across from the mothers/fathers and the brothers room is in the middle. I swear I feel the room I’m in is the room for the devil. I can’t really do all the things I’ve done in my home like jump on furniture, walk around naked, I deal with 3 extra people than I ever have in 12+ years."
1829,Dealing with self hatred,"Hey, I've been dealing with self hatred for a while now and I feel it getting a bit worse. I have slight feelings of self harm sometimes and I'm quite scared of how I may end up and if these feelings might ever stop. I don't have any specific triggers for these feelings per se, but its generally a lot of little things. I'm in the college stage of life right now and I'm not sure what to do with my life."
1830,I'm struggling.,"Hi, this past year I've been really struggling with my mental health. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, I've been medicated for both. With this in my mind I thought that the reason I haven't felt like myself was because of them. But I don't think thats the case. It's like I go through these periods where I have all this energy, and its like my emotions can be all over the place and I have almost no self control especially when it comes to money and buying things I don't need and have become very impulsive and I overthink everything. But then there are periods where I can't do anything at all, and its not like I just don't want. My parents get mad at me because I will spend the whole day in bed. It's like I can't because I'm exhausted and just want to disappear. I also have difficulty with food where I can over eat one day and hardly eat anything the next. My sleep has also gotten worse because it's like I don't need to sleep, but when I do I always wake up early. It's difficult to get through the day sometimes. I've also have increasingly dark thoughts and it scares me. I feel like I can never stay focused and always get distracted onto something else. I just know something isn't right, and I can't open up to my parents because they won't understand. I tried reaching out to psychiatrist about it and nothing has really come from it, all they talked about was changing my medication dosage or putting me on a new medication and setting up an appointment with my therapist. I feel like I'm the only person who us concerned and that nobody is taking me serious. I know it's just gonna get pushed under the rug. If anybody has any advice that would be amazing."

1832,I’m so tired of feeling this way,"I feel as if I am choking on apathy. Things that would normally bring me joy are just stressing my out, causing my anxiety and depression to flare. I feel so alone. I feel invisible to those around me. I don’t know how to change these feelings. I just want them to stop."
1833,Am I being childish? Or is there something more to this?,"I’m an angry person, I’m 16 years old, I’ve had anger issues for as long as I can remember. I hurt myself, I become destructive and I hurt my loved ones mentally, and I push everyone away, I make my little brother cry, and I don’t feel my mother gets it because I don’t think I can help my anger, I don’t mean any harm but I can’t figure out what’s wrong with me, any thoughts?"

Thanks."
1836,Loss of a loved one is making me fear my own mortality,"So I recently lost my grandfather and we had is funeral only 3 days later. It’s been a week and a half and i keep finding myself drenched in this anxiety of what’s going to happen after I die. 

I’m an atheist, and I feel like for people who believe in an afterlife there’s a small source of comfort in feeling there’s more to life than life. But I can’t get my brain to switch over to that belief. 

I think my fear stems from not being able to wrap my mind around the existence of nothingness. It scares the shit out of me and i just don’t know how to cope with it anymore. Any advice would be wonderful"
1837,How do i make new friends?,"I'm 21, from Brazil, very introverted, i like video games, anime and stuff like that, but i have no true friends.

I had one when i was in highschool, but he moved to the other side of the country, and we've grow distant.

I'm almost finished college, i have collegues that i enjoy the company off, but they arent truly ""friends"".

Recently i've been feeling really sad and lonely, to the point we're i'm cant sleep well.

I tried searching on google, but i only get very vague guidelines that dont help me.

When i look at the people i know, no one appears to have the same problem to make friends, wich only makes me sadder.

When the lockdown ends i would like to make new friends (maybe people like me), but i have no idea on how to do that.

How can i find people similar to me?

How should i approach strangers?

What should i say?

I pondered about posting this or not, but i dont know what to do anymore.

What should i do?"
1838,"Rarely feel or express emotions to others, but if I see a video of animals being mistreated I immediately feel like crying.","Anyone else feel this? my emotional expression is terrible and my coping mechanisms are shit. I dont process emotional normally and for the most part I seem apathetic. However, when I see videos of animals being abused or even traumatized at shelters I get very emotional for like 2 seconds and my eyes immediately water. I love animals, but isnt it weird that thats one of the only things in my day to day life that spurs an emotional response?"
1839,Where is the line? (Question/rant/vent),"With all talks of the importance of awareness of mental health and the importance to not take it as a stigma, many people are coming out and openly sharing their journeys. And i am glad of this. I really do believe that we should openly share such things and normalise mental health issues. 

But when it comes to me, i start questioning. I have a huge amount of self doubt. I question every single decision i take. Having second thoughts is second nature to me. After something that happened with me 3 years ago, I kind of started my life afresh. New friends, just starting out college, new me. I had lost the ability to trust anyone - i believed there was no such thing as a friend. I would not open up to anyone or bother to be interested in anyone else's life. After 2 yrs of being part of a group of friends, most of them claimed they didnt know me. And i dont blame them, i had made it to be like that. i had created a wall no one could enter. And guess what? I thrived in such a setting. I was great in college, super confident, trusted myself and achieved great things. 

Then, last year, i dont know what came over me but slowly but surely, i started losing all my confidence - this reflected in my performance in all the things i was involved in. I knew right away that something was wrong, something was happening. I was falling back into the same patterns - self-doubt, self-loathe, procrastination. these were the same things that brought my downfall 3 year ago. And i could see the ""new shiny me"" slowly disintegrating. But i could not do anything about it. As i said, i knew something was wrong with me but i didnt know what and i didnt know how to fix it. There was even a time when i felt like i was just floating outside of my body while my life was just happening; i had no control on my life. 

So currently, i am at a crucial stage for my carreer. it is that time when i should be just head into my work and not be distracted by anything. But instead, i 'self -sabotage' (which is something i read on the internet recently), waste time by watching tv/youtube/netflix, scroll mindlessly thru social medias, go to bed hating myself and/or crying, am not in touch with any of my college friends except a few, whenever i achieve something i get happy momentarily, but when i see that someone achieved even more, i just spiral down to self-loathe and self pity, and hate that person for having more. 

I have 2 friends who know a bit about my insecurities and self-doubt and they really help me a lot. A LOT. they so many times even put my own needs in front of their own. But because of my current state of mind i many times just block them off or be rude to them. i do this because in the initial years when i was this shiny confident me,  i strongly believed in not needing anyone else's support and making thru life on my own, and well, it seemed to work for me back then. I guess now i just feel weak and too dependent when i see them helping me. yet now i find myself being utterly useless without them. Does that make sense?

I also have this thing where i will worry about certain things (say a test or my career) but after whining about it and crying and stuff, i just become so careless. I care for nothing and will deliberately waste my time or not do something which i know i should be doing.  Like i know only i can make a difference in my life and like try to make things right, but i just simply dont do it.

I am sorry for the long post. This is basically my mental sate right now. My question is: for all my talk and support for mental health and its awareness, i am afraid to be diagnosed of anything. So this makes me question - where is the line? As in do i really have something or am just being too lazy and irresponsible and in the back of my mind, trying to blame/ justify it by thinking that maybe i have some issue. As in, am i just refusing to face any responsibility of my own actions by playing the victim card??? 

i dont know if could drive my point home and make you guys understand. i am just confused (by the way, i am confused with every decision in my life) and i absolutely do not intend to offend anyone. So i am sorry if i have. 

If anyone could give some kind of direction or anything to the garbage that is in my mind, i would be grateful. Thank you."
1840,How to differentiate between things I have control over and things I should just accept and/or embrace about myself/my life as a person with mental illness ?,"How to tow the line between accepting myself and improving myself? I find it difficult to tell apart the parts of my personality that I have control over, and the parts that 

According to people around me and my therapist, I manage to simultaneously be too hard on myself, and blame myself for things that are out of my control, and also not take enough responsibility for myself and my improvement. 

People say ""just do your best."" But I don't know how to tell if I'm doing my best, I feel like I always *could* have tried harder or done better. Do people really strive to ""be their best"" self or is that idiomatic/hyperbolic? Am I just lazier than most? Does this post make any sense?"

1844,I'm in a bit of a predicament,"So recently I have been posting a few things on my Instagram story which seem to have annoyed a good friend of mine. The things I posted on my story are similar to the things on r/mensrights

I've started to self harm again recently thanks to this situation.
I feel like a total piece of shit and I want to apologize to her but I doubt she will forgive me.
I've been feeling like shit lately but I don't want to blame my mistake on my mental health.

Any advice?"
1845,How can my subconscious be ok with a topic but my conscious have endless anxiety about it? (2 different opinions on same topic?),"So it feels like my conscious and subconscious don't agree on the same topic and I don't know why. I am diagnosed with cyclothymia disorder, it's like bipolar but not as intense with the episodes lasting much longer. This girl who I've met is absolutely the girl of my dreams and is anything and everything I could've ever asked for in an individual. We've been sleeping together for about 2 months now and things only seem to get better between us.

She is bisexual and has a friend group of girls who are also all bi as well. We have sort of a poly-amorous thing going on where I'm the only guy she sleeps with but she's still allowed to have ""fun"" with her lady friends. I've met them all and they're really cool people who I get along with.

Even though I am completely fine with this and beyond trust her for some reason it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I'm not quite sure why. I love her for her and that's part of her that I accept and yes it's new to me and I'm adapting but something in my brain just screams that she'll ""find love in one of them"" and that someone will treat her better.

I genuinely love this girl and don't want to let my disorder and stupid thoughts get in the way and ruin it."
1846,Going back to a previous problem,Have you ever felt like you got over a problem in your head only to find out later from someone else that you didn’t change to begin with?
1847,"Don’t want to commit to plans, obsessing over food, feeling apathetic.","This pandemic has been hard on so many people in many different &amp; it’s really starting to hit me. I live with my partner and dog, have friends I talk to often, I walk or bike daily with my dog, I read, express creativity &amp; enjoy hobbies, listen to podcasts, garden, sleep 7-8 hrs, working from home keeps me occupied and I enjoy my job. 

I’m just feeling so apathetic lately. A month ago I was struggling to eat, I’ve lost about 15 lbs in quarantine, feeling anxious, etc. Now I’m not feeling as afraid to eat and am feeling ravenous with food and having it dictate my plans and it’s overwhelming. I don’t want to commit to any plans because I’m not sure how I’ll feel in the moment (which makes me feel selfish and unreliable) and I just feel kind of pointless and out of control lately. I’ve just been in a funk, feel out of control with anxiety/depression, and am just upset that I don’t feel like I can control my life right now and commit to plans or feel good about much (even though I live a pretty great life.) 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for with this, (maybe some more control?) I’m just so tired of feeling out of control &amp; disconnected."
1848,OCD relationship with food,"Hello! So I’m 18 and recently got diagnosed with OCD. I suffer from depression and anxiety too. I’m still very new to this illness and not very educated on it as it’s all foreign to me. So, my OCD seems to be very specific and detailed that I haven’t been able to find much about it online, nor find anyone who is going through something similar. 

So, my OCD is that I can’t shop at any other supermarket other than Asda. The thought of eating pasta, milk, cheese, chocolate cake or anything from any other shop other than Asda absolutely horrifies me. So, for example - I can only eat Asda branded cheese slices, only drink the green cap milk from Asda, and certain brands of cereal make me wanna vom. My recent ‘obsession’ (?) is that whenever I order from a takeaway or go to a shop such as B&amp;M and a bottle/can of a drink is in a foreign language - I cannot drink it. A huge fear of mine is Lidl and Iceland - the thought of even buying food from there makes me want to cry. I can deal with certain foods from Tesco, for example, but it’ll only go as far as a meal deal.

I’m moving out next month for University and I have to bring cutlery, plates and bowls etc from home so I will actually eat. Another problem I have is cleanliness. I struggle eating at foreign houses as to me their kitchen is extremely dirty and I’m not sure where their food is from. I’m also scared of the temperature that the fridge is going to be in my shared University accommodation. 

This is only a small fraction of my fears and anxieties. I’m still learning about myself and this illness as I always pinned it down to me being a childish fussy eater.

I guess the reason as to why I’m here is to find some comfort. Does anyone suffer from something similar? I would love to have someone to relate to. Dropping a reply would mean the absolute world to me. Thanks in advance!"
1849,What to do when nearly everyone disagrees with you?,"I don't have much to say on this topic. With almost every opinion I have, if I talk about it, everyone, or at least nearly everyone, is against me. I used to have some places I felt more accepted, but now, not that many. I don't really enjoy things as much anymore, and I'm sick of wasting time on pointless things. People don't need to accept me; I don't understand why so many people disagree with nearly everything I say, but they do. What the cause, I see no reason to waste my time on hopeless cases, as well as temporary things for pleasure. So, I ask, what should I do now? I don't really have anything I like to do, at least not anymore."
1850,I feel like Nothing matters anymore,"Hello everyone,
I have chronic back pain since I’m 20 years old (I’m 28 right now)
After finishing school at 20 , my social anxiety kicked in and I decided to never go to a job interview, simply because I was afraid of talking to authority figures.

As the years passed by , I was still unemployed and my back pain became even worse, so much that I visited a lot of doctors.

So enduring this pain became part of my life.
When I wanted to socialize and do stuff on weekends , I always need to consider , just how painful my current situation is and decide if it’s worth doing something.
The pain became like a compass to me, to decide wherever I do something or just stay home.

Last year I finally hospitalized myself for 16 days, I was part of a group of people with similar circumstances.

After 16 days of daily checking and physical/psychotherapy , the doctors diagnosed me with depression.
I’m not quite sure what degree of depression, but they told me , that the pain I’m feeling is not just my imagination , the depression just increases my feeling of pain.

So I started taking anti depressants and my anxiety’s became less , but my pain was still there.
A few months ago I dropped my meds , because I got angry at the doctors , they kinda told me that the pain will be less , but in the end nothing has changed.

To be honest , they also told me to find a psycho therapist  and I found the strength to go to two different appointments.
Maybe it’s just me , but It didn’t really worked out with those 2 guys and I also dropped the idea of searching for  a new one , since i disliked both appointments with those therapist.

The idea of opening up to someone and tell him everything about you , is so god damn scary to me and I don’t see how this will lessen my back pain.

The reason I searched for this subreddit , is because i suddenly have panic attacks and feel depressed all the time.
I can’t sleep , nothing really matters anymore , I don’t even want to watch a tv series or play a game.
I’m just lying in my bed all day doing nothing.
I just wanted to share my situation with people.

It’s not like I don’t have anyone to talk to. My family is supportive and knows my situation , but they don’t know how to help either.

Maybe there is someone out there with a similar situation and has an advice for me ?"

1852,"bullying ruined my life, im tired","i was bullied a lot when i was in school, to the point where i dropped. i have severe social anxiety, and since i was a kid i never knew how to fit in or have a conversation, i avoided fights too. everybody laughed at me and made fun of me, bags were thrown on me, jokes about me and everything. i live in a place where everyone is a gangster or know one, and people here are fucking dumb fucks that will pick a fight that lasts forever. we have no police, and in general i always avoided fights because i guess im too afraid of it, i was raised however to be peaceful and not use violence at all which now seems bad. i always heard them making fun of me and saying a lot of things about me or my parents, i couldnt do anything about it. i dont know anymore, i feel shit about myself since years because im not strong, because i am a coward. i am tired of this shit haunting me daily, i am tired of feeling so weak

lately i had this obsession with being stronger than everyone and everything which cant be real, i am no god. i am tired, please what should i do? if i pick a fight: 1 i will lose probably, 2 i will get myself into something similar to gang wars and 3 i will be wasting all of my time and risking my life and the lives of those around me like my family. and im tired of being a pushover, i am no gangster and i dont want to be one or join a gang or anything, i just want to live in peace yet i feel so weak, so pathetic. help please"

1854,Feeling stuck in life...,"I’m a senior in high school. We just started our first day yesterday, and everything at my school is different. Besides the obvious “last years seniors aren’t here” and “now we have to social distance and wear masks”, everything is different. They remodeled our school and it’s all Grey and gloomy. They also have everyone the option of in person or online school. I chose in person because I wanted to see my friends, and you can’t be in extracurriculars unless you go to in person school. I’m really sad because a lot of my friends chose online, so I don’t get to see them. They also took away our study hall period, which was my favorite part of the day besides lunch and band class. And they told the band that we would only play at home football games. Going to football games as a band member has always been my favorite part of school, but now that’s mostly gone. There are many more things I could list, but I’m just feeling really unmotivated because it’s my last year and all the things I love are being taken away or changed. I just don’t know what I want to do anymore. I feel like there isn’t a point to my life anymore. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Everything that used to bring me joy is gone. And a lot of kids and a teacher of mine confused me for a junior which made me sad because I wish I was a junior.

I'm a 15 year old boy and when i was at school i would look around and feel so inferior. I've been skipping my classes for the last 2 years because of this. These constant feelings of alienation and hopelessness has made me look at suicide as a valid option and im scared.

I have tried to go through it all and ask myself ""does this spark joy"" but joy isn't exactly a thing when you're in a depressive episode. I see a top and think oh but I bought this with my mum or it was a present from my dad or I have this memory with it so even if I haven't worn it in the past two years I don't want to participate with it. I really don't have a use for this much stuff and it takes up space and my room ends up being a mess but it all has sentimental value. I really want to declutter but I don't know how to let go.

 Being happy, have someone to love you, have a pet that's there for you? Well I haven't got anything anymore.

Hadn't had a longer relationship than a month and I only liked two girls in my whole life. What is why I said I am a loser. Can't be loved cuz I probably don't deserve to be loved. The only thing that I loved was my cat Tomi. She died 2 weeks ago at age 19. Yes, she was with me when I was a baby. I know she had a wonderful life but I feel like a big part of me died with her that day💔

Lost my job as security due to Covid-19. I worked for about a year. I liked the job, good pay and it got my mind off things. 

But now, I think, I don't have a reason to live anymore. Won't be loved, won't be missed by nobody. I think about my life everyday and where did I fucked it up? 

I just wish when I go to sleep and in the morning I won't wake up. What would be a bleesing.

1861,Why can't I love my family?,"That is the question I've been wondering all my life, the question that has made me feel so guilty and conflicted. Why can't I love my family. They're not abusive or unloving. Sure there's things I don't like about them and past traumas but nothing so bad I shouldn't love them. 

I used to get along with my family to some extent when I was a kid. Sure, we fought every single day but I was affectionate. I always wanted hugs and attention. But the thing is, there's one thing I'm 100% sure of... I didn't love them back then either. I would literally refuse to say that I did because ""I don't want to lie"". They thought I was doing it just to be a brat but that's not the case, it truly didn't feel honest. I couldn't force myself to say it no matter what was offered to me. They jokingly offered money, treats, just to make me say it and despite being tempted, it made me feel too strange. I don't understand. So this isn't something that simply developed because of some sort of trauma, its always been there. I'm not incapable of love either. I can love deeply. I don't understand what's wrong with me, even people I know who have a strained relationship with their parents still love them. Why don't I. It makes me feel so guilty because I can't bring myself to pretend either, so I've been honest about it. They don't believe me. They think I'm just too proud to admit it. I wish that was the case."

1864,You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid,"I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I begged my family for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times.

So let me tell you a few things: 

1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 
2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.
3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like ""It's just hormones"".
4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it."
1865,Does anyone else get really severe/sudden mood swings?,"**CW: Suicidal thoughts and self-harm**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my late teens but what I'm experiencing goes beyond just the more mild hormonal mood-swings I've experienced before. I've experienced issues with depression and anxiety since I was a little kid, but lately things have been getting really severe and kind of weird.

To clarify, basically what's going on is that I'll be fine/pretty neutral one moment, but then something small will set me off and I'll suddenly start being overwhelmed with suicidal thoughts. I'll start thinking about how much I want to die, think of ways in which I can die, or start writing a note or whatever. (I've never made a serious plan that I've stuck with though.)

Other times I've been overwhelmed with the desire to cut myself to mitigate the emotional pain. I've really only acted on this desire maybe around three times, but I've never cut myself very deep out of fear of doing too much damage. (At most what I've done to myself would be the equivalent of a paper-cut that bled a little)

 I'll usually be stuck like this for maybe a few hours or so until I find something to distract myself with and gradually calm down. After that, I'll usually feel fine. It's just really bizarre.

Has anybody else experienced these kinds of mood swings? I'm just curious to see if other people have and if they have any advice.

(And yes, I am seeking professional help for my issues)"
1866,Loved one is pushing me away and I don't want to be pushed,"Hi friends,


I'm looking for some advice on how to handle a situation with a loved one. This person suffers from really bad depression and anxiety, and always has. There's constantly been highs and lows but it's always been manageable. It's important to note that in the beginning he wasn't on medication or seeing a therapist because it never worked for him in the past. 


A few weeks ago this person and I had a disagreement and we both hurt each other and stopped communication. Around that time several other things in his life snowballed and piled up and his mental health became really bad. The good news is that this finally got him to start seeing a therapist and to get back on medication (which he's still adjusting to). 


Recently we worked through our issues and forgave each other. And I knew I could support him through the dark times, to be a light at the end of the tunnel. I love him very much and wanted to be his rock. Except he's now pushing me away and asking for time and space to get better on his own. I've done my research and I understand that this is normal for someone in his shoes to request. 


However I'm struggling with the idea that pushing away loved ones can be healthy. He says that he needs to be able to get better by himself, for himself which I understand completely. But isn't it important to have your support system too?


I guess what I'm looking for is the experience of those who have been in his shoes."

You can't think your way into getting started or continuing with the task, even though you know that taking action is the best thing to do and results might be good, if only you actually felt like doing it.

1883,I dropped my husband off at the hospital.,"My (nb20) husband (m25) and I both struggle with our mental illnesses.

Because of my husband's mental illness, he has been having trouble keeping a job, and therefore insurance, so basically, he's been off his meds.

His mental health has been deteriorating slowly, and his father dying a month ago exacerbated it to the point that he called me while I was at work, and asked if we could go get him checked into our local psych unit.

I, of course, took him. He'd been ideating, having extreme impulse control issues, sporadic sleep, and was unable to perform the most basic of tasks for himself. I've been taking care of him at the detriment of my own mental health, but I'm glad he's seeking medical intervention.

However, because pandemic, I can't visit. I can't go into the hospital at all. He can't have his phone to talk to me whenever he wants and I basically just have to wait around and hope he or someone else calls me.

I'm nervous, and I'm scared, and I don't know what to do with myself.

You may say just don't live on campus, in which I would agree I have the option not to live on campus. But for many it isn't an option, so how can people who are legitimately forced to isolate themselves able to not feel this way, is it even possible?

Before I had my parents to keep me from going insane, but now I have no one, so what the hell can I actually do. I talk to my friend over the phone but is that even enough?"
1885,I don't know what to do,"I don't even know where to begin...

I feel lost. I feel broken. I feel... defeated.

To any who have bothered to read this far, I appreciate you, but I warn you, this could go on for quite some time and it could start to make very little sense as I'm sitting in my car and just writing what comes to mind. I can't ask you to read on or to help me, but I just needed to get this off of my chest because right now I feel like I'm being crushed.

I guess I'll start from the beginning. I'm the youngest of 4 boys to 2 loving parents that I'm lucky enough to still have today. Growing up we were each told that we were each exceptional at one thing above all else and how much they loved us for those traits. 1st was the smart one, then there was the sporty one, then the funny one and that leaves me... I'm the good listener. Seriously? My brothers get these amazing traits (don't get me wrong, I love my brothers and each of them are really those things) but seriously? Good listening? Thats the best trait they could tell me I have? But anyway, I figured if that was what my parents cherished in me, I would do my best to be just that. So I listened, and listened and listened to everyone else, their triumphs, their sorrows, their angry rants. And I would just always do my best to make people happier than they were before our interaction. But I never spoke up about my feelings, I've always felt like other people have enough problems that they don't need mine too. For so long I've kept this up.

Moving forward in my story to the last 8 months or soc(It's really hard to make anything here make sense as there are so many facets to my issue). I recently moved back to my home town for a great job opportunity! But, the job has been harder than I expected on my mental health, I now work in an industrial metals refinery in an extremely dangerous and taxing role where trust in my team is an absolute must, and while in my training I felt accepted and liked, since my training ended I feel completely excluded and disliked. Simple stuff like being excluded from conversation during breaks or just outright not responding when I say something. It's wearing away at me.

I can't even turn to my fiance whom I love so much, she suffers with diagnosed depression and anxiety, so if I try to open up to her about what I'm feeling I'm only met with anger and sadness because ""she is struggling with her own stuff, she can't help me with mine."" So I find myself apologising for even opening up. I try so hard to maintain my composure and be there for her all the time like she asks, but it is extremely difficult as I work 60+ hours a week as the sole earner of the household and being an introvert desperately need SOME time for just myself. Even after all I do, I'm still being made feel as if I'm not doing enough and need to be doing more.

I honestly feel like there's nowhere to turn, and no light at the end of the tunnel. I've seen the result of suicide in the family (I've watched as my mother listened on the phone as my brother attempted suicide, we honestly thought he was dead for hours until one of his friends found him. I watched as the light and spark left my mother's eyes.) I can't do that to her, I can't make her go through that again. But at the same time I struggle with the pain of continuing with life. I feel like I'm waiting for the sweet release of death but can make no effort to quicken it.

Honestly I could go on like this for hours but what's the point, there's no one reading this.

If you've made it this far, thankyou for listening to the ramblings of a man that has nowhere left to turn and no idea what to do. You are a gem, I genuinely hope your life is filled with the happiness we all deserve."

1890,I keep losing interest in things.,"First off, I don't really follow this subreddit, however looking through some previous questions, I feel like my question belongs here (please correct me if I am wrong and direct me to the correct subreddit).

For most of my life I (20M) just keep losing interest in things. If it is really enjoyable, it could take up to a year (or slightly more) to lose interst, but other than that, I'll just completely stop the activity. For example, I am an avid fan of computer games, but now I'm finding it hard to actually complete a game that I enjoy. I usually get 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through and just stop. I also am the DM for a DnD campaign, and my players are constantly asking when the next session is, but even though I am interested in the campaign still, I find it difficult to plan sessions.

Now I'm finding it hard to watch lectures as they don't interest me anymore. (This is the main reason I am posting as I will fail my degree if I do not watch my lectures). I used to love watching lectures and getting interesting information from them, but now I just can't concentrate on them.

On to my question:
Is there a way to change my course of thinking so that I can slow down my rate of disinterest? Or any helpful articles that you can link me to would also be helpful. I ask this question, because as I think towards the future, I see myself losing interest in most things around me (which is freakishly scary)."

One of my brother’s friends pointed it out to their GC and started going off on me, including my brother. I don’t know if they hate a hate boner for me or not, and it broke my trust temporarily with my brother because he was always very sweet towards me, and now he is saying rude stuff about me.

Ive always been really lonely and I thought I was projecting my own insecurities onto other people but this got worse around november 2019, when the person I thought I loved and I started dating. As soon as he accepted me, I thought Id be happy but for some reason it felt like it wasnt him. Like it was someone else in his body doing a poor imitation of him. Things didnt end well at all. When I tried to reach out to him and be friends with him again, the whole time and a couple weeks after I had cut him off (not exactly how it sounds, its way more complicated and the reason I cut him off) I was convinced the real him had been killed and replaced by someone else. I know that obviously wasn't the case but at the time I had really believed it though very deep in the back of my head I knew that wasnt possible.

Even now, when I listen to someone speak, I cant see it was a person trying to talk to me, it feels like a puppet thats programmed to say certain things and react in certain ways. Its so lonely it makes me feel like theres something wrong with me.

I know Im a horrible person and probably deserve it but its lonely and I dont know what to do anymore I dont know whats wrong with me"

Unfortunately, she hasn’t completely dealt with her PTSD from her childhood and has been in a toxic work environment for the past 2 years. We moved to Florida recently and she started a new job just for her boss to call a whole meeting to degrade her and tell her she would fire her if she didn’t start straightening her hair and then looked her up and down and said, “killer body though.” My fiancée wasn’t going to put up with another toxic work environment so she quit. Luckily she has years worth of savings. Well, the events of yesterday and her traumatic past all boiled up to what happened today. She threatened to kill herself. She talked to her dad on the phone and he was an asshole to her and when she hung up she said he deserved to have a dead daughter. She told me her plan. She was going to take the her entire bottle of vyvanse. I quickly got up and took all the medication and hid them. She was begging me to let her do it. I wouldn’t let her out of my sight and I called her stepmom, who has been a stable mother figure for her ever since she lost her birth mom. Her stepmom immediately told me to call the police because she had a plan. I couldn’t risk losing my fiancée so I called the police. They came and asked her questions and then told me they were going to baker act her. I watched them take my incredible fiancée away in handcuffs. I haven’t heard from her since.

Except, when I'm doing extreme stuff that is detrimental to my life and other people's life (basically adrenaline junkie). I also find that when I'm watching gore videos It feels up my empty void. I have gotten into extreme pornographic. If I see a naked lady I don't feel aroused but when I see them in pain, torment and in agony. Then I feel aroused.

I have tried getting help but my school counsellor got me excluded from the school for 3 months for on the basis of ""people safety and my safety"". Then in those 3 months, I had sessions with child service and therapist. But I felt discomfort because they would keep mentioning ""If I think about any terroristic thoughts"" (I think it's all stems from me being brown). And they were just bad in general. In that conclusion, I will not be seeking any help from ""professionals"".

But I see a change in my emotion and how I felt. When I was intoxicated or heavily smoking cigarettes. But I have stopped doing both of those. But it's been 9 months and I feel like empty. Except watching gore and extreme pornographic and doing extreme stuff that is detrimental to my life and other peoples life. I did see an increase in indulgent on those things. I've been also fantasizing a lot about murdering/skinning someone alive just for fun. Which is not normal. I've also seen an increase in my suicidal thoughts in the past 9 months.

I'm really desperate now. I will take any suggestions for my problem. I just don't want to feel empty and depressed"
1899,"Schizophrenia story. Please, i need an opinion","I have an uncle, who has had schizop. for almost 25 years now. He's 38 years old and lives with my grandparents, (his parents) who, to be honest, (and unfortunately) are bottom class in terms of socioeconomic status. They can't afford proper treatment for him, they have him druged for most of the time with clonazepam, which is showing to lose it's effect on him. He is becoming more and more volatile, agressive and dangerous for two old and tired people who just want the best for him. It breaks my heart, i can't put it into words. He is deteriorating, and almost killed my grandfather once not too long ago with his bare hands. We live in a different town and they are alone and helpless with him. What can i do to help? anything, i'm studying to become a psychiatrist to help them in the future but right now i can't help. I don't want them to keep suffering, please help me"

1903,Am I going insane or am I just depressed ?,"Hello, this will be a long one so get comfy and enjoy the ride. 
I am not looking for sympathy, or looking for attention I am giving my back story and medical history so that anyone with suggestions understands more about me.

• BACK STORY •

I am currently 19 y/o, I have been diagnosed with MDD(major depression disorder), ADD (attention deficit disorder), GAD( generalised anxiety disorder), social anxiety, PTSD( post traumatic stress disorder), I have self harmed since the age group off 12 and attempted suicide twice and have fleeting thoughts on a regular basis. 
I was sexually assaulted when I was 10, emotionally abused by a family member, had a rough upbringing in general with my mum ( dad was out of the picture ) and I was exposed to a lot of things no child should see. I have been to 14 schools total, I struggle to make and maintain any form of relationship. 
In my head I am very empathetic, I understand the emotions of the people around me in my head, however when I need to put my thoughts into action, it all goes tits up. 
Also I take anti depressants and concerta for my add daily and propanalol?? (Unsure how to spell it ) for as and when required 


• QUESTION •

Does anybody know why I don’t feel any emotions ?? 

Not the typical numb due to depression or anti depressants or due to any medications, I don’t remember feeling anything, like at all. 

I feel like I am in this constant state of ‘bleh’,even when I think back to my “happiest” memories, I don’t think I was actually happy, I think I’ve just taught myself how to respond to a situation and act accordingly. 
For example, growing up if someone was crying or looked to be upset, I would act ‘sad’ aswell or on my birthday, I new I should of been happy, so I acted happy.
 I think that along the way I have taught my self which emotions to show at which times based on others reactions to a situation. 
Drs think I am depressed, but I’m not sure I understand what sadness even feels like, I think that I am considered depressed because when I’m not around other people I have know ones emotions to mimic, so my confused, emotionless self comes out to play and because I don’t feel anything, good, bad etc I am “depressed”. 

Ino this probably won’t make sense because it doesn’t even make sense to me, but I’m just hoping that ones person may have experienced something like this or know of something similar. 

I just need answers. 

Thank you and sorry for the confusing short story"

1906,Every single damned day.,"I feel like I'm on the cusp on a mental breakdown way too often. There is no way I can lead a happy life feeling this way. I thought it was improving some time ago, but I think it's worse now than it used to be. It got bad again, but I took this year to try to get better.

I don't really have friends anymore. There are people there, including old friends. But I don't have friends who can offer meaningful, healthy support. I wanted to make new friends whose social lives don't revolve around bars. Not to replace friends, but to have another avenue. It hasn't really worked out and socializing is hard right now. Making friends in your 30s is hard, especially if your career is in shambles.

My life is very unstable. My finances are fucked, my earning near nothing, some of the highest student debt of anyone I've met. My career fell apart and I've been trying to put another one together. I don't have insurance, so treatment is hard to come by. I make sure I get my medication, but I don't have much else.

I'm in a self-perpetuating cycle. Things are bad and that makes it harder to get ahead. The ongoing failure to move forward makes it feel worse, which makes it even harder to move ahead.

I was trying to keep things together for the most important relationship I've ever had. That ended. I did a lot of horrible stuff that severely hurt the person I love more than anyone. I was trying to make things better for both of us. It was taking time, as it does. But I think it took too long. I was really trying to make things better. I continued to make mistakes, but I felt like I was learning and progressing. Now I feel like maybe I was wrong about the progress I was making. I was told I hadn't changed and nothing changed. I thought I had, though it couldn't be overnight. But maybe I haven't. Maybe I'm the same.

I still have good days. Days I feel like I'm going to make all the difference. But one little thing can make it all fall apart. The worst is when something happens that is, related to, or reminds me of ongoing problems. It brings out the sadness, stress, anxiety, and frustration of all of the times these problems have drug me down. I can't seem to take things on their own. These things cause an eruption of all of the negative feelings I associate with similar circumstances. I'm just so tired of them happening for so long. So now anything that even reminds me makes me so defensive, scared, frustrated, sad, and sometimes angry. And a good day becomes bad.

I just want them to stop. Just for a while at least.

This isn't how life was supposed to be."

P.s I do understand it comes from my anxiety but when I get bored I do tend to see more anti-social behaviour like watching gore videos or doing impulsive thing. 
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder by the therapist. And other discorder , which they didn't want to say. I was post to see professional people for my mental health a year ago. But I refused because I don't trust professionals."
1908,How to get past the fear of failure?,"Hi! I’m 19 and I’m moving out soon. I’m excited but also sorta struggling with the fear that I’m going to fail. My parents when I was younger would pick on my lack of money skills a lot and told me I wouldn’t be successful with money as a young adult so I’ve meticulously saved and have a huge savings. It’s to the point where I only spend money on necessities and refuse to do anything for myself even food that’s outside our normal home meals. I have a job and have spent months planning a budget and making sure everything is accounted for and will work. I’m sorta the odd man out in the family because I’m more creative but for them an artist is someone who’s flaky/unsuccessful. I want more than anything to not fail but it’s sorta eating at me and really stressing me out. Does anyone have tips on how to help that nagging fear? My anxiety has been on edge with all of it so we’re working on positive self talk and slowly pushing my boundaries in therapy as a start! Thank you, I appreciate any help"
1909,Am i just crazy??,"So, i have this thing where i get really mad. Like beyond mad. I can not control my temper. It’s like a switch. One minute i’m just annoyed the next minute i’m full on mad. (screaming into pillows, kicking doors, pulling my hair etc). Also this doesn’t happen out of nowhere. It usually happens during an altercation with either my significant other or a family member. I really hate this feeling of pure anger and it usually ends up in me saying terrible things to the people i love which i later regret. My boyfriend of 2 years felt this “abuse” from me. How do i control it, i feel so bad when i hurt him by saying such mean things. We don’t live together so we usually argue through text n i’m on the other side punching my mattress and pulling my hair. Is there any advice for me. Anything at all. 

Also, I’d also like to address how i also seem to be very pessimistic, in ways which i always expect the worst, i always feel like i’m going to die. DEATH is such a big thing in my mind. I’m so scared of death, how i’m going to die and when. I want to not worry about death, i want to live my life without no fears. Could someone please tell me what my problem is ?"
1910,Feeling completely hopeless,"I feel so completely drained. I can't stand the world or 90% of the people in it.

I get called a social justice warrior for defending myself from all of the years of rape, sexual assault, abuse, harassment, and everything else in the book.
