1,I think I am developing OCD and need help,"Hi, I’m from the US, 21 years old and a female. 

I have diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, and depression and take medication for my ADHD and depression. I cannot take “real” anxiety medication because I have a past addiction to benzos, so, substance abuse is another mental health struggle I have too. 

I had acute stress disorder after a traumatic experience over a year ago and recently was physically and sexually assaulted. 

I have developed Dermatillomania very badly. This started after my traumatic experience about a year ago when I picked at my skin a lot to cope. Now I pick at my scalp. I am finally trying to stop because it has gotten very bad and I think it is gross but I do it unconsciously. I am losing so much hair and have big huge scans on my head. I need to stop. 

This alone doesn’t make me think I have OCD but I have recently been having really violent intrusive thoughts and it is really scary. I also get very angry at the person who did the physical and sexual assault to me. I will just be walking along and have incredibly violent and intrusive thoughts and I am not a violent person. I hate watching violent movies or seeing suffering and I don’t even eat animals because I love them so much. I also get irrationally angry at my roommates animal I live with and it really bothers me because I love animals so much. 

Every time I feel like I’m losing my marbles and I make a google search ocd is the first thing that ever comes up. I’m just wondering if anyone has ever suddenly developed ocd? I definitely have had ocd like symptoms before like they are so weird idk how to describe them. Idk why I’m making this post I just feel like I am going kind of crazy and don’t know why I am getting such scary thoughts. If anyone has any advice or anything like that or thinks I’m overreacting I would really appreciate it. 

The Dermatillomania could also be me searching for stimulation bc I am very very adhd. I’m trying to replace it with rubbing my hair ties instead."
2,I just needed a place to express this,"I can ignore it most of the time, I live a pretty normal and happy live now and id think I'd make my small self proud.

but sometimes the fact that I've been abused consistently for the first 16 years of my life still creeps back up into my chest and heart and makes me feel like I can't breathe, and that I don't deserve to, my memories haunt me just well I thought Id escaped it all. a new chapter of my life has started and im so much luckier than most people that have felt the way I've felt in the past, because most people don't survive. I'm loved now, or so I hope, and my life finally has happiness, but my past self, the little me that was a burden to all, taken advantage of by so many, that me haunts me, reduced me into a ball of fear and hallucinations and I'm starting to think I'm crazy

idk if this is the right place to post, but I just needed somewhere"
3,Today started okay,"This is my first post and I'm not even sure what I'm looking to get from it but my struggle with anxiety and depression has been getting overwhelming lately and I needed to vent.

I woke up later than I wanted to and it took a while to get out of bed but I got up, got dressed and went out to run some errands. The sun was actually out for a bit and I listened to some happy music and actually felt okay for a short time. Did my shopping and returned home.

Had a dream about my mom being over my house this morning and texted to tell her.

I was met with a cold response. And I can't even blame her, I haven't reached out in a while. I don't talk to friends or family often and when I feel the urge to, the overwhelming guilt and shame from the gap in contact mixed with the repeated apology I know I owe them stops me from even sending a short text. 

Most of my family does not take anxiety/depression seriously and my mother has been seeing counselors for years so thinks what may have worked for her will work for everyone so I avoid telling her. Her overwhelming concern just feels embarrassing and intensifies my anxiety. 

I know I need to be open with people close to me about what's going on in order to have even a chance to repair the damage I've caused to our relationships but I'm not sure that's even possible anymore. Every day I find myself isolating more and more. I have tried to seek out professional help but the people I've gone to so far have been terrible for me and I'm so scared and anxious to try again.

I just don't know where to go from here."
4,venting: feeling like my life is falling apart.,"i’m a 20 F and a junior in college. i have bipolar type II and ADD. I dont take meds for bipolar disorder because they kept making me gain excessive amounts of weight. i’m still recovering from that weight gain.

i got a dui about 3 weeks ago. i had always had an issue with alcohol but never thought i’d drive until one night i did. thankfully nobody was hurt and nothing was injured, i just hit a curb. but the experience in jail traumatized me. it was beyond inhumane and disgusting. i have been washing my hands so much since getting out that my knuckles are dry and cracking even though i moisturize. parents are covering the lawyer, i’m paying for everything else like the breathalizer ($75/month for 6 months), victims impact unit ($60), counselling ($60 every other week), probation (dont know how much but not cheap for 18months-2yrs), and the impoundment of my car (~$180). 

and yes i know i shouldnt have done it. i feel nothing but shame and regret for the incident.

i’m a full time physics student and work a minimum wage job 4 days a week. my manager is a dick and minimum wage here is 7.25 no tips. i started off this semester ready to get my shit done. i’m repeating a class i failed last year and a class i dropped out of. after all this shit thats happened, my focus has been severely altered. i’ve been trying to shift it back to school. i studied hard for a differential equations exam (who i pay for a tutor in -$40/hr) and made a 55. i don’t know what happened. i know the material. i genuinely do. well it turns out i have severe test anxiety and my mind just blanks. i talked to my professor and showed him i can do the math correctly and he just said that next time i need to work on the anxiety. 

i also got a strike from my university for the dui. that’s another $75 to them + i have to take a class on alcohol and substance abuse. 

i’m sitting in the bathroom stall at my job and just crying. i was cleaning and just thought about the ways i could kill myself. my life is going downhill. everyone around me is doing well. i’m mentally suffering. i thought about running away. i just want to be happy. i’m tired of this and i’m tired of hurting."
5,Anxiety and family.,"So a little background, my eldest sister suffers with a lot of mental issues one being borderline personality disorder. (21)
My brother has anger issues. (20)
I suffer with anxiety, panic disorder, depression and an eating disorder. (16)

So my sister and brother argue a lot, and it gets very out of control very quickly, tonight they kicked off, ended with my sister pulling a knife out on my brother while my younger sister (13) was with them at their house. I had to get to there’s very quickly baring in Mind I was just calming down after a major panic attack, you know the slowly coming back to reality phase.... 
police were called etc.. 

These situations happen too often but I am always the one my elder sister calls, she depends on me too much and I’m only 16. But tonight, after it calmed down a little, that my anxiety was spiking again and my brother told me to “stop making it about me when it’s not about me.” I am never the person to cause a scene I’m more of a ‘suffer in silence person’ so I was kind of hurt by him saying this, I ended up going outside because my blood pressure was going high and my chest was getting tight (my first sign of a panic attack) I had a full on meltdown, no one checked to see if I was okay, not even my mum. I dried my eyes went back in to the house and I lay down on the floor because it was cold and felt nice since my body temp was high and she laughed at me and said “go and take another pill” (on about the anxiety medication I used to be on) 

I feel bad that I made a point that my anxiety was bad but I equally felt like I needed to say something about it, to let them know that dealing with them constantly is affecting me severely. 

Do you think I shouldn’t have said anything? Any advice? X"
6,A Teacher threw me out of class because I am Asian,"Eventhough i have been dealing and struggling with mental issues for quite some time already I feel like this is the thing that I really don’t know handle with mentally. I guess I’m not the only Asian person who has experience this kind of racism since Corona “trended“ but it’s really difficult for me to handle this particular thing.A teacher I never had before in any class expelled me from his classes (dunno if this is the right word) with the reasoning being that he doesn’t want to risk getting infected with “The Virus“. I honestly didn’t attend school for the past days because of this and I am honestly afraid to go there, because Eventhough I know that the people in my class are probably on my side I really can’t handle bullying that well. I just don’t know what to do and nobody this far was really able to help me, so maybe someone over here might have a suggestion?"
7,How can I get better? (F15),"Since the 7th grade, my mental health has just deteriorated and no matter how many times I've tried to get help, my parents brushed it off. My self-esteem is low and I'm awkward and quiet. I can't concentrate and it's hard to remember anything because I'm constantly thinking about things I don't need to worry about. I get jealous easily when it comes to my boyfriend (m15), but I feel like there's an underlying cause. I constantly get misunderstood and I take everything to heart, I don't know what to believe or what not to believe. It never feels like I can be myself, I forgot my true personality. When I try to be nice in hopes of seeking validation and hoping to make friends, people think I'm odd or they simply don't care. I don't know how to get better and school stresses me out. I want to cry every day and my motivation to do anything just diminishes."
8,Guys. Get tested for anemia.,"I've been taking iron supplements for 4 days and it's insane how much more energy I have and just how much happier I am in general.

Don't get me wrong I'm also on antidepressants and in therapy but wow apparently iron was the boost I needed."
9,How do I open up to a doctor about my bad mental health,"I've been depressed since I was a little kid. I remember vividly from Kindergarten to now, that I was never able to get along with the other kids. All my interests were outside and foreign to the norm. I was never taught how to socialize with others and understand body language and social cues, which is disconcertingly difficult for me, knowing how to filter and think before I say things. I was always extremely sensitive to others yet I would pretend to be tough and rude to others just so I could feel stronger and more secure. And I would cling to friends or anyone who made me feel worthy and secure. But then hate them whenever I was excluded, humiliated, betrayed, insulted. I felt everyone was either good or bad, hated or liked me. But I think that I was mostly hated. I would always be dependent on everyone liking me and wanting me around to survive. There were plenty of times where I considered suicide and was hospitalized once. After that hospitalization, I knew that I would only get worse and would never be fixed. I just want to be normal and likeable. I paid people to like me, I bribed people to like me, I tried guilt tripping people to like me, lying, manipulating, etc. I just really wanted friends who would really want me around just as I did. I know thats pathetic. But I hate being mentally ill, it makes me feel disconnected, flawed, worthless, stupid, and it makes me not live any longer even while Im writing this. I wish I could tell someone this in person but Im so afraid to be judged and Im so ashamed of myself as a person. Other than Depression, I probably developed all sorts of disorders too. I did self-assessments and found BPD, DPD, and other problems. I just wish it could all go away.  Sorry about this elongated text. But how should I open up to my doctor? What problems or illnesses should I bring up? Thank you for the time. But in the end, knowing my past and luck, I might never be helped."
10,"Struggling in life, but the problems are so blurred and confusing for me to understand","I am looking for advice and maybe insight if anyone here can relate to my problems. I have always been a little ‘off’, and all of my close friends acknowledge that, but I have still been able to do relatively ok in most areas of my life. As I get older, (21), I have started to pay more attention to some of the kind of trends that have been messing my life progress up and just my general functioning. I have been diagnosed with adhd when younger, but I am fairly sure that I have also had a few periods of decent depression. That much is clear to me, but then there is this ‘other stuff’ which gets me the most because it is all so embarrassing and plain confusing.  I am very unsure if this is related to mental problems (my poorly handled adhd? Or even bipolar/autism?) or if these issues can be derived from personality flaws and poor work ethic. I don’t know what to do, if I need to do anything, and feel lost. 


The life problems: 


• Periods of feeling unmotivated and depressed
 - Don’t care about anything, mostly not sad but life feels meaningless
 - Very hard to eat, almost have to force feed myself to not lose weight. Food = disgusting
-Isolate myself from friends. Have ended multiple relationships because I get flaky and go ghost mode
- Depressed feeling times last for a few months I think, but normally are only very bad for a week or two. During the very bad times I think about suicide sometimes and feel really empty.


• The ‘weird stuff’ 
-Sometimes becoming enraged over tiny things, like chewing sounds, someones presence, or other tiny things other people do. Sometimes find myself getting really angry because I feel like whoever I am talking to is speaking too slowly and I know what they will say. Like want to claw my eyeballs out angry. 
- Days where I feel extremely angry and aggressive for NO REASON. Like, walking through the supermarket fuming over nothing. 
- Impulsive drug use. I normally only drink once a week and smoke marijuana occasionally, but sometimes I go through phases where I do lots of dangerous hard drugs on impulse. Its not an addictive thing imo, just concerning to me that I make those poor decisions. 
- Weird sexual stuff. Sometimes I will for seemingly for no reason get fixated on a sexual idea and I feel like I am ‘driven’ to achieve it right then. This is what makes me feel the most crazy out of all of it. Like, weird kinky stuff that can be unsafe and also leaves me feeling ashamed after it all plays out. Have had times with really high sex drive (need to get off multiple times per day) and sometimes have times where I have no sex drive whatsoever for week(s)
-Small problems with insomnia and maybe anxiety


•Personality duality
-The ‘good me’ is charismatic, sharp, funny, and very good socially. Very extraverted. This person can make friends with anyone, loves socializing, and is good at talking to women. When I am like this I am successful at everything I do, happy with my life, and start romantic relationships. Very motivated academically and socially. 

-The ‘bad me’ is awkward, introverted, and quiet. When I am like this I do not like to socialize or go out. I mostly isolate myself, and this kills my relationships because I flake out on plans and become distant from everyone. Gets the bare minimum done to continue functioning, barely goes to class. The days seem to blur together. 


Is this stuff objectively cause for concern? I feel like I am making myself have these problems by thinking about having them, and it is all just made up by me subconsciously. How do I even approach this?"
11,Feeling of being unable to be in romantic relationships,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to see if others are in the same situation.

As a 29 year old female I have been single for 5 years (prior to a 2 year relationship) but have had lots of short term relationships in that time.  
I just got broken up with again ( iand can see that my mental health, recently being told it was too much to handle is definately a big part of this.  
I'm using the time to work on myself and not being in a relationship but am scared I will never be capable of one.  
Do others feel the same? It makes me feel a bit alone"
12,I want to disappear forever from the face of the Earth since there are people with Antisocial Personality Disorder who choose to overcome the disorder rather than just be at the mercy of it.....,Like the title says.
13,Feeling very lost. Any advice please?,"Hello everyone, I will try to keep this very brief. My whole life I have grown up with a very overbearing mother. I would go as far to say that she is emotionally abusive to both my sister and I. However, she is emotionally abusive and manipulative in a very sly way. Always dangling money and gifts over our heads. My father and I have no connection. He makes no effort to try and get along or even talk with me. For instance when I told him I applied to grad school all the said was “yea”. Tonight my sister and I both took a mental health quiz and it said we were both suffering with dependent personality disorder. We are so codependent on our parents. Keep in mind I am 22 and my sister is 33. Every thought or action I have is ran through the lens of what my parents would think about it. Neither of us have any self esteem or worth. We are living in the south. A very conservative and redneck part of the south. I am also gay (parents do not support this at all) and stick out like a sore thumb around here because I take pride in how I look. I have a BFA in art from a private school. However, I constantly feel like I am ignorant and viewed as a loser/idiot. My degree is not good enough or valid for other people. Recently I applied to an art graduate program in St Louis. This would be a ticket out of this hell hole for me. However, when I tell people St Louis they tell me I will hate it and should move to New York instead. So now I feel like St Louis is not good enough. However, it is too late to apply to other grad programs due to deadlines passing. Overall I just feel like a total waste and that I am never going to be good enough. Please give me advice...I also apologize in advance over spelling and grammar errors...I wrote this in hurry on my phone."
14,All of a sudden it kind of fell apart?,"I'm a freshman biochemistry major in college who's passion is science, writing, and volunteer work. While I haven't really made many friends here, and miss my best ones who are far away it's been okay. I focused on writing a book idea that was very passionate for me. Spending maybe 4-5 hours a day along with my classes, writing. And having a ton of fun. 
One week I had a bit of a medical incident that was very minor, but kept me from writing for a week. And then it was just bad... I've always had chronic depression and at one point planned to kill myself. But that was in HS and I've learned a lot since then. I've been questioning my religion and choices, college and major, and honestly every time i try to pick up my story i just can't. All of a sudden it kind of fell apart and I don't have any energy anymore. I can barely put up the face i used to. I just can't seem to figure out why I'm so sad. I don't hate myself and I have a mission. But for some reason it just feels not even worth it to get out of bed.
Maybe I'm just adjusting to something or need a break but. That one week off kind of broke me."
15,"Have ADD, getting very frustrated and disheartened with medication. Every time I take a step forward, I take two steps back.","So I have been diagnosed with ADHD-PI (ADD). I am getting really frustrated and disheartened with medication. Feels like every time I make progress, I take another two steps back soon afterwards.

Here's the summary. 

* After **Ritalin failed**, I got switched to Dexamphetamine.
* **Currently titrating on Dexamphetamine.** Been on it for five weeks across various doses in titration.
* The **previous dose** was **not starting to be as effective** as it was prior, so I figured now was the **time to move up.**
* **Bumped up yesterday** and it was great! **Best I've felt on Dex** \- perfect clarity of vision and mind, no tiredness, more motivated, and the happiest I had been in a while. Getting things done that I would never normally do. It's like a subtle compulsion, I see something (dirty room/sink) and WANT to do something about it (clean them.
* Finally felt like I had found what I needed.
* **Today, I kept everything the same.** Same sleep length and quality, same water intake, same meal before the dose, same dose.
* **I didn't get the same positives I had yesterday**. I instead became sleepier and more sluggish - more foggier, less alert, less motivated, and definitely less happy. Don't want to do things as much, avoiding doing things.

Why does this keep happening??? I'm at a loss. Feel like I'm just going around in circles and it's incredibly disheartening.

Any insight or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated."
16,Something Odd Happened Yesterday (Friday),"I was in Group Therapy at Program when we started talking about how people don't take the time to understand a problem (like depression and anxiety) completely and therefore act very ignorantly, which hurts the friend or loved one who is suffering.

I was half-listening (trying to battle a freaking urge at that moment) when my ears pricked up and I caught this part of the conversation. I said ""same thing with my disorder...I get so much ignorance. People think I am just this violent, crazy arsonist who goes around burning buildings and stuff for fun (I burned a rag on the porch of a house but caused no damage at all, and that is the closest I've ever come to burning a structure) but I am really not. I can't stop myself when I need to burn something. It is like an itch that has to be satisfied or I get more and more irritated, restless, angry, and depressed...so I burn and the relief I feel and the pleasure I get are overwhelming and calming.""

To my surprise, I didn't get hate or ignorance. This was the first time I had actively talked in Group about what it is really really like to be me. To my surprise, the therapist said to me, ""You know, you said something to me that really stuck with me. You said 'the only way to relieve the tension and the anxiety is to burn' and that is really interesting to me. I would like to know more about this disorder...""

Wow. Then, again to my surprise, all the other people in the Group started asking me real, honestly interested questions about what I feel when I need to burn and other things like that...and I was flattered and embarrassed at the same time. I answered as best I could and the attention made me feel so wanted and valuable and...dare I say, almost normal. Well, normal in a psychiatric setting. I know I have a problem now. My friends have made me see it and hearing it from a professional hurt me deeply, but also let me feel those feelings and realize that I DO have the potential to be dangerous, but that as long as I am actively going to my Program and the Groups, at least I can start to understand why I am like I am. The prognosis for someone my age with this disorder is abysmal, but I have a tiny glimmer of hope that I am at least accepted for who I am. My family accepts me of course, and even though the Program is just a micro-universe for me, it still feels good to be able to be myself...

My strange, funny (I am the ""class clown"" for real lol), valuable, loved, pyromaniac self. :) I am good with that...at least for now.

&lt;3 Thanks for reading. A positive post for once!"
17,Is it possible to develop a phobia of just shitty people as a whole? Because if so I believe this is happening.,Rawr like a goat
18,I need help but not sure if i am mentally ill or just lazy,"Im very sorry this post is going to get very long but i really hope anyone can stick through it and help me, so i have doubted my mental health for a very long time because when i first told my parents im having difficulties in school and cant pay attention they brushed it off but on my insistence we visited a psychologist and she told me that i need to see a therapist and need medication but i guess my parents didn't care that much because we never went back and i didn't receive therapy and i never bought it up because i was scared , this happened when i was 16 and progressively things got worse i was in grade 11 and i had to get to college but i lost all win to do anything with my life and i stopped caring all together about my grades and i let them slip i failed 11th grade and had to repeat it in another city and when i repeated it i failed again and i failed grade 12 as well. I dont know how to describe my utter lack of will to study i knew alot counted on me passing with good grades but no matter how much i forced myself i could not study or be serious about my studies 2 years after graduating HS i spent in my parents house because i didnt know what to do and now im in university studying biochemistry i thought this was something i am passionate about but i was wrong from the day the first semester started to now i can feel myself getting worse and worse i havent showered in 2 weeks i lay in bed and i feel numb i dont do my assignments and i often think of dying i use social media and fandoms to distract myself and when those distracts arent there i often think about dying my room is a mess and i barely eat unless a meal is made for me i cant even remember the last time i was genuinely happy my grades are very low and im at the risk of being removed from university all this happening and i still cant seem to care i forced myself to but iam so exhausted i cant pay attention in class even when i try very hard and im so so so so tired i dont want to do anything im so tired of life i think i might have ADD and depression can someone please help am i in need of medical help or am i just lazy?"
19,feeling out of it,"hi guys im a long time lurker, first time poster. recently ive been feeling out of it mentally and to cope with it on a normal basis, i always workout in the morning at 5:30am because for some reason making myself suffer keeps it at bay. however, lately it isnt doing much to keep my mind from going to dark places and i know i cant go there because once i start going towards it, i just dive deeper into the dark place. i just got out of a 2 hour cycling session in my gym to hopefully help but the feeling is still there. does anyone have any advice that helped you that might be able to help me? 

Thank you guys!

23,trying to present mental health in a positive light with - HELLO LARRY BARRY,"
Hi everyone,

I wanted to do something more. I'm a mental health nurse. I have seen friends and acquaintances suffer as their family members took their lives and I was also frustrated by how drama (TV and Film) always presents mental health as just Psycho Killers.

I wrote a novel, HELLO LARRY BARRY, it is funny, clever and inspiring. I want the general public to understand and view mental health positively, I want mental health people to be viewed in a balanced light. Magnificent Mental Health. 

I'm trying, going the extra mile, wish me luck.

24,"I have no emotions, i can't even be depressed even tho my life is failing. How can i stop this","I have felt nothing for the last 2 months and now i'm really fucking tired of it, i can have short feelings but only the most basic emotions for a couple of minutes max. I'd rather go back to being suicidal than feelig nothing. What can i do?"
25,How to get myself to go to class consistently?,"I'm a third year university student, diagnosed with depression, anxiety and adhd. I find it really hard to get myself out of the house and go to class. My grades have suffered because of this, and I've had to drop many classes because of it. 

The thought of being in a room full of that many people, or being on campus, seems overwhelming. Sometimes I cant get myself to care enough to go. Or sometimes I get distracted doing something, lose track of time and miss my bus. There's always some sort of mental block- even when I know where my class is, when it is, and I have all my work finished. 

Does anybody have any advice? I have trouble getting myself to leave the house in general too, the only place I feel like I can get myself to go no problem is to work."
26,I have a question on what the fuck happened to me today,"Hi guys, I had a very strange experience that included tactile and visual hallucinations today. So I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder for awhile now. It comes and goes (I was in a psych ward last year for 2 weeks due to this) recently I have been noticing random things. I remeber I was in class when I saw a man walk through the door to the class and I turned and realized nobody was there. Anyways, fast forward to today. I started off feeling extremely and unusually optimistic after a period of isolation and depression. I was laying in my bed listening to youtube, and suddenly felt strange, kind of “off” I guess? I sat down to play some games, but just couldn’t for some reason. I had to go and lay in my bed because I started feeling very off and not right. My heart began pounding extremely hard, my veins in my arm protruded more than normal, and my thoughts became nonsensical, just complete and utter gibberish, and surreal, meaningless thoughts. I began looking at my wall and ceiling and noticing strange faces and patterns, like I could see someone’s face made out in the shape of the texture of the ceiling. I also recently have been having wild thoughts and noticing strange, meaningless patterns in everything that I can come up with in my head, it’s like an ability that I have or something, or I’ll be able to tell how everything is connected (as strange as it sounds), it’s hard to describe but basically I can look at a completely normal mundane item and connect it to another normal mundane item (for example: you look at how your bed has a part where the sheets kind of are bunched up, and I’ll think “oh that’s just kind of like how everyone bunches up their problems together into one giant hill” or some random shit like that.) anywho, I began texting my friend ava and felt sort of “delirious” in a way, like I wasn’t all there as I was typing and was just completely going off of course about how her and I have more insight than those around us because of our illnesses or something, then realized how strange it was halfway through. I kept on noticing things out of the corner of my eyes (my boots seemed to become very long and black as that were sitting there and it scared me) or I would see a black figure out of my tc reflection dart across the road. I was in my room and was completely out of my mind on edge, I felt like something was crawling on me in a way, and every little noise sent me into the air from fear. Then, I look up at my room ceiling, and there is this circle where the ceiling is swirling in a liquid, clockwise motion, but then fades as I look directly at it for a second. I kept on noticing these black dots at the top of my ceiling moving around but they weren’t anything. I was getting paranoid as hell and heard “Brock(my name)” then “what was that?” in a whisper in my room but I figure I just imagined it. I decided to take a shower and I was frequently looking out of my curtains and was looking all around as I felt very wired. My mom turned on a tv show or something in the other room and it sounded completely terrifying, like a woman was talking in a robotic voice through the wall or something. Everything began to feel like it was “false” or how I was realizing just how strange our “existence” is, like I look at the ground and I just think how do we see this, it’s hard to describe. I looked at myself in my mirror and I looked like a different person somewhat, I then had a quick sensation of a bug in my ear (even tho I knew there was no bug), my dog barked outside and it send me jumping into the air gasping because I was in such a strange stare of panic. I sat down and saw a black little animal or something briefly pop up behind a bush across the street but quickly disappear. After sitting down for a bit, I began to calm down. It is not over yet (almost). I was in the car going to an eye appointment, and I saw this weird faint black “circle” that was made up of portions, it was transparent, and the different sections kept on getting sucked into the middle of the circle. It went away and wasn’t a bother, but finally at my eye appointment, they covered up one of my eyes to test it, and my entire vision in that eye because distorted in color and these black lines engulfed my vision but quickly went away, they looked like veins almost.

Sorry for that wall of text, I’m just at a loss. I don’t know what to think of that since it was completely uncommon and I had never seen anything like it before. I feel a shitload better now as I type this (it happened at like noon), so don’t worry about me too much. Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks in advance"
27,"42 years old, and my mother just told me to tell her what meds I am taking.","I don't know why this bothers me so much. I just went to psych yesterday, and they started me on a new med, because I have been having more symptoms than normal. New diagnosis, and my mother did this tonight. She didn't ask, she told me. Then when I was hesitant, she sounded upset. Not single, don't live alone. Hubby is very supportive of my seeking care. I have a primary and a psych doctor monitoring me. I feel like I ATA, because I really feel like this was crossing boundaries. She also said ai should take my meds at a different time than told, to reduce the side effects. Love her dearly, but our relationship can be complicated."
28,What’s wrong with me,"This past year I thought I got “brain fog” due to using roaccutane pills for acne. I completed the whole therapy and I thought the brain fog will go away but it didn’t. I started feeling this way when I started using the pills, like two months in. So i thought it’s gotta be connected to the roaccutane. But I started questioning it.

I started questioning if it even is a brain fog. As the time passes by I feel like I am just going nuts. The feeling I have all the time is just undescribeable. 

I feel like I am not as alive as I was before the therapy. I feel like my emotions are fogged (although I was always introvert, but I did feel everything back then, I just wasn’t showing it)
, like the connections between my friends,family, girlfriend is also fogged. 

Since I had depersonalization and derealization, this feeling kinda reminds me of that but I know it’s not, because I would feel like I’m watching my lif as a movie. 

I have so much to say but so little to worss to explain this chaos in my head.

Sometimes I wonder maybe everyone feels like this, maybe this is how it feels like to grow up and face the real world. (I’m 18, anout to finish high school, and have no idea what to do with life)

I could talk to my best friend and feel as if Im talking to a random guy I just met I feel no connection with him, or anyone.

I honestly don’t know what’s going on inside my head."
29,I hate being disabled,"Sensory Processing Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, PTSD... I just started having an anxiety attack for no reason on my way to a party, and so I had to just go home and chill. I'm still struggling with anxiety for no reason that I can tell, and that's very upsetting. I wish it would stop."
30,I feel like I’m losing myself,"I’m ( 22 F ) severely depressed, and I don’t really know why. It’s to the point where my boyfriend is the only person who brings me happiness ( which I worry about co-dependency). My depression is becoming so bad, that I will randomly “snap” out of nowhere, and go into this horrible cycle of self hate and doubt to the point where I don’t want to exist( not die, just not be here In this moment). I feel that my bf is kinda annoyed at me, because he feels it has something to do with him, or he isn’t making me happy. I just hate my job, college is stressful, and I hate my home life. I’ve become so dependent on him, that I will cry and become so depressed when I have to leave his house. I know I need therapy, but it’s just I have doubts, and am scared to open up. Because I really don’t even know where to pin point my depression"
31,I’m losing my mind,"I hate being alone but I can’t stand to go to sleep, I don’t know what to do. I can hear phantom music in my head as I try to find a new show since my last one just ended. I need someone to talk to, if you could find it in your heart to take up some of my attention so I don’t do something bad, I would love that."
32,Physically sick because of 'deja vu' from dreams,"I have no other way to describe how I feel other than very physically ill and I have no idea what's going on. 

Starting around noon today, I've been getting weird 'deja vu' or flashbacks to dreams (I think) I've had. This then makes my heart feel like it has more pressure and is beating slightly faster, then it moves down to my stomach where I then feel nauseous and lose my appetite. It lasts maybe a minute and a half, and needless today, makes me extremely uncomfortable.

It had happened maybe 6 or 7 times since then and I'm wondering what the heck is happening or how common it is. I am 19F and have depression, anxiety and social anxiety. 

I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, I'm just trying to figure out wtf is happening. Thank you!"
33,How helpful has a diagnosis been to you?,"[heads up, you may have seen this exact post before - i created this alternative account for things mental health related so this is a repost from my main account]


I know there’s something not right with me. It bothers me everyday. Just some of the things I can name are:

•I never feel like my thoughts are my own. It feels like someone is putting them there.

• I feel the need to censor my thoughts and change them and explain them in my head, so that people don’t judge me for them

• It feels like everyone is listening in on my thoughts and I live in constant fear of thinking the wrong thing and being mocked and ridiculed as a result

• I constantly have to cancel plans with friends because I’m in a dark spot but I don’t want to unload my problems on to them so I say “I’m tired” and sound like I don’t want to be around them

• It’s really difficult to understand the world around me. I can’t comprehend how other people so seamlessly can tell what their peers are thinking, and make a spontaneous, yet appropriate response. I have to think incredibly hard about everything I say and do, and this often results in inexplicable, painfully long periods of awkward silence between me and others, even some of my own friends.

• People tend to assume there isn’t much to me, when in reality I have lots to say, I just don’t understand how to express it.

• The only way I’m able to truly express myself is through my art.

• I live with constant paranoia that everyone is after me.

• When I was 13, I began to self harm to deal with my issues, and now have to live with scarred arms which I dread to have to explain to anyone. It also becomes extremely easy when I’m in a significantly rough patch to fall back into those kinds of habits.

• I live a lot of my life in complete numbness. I only long to feel real, full emotions, rather than faking them for the sole purpose of fitting in.

• Insomnia. This is a big one. It’s rare for me to get a normal amount of sleep. I’m forced to tell everyone I’m just tired “because school” and “I’m not sad, just didn’t get much sleep last night” when inside all I want is to finally be able to relax again.

Most if not all of these bother me EVERY DAY and constantly drive me over the edge, yet I’m terrified of telling my parents. They already found out that I tried to hide my first suicide attempt from them so I promised to tell them if I ever feel that low again. So now if I tell them about everything that’s going on I’m scared that they won’t be able to trust me anymore since I hid this all for so long. Since I haven’t been able to tell them I haven’t been able to go to a professional and get a diagnosis. I’ve been debating whether I should open up to them for a very long time despite all the seemingly detrimental cons (loss of trust, fearing that I would get anxious, freak out, and start lying while trying to explain everything to them, etc.) but what doesn’t help making this decision is that I don’t have any first hand accounts of how helpful getting a real diagnosis has been to other people. So if you’re comfortable, would any of you guys mind telling me how your diagnosis process went, and how helpful it was? (e.g. were you able to get the correct treatment following the diagnosis, did having a definitive diagnosis to explain your symptoms help you cope with them, did finally opening up to someone feel as freeing as you imagined it to be, etc.)"
34,I feel like committing suicide soon,I’m an 18 year old girl and every time I get rejected from a guy I feel the pain intensify. I just want to kill my self. How do I stop taking rejection so personally and poorly? I have a huge fear that no one will ever love me
35,I think I might have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and I need opinions...,"So I think I might have BPD and I need opinions...

I don’t want to self diagnose myself or anything, but recently I’ve become increasingly aware that I may have BPD. I seem to be very good at hiding it, and I only allow the symptoms to come out when I’m alone mostly. Here are my symptoms:

-sometimes feel suicidal
-sometimes feel chronically empty 
-sometimes I get very angered by small things, and not angered by big things that I SHOULD be angry about
-I have had many romantic relationships and all of them have been unstable
-I seem to have a distorted sense of who I really am


Those are all the symptoms I have that relate to BPD, I don’t seem to have a fear of abandonment and I don’t think I have paranoia. I also do not have impulsive behaviours with drugs, gambling etc. I would say I’m impulsive in my relationships with others, but that’s it. Apparently people with BPD don’t experience empathy as much (according to the internet), but I am highly empathic. So, with all this said, do you guys think this is BPD or something else..? Please leave detailed answers with facts because I really need answers here. Feel free to ask questions too"
36,Went to a movie alone!!! (update),"Hey guys, I made a post on this sub recently about how I wanted to go watch a movie by myself for once and how I felt really anxious about doing so, because I didn’t want to seem weird or lame. But I was also doing so because I wanted to get out of another event (my other recent post).

Anyways, I did it! Feel free to not read all of this if it gets too long. But basically I went and at first I was the only one in the theatre. But that’s because I got there a little early. Then it started to fill up. In my theatre there were a lot of people in pairs so at first I felt a little weird but I tried to brush this off and tell myself that literally no one cares. 

When it ended and I was leaving, I was back to feeling a little weird again just because I thought people could be paying attention to me since I was leaving by myself. But this feeling passed and it’s probably normal? It’s okay to feel uncomfortable at first and I don’t regret doing it at all.

But when the lights went down and the movie started, I started to feel really good. I was able to enjoy myself and I wasn’t really thinking about what other people have on their minds. I’m sure as fuck they could care less about me. It was such an uncomfortable but good experience and I’m so glad I did it. I know now I want to do it again in the future whenever I can’t make plans with anyone else. 

Thank you to all of you who encouraged me! It might sound dumb but I have done everything independently except see a movie. And now I know I’ll feel less and less weird about it as I do it in the future."
37,I feel emotionally numb.,"Maybe this isn’t the correct word, and please tell me what you think. Lately I’ve just felt uninterested in things I once liked. It feels like nothing matters because who cares, I have no real attachment to things anymore. Like when I see an attractive woman I’m like eh who cares, I feel nothing. When I think about sex I feel uninterested and I feel I lost that passion I once had. Just life in general I’ve lost that spark, I feel not happy but not sad. It’s hard to describe. Maybe it’s not called emotional numbness, maybe it’s something else entirely, but I wanted to put it out there to see if others have experienced something similar? How did you get back a feeling of emotion again. And then I think, this is the reason no one likes me. Why people talk to me, then ignore me. I just feel alone, lost, and numb. 😞"
38,"Hi, I (17F) need a little help?","So for the past couple of months, I have not been in the best state of mind. 2019 was the worst year for me. And with everything that has been going on I have started to feel extremely worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been experiencing what I can best describe as panic attacks, very frequently too. I know that my anxiety is through the roof, and mixed with my already very short span of attention, is hindering me from performing well in school. I can barely sit for 15 minutes with my books when I get distracted with what is going on in my mind. I can't talk this out with my friends because I can't tell them some of the stuff, and I've started feeling very lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate it if anyone can suggest any tips to curb my anxiety. I tried looking it up but most of them, like deep breathing, don't work for me. Also, I did ask my mother to join therapy, but she says anything I have to work out I can discuss with her and that i'm 'too smart' to need someone else to tell me what to do. My parents are of the mindset that mental illness is 'all in your head' and that I need to snap out of it.

I just want to know how I can stop this and not let what others say or think about me affect me to this extent."
39,Looking for Advice,"I'm starting a nonprofit for mental health &amp; as most people on here probably know..people just simply don't care about mental health. My view of it is people only care after tragedy occurs (a suicide, a violent act, a death etc something along those lines.) with my project I would like to introduce the methods and outlets that I've found to people Before things get to those dark points. I struggle with mental health day to day, I've been in behavioral hospitals, I've gone to therapy and on my own I've found outlets that I never learned about in those places and that's why I'm starting a nonprofit. It's in the early stages and I'm trying to find partners to help with launching it etc, but again no one cares about this topic. So if anyone has any ideas on how I could launch this and maybe get some help with that side of things I would love to hear them!

41,My parents fight a lot and I don’t know what to do about,"So my parents do not get along at all. They fight over everything and always have and never resolve anything. I intervened to calm them and get them to stop fighting  but it doesn’t work. Even if I talk to about it later it still doesn’t work. before my sister I as a 10 year old, told them not to do this shit after my sister was  born because I don’t want her to go through the intense trauma I went through but they didn’t listen. I now try not to intervene at all but my little sister watches them and does the same thing I did, intervene. The only difference is that she gets mad at them like really mad. I have already suggested them to seek therapy or get a divorce but they just don’t do it. I can’t even talk to counsellors at my school about it because I feel like no one should the family problems. I just can’t seem to accept the idea that someone else should know these problems mainly because that’s the way I’ve been raised. I don’t want my little sister to suffer too mad I don’t know what to do!"
42,I can’t feel the things I’m touching.,"I had a super bad dream last night that must have messed with my psyche, because when I woke up after a night of nausea, on and off sleep, and an overall unwell mental feeling. My level of dissociation skyrocketed and I felt like I was still sleeping. My head vibrated and mumbled, my hands shook, I felt drunk almost. I haven’t felt like that since highschool when my mental health was at its worst. I felt like this almost every day.

A new thing was this “loss” of feeling. I couldn’t feel my toast in my hands, or chewing it. Technically I could, but it was a faded feeling. It made me drop my toast a few times, or struggle to get it in my mouth. 

Should I see a doctor? Should I be concerned.? feel a bit better now that I’m home from work and I’ve taken my meds. I don’t know what to think."
43,"Adolescence, anxiety, and alcohol","Hi reddit. I [16M] would like to start by saying that I’m not in danger of becoming an alcoholic, not immediately. I’ve come close before and I’m doing better now. 

I’ve never been diagnosed (I know how that sounds, but I’ve done my research) and I exhibit a lot of symptoms of social anxiety disorder, which are obviously mitigated when I drink (it took me a few to even be able to write this, where I’m anonymous). I’ve noticed that that confidence leads to success with friends, girls, family and the like, makes me more motivated to create and consume art, allows me to order from chipotle, and overall makes me a legitimately happier and more proactive person. I feel more in control of my life despite having less control of my motor function.

But, obviously, I don’t want to rely on alcohol to escape in this way. I have trouble internalizing my drunk self’s knowledge that people really don’t care and that their judgement is irrelevant. I’ve tried therapy once before and maybe all this is just me trying to avoid finding another therapist, but I really didn’t like it. I don’t know how appropriate this is for the sub but I guess I’m just wondering if anybody’s been in a similar situation and has some advice. 

TL;DR  I feel deeply relieved from my anxiety when I drink but don’t want to become reliant on it so I’m looking for advice."
44,Why do I feel sad when I share my sadness to someone?,"I've never shared my feelings with anyone. When I did it for the first time, i started speaking about everything from the beginning.

I have adhd I’ve been through almost all of the pills, Concerta, Adderall, Intuniv, Strattera, Focalin, and currently I’m trying Vyvanse (Lowest Dose) again since the first time in 6th grade (I’m 18 now) hoping to see maybe a difference in the pill to help me focus, relax and sit still. But with all this stimulants I notice the same thing, yeah my focus goes up but it’s a constant anxious feeling within me. With non-stimulants I find myself to be really tired or burnt out and just more emotionally sad and I feel it makes my mild depression a little worse. I have to constantly be alone or leave groups of people just so I can have the time to bring me self back down again. My hands have been sweaty for as long as I can remember due to this nervousness. And i’m just looking for someone with advice, little tricks and tips to calm down. Just ways to cope with this nervousness and help me with my ADHD. (rp)

Any help really is appreciated 🤍"
47,What could I be experiencing?,"Hello all,

I'm speaking with doctors but I also wanted to get a community perspective on what the hell I'm experiencing. I just haven't been able to figure it out. Basic facts:

\- From the period of February to December I experimented with these nootropic supplements: krill oil, l-theanine, alpha brain, piracetam, CBD oil, CVS Cognizin citicoline, Nootropics Depot Cognizin citicoline, l-tyrosine. However, from February to September I rarely used any of it. It was only from September to December that I did, and the only two things I used regularly were CBD oil (5-10 mg before bed) and both brands (interchangeably) of Cognizin citicoline (250-500 mg). I at first thought they were helping but later felt like I wasn't quite myself with them in my system. So in December I went off all of it cold turkey and haven't used any of it since. 

\- I afterwards still didn't feel quite like myself, couldn't see the world the same, and had pervasive memory loss. My phenomenological tint had changed and I often obsessed over whether or not I was ""looking at the world through a stranger's eyes"". \~90% of my memories were lost and still are gone. 

\- I've been trying to manage as best I can and some days are better than others, but I'm constantly trying to recover my memories and sense of self, with little success. 

\- Reality during the day takes on a gray tint, feeling empty and decontextualized. I don't have the beautiful and sublime encounters and understandings of the past to orient me. I also am more pessimistic about the future. I used to perceive myself within a complex and variety-laden continuum linking past to future. Now every day feels like my first and last day on earth. There is no past, there is no future, there is only this insipid moment.

\- At night often, reality shifts from feeling empty and textureless to feeling sinister and angular. I feel like something is pressing up against me (not physically, but psychologically) and have the urge to jump out of my skin. I often have to drink wine and put myself to bed because it's all closing in on me, this suffocating and oppressive vibe. The best way I can describe it is that reality is too 'sharp' to inhabit comfortably. Simply sitting around and being alive, with nothing else going wrong, makes me uneasy. 

I'd like anyone who might understand what I'm talking about to give any perspective that they're willing and able to. If you can only comment on one of the things below, I'd rather you comment than not. Of: 

1. This memory loss (not being able to mentally relive most of the moments I've had) 
2. This identity loss (feeling like I've died in my own body) 
3. This phenomenological shift (not feeling like my consciousness/observer's lens has the same tint) 
4. This perspective shift (not being able to see what I saw before within my physical surroundings and mental landscape) 
5. The ""empty feeling"" in the air most of the time 
6. The ""sharp-seeming reality"" that I have to inhabit sometimes, often at night

Have you experienced something similar before? What do you think it is? What do you think caused it? And would you predict that it'll be permanent? 

I'm especially interested in knowing what #6 is about. My mom has schizophrenia and I'm awfully worried that I could've triggered psychosis with the CBD. Does what I described seem like psychosis, or rather something else?"
48,Anxiety about sleeping,I don’t like waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night. When I sleep at night I see life progressing in the day. I have anxiety when I go to bed because I know another day is coming. I stay up late even when I’m tired and want to sleep. When I sleep during the day it just feels better.
49,Night Terrors,"So for past 6 days Ive been having these crazy, realistic nightmares. They have all included somebody I've cared about being taken hostage/killed and there being nothing I can do about it. This has greatly affected my sleep and thoughts throughout the day. The most recent dream I've had was an old friend of mine killing her own sister and being sentenced to life. I haven't been able to stop worrying about not only her but everyone else. I've felt paranoid that I will lose someone in the near future in a similar way and I don't know how to stop it."
50,Humans aren't designed to be happy. So stop trying.,"This article is so true. So sick of society trying to sell us shit with the promise it will bring the happiness we are ""meant"" to be feeling.

https://bit.ly/32wNsWS

""A huge happiness and positive thinking industry, estimated to be worth US$11 billion a year, has helped to create the fantasy that happiness is a realistic goal. Chasing the happiness dream is a very American concept, exported to the rest of the world through popular culture. Indeed, “the pursuit of happiness” is one of the US’s “unalienable rights”. Unfortunately, this has helped to create an expectation that real life stubbornly refuses to deliver.
Because even when all our material and biological needs are satisfied, a state of sustained happiness will still remain a theoretical and elusive goal, as Abd-al-Rahman III, Caliph of Córdoba in the tenth century, discovered. He was one of the most powerful men of his time, who enjoyed military and cultural achievements, as well as the earthly pleasures of his two harems. Towards the end of his life, however, he decided to count the exact number of days during which he had felt happy. They amounted to precisely 14.
Happiness, as the Brazilian poet Vinicius de Moraes put it, is “like a feather flying in the air. It flies light, but not for very long.” Happiness is a human construct, an abstract idea with no equivalent in actual human experience. Positive and negative affects do reside in the brain, but sustained happiness has no biological basis. And – perhaps surprisingly – I reckon this is something to be happy about.

Nature and evolution

Humans are not designed to be happy, or even content. Instead, we are designed primarily to survive and reproduce, like every other creature in the natural world. A state of contentment is discouraged by nature because it would lower our guard against possible threats to our survival.
The fact that evolution has prioritised the development of a big frontal lobe in our brain (which gives us excellent executive and analytical abilities) over a natural ability to be happy, tells us a lot about nature’s priorities. Different geographical locations and circuits in the brain are each associated with certain neurological and intellectual functions, but happiness, being a mere construct with no neurological basis, cannot be found in the brain tissue.
In fact, experts in this field argue that nature’s failure to weed out depression in the evolutionary process (despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of survival and reproduction) is due precisely to the fact that depression as an adaptation plays a useful role in times of adversity, by helping the depressed individual disengage from risky and hopeless situations in which he or she cannot win. Depressive ruminations can also have a problem solving function during difficult times.
￼Where is happiness located? Gutenberg Encyclopedia, CC BY-SA

Morality

The current global happiness industry has some of its roots in Christian morality codes, many of which will tell us that there is a moral reason for any unhappiness we may experience. This, they will often say, is due to our own moral shortcomings, selfishness and materialism. They preach a state of virtuous psychological balance through renunciation, detachment and holding back desire.
In fact, these strategies merely try to find a remedy for our innate inability to enjoy life consistently, so we should take comfort in the knowledge that unhappiness is not really our fault. It is the fault of our natural design. It is in our blueprint.
Advocates of a morally correct path to happiness also disapprove of taking shortcuts to pleasure with the help of psychotropic drugs. George Bernard Shaw said: “We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it.” Well-being apparently needs to be earned, which proves that it is not a natural state.
The inhabitants of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World live perfectly happy lives with the help of “soma”, the drug that keeps them docile but content. In his novel, Huxley implies that a free human being must inevitably be tormented by difficult emotions. Given the choice between emotional torment and content placidity, I suspect many would prefer the latter.
But “soma” doesn’t exist, so the problem isn’t that accessing reliable and consistent satisfaction by chemical means is illicit; rather that it’s impossible. Chemicals alter the mind (which can be a good thing sometimes), but since happiness is not related to a particular functional brain pattern, we cannot replicate it chemically.

Happy and unhappy

Our emotions are mixed and impure, messy, tangled and at times contradictory, like everything else in our lives. Research has shown that positive and negative emotions and affects can coexist in the brain relatively independently of each other. This model shows that the right hemisphere processes negative emotions preferentially, whereas positive emotions are dealt with by the left-sided brain.
It’s worth remembering, then, that we are not designed to be consistently happy. Instead, we are designed to survive and reproduce. These are difficult tasks, so we are meant to struggle and strive, seek gratification and safety, fight off threats and avoid pain. The model of competing emotions offered by coexisting pleasure and pain fits our reality much better than the unachievable bliss that the happiness industry is trying to sell us. In fact, pretending that any degree of pain is abnormal or pathological will only foster feelings of inadequacy and frustration.
Postulating that there is no such thing as happiness may appear to be a purely negative message, but the silver lining, the consolation, is the knowledge that dissatisfaction is not a personal failure. If you are unhappy at times, this is not a shortcoming that demands urgent repair, as the happiness gurus would have it. Far from it. This fluctuation is, in fact, what makes you human."""
51,I recently discovered I may be suffering from bipolar disorder.,"
Male, 29
I'm mostly here to ask advise on how to seek out a diagnosis and for any advice on how to cope with the crazy ass symptoms you can experience.

 I recently went through allot of crazy stress and feel like the symptoms I experience have become worse. 

From massive loss of sleep to suicidal thoughts and feeling of helplessness.  Through to exercising like crazy and being super focussed and feeling great! it's a weird ass rollercoaster and things seem to be getting worse over time. I've had some close and amazing friends reach out to me and basically told me I might need help. How have you coped with it? Or how have you helped someone else suffering?

Thanks in advance!"

54,I don’t know what to do anymore..,I’ve been struggling with my mental health lately and it just feels like it’s not progressing anywhere good. My school was supposed to be sorting me out someone to talk to but they’ve done nothing and it’s not helping. I’m anxious in a lot of my lessons and much more before i go to school in the mornings. Suicide has crossed my mind a few times recently but I know I can’t act on those thoughts. I just want all of the pain to go away but I don’t know how anymore.
55,Poll to accurately describe mental illness in a novel,"I’m made this google forum because I have this idea for a novel about mental illness. I really need it to show how different people act even if they have the same mental disorder. It basically follows a group of friends with mental illness and how they cope with it. Since I only experience my own mental illness I should probably know how other people experience theirs. The goal is to help people suffering with mental illness to live with their illnesses the best way that they can. I’m not sure if this is or isn’t a terrible idea.

56,Is it cruel to resuscitate someone after suicide?,"Disclaimer: this whole ordeal triggered my anxiety and I feel extremely weird right now, so my grammar might be off.

I work in a level one trauma center. Today we had a transfer from a smaller sister hospital. 34 y/o male found hanging from a noose in his basement. I don’t know who found him, but he was brought via EMS while sedated/intubated. He had abrasions all around his neck and just looked horrible. After his CT scans/xrays, he woke up and started screaming, but not because of physical pain. Just this horrible scream that I’ve heard from too many people who attempted suicide but weren’t successful. I’ve heard numerous stories from people who attempted suicide and were so grateful that they had a second chance at life, but then there are people who will keep trying until they succeed. I felt like I was being cruel by doing my job to keep him alive because he was clearly suffering, and who am I to force him to live if he doesn’t want to?

I’ve helped resuscitate multiple suicide attempts. The looks on their faces when they realize what is going on is terrifying. I don’t want to inflict pain on someone who is already suffering, but at the same time I want them to have a chance to get better. Still, the screams are so much different than the screams of people who are in physical pain and it honestly haunts me. 

Do you think it’s cruel/out of line for healthcare workers to “bring someone back” after a suicide attempt?"
57,"Not exactly hallucinations, but what are they?","Hi Reddit,

TLDR; I see monsters and don't fucking know why.

I know I shouldn't get a diagnosis online, and I don't expect one, but I'm wondering if you or anyone you've met has experienced something similar? 

Basically, I've seen ""monsters"" since about high school.  I'm in my mid twenties now.  They're usually the same ones, about 5-6 of them. Always based on some sort of memory. For example, one is very similar to the dementors in Harry Potter. That one in particular will hover over me in bed. They're not COMPLETELY there. It's hard to explain, but I never think they're real. (So for that reason I don't think I'm schizophrenic, because no part of it feels real)  They're fleeting, kind of like a projection that I can't directly look at.  They don't touch me. I don't feel them, but you can imagine how terrifying it can be at times.  At my worst, I used to see them everyday. Nowadays it's only if I lack sleep or become very stressed that I get extremely paranoid of them.   My best comparison would be how you feel after you watch a scary movie? Just extreme paranoia of the paranormal. I avoided scary movies for a long time because I didn't want to trigger another ""Monster"" to be created in my head.   Most days i just dealt with it, ignored them. They didn't really freak me out unless it was at night and I was alone. If it was day light and I was in public, I could still see them but I wasn't too bothered. The more distracted I am, the less likely I am to see them. 

I have tried to see a therapist/psychiatrist once on campus, but he was very dismissive and basically just said ""well, why are you scared if you know they can't hurt you?""  So I gave up on that a long time ago.

Thanks Reddit :)

Have you met anyone who has experienced anything similar? Did they ever get a diagnosis?"
58,23F never been intimate,"Don’t know how to write this cause I’ve never told anybody this cause I’m so ashamed but the stress, anxiety and depression is really getting to me so hope someone can give me advice.

So I’m a 23y old girl and I’ve never had sex or even kissed a guy. I’ve always been a really shy and really insecure person so when everyone else started experimenting I was and still am unfortunately too shy to kiss a guy because I don’t know how to kiss or how to have sex (sounds stupid ik). I’m just so embarrassed because I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to explain it but when someone gets close to me physically ór emotionally I freak out.
I’ve struggled with this a lot and thought I might be gay or a-sexual but the thing is I do want to but am too scared, shy, embarrassed, unexperienced whatever.
The thing is I’m not really an ugly girl so I get stopped on the street or guys asking for my number quite regularly. So that’s even more embarrassing cause people see I get attention but I don’t do anything with it.

There is this guy I’m in love with and I’ve pushed him away because of that reason. He was into me but I pretended I wasn’t. I’m so lost right now cause all I want is to be with this guy but I can’t because I have some mental blockade and I don’t know how to get over it.

It’s even so bad that I ‘escaped’ my life and have been traveling for a year thought things would change. It’s been over a year now and i have to come back but I’m just too afraid to come back because people are going to ask about boyfriends and because I have to leave this guy on the other side of the world.

Even writing this is so hard for me because I always just close my eyes for problems but I can’t anymore right now. 

Thanks if you read all this I appreciate it!"
59,Life expectations - feeling hopeless,"I don't really know how to express my feelings, I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say (English is not my first language)

So, I'll be 30 in two days and I am not excited as other people might be. I'm struggling with depression, I don't have a job, I'm living in my father's house again and, to be honest, I have no willing to live. My birthday gives me anxiety, because I never thought I was going to be like this at the age of 30. When I was a child I used to think that I was going to be successful, that I was going to be settled but the reality is so different... People say it is just a number, and I know it, but the only thing I can see is my failure. Nothing motivates me, I mean, I need money, I need to get out of this house, but every time I look for jobs it seems that I won't be capable of doing even the easiest thing. And I really want to do it, but the only thing I see in the future is me laying in the couch. I feel hopeless and stupid to think about me this way. I'm currently seeing a therapist, clearly not doing any difference. I have suicidal thoughts every day but I haven't done anything yet. I just feel like people doesn't understand what is like to feel this way so they just think that I am lazy or seeking for attention, which is crazy because all I want to do is disappear. Last time a told my mom that I think I need antidepressants she implied that I am an addict (last time I took those pills was a year ago). Right now I can't see a psychiatrist because is too expensive so I am in a vicious cycle.
I am writing this right now because I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about it, I just wanted to get this off my chest, but if you guys have some advice it would be great for me to read it. Thanks in advance."
60,Help with sorting my emotions,"I've had a hard time recently because my crush wasn't interested in me. For me, it's been on the rare occasion I feel a special connection with a girl so I have little experience with dating. My last relationship was 3 years ago and it's kind of taken its toll on me. It's nothing wrong with me (I think), I consider myself an all around good person. It just hurts me on the days when I need a hug or someone to talk too.

Any advice in how to feel better?"
61,I don’t know what problem I have.,I don’t really know what I have. Everyday I get this intense feeling of deep loneliness sadness that makes my chest tighten and makes a heavy feeling in my heart. For some reason I feel like no one likes me but rather I feel like they only tolerate me. Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I didn’t exist and how happy people would be if I’m not around. I don’t wanna exist but I don’t want to die.
62,Am I faking?,"First time poster, sorry if this has been addressed before. Sometimes I worry that I’m faking my mental illness. I feel like I don’t have a good reason for being the way I am (no real trauma). But counseling and medication have really helped me, so maybe I really do have a problem?"
63,"Girlfriend with suicidal thoughts, unable to relate or know how to help. What can I do to help and be a more mentally supportive partner?","Hey r/mentalhealth, 

I will start without getting too deep into the situational aspects, I have a long distance girlfriend who is having some suicidal thoughts and battling bouts of what seems like some deep rooted depression. 

I have made the mistake of being considerably ignorant to these issues, either getting irritated, arguing, asking her to simply stop these issues and all but being 100% supportive mentally through this process. This is not a lack of care, for I love her deeply, but I have never battled depression or had the single instance of suicidal thoughts ever enter my mind. 

When these issues spring up, panic attacks and she starts to overwhelm herself with these feelings I do not know how to support or talk her through the issues, and not knowing and I do what I can, it usually resorts in an argument with both of us more steamed and her feeling all the worse as a result. 

What frustrates me most is that I have no idea what to do, how to be the number one support she needs without her being left by herself. 

She doesn’t have friends to reach out that she is comfortable speaking to about these issues and the family is a bit distant. 

I wanted to reach out to mental health and see what solutions, processes, guides, all in all everything supportive tips I can use to help my girlfriend through these issues and hopefully within time, help her out of this condition (if possible, with all prayers in order) 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you."
64,Magna Cum Laude Graduate -top 10% School Help,"I have been depressed since high school, attempted to be placed on several SSRI medications with no avail, between junior and senior year of high school I had not experienced immense depression, but still experienced anxiety. Throughout my initial college years before I transferred to my ivy league institution I experienced the typical depressive period with anxiety mixed in throughout. However, now that I am 22, I experience anxiety every single day, anxiety attacks which hurt me to my core. I fidget, I hyperventilate, sweat, look around at everyone, shake my legs immensely, and feel like my heart will explode. My depressive issues have been intense, but I dont feel suicidal.... i just feel immense anxiety and depressed as that my anxiety negatively effects me. My parents did not see how my anxiety could effect me and thus I cannot see a psych without their OK since im on their insurance. I have been suffering quietly and its been hurting me, I have terrible sleep, depression (which has been diagnosed previously), and anxiety (i only get 12 .5 xanax tablets a month). My parents dont undetstand what I am feeling, I know i am not severe, but I want to know if i should truly seek a psychiatrist and a therapist for how I feel. I want to know that going behind my parents backs will be worth it, their negative perspective behind things has made me shy away from talking to them."
65,What are the signs of arrested development?,
66,Rapid Mood Swings for no Apparent Reason,"18F, no prior history of mental health issues. I have troubles identifying what I’m feeling sometimes and I generally don’t have much empathy so I’ll try my best to explain what’s been going on. 
The past week I have been having some big mood swings; I’ve been very happy one moment, and it could be five minutes later and I am feeling very tired and depressed, or angry. To give some context, here’s what my week has generally been like. 

I’m a grade 12 student who’s taking some IB courses so i’m naturally stressed all the time (I also tend to be quite high strung), and I had a busy week with some tests and extracurriculars. I was extra stressed as I was waiting to hear back from one of my universities for early admissions. All this being said, I didn’t feel like I was any more overwhelmed than usual. 

I’ve noted that I usually hit the “lows” when i’m not focusing on any tasks and i’m left alone with my thoughts. I also found myself zoning out more and feeling very energetic one second, and then absolutely exhausted the next. I think I also experienced some anxiety that came out of nowhere. I hit a crazy high after finishing a moderately stressful task, and then went to a party with my peers where I did not drink but was extremely talkative and excited as though I were drunk (I’m usually pretty introverted). I hit these highs maybe two or three times a month, lasting about 30 minutes each time, but they generally just result in me being more talkative and aloof than usually. 

I did some research on bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and I don’t feel certain that either of those are what I’m experiencing. My mood swings feel too frequent to be BD, and I don’t have the impulsiveness and other symptoms associated with BPD. I have spoken to a few close friends about this, some who do deal with mental health issues, and they think that I’m likely just going through a typical rough teenager patch, but I feel like it might be something more. 

Today was the first day I was mostly stable- I worked out early in the morning which I think may have played a role, and I was generally quite pleasant all day, with the exception of two little lapses of sadness and a bit of random anxiety around midday. 

I’m not great at talking about emotions and I’m kind of known for being kind of emotionless, so if anyone could help me out, that would be great :)"
67,"[14f]I self harm, though I am not depressed im pretty sure","I have a long history of self harm, I am currently 14 and female. I go back to maybe 10-11? Where I'd cut on my wrists. Don't remember the reason though. Last year I self harmed, quite a bit and missed a lot of P.E despite being my favourite subject. I was going through a rough patch and felt so painfully numb, so it made me feel. In the end now, self harm doesnt hurt me. Cutting myself doesnt even make me feel anything anymore. I feel numb to it because im so used to the pain. Right now, nothing bad is happening apart from feeling useless, and having a friend die a while ago. I sometimes bite off skin near my knuckles, and it feels more like a stim then anything else? I like the power of being able to harm myself, and inflict pain to my own degree. I like being in control because no one else ever takes me seriously. I don't flaunt my scars, i do everything to hide them. What can i describe this phenomenon as?"
68,it’s always the little things...,"As a junior in Highschool, things are becoming overwhelming and reality is starting to hit, leaving me with the feeling of being lost. If there is anything I’ve noticed change in myself, it’s feeling melancholy every single day. I have two loving parents, two supportive siblings and a roof over my head so I can’t seem to understand what could be this underlying issue. I don’t want to go far enough to say that I have depression, but that’s a possibility. And as a child of immigrants, depression is out of the question. Even though my mom is a nurse, as mother I am sure she wouldn’t want to believe her own child has depression. But once again, I still don’t think that’s the case. Let me explain a series of issue that has been bothering me lately and even though these are small matters that will pass one day, they make me feel like absolute shit. 

Growing up in a Buddhist household, I was naturally altruistic. All my friends would always praise me for being so lenient (saying ‘no’ was also scary for me especially because of my anxiety). However, this year I became afraid of being taken advantage of (ex: giving people my homework answers or just saying yes to favors in general), so I became a little more stern in saying ‘no’ in the most polite way possible. All of a sudden, I feel like a villain for saying ‘no’. It’s also as if my ‘friends’ try to guilt trip me for not agreeing and it makes me feel like a punching bag. Along with this, we would all joke around about each other but, when it comes to me, all their jokes have some sense of seriousness to it. I know I could easily just make new friends as someone who is a little more on the well-known side, but everyone already has their set cliques and I want to have nothing to do with that. I can only stand one girl out of my friends and one of my good friends does pseo so I rarely see her :/ The rest of them are just boy hungry and I’m just trying to focus on my academics and get out. This all sounds like a typical Highschool issue, but it really affects me on the daily in a way that I’d never imagine. It feels like I don’t have a sense of place, no one appreciates me, and I am never taken serious. I genuinely do not want to be a burden to people by generating negative energy at school, but that’s all I feel in the inside. It just confuses me when people say they only see me ever smiling and laughing. I’m in a place of confusion where I don’t know what emotions I am feeling. I’m sorry this all sounds so disorganized and maybe a little dumb, but I just need help understanding why I am feeling this way. Feel free to ask questions, I’m more than happy to clarify."
69,TRYING TO SOCIALIZE,"This is weird. I went to a church event recently. There were so many strangers around me, I felt so lonely. I mean there were people who I know, but I don't talk to them. I didn't know how to survive this program that was seven hours long. Seven hours of staying lonely. Yes, I should have done something, like trying to make an effort to talk. But I couldn't. I felt it was very awkward to do that.  Yes, I'm an introvert too, which made it miserable for me. Though I enjoyed the event, I was deeply disturbed on how I'm
becoming numb. Especially during events that have more people. I'm not sad, but I'm helpless. Should I work on it or just be the way it is? I don't want to feel that negative energy again. At times, my mind was like GO HOME, YOU DON'T BELONG here. But I didn't do that. I realized I would be a coward doing that. Damn, how these people so hyperactive. Ugh."
70,Should I just not talk,I seem to fuck up myself every time. Pretty sure I am that messed up.
71,I hate myself and I don’t know why,"I don’t know why but I just hate myself that’s all there is to it. And I have a sneaking suspicion that everyone else I know hates me. My “friends” there nice to me when I’m around them but I just feel like they’re just being polite or something really just hate me as much as I hate me. I don’t know if it’s paranoia or something but I just feel like they probably talk shit behind my back but I don’t know I don’t have no evidence or nothing it’s just a gut feeling. They’ve said things like “Matt we love you ” but I just feel like they’re being fake or trying to manipulate me or something. I just feel like I’m not a good person. I don’t talk about this kind of stuff with people even online I’ve never opened myself this way. I try to live a healthy lifestyle you know I eat healthy and working out lifting weights is pretty much all I live for. It’s pathetic the one thing keeping myself from just ending it is lifting and the prospect of getting gains and getting strong. Outside of that I just hate life and I hate myself. It makes me so angry too I just get bouts of anger where I just lose control of myself. On top of that I think I’m starting to become an alcoholic and I’ve developed a full on nicotine addiction. Drinking and smoking is the one thing besides lifting is the only thing that really numbs the pain, those little moments where I just feel numbed are really just the only thing (again besides lifting) that keeps me going it really goes a long way because in those little moments of bliss just lets me forget about this huge burden I carry. Everyday just feels painful to me. I can’t even look myself in the mirror any more. I’m a pathetic monster. I don’t want to talk about it to anyone because as I’ve mentioned I suspect that my friends secretly hate me too so that makes it hard for me to open up like that, plus I just feel like it would be a burden to them. I’m just too nervous to talk about it. I feel like no one really cares about me and I don’t blame them because I don’t care about be neither. I just don’t know what to do, I despise myself the man I see in the mirror is pathetic and weak. It’s a huge burden I carry and it’s starting to interfere greatly with my life. It’s painful to me it hurts that I hate myself so much but I don’t know what to do about it I feel like I’ve reached a dead end. If it wasn’t for my passion for weight lifting I would’ve killed myself by now I really would’ve. Even then I still think about it but it’s just a thought I entertain, no actual urges to do it. If I died I feel like it wouldn’t affect anyone like they might talk about it for a day at best but they probably wouldn’t care, don’t blame them neither. I don’t know what to do, I guess I just have to wait until I die to be relieved of this pain, death must be such a relief especially for an individual such as myself, not a care in the world. I don’t even know why I hate myself so much I mean my so called “friends” say they like me sure but those are just words, and words are useless. I can just have this gut feeling that they secretly hate me. Life just feels so cold and empty to me. What do I do? Nothing that’s the answer fuckin live with it I guess. 

Tldr: I hate myself, everyone else probably hates me, no one cares about me, I’m angry about it and I can’t talk about it because the only people I can talk about it with are the people who probably hate me."

73,Covid 19 and mental health facilities,"I just visited a mental health facility in Kirkland, WA very close to the most recent outbreak. All staff and visitors were asked to wear face masks. None of the patients were given them because the metal in the nose piece is contraband. 

My SO was highly medicated but definitely aware of the disparity. My SO repeated to me some vague excuse that they gave them out for a bacterial or mold or some kind of thing ( the words Covid or coronavirus were not mentioned) coming from another facility nearby. 

She asked me how I was eating and I told her I stocked up last night on a lot of frozen fruits and vegetables. She was concerned that I was eating fast food without her around, but I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth that the virus had hit near us and I wanted to be prepared for quarantine. I didn't want to spread fear on the floor. She already expressed that she isn't safe in a mixed space.

This is just one story, one life. This is not about my feelings or how I handled the situation. The big question is: how do we treat all voluntary and involuntary patients facing a pandemic?"

I’m just gonna say this straight out and not correct grammar."
77,Idk what it is,"So I’m not fully concerned about this , it happens kind of often but only in certain situations.
Basically in situations there’s, well not a voice but more like, a thought telling me “what if you just did so n so right now” or along the lines of that.
So I’ve been like in the car with the window down and it’s like “what If you just threw your phone out the window like right now , why not do it , like go” and then I have to like grip my phone really hard and it makes me on edge. I’m not afraid of heights but similar things happen when I’m on a bridge , so the phone thing and as well it’s like “what happened if you just like jump off right now , why not” and like I get kinda stressed (I’m not depressed and the thought of killing myself has never ran over my mind so it’s not that).  As well as that a more serious one is when I’m near roads , I get this big impulse to just run across the road and some times I wait until there are no cars and like walk back and forth so it like get rid of the feeling and I like get this adrenaline rush when It like comes to it. Around roads I usually cross just like really quickly and my friends are confused to why I just randomly crossed instead of getting to the crossing and this is why. And I think the only other one I’ve experienced is recently with like large kitchen knifes i feel like “ what if I dropped it right no on my foot or like just stabbed myself “ and it’s got to times before I’ve like had to put the knife down because I get so anxious though I’d doubt I’d ever do that. Same happens with scissors.
In the moment it just feels like a really over whelming feeling of you should do this and usually goes when I get away from the thing or the area or safely do it , like run across the road when no cars are there. It’s never been dangerous except from maybe this one time when I was younger , was one of my first experiences of this , and I just felt an impulse and was waiting to cross but then I just like ran and this car was coming round the corner and it got really close like I missed it by a second. But apart from that it’s never got dangerous because I think I’ve learnt / am learning to avoid the impulse , sometimes though I do get scared I might just do it but I doubt.
I kinda just know what it is so I could like help it , you get me."
78,Misdiagnosis and loopholes," Hey guys this is my first time posting here, I wanted to talk about my misdiagnosis. I made stuff up to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia while I was pretty sure I had ADHD I was a child I didn’t know what to say so excuse me for doing that I was a child. I always struggled because of attention I usually daydream most of the day, I go into fantasy worlds where I fight monsters and stuff or always have some sort of super powers, I get yelled a lot because of my attention problem because I can’t pay attention to normal conversations, either I’m fidgeting my hands or making weird things with my hands or I’m just into my fantasy world or completely distracted with my phone or something else. When I study I can’t read without checking my phone and losing track of time and forgetting that I was studying, or I just stare into the book or paper for minutes to an hour and forget what I’m supposed to do. I can’t handle myself in public because I’m always awkward and doing random things, when I go out my headphones are in my ears because I can’t pay attention to anything or can’t ignore boredom, I can’t go a day without being so bored and it gets so bad that I need to smoke weed to pass time, I can’t handle patience or wait for something without going insane about my thoughts. And I have really bad mood swings that last for minutes to hours. I forget what to say when I have a normal conversation. And I’m really speech is really disorganized, I jump from one thing to another and people say I’m really rude for it, when someone is talking I usually interrupt them and be really awkward because of how fast is my self awareness I just realize my actions right away. When I was a child I was really smart and on top of my class, in high school I was taking AP/IB classes but struggled with my attention but still managed to pass and still be on top. In sophomore year I was hospitalized for suicide, I was going through seasonal depression but the doctors didn’t know it because I was never diagnosed with any mental illness before, when they asked questions I told them I hear voices which was a lie, it’s my own voice talking to me in my head, usually people with schizophrenia hear things outside their head. Furthermore I told them I see stuff that are not there, which was also a lie, I wear glasses and usually have migraines and when I get a headache I see colors and shapes because of the headache, it last few seconds and goes away it’s not related to psychosis. And than they put me on antipsychotics which didn’t do anything and gave my bad side effects, I was still convinced that I had schizophrenia, after I did my research on adhd and schizophrenia I found out the truth, I just wanted to get diagnosed with schizophrenia because it felt good, it was so dumb to think that way, I was literally brainless to think getting a diagnosis of schizophrenia will make me feel good. I was 14 years old and didn’t know how to think probably I made so many mistakes and got myself into so many loopholes. I stopped the antipsychotics when I found out that I was just a dumbass trying to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Everything was a challenge for me and so many people reward me and put in high places and it made me feel good so I guess I wanted the misdiagnosis to take on the challenge. I’m now 18 years old still trying to convince every psychiatrists that I don’t have schizophrenia but I can’t and it’s on medical records, I can’t get the right ADHD treatment because of the misdiagnosis and I can’t live like this anymore, I don’t know what do, I blame myself for causing this loophole, I deserved what I got I guess. I just feel so awful because I’m not getting the tight treatment, I’m emotionally burnt out and so angry with everything that I can’t control my words and impulsivity toward people. I don’t know what to do next, it’s all because of my lying issue and my struggles to keep up with things, I forget what to do everyday, I go to the bathroom and forget why I went there. All I’m saying is that I deserve what I got, I’m an awful person. I don’t know how to tell this to the new psychiatrist that I will see in few weeks, I don’t know where to start"
79,Asking for suggestion: Mental health organization for donation of funds!,"Hi,

I posted a few days ago about this but lost that account and thread. 

Anyway, I’d like to request for everyone’s assistance in helping me find an organzation where I can donate funds. I put up some activities a few weeks back and I have accumulated over $1k for donation. 

I’m bulimic - eating disorders and depression are close to my heart; hence, organizations (regardless of country as long as we can help them) focused on these mental illnesses are my priority. 

Please feel free to comment your suggestions. 

Thank you!"
80,"Living in a phantasy world: Dystopia, Cyberpunk, 80s","I live in a dream world. I often think about what it would be like to live in a cyberpunk dystopian future. I daydream about what it´d be like to live in the '80s, 20´s or in the 15th century in france. Honestly, it´s a lot more detailed in my head and I really can´t go any deeper than, that I really really sometimes believe that I either already lived in those times or will in my second life'20s which I somehow believe can happen in any time (like I´ll be reborn in the eighties for example). 

It´s gotten to the point where it affects my life. I write about, I talk to myself about things that never happened as if I was having an interview with myself or something in that matter. I totally see what I am doing and I am fully aware of it but stopping it is impossible. It´s like a coping mechanism for me. Probably. I don´t even know it might also be something else but it doesn´t feel normal. I don´t think other people do that. Or has anyone else done something like this before? I am, by the way, 19 years old and from Germany if that´s important. France"
81,I think I have a problem on my hands.,"I wrote this on another subreddit and I'm sorry to be annoying but I really need people to know.

WARNING: LONG READ 
Hi Reddit. I'm not giving my name or any hint of it for privacy reasons. I really don't anyone knowing me to find out I wrote this. For some background, I am a religious 14 year old living in a good country and home. 
I have a wonderful loving family and I am very fortunate. The only problems I have are with myself.
I cannot live with myself. Don't worry, I won't kill myself and I will never self harm, my faith in God won't let me do it. I think I have mental issues and nothing is really helping my mental state.
For one, I am really ugly. People say to me I'm not, or, I'll grow into my looks, but I know I'm ugly and accept it, but I hate the fact it is true. I get frustrated when I go out in public and see people prettier than me.It makes me angry and sad, and I don't stop thinking about my appearance. It keeps me up at night and I can't focus on anything else. Not school, not hobbies, not eating. This makes me slow at everything. Things I learn do not stay in my head and I have terrible memory.
For another, I think I have a mental condition of some kind. I may not have, heck, there's a high chance I don't but what I feel is so impulsive and  constant. Whenever I'm at school, every little thing annoys me and makes me angry. When someone slightly nudges me by accident, when the annoying girl in front laughs too loud, when someone trashes my table. I've even considered beating people up, but never acted on those urges. Something else is how I feel detached to everything. Whenever I am talking to a friend and they turn to talk to someone else who called them, I feel totally abandoned. I don't want to, but I can't help any of these problematic feelings I get. I'm not a loner, but I'm not popular either (which I have no problem with, I like it this way) and I am on great terms with many of my peers. I feel so sorry for my friends when I lash out at them, and I apologise most of the time (which I should do all the time). I always feel like crying and breaking down, but I know I don't have depression or what an edgy teen would claim to have. I am always changing emotions, of which I don't intend to. Happy one moment, agitated the next. I don't know what to do and it's becoming too much to deal with. Sometimes I wish I was not born with emotions. My brain is like another person sharing my body. It's like its only purpose is to make me feel insecure and angry. I always wake up in the middle of the night and stare into space, begging my brain to shut up. It is very much like a noisy, manipulative roommate with no respect (you know, like the ones that don't flush the toilet and bring home noisy party folks). It feels like a nightmare. I know I'm not a special person or amazing or superior in any way but whenever I am near anyone, there's always this side of me that says ""you're better than everybody else"". I know I'm not! I feel like a disgusting person when these ugly thoughts come out, but I can't help it. I curse internally at others for outshining me but I don't want to. I want to look up to people for being great, not hate or envy them. My confidence sucks so I don't know where this all comes from.
I told my parents only the part about getting mad and the ugliness but nothing else like my constantly shifting feelings. They gave me a wonderful talk about loving myself and my talents and how I should not compare myself to others. Mum offered to move schools (if I could find a semi-selective one near us, which I can't) and for a counsellor. 
I'm going to ask for a counsellor visit (I'm very nervous to as they don't recommend it), but, if anyone knows anything about psychology and can tell me what the hell is happening in my brain, it would be appreciated.
Thank you for reading and please don't think I'm an attention-seeking teenager. I am not edgy, I do not have the ""I am 13 and I am the darkness"" syndrome, nor do I want to cause drama or harm to anybody. A lot of other people have it worse than me, I know that. I want help. I just want to sleep again.
Thanks, I love you all."
82,How long for antipsychotic drug REXULTI to start working?,"TL;DR: Friend had a mental slip leading to sudden enlightenment. He has been (questionably) diagnosed with schizophrenia, prescribed REXULTI for a full year even though it is harming his mental health. He wants to give it a reasonable try, but wants to be off it ASAP.

Please consider reading the rest of the post as any other information would be really valuable to me.

-

I'm posting this on behalf of my friend. Recently, he had what I would describe as a mental slip, which manifested as sudden and intense spiritual enlightenment. 

He describes this time period as the most meaningful and purposeful he has ever felt, and sees the experience almost entirely positively. Due to his change in personality, his family were worried and he relented to seeing a psychiatrist to ease their worries. He was then hospitalised against his will, and diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

My opinion is that his diagnosis is not very accurate. I will admit that after his slip, he has started believing in spiritual woo-woo (like astrology, numerology, butterfly effect), and I think that he gave them too much information about these abstract ideas, leading to the heavy diagnosis.

He has been prescribed REXULTI for about a month now, and it has done nothing short of make him miserable. He seemed overall healthy before, but is now experiencing depression  and complete hopelessness.

He is reaching his wits end as to whether he should continue the drug. His doctor said that he should use it for a full year, but that is the last thing he wants to do. I suggested he stick with it for at least a few months as I know mental health meds take time to start working.

How long would constitute a reasonable trial of the drug for him to then decide whether to continue with it or not?

Do you know of any resources or other useful information that could be helpful?

Thanks for your time, and sorry for the essay of a post."
83,Getting triggered too often,"I shoot myself in the foot and act like a moron to lower people's expectations and try to get fake diagnosis for depression, ADHD, Aspergers, or ADD. It's a way of victimizing myself. It's like I'm trying to mooch off alimony or welfare but I'm in no position for that bullshit. I also blame it on my dad dying a few months ago. People who know me aren't buying my bullshit and now everyone hates me. It's just raw delinquency. I have no respect from anyone left. I also got 3 misdemeanor charges for trespassing and IEC. They've been dismissed and expunged but it doesn't mean they don't exist. Hospitals, schools, government jobs, etc all can still access them. It still reveals my poor character. 

I used to be a decent student and got into a top 5 public university (if anyone cares about those rankings) so that just means there's even less tolerance for me backsliding like this. Where's a good place to start or a decent goal to focus on? I feel like all my past goals in life are unreachable now and I need to adjust my outlook. Things can't go back to the way they used to be, but at the same time I need to stay out of trouble and keep busy. I basically screwed up my life with no back up plan. I think I could have a dissociation disorder. Sometimes I rant at people but then forget about it. Then they come to me later to talk about it and I 100% think they're screwing with me. Then the next day I'll remember. 

If more context would help, I'm asking online specifically because my parents and family have become increasingly unsupportive and I can't trust too many people when I'm this vulnerable. Going online preserves my anonymity. I also feel vulnerable to grooming or other kinds of sexual exploitation. It's already happened once. I was too apathetic to care though so I'm not milking for pity here.

I also can't seem to get hired anywhere. At this point I don't have much dignity, integrity, or social inhibition left. I'm kind of getting used to people not caring anymore. I feel like I'll end up getting mugged and killed soon. Some female friends I knew said I'll end up becoming a gigilo or gay porn star soon. It was half joking, half cruel.

84,Feeling out of place and different from my friends (Gaming related),"Hi, I never made an account in reddit before but I've been reading threads of chosen subject before since 2009. So here I am doing this for the first time as right now I kinda have nobody to talk to about my problem.  


I am 22 years old and I'll be straight forward, my problem is kinda childish but its bothering me somehow. To start this, here is my background. Our parents dislikes me and my brother and always hates us so to escape the depression from our family, My brother always goes to a gaming cafe and play games. He then made me come along with him when I was 5 years old (2004) because he wants me to have the same interest as him which is gaming and also give me another way how to escape sadness. He always invites me to play this game called **""DOTA""** everytime we go there but, I was just a small kid and doest know how to do things yet. I suck in games like **REALLY SUCK** and everyone doesn't want to play with me because I'm so bad unless my brother tells them to let me join. It kinda hurts my feelings every day I think about it back then so, I start setting up my mind to get good in everything that I do and I will give my very best into it. I'll admit that I really wanted people to like me or like playing with me. I trained and trained being better in **DOTA** as well as everything I do. I didn't gave up no matter what and took everything that it takes.  


Fast forward to present time, I have gained this personality of wanting perfection in things I do. ( I don't know how to explain this but I don't correct other people. I don't focus on their mistakes but only focus on mine and I'm always self crytising myself such as ""I could do better than that. Keep trying and dont stop until you got it right"").   


I have made friends online that has the same mind set as me and went playing LAN E-sports tournament when I was a teen-ager. But for me, they are just online friends as we dont have the symetry of IRL friends. I have reached the highest rank/medal in DOTA (*Immortal rank 1700+ EU*). In the end of the day I still feel lonely after achieving those. So I qut the E-sports scene and just play games for fun.  


Now this is where my problem starts bothering me. My IRL friends also play games casually and they invite me to play games from time to time. I go play with them to have fun but then, every single time they I play games with them, they stop playing with me and still play with each other. This has been going on for almost 2 years now and I had enough of it. So I asked one of my friends, ""why do you guys not play with me after a few games I play with yous?"" he then answered becasue you are too good and its no fun. Now I'm so confused because back then people does not want to play games with me because I suck and now people does not want to play with me because im so good? It is driving me crazy and I really feel like I dont belong to anywhere. I really think I need some mental health advice right now...  


*TLDR: Back then no one wants to play games with me because I suck and now, no one wants to play games with me because I am so good.*"
85,Why do I feel sad and awkward after sex even though I'm not doing anything wrong?,This guy friend of mine and I had sex a couple hours ago. During the act I'm happy and having a good time and all that. However afterward I just feel so awkward and guilty. He has a collection of shot glasses (he travels for work and always gets one from all the places he visits). I told him that instead of cumming in the condom he should cum in a shot glass. So I put a shot glass between my boobs and he came in it and I drank it lol. It's not the first time I had sex with him but I just feel so awkward and weird especially the whole shot glass thing. After we were done we laid in his bed and we kissed and he told me that he loves me then he fell asleep. We have always jokingly said I love you to each other but I'm not sure what love he means anymore. We are both in our late twenties.
86,"Is there a difference between not wanting to be helped, and thinking you can't be helped?","I honestly think I'm too deep into my problem/s and think I can't be helped, is there a difference between not wanting help and thinking you can't be helped, if so what is it?"
87,Academic crisis for mental health,"Today I repeated cut my arm like a teenager (I'm 22) because I am helpless. I cause pain to people I love. I'm selfish and too stubborn. I'm a walking zombie . I've been to therapy before. Psychiatrist. It's a list cause unless I try to help myself. But I'm lost and drowned in my pool of self pity while my parents are slaving to afford my education . I feel very alone and defeated. All the fight in me is gone. I can't even kill myself because my parents spent so much of their hard asm earned money to make a weak loser study in France and I'll probably be kicked out because of my lack of so many things. In native ten years I'll be sick even more because I've seen it. Once it hits u you get consumed by this pain and from then on, even as a grown woman, you become infantile , you become a sad wet blanket. I wanted to cut myself into pieces today. I can't die because I'm scared of death. Everyone asks me to love myself but it's meaningless to me. I'm defeated and want to give up till I am dead I guess."
88,every day feels the same,"i havent been diagnosed with depression. I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 10 or so, and Im also pretty sure I have rejection sensitive dysphoria, because my god, I cannot bring myself to try shit. Every day seems the same. wake up, go to school and be tired the entire time, go home, do 2 hours of homework, play the same games for a few hours, browse the same reddit home page, then toss and turn in bed for the same 5 hours every night, and repeat. every day feels predictable. 

im just waiting for SOMETHING to happen. but the catch is i dont want to try to MAKE things happen. because the idea of trying things is somehow scary.

i want a job but hate applying, i want my license but i somehow figure if i dont have a job i cant get a car, or pay for fuel. 

its just confusiing, and i honestly have no clue where the fuck im going in life?? i feel like i cant keep going comfortably for the rest of my life because i dont now what im doing to begin with, so how could i understand the rest of it?

i dont even know what this post is, or if it even makes sense. i just want things to change but dont really want to at the same time?

is there some way to make life more exciting without the risk of fucking it up? 

ive thought about drugs. but thats one thing i really dont want to fall to. 

i feel like i want too much stuff without the repercussions that doing that stuff may bring

im really confused and bored and frustrated and i dont know what to do next"
89,Emotional abuse,"This is a related post to one I made recently and has to do with my experience of living with someone who is mentally ill and how as a result, I felt coerced and forced to live with her.


My mum is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but there is good reason to believe she has borderline personality disorder, which makes a lot of what has happened somewhat understandable. 
I have never been made to feel so guilty over making a decision, being told how it was a bad decision, being told go go fuck myself, told how  I'm in the wrong here and now getting texts asking me to talk to her and that she misses me. 
She said that ""no one is there for her"" which isn't true. 
She is a diagnosed alcoholic and has gone from fully quitting to going straight back. 
I'm so hurt by all of this, I know that I'm allowed to make decisions and that I'm not to blame for her feelings, but I keep second guessing myself and am just sat in bed feeling guilty and anxious. 
I think my inability to put my foot down and be confident in my decision is a result of the guilt and I can't decide if it's a calculated act to keep me around or if she genuinely doesn't realise that she's making me feel bad. 
Over phone she tried telling me that I should ignore when she's having an episode, which I don't see to be fair when the one she had the other night involved her barely conscious and swallowing down every tablet in sight, I can't and don't want to see that. 
Everyone I've spoken to agrees with my decision, yet I'm just drowning in guilt right now. 
I am really confused by how she went from angry and telling me to go fuck myself to being nice over text and apologising straight after, it's odd. 
I'm scared that she'll hurt herself, I don't know what to do."
90,Religion and psychotic things?,"So, hi. I am someone who is in the beggiming of a process of converting to new religion (paganism). In that religion we believe that the gods send us signs and that we can meet them through dream and meditation. And I was wondering because I read an article on religion and psycoticism? (Sure thats not how you say or write that but ok) and now I am wondering if it would be a sign of me being psychotic to join and start looking for signs of the gods."
91,Processing emotions,"How does one process emotions? Specifically emotional pain, emptiness, heartache and loneliness?

I’m trying but it never resolves, it just just keeps coming back up multiple times a day. It aches and hurts so much and I don’t know how much longer I can take it.

I’m desperate. Everything I’m trying doesn’t seem to work. Help please."
92,Academic and mental crisis,I'm being sent to an Erasmus programme but I feel to mentally habdicapped to go to it. I have even tried cutting v myself and getting into accidents to avoid it but I can't. I need to go and spend time with my family but my university is very unforgiving. So I am trying to cut the Erasmus course short to succeed. But it's so stressful. I really thought before coming that it was an optional course and I could study in France if I wanted to.  I am being made to do something I do not wish to and my mental health is suffering very harshly for it. What can I do? If I tell them I'm mentally ill they might refrain from giving me opportunities in the future which will end up in me kicked out of France since s I want to work in the future . The anxiety had completely consumed me and but I don't feel stable enough to take the Erasmus course. I'm hoping the German university to. be more helpful but I'm still suffering badly
93,I hate when people say depression is normal,"It just makes me feel like this is the norm, this is how everyone is supposed to feel everyday. That there’s nothing wrong with me. Nothing that can be helped with. That I should just accept that this is life and there’s no need for it to be better. 

I get that it’s said to make people feel less like ”outcasts” or something but it’s just makes me feel like there’s no hope."
94,Hospital,"So I've been told by many friends that I need help. But regular therapy hasnt worked because I just would end up lying and both him and my parents bought it.

I wanted to know what yalls opinions are on mental hospitals because I have been thinking about telling my parents what all I do as to get me into one.

I think the forced schedule and lack of hell from school would be useful.

So yeah what's yalls opinions on them

Also, if you happen to live in Delaware (US) and knew a good place I wouldnt mind that because most reviews look fake or like the place is a hellhole."
95,I need help,"I'm a soon to be 20 year old male. About 2 months ago, give or take a couple days, I found someone very special or so I thought. After two weeks she grew distant and I knew something was wrong but chalked it up to her soon to be ex husband (at the time) and brushed it off. Eventually she came to me saying he ""wanted her one last time"" before they were divorced. She promised me she wouldn't. A week later she went out to drink with some co-workers. I went to go give her some money for drinks in case she wanted to pay for a round or two. I drove up to the bar and saw her vehicle. Next to it was another vehicle. With the weather being so cold you could see the exhaust fumes and my heart sunk into the bottomless pit that was well is my stomach. I pull up in front of the two vehicles and caught her in the act with one of her co-workers. I dont know what compelled me to but I screamed no and lost it. I collapsed and crawled back to my car finally speeding off with no intention of getting anywhere safely. I get to a stopping point and sit there for a couple minutes just staring. She finds me and we talk for hours on hours. Thinking everything is finally ok she tells me she let her soon to be ex husband have his way with her. It's been a rough 4 days since. Constantly crying myself to sleep, not eating or sleeping. One of my co-workers had to take me home this morning (2am I work overnights on weekends) because I had overdosed on a combination of over the counter and prescribed painkillers. I shouldn't be alive let alone walking and talking right now. My intention was to numb all emotion, not die. At least that's what I keep telling myself. Now that you know my story I ask for a friend and/or advice. I dont know what to do or say. I dont know how I feel and the only thing I know is that I need help."

100,The Problem with Mental Health in Schools - USA,"The mental health training in schools is an absolute joke. They recently tried to address the growing issues by making us watch videos on mental disorders twice a week for a month. It didn’t help. 

At my school we’ve lost 6 students in the last 2 1/2 years to suicide. We’ve lost 2 in the last two months. I lost a friend last week. 

She told me she was going to commit suicide Monday morning. She wasn’t here the next day. The kicker is that my friends and our reported her 9 times. 9 times in a span of two months. Two times the safe line was called. One time we were hung up on. The other time we were yelled at. A series of emails that resulted from our administration were all dead end. 

One of my friends sent another email to admin on Monday essentially explaining that the situation got more intense. She was given the response, “We’ve already talked to her.” That was it. 

Naturally, that raises the question what are schools expected to do? If we are injured at school, legally all the school nurse can do is give us ice, call our parents, or let us lie down for a while. It’s messed up. So if they can do anything for physical injuries, does that translate to mental injuries as well? 

That raises another question. What can change? Things like the baker act are absolutely terrifying and don’t do much to solve the problems. 

What does everyone else think about this? I feel stuck. I don’t understand why the system is the way it is, but I want to change it."

102,"Something needs to change, I’m ruining everything and hurting everyone around me.","Bit of background. 
I have been dealing with my mental health for the last four years. Starting as depression has now developed into severe anxiety. I grew up in a home where my dad dealt with everything with shouting and being angry. The anxiety of living like this has (as my therapist put it) put me into crisis mode constantly, that has meant I have started to react in fight mode to protect myself, and the way I have been taught through example is to shout. It’s meant I now react aggressively, cry at the drop of a hat. I’m unbearable to be around. I basically spent a long time trying to not be him to realise I am entirely him. 

In my undergraduate degree I made friends with people and became close with them, I would spend my time with them everyday, we eventually decided to do our dissertation research together. The whole class had to go and do our research of geology away from the uni, which meant we lived together for 6-7 weeks. Months prior to that my first ‘episode’ of mental health really happened, I explained to them what had happened and I was on medication to help it. However my anxiety, depression has made me act still like an awful person. I would snap at the them, say things I didn’t really mean and just break at small things that hurt me. I couldn’t brush things off. They retreated from me and I had to spend a lot of time repairing that relationship. 

And now.
Fast forward I am in my postgrad degree now, one of those girls is at the same uni and she and I had become close again, slowly making up for what I had done. Two weeks ago I snapped as I was tired and stressed. I should have recognised this and removed myself, but I just didn’t and had to then apologise later. This weekend the pressure has mounted, she sent me a message about a job she might apply to and I sent a message back that was a little blunt. I later responded that I didn’t mean it quite as blunt as it came across and she sent my back a message saying I’m using her as a punching bag and maybe if it ‘wasn’t me it wouldn’t have seen it as rude’. I basically have reduced the bar so low that she just assumed I’m trying to be hurtful. 

On top of this I live with my boyfriend who I can snap at any moment. He’s the most understanding person but I can tell he takes it personally when I raise my voice (because who wouldn’t?), he feels he must walk on egg shells because I’m so sensitive to everything. He sometimes doesn’t know who he’s getting that day, there is no consistency with how I react. 

I am at CBT and have done therapy for so long. Nothing is changing, I’m trying my exercises from therapy, I’ve tried meditation, I eat better than I ever have, I run most days. I am trying everything people suggest and I still seem to blow everything up around me. Everyone I love get the worst of it and I’m going to end up alone if this carries on. And I know there’s giving myself a break and a bit of self love, but it’s very hard to do when you’re constantly ruining you relationships with everyone. 

I just need help, I want to shut myself away so I can stop hurting everyone. 

TLDR; I seem to have a major short temper and no exercise, diet, meditation, therapy seems to help. I’m awful to all my friends, family and boyfriend. If you’ve seen bojack horseman, it’s like that but without the drugs and illegal stuff, I’m just an arsehole."
103,ADVICE ON MEDS,"I am currently taking Risperidone, 0.5mg twice a day. I know it’s a low dose but I’m experiencing severe constipation that I’ve been taking medications for, for months now and the risperidone is also affecting my libido. The sex drive problem is probably because of my current mood, but you never now.
I’m trying to come out of a severely low period which I cannot say was depression, because, here’s the thing: I’ve been going to different doctors, 3 therapists and 2 psychiatrists but none of them have diagnosed me, so I decided to see a new doctor, a psychiatrist, and try to sort things out.
To be short, I’ve had fluctuations in mood for the last three years, which is not a lot but keep in mind that I’m 17. 
During the more elated periods I also experience psychotic symptoms, and I’ve had those same symptoms also during one low period.
I’ve been prescribed the antipsychotic I talked about but they’ve never told me anything about a possible diagnosis, except one therapist who used to say I was bipolar as if it was obvious but never formally diagnosed me.
I am struggling and I wonder if I might need something to keep me from going down as well, maybe a mood stabilizer but I’m not a doctor so I don’t know. Also, I don’t think I can keep taking these laxatives for my constipation because they ruin your intestines’ tissue in the long run, so maybe I should change my antipsychotic?
I am going to see a psychiatrist but I just wanted someone’s opinion before I go to the appointment. Feel free to ask me anything and thanks for reading through til the end :)"
104,Managing a relationship with my mentally ill brother- very burnt out,"I always feel like Ben in Parks and Recreation. ""What do I do? What do I . . . what do I DO?"". It's kind of hard for me to even articulate the problem.  But basically my brother is frequently suicidal, does not take care of himself, hates mental health treatments for the most part, and is often unkind.  I have poured in massive amounts of time and energy into trying to help over the years, and it has not paid off at all.  I would say that relationship is a big part of what took me from being the happiest I'd ever been to now probably mildly to moderately depressed.  He calls me and yells at me that he needs help, and why aren't I helping him, and says he's going to kill himself.  But he won't say what help he needs, or when he does, it's either something I cannot control or something where when he gets it it makes no difference to his mental health anyway.  Sometimes he has been actually on the phone about to jump off a bridge.  Sometimes I call the police and he is held overnight, and he comes out even more furious at me.  In the town where he used to live I called so often the police told me to stop calling.  Also, he thinks he dies whenever he goes to sleep so he won't do anything that might result in sleep, which adds another level of impossibility to the situation.  I used to spend maybe 2 hours a night to four hours a night talking to him plus driving 8 hours round trip once a week to talk him off a ledge and clean his super unsanitary apartment, but now I have a daughter and I'm down usually to about an hour twice a week.  That doesn't sound too bad, but even talking to him pleasantly makes me extremely stressed out because I've built up such a feeling of hopelessness and panic and anger around him.  And I feel like I can't talk to him about this because it makes him extra suicidal and you're not supposed to tell depressed people they are a burden.  But he is a huge burden and I feel like I can't take it.  

What the hell can I do?  My mother is dead, and my father is getting older and doesn't have the physical health or inclination to deal with this constant crisis.  I have talked to therapists, but they just tell me not to talk to him if he is being like this, and that feels wrong to me.  I don't love my brother anymore.  I wish I did, but i don't know how to help my feelings recover.  I just don't want to be responsible for someone's death, but that seems impossible.  Any advice at all would be appreciated!"
105,So I finally watched joker [spoiler ahead maybe?],"No, it won't be a post about how I think I'm a psychopath or anything like that. It's just that I identified a lot with him on that part of the movie where it's revealed that in fact, he had never started a relationship with his neighbour, but he had imagined her with him often.

I noticed I've been doing that a LOT and LOT after me and my mom lost our housing and had to move, I'm thinking it could be a sign of loneliness. If I'm alone I imagine I have someone else with me (an imaginary friend, an actor, YouTuber, a crush, whatever) and I even go as far as interacting with them, make faces, etc. Anyone else does this?"
106,The stigma behind mental illness,"I'm so annoyed seeing people on social media and such throw around mental illnesses so casually.

Everyone makes it seem like they suffer from ""depression, (social) anxiety, mental breakdowns"". They make light of what it truly is and make it seem like it's nothing at all.

I really do want to believe that these people are suffering like they say. But to say stupid shit like if they were making millions of money, they wouldn't be depressed or socially anxious, then chances are the severity of their situation is probably very minor or they're wrongfully self-diagonising themselves and trying to make it seem like they know everything that they're talking about.

Making it seem like it's so easily fixable with money and ""just cheering up"", or forcing yourself to socialize when you have social anxiety and stuff makes it hard to truly see those that are suffering.

Ignorance truly is bliss. Mental illnesses is one of those things that you'll never fully understand unless you've been through it yourself... hence why it's so hard to even explain to people. What's the point in trying to explain something that just can't be fathomed from the outside? I wouldn't want to wish it on anybody. How could someone who's so cheerful and genuinely happy with life believe that there's a life out there where somebody is alive, but not really living? To suffer from being depressed, more so apathetic and anhedonic?  That things in life are dulled to the point of no reward, no satisfaction, no motivation, etc.? It's just not something that's comprehensible from an outside perspective. But I'm not trying to kill nobody's vibe. These are my problems to deal with, why try to bring the mood of others down?

And I don't blame them I suppose... it is what it is. This is just the stigma with mental health, and we just gotta learn to live with it I suppose.

Still, people annoy me. The know-it-alls, the people that offer suggestions (but could mean good intents), the deniers.

Sorry for the wall of text, but just a rant I guess."
107,PLEASE HELP ME.,"I’ve never used reddit before my entire life but I feel like I’d receive the help I’m seeking without having to insert much of an effort? I just feel so tired to do anything I mentally feel so tired. I don’t know how to explain how I’m feeling right now. I moved countries two years ago, alone. To study. And I’ve been by my own ever since, I’m homesick. I’m tired, and most of all I don’t feel like me. My dads been financially helping me but it’s come to that point where he can’t afford to I can’t Don’t blame him. I’ve been trying my best to find a job for two years but all I get is rejection emails. I’ve redone my resume and done everything on my end, it’s stressing me out because I’ve got uni fees coming up, my rent and bills, all that after I pay off I won’t barely get by. Now more than ever I keep thinking of ending it. I can’t even afford therapy. I feel like I have so much of bottled emotions inside of me that it’s not even coming out. Whenever I see a train coming by at the platform it truly messes with my mind, making me think what would it feel like if I just took a few steps forward. I do have friends here but after a certain point I can’t come to them with my problems because they got their own. I miss home, I miss my cat. I just don’t want to feel alive anymore. Most of the time I feel like I’m dissociating, like I’m living “a” life for the sake of living it and I’ve had enough, I want to truly disappear and feel like I don’t exist. I’m so tired."
108,From stigmatised to glorified,"As part of my degree I am looking into mental well-being and it got me thinking, in today’s society is mental health issues glorified amongst the younger generation. Have we completely broke the barrier of it being something that’s a stigma to teenagers and young adults glorifying it and feeling as though they need some type of mental health illness to fit in and to be seen as trendy.

What’s your opinion?"
109,Want to hear something shocking? Mental Health treatment in the US is dangerously poor,"I picked up my phone and dialed an emotional distress hotline...something I haven't done in 5 years. Wow. Guess you picked up? I thought it was bad before when it was college students on the other end but this woman was utterly apathetic to the point I think she probably wanted me to hang up. And my therapist that I pay for with my insurance? Shes an ""eternal optimist"" which is code for ""I can't handle you, you are too dark for me"". So she has no constructive advice whatsoever, might as well talk to a wall. The therapist before her was a deranged Trump supporter who brought up politics every session and my psychiatrist has bible quotes on her wall...I don't even live in the south what's going on? This is sick stuff. We are really in a scary timeline I have no clue where these people were hiding all these years but after Trump they ust wave their freak flag, or I guess bigot flag. This is bad people. As bad a year 2016 was at least the mental health workers were professional. What happened in 3-4 years?"
110,What don’t people like me?,"Pardon if this is the wrong place for me to ask this question. I have been wondering what’s been “weird” about me for several years and never gotten an answer that helped. I feel like it has to do with my social anxiety.

I’m currently a freshman in college. I have always been fearful of social interaction so I primarily kept to myself all throughout school. When I sought out attention (usually joining other groups) in my early years, my classmates either ignored me or said something rude about my personality. I was the weird girl because I drew cats a lot and hardly spoke. I was confused and basically shrugged it off every time. I started to believe I was a burden to people. The people who I did see as friends never usually paid attention when I spoke. I just wanted friends to hang around others for their company. I never asked for anything, I just wanted people to rely on if I wanted to converse. The rejection of others began to slowly chip away at me that I had a time in my life where I shut down. I was an afterthought in every group I joined. Why did the people I trust not care? Is it because I have a hard time speaking? 
My speech is often made fun of because I “mumble” when I swear what I just said came out crystal clear. 
I stutter and struggle to pronounce words under stress and I find it really embarrassing. When I speak sentences, I sometimes blank out and forget what I was about to say. (This happens often) I do a lot of calls with people online and I get worried that people will see less of me when it happens. I’m really worried about this if it ever comes up during a professional setting. 

Is there something mentally wrong with me or something more? I don’t understand what makes people want to stay away from me. Never once have I gone out to make someone uncomfortable or force a situation on them. I’ve felt so alone for such a long time. I’d get the same answers of “Oh, you should reach out more!” ....when I already do."
111,/exhales.../ anxiety sucks.,"Just another day. You wake up, not really sure if the day is really worth abandoning the bed. Okay, you say to yourself, let's give this a try. Maybe, just maybe, today might be different. 

But then there it is again. The lump in your throat. The lightheadedness. The absence of appetite. Suddenly you end up crying. Hyperventilating. Your mind goes overdrive. You feel unworthy. You feel useless. You feel you're never enough.

They say, talk it out to a friend. But reaching out means accusing yourself. You are again bothering someone because you can't get your shit together. So you isolate.

Eventually you will be reminded, that accepting your vulnerability is the first step. You chat a trusted friend, and feel a bit better... Calmer. And hey, you feel okay again, somehow. Then the cycle repeats.

God damn it's so tiring. Having to live like this. That's why I am deeply grateful for communities like this one, because it makes me realize that I am not alone in this fight. There are people out there who actually experience the same thing, and they are still trying. I would love to hear from you guys, please do share some self-help tips or your stories. We are all in this together. ❤"
112,Trouble being honest with therapists.,"I have issues being honest honest with my therapist. I think I really have something going on in my brain, I know I’m at the least, pretty delusional. I don’t want someone to think I’m crazy, and I don’t want to be judged, so I’ve been unable to be honest about any of the things I think or experience. I know that a therapist is there to be impartial and help me, and the only thing I’m doing by lying is hurting myself, but I just have so much trouble being truthful?

I’m also very good at seeming put together, I guess. And so, if I did get a diagnosis for whatever is happening, I worry my family would think I’m lying to my therapist to feel special or “cool” or something."
113,Want to help other people,"So I’m a 15M from India. I want to do something for the people who suffer from mental illness in my country. I developed an eating disorder last year. I’ve had suicidal thoughts. I’m not fully recovered but on the way. Before any of this I didn’t really think of mental health much. Didn’t know much about it. But after going through these things, I’ve really developed a sort of respect for the people who battle these thoughts everyday. Mental health is not really paid much attention in India. We don’t have really good therapists. My question is what can I do to help other people with mental illness and raise awareness about it? Any help would be appreciated"
114,True Life: Fucked up Childhood,"okay now that ive got your attention, i have a million questions. let me start off by saying This is a long, depressing, complicated story involving events that are relevant to my mental health that ive told only some details about to anyone due to thinking it's a burden to hear and also I have no desire for sympathy. I'm honestly just putting this here in case someone happens to stumble upon it and give me their opinion on my story/possibly some HELPFUL advice.. (i try very persistently to NOT need help, so ive got the high functioning thing down to where no one suspects I have any issues besides being ""quiet"") so read at your own risk lol. im a 22 almost 23 yr old woman who's dealt with trauma most of my life. I've always knew i was different and not in a ""Im special and smart"" way Like i was told, but like an ""I am having a terrible time but i have to persevere because this is my life"" kind of way. 

One of my early memories is of me in the winter of 2000 when I was 3, in my dad's truck wearing pink Barbie snow boots and staring down at them while he asked me if I wanted to live with my mom or Aunt M. I said my aunt for whatever reason, and my aunt's house is where I moved. (I wouldve had to move regardless btw, my mother was too poor/had drug, mental health issues to be able to support me.) I was also coerced as a toddler (idr what age, maybe 3-4?) to touch my dad in a guessable area i don't really feel like mentioning specifically. My dad and mom divorced when i was 1yrs old, he then lived in my grandma's house across the street from where I lived at my aunt's for reference. age 7, my dad had been arrested a couple times for stuff I didn't really know too much about at the time, (Mostly drug charges.) also, February 14th of my 7th year my mother died via overdose on crystal meth. I have a memory after this age where i woke up to my dad carrying me outside and dropping to the ground outside in the snow. He had started a fire at my grandmas house and the entire garage was engulfed in flames. not his first fire, he also recently got out of a 10 year sentence (i was like 11 at the time) for manufacturing meth in his house and it exploding.

Almost forgot to mention when i was 10 i started cutting myself and the school counselor called CPS on my aunt. I started going to therapy then stopped. This may have been when she really started fucking up my perception of reality. I was grounded for cutting myself. A 10 year old trauma survivor. I was punished for the most... ridiculous things. I put on a little black eyeliner my friend had on one day as a 13 year old at school, went home and because she had told me a year or two earlier i couldn't wear makeup, she justify taking every single thing out of my room except my literal mattress, 5 days worth of clothes, a sheet and a pillow. I was excited to be able to receive my favorite fucking stretchy spiral keychain i used as a bracelet back. Also got grounded harshly when my aunt saw i had a facebook. It was like the end of the world when i got in trouble. My cousin, however, never received remotely as harsh punishments and was never grounded, though some things he did like drive 3 hours away at 16 years old, went punished with a stern scold and some laughing. 

At 12, i was cutting myself again except way more eagerly (id always look for jagged broken things on the ground to use) and id cut anything, id shred my knuckles, carve stuff right under where my pants rose so no one would see, arms/wrists, my upper thighs ended up being the most used to where i had enough cuts and scars from my hip bones down to the middle of my thighs (still have all the scars) i went to therapy until my therapist switched professions literally, then stopped going. It was more like someone i could just have as a friend. 

Fast Track: 1am, I'm 14 years old. Always been a night owl since it was the only peace and quiet I usually got. Im watching tv and my uncle who, up to this point, had seemed normal enough.. maybe a little more strict but not weird, comes busting into my room and says how he knows what Ive been up to and he knows what I do. Visibly confused, i question him, and he goes on a rant about how he knows i stay up and masturbate. (I had discovered masturbation but definitely was not doing it every night or even on any regular basis at all.) I dont really remember much of what happened next but he eventually left me alone, but i do remember the feeling of crippling fear and confusion. He would begin to come in my room and stand near me by my bed when I was watching tv or playing a game during the day and would obviously be staring at my breasts, which i caught on to and would pull the cover up. This gets much weirder.. i cant and won't name everything he did, some things include: trying to slyly feel my boobs while hugging and asking for hugs all the time (sometimes hed have an erection), putting random sexual objects in my room (a WHIP, a vibrator that looked used, clothespins) which all of, upon discovering, i would immediately take the item and run crying outside and throw it over the fence in the alley behind our house. My aunt caught him looking in my window and had him explain why she had to put a piece of material to cover the open spaces.(relevant because later when i finally told her about it, she didnt believe me and said I would've told her way before if it was true.) i would hear him outside my window jacking off. He told me before i could watch and he wouldnt stop. He tried to make me kneel in front of him. He would come into my room every night towards the end of it (when i was like 16-17 before i moved out) and I would barricade the door and hed still fucking come in there somehow. I fucking cant stand the thought of someone watching me fucking sleep. If i wake up to someone looking at me i will be pissed. I was late for school or overslept so many times due to lack of sleep because of that. Id sleep in class. Looking back, some teachers who didnt say anything Im truly grateful for, I think they may have sensed something was wrong. I told my friends about him and actually detailed events in real time to several people which really should've maybe told their parents or something but whatever.

One week before my 18th birthday, at (deja vu)around 1am. Here it comes, busting into my door. Only this time with a new delusional exclamation. He accused me of raping and molesting HIM completely out of nowhere. He was clearly having some sort of mental malfunction and I will never in my life forget the look in his eyes when i had enough and finally just started SCREAMING at him, At 1 am, while my aunt and cousin are asleep. He was pissed. Never seen anger like that in someones eyes. I however, felt no threat anymore. I hadn't said anything those 4 years due to being the reason i fucked the family up, i was trying to protect them and they crumbled me up and threw me in the garbage. So I'm hysterically sobbing and my aunt comes in and asks what happens and i try my best to tell her about all these things hes done and not being able to even SAY some of the things. He left that night and when i came home from work the next day.. i found out they had for some reason raided my room and found a roach blunt and my aunt went absolutely ballistic on me. Going through my phone and laptop, seeing all the things i tell my friends about wanting to move out. I guess she ""just happened"" to skip over all the detailed encounters i sent friends also.. which was the whole reason for me wanting to move.. she angrily tells me that if I want to move so bad then I need to move out. I pack my shit right then, just for her to tell me ""Oh i cant let you move out until you're legally 18.."" so I suffered another week.. Of being judged, condescended down to, my cousin even told me Id end up like my mother. If they only knew how completely fucked their mindset is...

Ive lived on my own since then and have absolutely zero contact with any of them. 
I worked at target when i first moved but the pay wasn't adequate so i willingly and shamelessly decided to be a stripper. (Side note, but this single decision has led me to meet some of the best people i know now)
I suffer from debilitating, undiagnosed/untreated mental illnesses every single day. I dont want to be on a set medication due to possible side effects and the possibility of something getting increasingly worse, but yet i do self-medicate. I fell into a very deep depression after the honeymoon phase of being free on my own. I think it was the realization of the trauma I've endured possibly. Either way, i had to cut most all social/work interactions and only work friday and Saturday. Sometimes thats even exhausting. Before the depression hit, weed would just make me tired but now i find it to be one of my only joys in this world. I also take a vyvanse (kinda like adderall) when i go to work the two days i even go because Im just so tired. Ive been exhausted my entire life i feel like. I have NO motivation. I dont want to kill myself but i do fantasize about death. I do feel my depression is very slowly but surely getting better. I used to not be able to get out of bed for an entire week. I would only shower when I absolutely had to, i also lost 35 pounds from lack of appetite. i had developed a worsening insomnia and currently still have to smoke before being able to eat or sleep. Btw please understand i only started self medicating with weed after i noticed its positive effects filling almost* exactly what I need to not feel the weight of never ending dread. it gives me slight motivation which is better than none at all. But not enough, and i refuse to let myself take stimulants more than a couple times a week, even though that's the only thing that makes me feel alive and motivated. I have always had; (keep in mind this is self diagnosed but all i do is wonder wtf is wrong with my brain so I research all the time) moderate-severe anxiety. Small and insignificant things such as planning a trip or seeing a doctor seem like a huge obstacle. i try to just mask everything around others to not seem completely out of tune, but have always in a way felt that anxiety and depression have been present. In 4th grade i recall hearing a teacher telling my aunt about how she thought I have symptoms of anxiety and my aunt just ignored it. She always just simple-mindedly blamed it on my mom dying at a young age and thats it. 

Hmm. I dont really know what else to add right now. If you've read this, thank you so much. I appreciate you taking the time to read my story."
115,I feel depressed sometimes.,"Sometimes I feel really depressed. I just know that I've never brought joy to anyone's life, only stress and problems. I don't wanna talk to anyone about it either. I just feel like ending it all sometimes. Thoughts? I feel better talking to random people about this rather than my friends and family"
116,Psychosis,I want to smoke pot to get psychosis.
117,Should I be Concerned?,"Hello everyone. Firstly, I want to apologize for my english, It's not my first language. I'm a 19-year old college student. I've always felt like something was wrong with me but thought that I was just making things up in order to get attention or something like that. I know that you're not supposted to 'diagnose' yourself by taking tests on the internet but all of those tests actually revealed to me that I might have ADHD. I'm very forgetful, meaning that I can forget something that has been told to me a few minutes ago. I can never finish what I start and it makes me feel like I'm a failure.Sometimes I get super excited about an idea or a task, I think about it for weeks and then, out of the blue, I find it boring and completely stop thinking about it. I easily get distracted, for example I could be painting something and then a new idea pops up in my head and then I start rushing the process of painting just to get it over with. I also can be very moody, my boyfriend actually thinks I have some kind of form of a Bipolar Disorder. Even now, writing this I have so many thought in my head that I don't know how to express them all. Also, I have trouble falling asleep because of the amount of things I think about.   Here's the thing, many of these tests talk about 'poor time managing' but I feel like I'm the opposite of it. I always  start projects on time and finish them at least a week earlier. I'm never late and always too early. It might have to do something with my anxiety but I just feel lost at this point. Can anyone tell if I should take this situation of mine more seriously? Thanks!"
118,I don’t know,"I sometimes randomly feel empty inside. Like, I’m fine some moments, then I just feel... sad. I don’t know how to say how I feel and even if I did I don’t know if anyone would listen. I love my parents. But I don’t know if they would understand me. I talk to them and I think my mum might but I don’t know about my dad. I talk to him about mental health sometimes but I feel like he thinks it’s either you’re fine or you have serious mental problems and screaming and throwing things in public and the like, just “crazy”. He shouts a lot sometimes and I feel bad mentioning this but last week he was shouting because I wanted to give my grandma a call before going to sleep and it was like two minutes after he told me to put my phone away and then my grandma (she answered my call) just told me it’s best to go to sleep bc dad was angry and after I hung up he got angry because she said he was angry. He and mum started arguing (what else is new) and he shouted a lot, more than mum even though he doesn’t understand that his voice is louder. I don’t know how to explain this but I was sort of trembling and just holding my head in my hands facing away from him and I really gasped when he snatched my phone from my hands bc I thought he was about to grab me or something. Idk. Then he said I was being ridiculous by clutching my head and being like that or whatever but he told me yesterday that apparently he thought I was being dramatic and apologised. Dunno how he thinks i would be in that situation. I really don’t like loud noises some of the time. I think it’s misophonia but I don’t want to self-diagnose. And yeah, sometimes I feel like I’m stupid for thinking I’m depressed. Idk I feel like I should go to a therapist but I feel like my dad believes the stigma around it, though apparently he is going to look for a psychologist to go to so he can stop being angry for little things. I wanted to call some sort of child help line but if I get put into care or something or get split up?? Idk if it’s worth it because we’re fine most of the time. Idk if it’s worth risking us getting split up because of a few moments. There’s more stuff I would add but I don’t wanna make  this too long and honestly, I don’t know what else to say. I’m fifteen and male if it means anything. Thanks for taking the time to read this :-) sorry if it was too long :-P"

122,"4,018 Days and Counting","It has been eleven years.

This is hard to write. The words do not come easily.

As I reflect on how I have changed and grown since that day, I feel both empowered and inadequate. Empowered because I am a survivor, a thriver, a better-every-day-er. And inadequate because it still crosses my mind and cripples me, disorients me, and better-every-day only applies some percentage of the time. 

Some days, I do slip. I slip back to where I was mentally and emotionally on day two, or seven, or 365, or 1,234. It does not equate to much - the momentary backsliding. But it exists, and the mere existence of trauma can be a disability of its own right.

Some nights, I still awaken in a terror thinking no time has passed at all. Some days, I feel like I cannot breathe, cannot speak, cannot exist.

But the frequency is on a downward trajectory, on average. It's true that it rears its ugly head more often at times, generally when it's the same time of year as day one. But the slope of the line is angled ever lower, approaching, I hope, an asymptote of zero.

Until that day comes, I will continue. I will exist. I will be more, ever increasingly, than my traumatic past."
123,Memory and mind blackouts,"It's been 2 hours since I came back from training. Only thing I am doing last two hours is sitting or liyng on the sofa watching the time passing by and listening to some metal, I am lifeless, but it's not like dead inside while deprssed, but it's very close to that. There would be nothing bad about that, but I need to study and it's the last thing I am about to do right now (like even if I found some enthusiasm I would do anything else first).

I am have no energy and enthusiasm at all. I'm terrible tired all the time, but I am unable to sleep (only from total exhaustion). I don't enjoy anything lately (less than 2 months). I can't focus on anything I don't even know what to write about (I had it in my head but I can't remember). 1,5 ago I was about to harm myself then I was about to get totally drunk then I wanted to watch something on TV. Now I called with my mother that reminds about 10 things I wanted to do today which I completly forgot about. I am struggling to write this and to talk, like I often lose a thought and it takes a pretty long while to find it again or I forgot it.

This state usually don't last long, but it happens more and more often.

I forgot what I was about to write again, so I'll end this. Here was supposed to be something to end this, but I forgot it. I feel a bit better after putting this togedher.

The other late stuff is in my other posts, but it's baffled too.

So thank you for reading and responses. 

I am sorry about grammar and how confused is this shit.

124,I need to share this so it’s not just in my head... *TRIGGER WARNING*⚠️ GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF RAPE + INTENSE EMOTIONS,"TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 
GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF RAPE + INTENSE EMOTIONS

when I was 17, I was raped vaginally, anally, and orally over and over again for about 3 hours. I was a virgin saving myself for marriage and had never been kissed before. I have healed so much in the past 10 years... which I think is why repressed memories are starting to resurface.

the other day, an absolutely horrific memory suddenly came back. as he brutally raped me orally after he had raped me several times, he told me over and over, “you’re a slut. you’re a whore.” he also forced me to repeat it and say, “I’m a slut. I’m a whore.” when I had this flashback, it was like I could feel the filth, the disgust, the self-hatred, the shame all over again. 

for so many years, deep down I have felt like a slut and whore because of what he did to me and forced me to do. that he ruined me and made me a whore. he knew I was a virgin and I believe that his goal that night was to make me feel that way. he told me, “no one will ever want you after I’m done with you”

the emotional pain is resurfacing. so much shame. it’s unbearable. his words echoing in my head as he raped me repeatedly in every way possible. “you’re a slut. you’re a whore.”

it hurts."
125,What does acceptance mean to you?,"So, I just had this conversation with my psychologist. I am struggling with PTSD and general anxiety disorder and have come to understand that instead of accepting my feelings i’ve been fighting them/pushing them away. So my psychologist asked me to think about what acceptance means to me, and what it would mean for me to accept something. As this is a very hard question I was wondering how you guys look at acceptance. And maybe it could help you guys too."
126,How do i not get attached to everyone who’s nice to me?,"i have very bad social anxiety, so i’m not the type of person to just go up and talk to someone. Because of this, i tend to only really ever have a few ongoing relationships at once, and it’s usually outgoing people who are very socially relaxed and for whatever reason feel like they can help me. Whenever this happens, i always go through this annoying process of confusion that leads to obsession. it’s not like a crush at all, it’s more just like i look at myself as not worth getting to know so when people make an effort to be in my life i get weird feeling of indebtedness and i can’t think about anything other than them and wondering why they want to help me. And it’s not like i have the confidence to actually make any real progress so i just kinda live in this uncomfortable state of confusion until they inevitably exit my life.

This is really annoying and has happened like 3 times and i want it to stop but i have no clue how, so i was hoping someone here would have some advice.

Thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to respond."

128,Low-cost alternatives to individual therapy,"**\[I mention the names of a few apps and online services. It is by no means an endorsement\]**

Roughly 1 out of every 4 Americans suffer from some kind of mental health issue. However, taking care of mental health issues like depression and anxiety takes a sustained investment of time, money, and sometimes meeting multiple therapists. Not everyone has the necessary insurance coverage or financial resources to access or afford individual therapy from mental health professionals whose rates range anywhere from $150 - $200 per session. I personally know of several people that have faced these challenges and read quite a few posts made on Reddit and other online forums about the same. Fortunately, there are alternatives that might fit better within the budgets of financially strapped folks. Let’s look at some of them.

Mental Health Apps and online therapy ($$$)

Just about everyone has a smartphone and many use them to download games and apps for entertainment and learning purposes. One area where apps have made significant inroads is in the health and wellness space including mental health. Mindfulness and meditation apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) and [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) have become quite popular but they do come with a steep annual fee putting them out of reach for many. Besides apps, online therapy sites like BetterHelp and TalkSpace have become quite popular. These companies offer subscriptions anywhere from $50-$100/week which allows one to text or chat with a therapist at any time. Some even offer telehealth which is very convenient for folks that cannot travel or do not have access to therapists where they live.

Therapists that charge on a sliding scale ($$)

It may sound unusual and also surprising to some that there are therapists out there that will charge a fee based on your income hence the term sliding scale. The best way to find a therapist that has a sliding scale is to check out their website or simply call their office and ask. You can also check out organizations like [**OpenPath Psychotherapy Collective**](https://openpathcollective.org/) which provides affordable, in-office and online psychotherapy sessions between $30 and $60 (between $30 and $80 for couples &amp; family sessions). They do however charge a one-time fee of $59 that gives you access to licensed therapists at these reduced rates as long as you can show a financial need.

Free or low-income mental health services ($)

Low-fee or free community mental health clinics are a great option for those that don’t have health insurance and/or are unable to pay out-of-pocket for the mental healthcare they need. These clinics are usually run by charities that may be associated with [**large religious**](https://www.archindy.org/cc/bloomington/programs-mental.html) or public health nonprofit organizations. They provide a wide range of services including individual and family counseling, medication management, and drug addiction counseling. They’re also equipped to treat a wide range of psychological concerns, like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. These clinics are staffed by psychotherapists and psychologists, and also employ psychologists, mental health counselors, and social workers that are still in training. Your local public library or NAMI chapter should be able to provide you more information on how to locate these services.

Crisis and suicide prevention hotlines

Mental health emergencies like [suicidal thoughts require](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) immediate psychiatric care and attention. Hotlines staffed by trained volunteers and professionals can be called 24/7 and are able to provide emotional support and can usually help locate the necessary assistance.

Local support groups ($)

Support Group can be defined as any group of people that meets regularly to support one another through a difficult time or issue that can be considered a support group. Many are aware of Addiction support groups, however, there are groups for all kinds of issues and illnesses such as depression, PTSD, victims of domestic violence, and people with sick parents or children for example.

Support Groups by nature are very flexible and work around the schedules of participating members. There are very expectations around regular attendance or time commitment. The composition of the groups can vary from meeting to meeting and the topics may be very different from week to week. There are no special qualifications or training required to facilitate a Support group. They may participate but mostly take care of keeping the group organized and keep the discussion moving forward in a positive direction. The power of Support Groups is really quite simple - it shows people that they are not alone in their struggles and learning from other people who have had similar experiences on how to cope and keep moving forward in their own lives can be quite powerful and effective. Some support groups like AA are usually free or charge a small fee to cover for administration costs."
129,Help- always feel anxious/irritable,"For no reason at all, sometimes only for about 15-30 minutes or so I will get angry and annoyed for no reason at all. This usually happens 4-5 times a day. And I don’t know why.

I do know it has to do with stress(cortisol), though that’s what commonly makes people irritable. But I’m not stressed that much and sometimes it just happens  when I’m laying on the couch. I feel like I could wrestle a bear. 

I can answer any follow-up questions you have. Most people don’t understand how far advice goes on this site- if you respond I greatly appreciate it."
130,I’ve come to a realization recently,"I don’t really know if this is going to translate well to other people, but I can feel myself mentally deteriorating and I feel like a child again. I’m a 19 year old guy but I have to constantly stop myself from throwing temper tantrums when I’m alone in my car because of past events and just self hatred in general.  I think I have a fear of abandonment and a lack of object permanence, which doesn’t make relationships easy at all for obvious reasons. It makes me controlling when in reality I know there’s no reason to be, but I haven’t been able to stop it over the past 4-5 years. I feel like I can’t love anyone because of how my brain is, I’m questioning if I even love my family, and I want to change it but I don’t really know if that’s possible anymore. 
I want to bring it up to a therapist, but I know the questions about past events will come up and I don’t have much of a memory before grade 8. I’m constantly fighting with the idea of not being here anymore no matter how badly I want to be, and I just don’t know where to go from here. I’m hoping more experienced people on here can help me get some insight into this and help me figure out where to go next. 
Thanks."
131,"I hate it when people see my message, and still decide to ignore me.","I fucking hate this. Like seriously. I'm not talking about this happening once or twice. I can understand that. But when it keeps on repeating, that just feels shitty. like seriously. All it takes is a ""I'm not interested in talking to you"" why can't people fucking say that?"
132,How do I help my husband and our daughter?,"My husband had a rough childhood,  which involved being dropped off at a boy's home with his younger brother when he was 8.  It also involved a lot of family counseling which didn't help reunification because his father is a narcissist and wouldn't pay enough child support so his mother could afford to raise him and his brother.  His mother also, after her divorce from his father, put her significant others before my husband.   There's one instance which he keeps bringing up, where he was out and needed a ride home, his mother pulled up to talk to him, and she refused to give him a ride home because she had to get home to her girlfriend.   His mom is bi.  

In my 20+ years with him, his issues with things from his childhood have become more problematic.   He refuses to go to therapy to deal with these things.  He still has nightmares several times a week where he wakes me up because he's yelling at his parents. This has gone on the last 25 years.  And, our 13 year old daughter us battling anxiety and depression and she and her dad have a tumultuous relationship.  She thinks he hates her.  She has sensitivity issues-mostly with loud noises. If I even raise my voice a little, it's like yelling to her.  She has expressed suicidal tendencies. 

I want my husband to go to therapy with her to try and understand what she's going through and work things out.  I even gave him an ultimatum to go to therapy or move out.  He said he'd rather leave.  He is the one who triggers her suicidal episodes, so that's why I want him to go.  I already go and meet with her therapist.   He says she's being a drama queen and this is all for attention.  She has said that she has tried to strangle herself and suffocate herself. I don't know if that's true. 

I am at a loss of what to do.  I feel like I can't reprimand my daughter even a little without her blowing up over it.  I have to be able to be a parent and not let her do whatever the Hell she wants.  Is it possible my husband has had trauma related to therapy and that's why he's so resistant to it?  He is taking antidepressants and antianxiety meds plus adderall.

Any input would be helpful at this point.  I am going back to my therapist to see if she can help me sort this out.  I am seriously looking at ending my 22 year marriage over this.  I am also going through treatment for breast cancer and will be starting radiation at the end of the month.  My life is kinda shit right now."
133,"Suicidal friend, need help","So a few years ago I made a friend over discord whom I have been talking to ever since. We have never met in person as we live in different countries. I am about a year older than them and a few months ago they tried to commit suicide. Before this we had often had long talks about depression and suicide, and from what I’ve gathered from them their parents are quite neglectful, and are in a pretty bad environment at home. Almost always I had to try and convince them things would get better and that suicide was not the answer. Despite being hospitalised and undergoing therapy since their failed attempt they still feel the same and their parents don’t seem to be any better. I have constantly been trying to convince them to hang on a little longer, to see the therapy through, but I’ve just found out they have decided a date to do it. I feel like I am unfit to support them and that I am the only one doing anything to stop them from committing suicide. I don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like I can’t keep trying to convince them not to do it as it’s not going to solve the problem. I don’t know what do to and I don’t want them to leave"
134,Through my peripherals I sometimes see people dancing in the dark and trying to get my attention,"Idk what this is, I’m really curious as I can’t really find much information online. I’m literally in bed right now staring at my phone as I have 2 people dancing to the left of me and 2 on my right watching my screen. They seem to wave a lot in attempts to grab my attention, maybe so I can join in? I’m not even sure. Sometimes they’re just talking to each other, whispering, gossiping or just chatting as if they’re in some party/club scene. They’re all mute and soundless and exist only in my peripheral vision, if I try to look head on they disappear and reappear once I look forward/away from them again. Sometimes there’s men sometimes women and sometimes both. They seem to really like parting and the dancing is all upbeat. I rarely have these occurrences but when they do occur they can get pretty distracting and therefore frustrating. While writing this more “people” have joined this “party”. Anyone know what this is?"
135,Happy memories went away,"Hey guys 
So I don't know if this is normal or not but for some reason I forget all the happiness that was once in my life a lot of the time all I could remember were all the negatives I was like this for a while and still slip into this depression . I'm curious to know if this has ever happened to anyone else have you ever forgot great moments in your life due to all the bad ? And what helped you to see things differently ?"
136,My urine is really dark yellow and I did a test strip that showed the urobilinogen is really high. Guess that’s what I get from drinking all of that alcohol and energy drinks. I have spina bifida so I already have a urologist I see regularly. Going to discuss this with him.,I think I’m going to regret how I treated my physical health.
137,Can anyone give me advice?,"During the last few month I have been feeling really bad. I start crying if people stress me too much and I am so scared to talk to people. I have also been feeling really empty and get tired of talking to people. I have already broken contact with 2 of my best friends because I'm too scared of texting them because I think I'm going to say something wrong or that if I text them that I just look like I'm desperate for attention. In short, I'm just tired and scared of interacting with people. I have told my mom this probably 5 times but she always forces me to go on holiday with the people that make me feel the worst because they are so loud and outgoing. I tell her about my feelings and she tells me that it's normal and that I just have to try harder at interacting with people. She doesn't understand when I tell her that interacting with people makes me feel physically ill and that doing stuff with people I don't know that well makes me what to curl up in a ball and cry. That makes me feel really bad. I dont know who to talk to. Does anyone have advice on what I should do?"
138,"i have attention span of a cat maybe less than a cat, its completely impossible for me to pay attention for longer than 15 seconds, i cant read long articles or stories or instructions.",i dont know if this is Mental issue or not but who knows.
139,I'm allowed to be angry,"I had - and still have - no one. I'm not the depressed person who can't get close to people and pushes them away. I don't wreck relationships. I don't have a good life that I can't enjoy.

Everything is really absolute dogshit. I had no one. I was alone through these years. I made my mistakes alone, and never could share them with anyone. I did all my learning alone. I can't even get a therapist since they're all so stupid they can't hold a conversation.

I made this bed and I can't lie asleep in it, and it's my fault, but how far can you go when you always go alone?"
140,How I'm self healing from narcissistic abuse &amp; psychosis.,"I was raised by a narcissist (and his flying monkeys) who was psychologically, financially,  verbally and physically abusive. 

I moved out of the house at age 18, struggled for a couple years but I kept going. I'm finally at a point in my life where I can reflect on my traumatic past. 

I'm still healing, and learning that this could be a life long process.  Thankfully, I have a patient and caring husband.  

I sat down to talk about [the different ways I'm self healing ](https://youtu.be/JK8cEckvlf4)...including taking weekly baths with CBD bathbombs.  

I live in Colorado where weed is recreational, but if you're in a nonrec state, I'd just use Dr. Teal's Epsom salt (the lavender one), dried flowers and essential oils. They relax the body. 

I also journal and write poetry alot. If I need to do something more tactile to really rest my mind, I cook. 

Cooking, gardening, or any tactile activity that forces you to concentrate on specific tasks really helps. Especially when you have intrusive thoughts.  

Let me know if my video helps in any way and if you'd like me to do another."
141,SAD sufferers: Should you go any higher than 10000 Lux?,"Is any higher more effective?
What's the best distance?"
142,We have no control,"If you lost your mind I doubt if you'd know it. You could be reduced to a hermit eating moldy bread on the side of the street and know nothing else. All it takes is one little thing in your mind to go wrong. You are trapped in your own mind in your own body. At the mercy of whatever is going on within you. But not knowing what actually is. All you know is what you've seen. But people don't have to tell the truth. According to probabilities there is probably one person out there who never heard a single truth in his entire existence. That person could be you, and guess what? You'll never know."
143,Known truths,Perspective is everything. Nothing is good or bad. Thinking makes it so. Be kinder to yourselves. Go to therapy. Message me if you need help finding a therapist.
144,I need to talk to someone,"I can't afford a therepist, I'm going to call the hotline but this goes beyond just me. My mental health has been a clusterfuck the past couple months and I'm going to need to explain a lot to anyone who's willing to listen. So preferably I would need someone to PM me, it will make more sense once I explain"
145,Need to end relationship,"There is a girl at my school who is mentally ill, and considers me to be one of her best friends, i dont feel the same at all. i need to end this relationship because its beginning to strain me mentally but its hard because im scared that i will hurt her. If anyone has advice i would appreciate it."
146,I cut off my toxic father today.,"[M23] 
Today I made the decision to cut off my father. He is the true source of all of my problems, including my depression and anger issues. He has a psychological effect on my brain that no one other human being is capable of. He makes it impossible for me to voice my issues when we're in an argument, leading him to believe that I'm so far gone and a baby. He has said some of the most unspeakably horrible things to me, the most recent time being when my car broke down on a very busy major road in a dangerous area. I don't know enough about cars to find and fix the problem. People were screaming and honking at me, I was absolutely terrified. My father is the only parent I have down here as my mom fled to NY after he cheated on her for 20 years then divorced HER. So I call him in desperate need of help and support, and he starts screaming at me, telling me to shut up and that I'm ""getting him in trouble"" by leaving and coming to help me. I was already so terrified, and the feeling of my own father screaming at me to shut up and that I'm ""acting like a girl"" was so unbelievably heartbreaking. I just let him yell. He shows up, I immediately start thanking him, he says ""shut up, get in the car"". We push the car out of the way, I thank him again and he tells me I'm a bitch and not a real man. I say ""I thought my father would be the most supportive person to contact in this situation"" and he again tells me to shut up and that I'm a pussy. Sounds like I'm joking huh? That's how ridiculous he is. Today, I voiced my displeasure about how he talked to me that night, and he took my fucking car from me. My CAR. Now I have no way to and from work, and I'm likely gonna get kicked out of my apartment because I was recently unfairly terminated and can't pay rent. He knew I was in a bad spot too, and he just blatantly made it worse. I feel so lost and defeated. Why does he have to treat me like this? And then he blames me for everything, saying that I'm ungrateful and disrespectful, when HE caused all of the problems in my life. I cut him off and I honestly feel amazing. Now I can finally move on."
147,Should I take these pills? Will they make me feel better?,"I feel like there's just nothing to life anymore. 

I'm in school, doing something that only really serves to make me unhappy because otherwise my dad would kick me out. I'm deeply insecure over my own attractiveness and that makes me feel like my girlfriend hates me. All my friends don't invite me to parties and act like I'm a chore to be around. I'm constantly irrationally paranoid and just feel like everything and everyone is out to get me. 

I can't move out because my part time job doesn't allow it, I've been going to the gym and even picked up a new skincare routine to improve my self-image, and I've even been doing breathing exercises to calm me down. None of it works and I'm sick of being anxious and miserable all the time. Yesterday I convinced myself my girlfriend was cheating on me with her best friend when she isn't (for one) bi and her friend and I are on good terms.

My brother suffers from severe anxiety and depression and I stole some of his pills from an prescription he'd forgotten about. I just don't want to feel this awful anymore, because the point of life is getting tedious. Is this what it'll be like forever?"

150,Help for a friend (BPD),"I’ve been worried about a good friend of mine for a while. I am no psychiatrist, but ever since I’ve known him, he displays all the hallmark symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. He was recently kicked out of his apartment and while he has been able to keep a fairly successful sales job, I worry that his career will become the next casualty.  In his latest impulsive decision, he purchased a gun, which prompted increased alarm from me and his other friend. I don’t believe he is a danger to society, but he surely could be a danger to himself if his mood abruptly turns (as it often does).

Is there anything I can do to help him other than just being supportive and not cutting him out of my life? Any suggestions on how to approach talking to him about getting help?"
151,Schizophrenia,"Trigger warning ⚠️ 

I’ve got so many voices inside my head,
my Schizophrenia’s keeping them fed,
I’m starting to feel lost within myself,
think I’m turning into someone else.


I’m always planning my escape,
before my brain can escalate.

“I can’t find it,
where’s the door?
I don’t think we’ve been here before.”


Fight or flight is kicking in,
I can feel it in my skin.
My heart is pounding through my chest,
what is this?
I feel possessed.


“They’re out to get you,
stay at home,
you know it’s best to leave them alone.”

I can feel the panic taking over,
struggle keeping my composure,
start to shake uncontrollably,
I think the demons got ahold of me.


I’ve tried to drown them out,
but my head is in a drought,
my mind goes blank,
I’m in a daze,
somehow my body operates.


What was that?
I heard the door.

“Maybe you should go explore.” 

The hallucinations are back again,
no one’s there,
there had never been.


It’s okay,
I’m not crazy,
things are just a little hazy.

“Who are you kidding?
You’re so deranged,
stop walking around like anything’s changed!”


I just want to make my family proud,
but these voices are getting so loud,
they push me down,
to the ground,
I think I hear them laughing now. 

What’s so funny?

“It’s a game,
if you want to win you’ve got to play,
so pick a card and roll the dice,
Maybe tomorrow we’ll be nice.”

I picked a card,
they flipped The Fool,
I guess that means I’m just a tool,
a vessel meant for them to rule.
Which means tomorrow they’ll still be here,
emphasizing my every fear.

“Just close your eyes,
and relinquish your mind,
it’s time for you to say goodbye,
put that gun to your head,
we’ll be gone once your mind is dead.”

I’ve got the gun,
now there’s one in the chamber,
but let me leave you with this one disclaimer.

When I pulled the trigger,
my body collapsed,
then somewhere between life and death overlapped,
and my demons found their way through the cracks.

Now everything’s dark,
and it’s so damn scary,
I’m trapped with my demons,
in solitary"

155,How to deal with feeling empty?,"its not all the time. Once or twice a month I get these weird moods where I feel like theres a gaping hole in my stomach and I dont know what causes it or how to get rid of it... sometimes when I’m feeling like this I just cry and I’m not even sure why, I just do.

anyone know what this is and how to deal with it?"
156,How to stay interested in something?,"I didn't really know where else to put this but I really felt like I should try to get advice from someone because this is making me feel more and more down each day. 

So I got Pokemon Shield 2 months ago, and I got completely addicted to it. For like a month until I had gotten that game I had been having many days where I was feeling pretty depressed, and just not like myself and it felt pretty awful but I didn't really know how to go back to feeling myself. But when I got addicted to that game and its fandom, it helped so much. Whenever I was feeling sad for no reason the instant I thought of that game, I cheered up almost instantly. It was a really nice distraction from this sadness that, before getting that game, I couldn't really stop feeling. 

Since I had gotten addicted to that, though, I knew I would eventually become less interested in it because that's been happening with things lately. I've been completely dreading that moment. And I knew when it started happening, though I found new videos and things about it to keep me hooked on. It's happening faster and faster and I don't want to let go of this game because it really helps with this weird feeling of not being myself that I've been having. Is there anything I can do to stay interested in something like this? Am I just paying TOO much attention to it, and if I cool down with the game then come back will I be addicted the same as I was when I first started playing it?"

158,"How to be consistent with medication, basic tasks and hygiene?","I have really bad depression and anxiety, I have no energy to do anything and I feel very apathetic and exhausted for nothing. I take 5 medications and I have an app on my phone so it reminds me but I always ignore it, part of me is lazy”I’ll remember later” and another part is that is so many pills it gets annoying and I’m so disorganized.


I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and a psychologist/counseling but my biggest problem is that I don’t do anything. I want to be able to get up and go out to walk, go consistently to the gym, do stuff that used to make me so happy and feel the warm fuzzies again. I want to properly care about how I look and not slack at all in my hygiene.


 I just feel very numb, the suicidal thoughts have decreased quite a bit but my anxiety is really bad still. I’ve got an amazing support group but I isolate myself a lot too. I’m also stressed trying to find something to do and the energy to do so because I’m freeloading with my grandparents for a bit while I get my treatment and a bunch of other stuff my family wants to try to see if it would help, since it’s cheaper here to get medicine compared to the US. 


I do want to do stuff and try to be as well rounded as my dented self can be, but I struggle even with the simple thing of swallowing pills twice a day consistently, I stay in my pajamas all week and my teeth have gotten spots too.

160,Job wrecking havoc on my mental health?,"Should I quit my job?

Hello! I am a psych tech at a big university hospital. I am on the psych ward and my patients have severely behavioral and mental issues. I get verbally abused by patients (constantly swearing at me, telling me they’ll rape me, to f*** off.) at other units in the hospital the staff has the right legally to refuse care if a patient is acting this way. But since it’s a psych unit- it’s accepted. 

It seems to be effecting my mental health. My coworkers aren’t friendly, they never break me and I have to be on the unit at all times while they’re all sitting in the nurses station on their phones. I’ve talked to them about this and they roll their eyes and are like I’ll be out a little later. I went five hours today having to pee SO badly. 

I have applied to nursing school and find out the decision in two weeks. It is back in my home state across the country and I would be going home in August for that. I’m not sure if it’s worth staying at this job for 6 more months, or find a new one? It’s recking havoc on my mental health and I dread coming to work. 

Only positive is my schedule, three twelves in a row, but I was told in interview I’ll be working nights when now they switched me to days. I hate days. 

Thank you!"
161,Undiagnosed but...,"
F(17) I honestly don’t even know what I’m trying to achieve by writing this post but I don’t know how to help myself. I think I have anxiety and depression, and some sort of CPTSD. (I know it’s not right to self-diagnose but I’m not saying this lightly). 

I’m constantly in a state of mind where I overthink everything and make my “depression” worse by degrading myself and my actions. I have extremely low self confidence and compare myself to others everyday, undermining my achievements/intelligence/hard work. I’m always reminded by my classmates that I’m extremely smart but I just don’t agree with them. (Please don’t take this as bragging, I am being genuine.) I’m simply good at beating the curriculum but I don’t feel a sense of real intelligence. 
I mispronounced a word a few days ago in class and I am 100% positive that no one noticed and I keep telling myself that but the scenario keeps replaying in my head. This is a more minuscule example of something that clouds my mind but the most recent one. I could go on and on about which issues have occupied my mind for days on end but I think you get the point. I cry myself to sleep every night and it’s almost like an automatic response to let out all the sadness inside of my body. It’s not a wailing type of crying, I’m completely silent and I simply let my tears roll down and soak my pillow. 

I’m nearly sure I have anxiety because of the racing thoughts in my mind and I’m careful of what I say because I’m afraid of being ridiculed. I make an effort everyday at school to say only what I think will receive a good response (laughter, approval, etc.) I revise everything before I say it and play possible scenarios in my head and my mind reminds me without fail what happened that last time I tried to make a joke. I don’t feel a real connection with any of my friends but I do like them. However, I wouldn’t miss any of them and I don’t make efforts to get to know them better and certainly do not tell them about my mental state. I never tell anybody about what goes on in my mind because it always comes out sounding like I’m making excuses to be sad. But then I think about how shitty everyone’s life must be if they’re going through the same thing as me. I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem normal but what if I’m just being over-dramatic?

That’s not nearly half of what I want to say but I don’t want to bore you guys. Any idea on what to do in my situation? 

f.y.i. I have no access to a mental health specialist/therapist/hospital until later this year. I have nobody to lean on right now."

163,How to stay interested in something that makes me happy?,"I don't really know if this goes here but I'm not sure where else to post this.

Since around November, the majority of days I've been feeling pretty sad for no reason and not like myself. Though, two months ago I got this game and I got into the fandom and become completely addicted to it. There were so many videos and things to watch, and it really helped distract me during those off days. Whenever I would feel depressed I would think about this fandom and it would instantly cheer me up. I can't think of another fandom or game that's made me this happy in years.

The past couple weeks or so, though, I've found myself not as interested. I am craving that excited feeling but I am rarely getting it anymore from watching the videos about the game, or reading fan fiction, or even playing it sometimes. I'm trying so hard to make myself feel the same way I was feeling about it before but I keep feeling like I've overloaded my brain too much with the game and now I have nothing left to watch or see about it that will make me interested.

I heard that if I become interested in something else then come back it will be interesting to me again, but I really don't have any motivation to become interested in something else. Not only that, but like I said this game has made me so happy lately that I don't want to let go, even if it's not as fun now as it was. I just want to be excited about this specific game and fandom again, but I don't know how. Is there anything I can do?"

166,Tips on battling anxiety?,"So I am a rising junior in college. I am a very quiet and isolated person and have very limited friends. Freshmen year while everyone was off making friends and doing fun things, I was always doing my own thing and being isolated and staying in my room. I have always been really shy, and doing new things gives me a lot of anxiety, so I always avoided social situations instead of fighting the anxiety. I did a lot of stupid things freshmen year and I was just always quiet so the people on my floor didn't talk to me much either. The few friends I did make, we just did not get along very well in the end. I did make a close friend who introduced me to all the cool and crazy things and I realized that I actually enjoyed doing fun and new things, even though I may be uncomfortable at first.

So now fast forward to present day, I have a very bad relationship with my suitemates and we do not get along and my roommate who is my close friend is never in the room so I barely, if ever, see her. I really only have probably three friends total. Now I have sort of come to the realization that I need to change something about myself, be more outgoing and open to new things and battle the anxiety that I get instead of avoiding it. I don't want people to be stuck with that bad impression of me from freshmen year because I have learned and grown since then and learned from my mistakes. However my concern is that is it too late? By now people already have their friend groups set and I feel like they wouldn't wanna include more people in their friend groups. Has anyone been in a similar situation and can give tips on where to start? And on how to battle this social anxiety and shyness that I get? Any help or tips would be appreciated :)

This is honestly really starting to affect my mental health because I constantly feel anxious, I think oh am I stuck like this forever? Will I ever grow out of this phase in my life and make lifelong friends? Sometimes it really just makes me feel like I can't do anything in my life and I am just stuck with people having bad impressions of me or spreading rumors and I just wish someone could help me out or give me tips on how I can handle this. I feel so alone and it's making me feel so depressed and anxious everyday."
167,My parents are paying for my university. Today I told them I am taking a semester break to stop thinking about dying a little less.,"‘How are we supposed to feel?’

168,"Social anxiety, loneliness, and not being able to move on. Does anyone have any advice or reasoning?","I believe I am an empath and am very sensitive to the reactions of other people. I've learned to be present overtime, but later on, when I am alone, I tend to overthink situations. I have always faced a good deal of social anxiety throughout my life, but I think I know how to conceal it well. 

Over the years, I've been thankful enough to have both my parents and a loving sister. My family has been there for me. They are sometimes overprotective, but overall, I am allowed to be independent and have never been controlled or forced to do anything. My parents always gave me the freedom to make my own choices. 

I also used to have a childhood best friend, and she was some times manipulative, but I never thought of myself as the type to get stepped over. I guess growing up, I did have many fall outs with my so called "" best-friends"" and was kinda bullied by my 1st grade friends group, but nothing serious. I remember spending days on the playground alone and feeling upset about it.  Always feeling abandoned by my previous ""best friends"" the next year. Eventually, I also fell out with my childhood best friend and we ""broke up"". It was pretty painful for me. 

Following that, in college, I had a few fall outs with other friends due to drama, and now...I don't really get too close to people. I enjoy their company, spend time with them, and have fun - but I feel that they don't know the real me. We also don't hang out that often for me to call them a close friend. These days I feel hyper sensitive when people don't respond to me, or they blow me off. I feel so hurt and alone, even when I have my family here with me. 

A couple years ago, I started talking to some guy online, and when I met him he wasn't what I expected. He showed me narcisstic behavior, and couldn't tolerate it. So I cut him off. I still feel like the abandoned one though. I keep crying over him and feeling upset, when he was just a jerk to me. There is nothing to like about him, but I keep wishing I could get that close to someone again. It doesn't seem to happen. All of this just makes me hopeless."
169,What advice would you give to someone who feels insecure about their appearance?,"I’ve been trying to work on being more positive about my appearance for a couple of months and it’s been pretty hard. It’s not as simple as “be nice to yourself!” I’m a lil overweight and I’ve been like that for the past five years. I obviously have tried diets and exercise but nothing has been helping me. I just want tips on how to improve my self-love and positivity. I hate feeling bad about myself so if there’s any tips I can learn, that would be great."
170,How can I increase my self-esteem?,"I view myself as just not being up to the same standard as your average 26 year.  I’ve got a part time job and had to drop out of uni from ill health so I’ve only got a general degree instead of Honours.  Had to move back in with my parents and only just passed my driving test.  Im average build, fairly tall, been told im good looking but dont see it and I have decent social skills and know how to dress.

But, I just feel like I’m worthless all the time.  I put far too much emphasis on what people think of me and I seek their approval to determine my worth.  So,  how do I learn to like myself?  Do I try and meet my high expectations for where I should be?  Do I lower them and become more content?  Do I ignore all that and just go out and try to enjoy life?  Any help would be nice"

172,I need advice,"Hi, I am a high school student in an extremely competitive county (aka if you have below a 4.2 gpa and 1450 SAT you are considered stupid which is a whole other problem but not the point of this). Despite this, I have never really gotten too stressed or had a mental breakdown or anything of the sort and I’ve always felt that I‘be been pretty stable and happy in terms of mental health. However, two weeks ago my grandmother died, which completely shook me to the core. I’m not even sure why because we weren’t that close but it shattered me. As a preface, I never cry and I’m the person that my friends come to for emotional support, but for the past two weeks I’ve had no motivation to do any work and I cry every other day. I am a straight A student and I have my SAT coming up in a couple of weeks, but because of this, I can’t concentrate and I just don’t know what to do. My grades are dropping and I put on a front at school because I don’t really know why but I don’t want my friends to know. I guess I just don’t want their pity because if anyone hugs me and says I’m so sorry I will instantly burst into tears. I just don’t know what to do. I talked to two of my teachers and they are both amazing to talk to and offered to give me on extensions with whatever I need, but I feel like since I’m barely doing any work, I shouldn’t get even more behind on my assessments and work by taking those extensions. I’m from a family that is not the biggest advocate of mental health, but I just want things to go back to normal. Please, please can someone give me some advice on what to do."

I've been to my GP about mental health before and have been referd to the CAMHS program but i don't hve the corrage to mention this to them as i don't want anyone finding out about these thoughts. in all honesty i think i'm a bit ashed to think this.

Though, I'm starting to wonder when I'll get to a point where I just don't care anymore because I'm so tired. And I'm tired right now.

175,Is there something wrong with me? (18M),"I can’t  seem to get over my ex girlfriend no matter how hard I try. We went out for about a month and broke up seven months ago. Everyone I talk to says it’s ok that I’m still not over it but let’s be honest, that’s not normal for the length of time involved. I still look at her Instagram almost daily and last night I got so sad that I drank alcohol to try and feel better. I’m so ashamed of that and I don’t want it to become a habit. I’m 18. This has been plaguing me for the last seven months and I just don’t know what to do, it makes me feel so small. Any advice you can give would be so very appreciated. Ever since we broke up I’ve been going through the worst mental health battle of my life, felt suicidal a few times and been depressed more times than I can count. I see a therapist every two weeks but I’m too embarrassed to admit to her how much I’m not over this. I seemed to be making progress and I don’t want her to think I’m some kind of stalker or weirdo because I’m not. I’m just a kid that went through his first break up and just can’t deal with it. I think I must have some underlying mental health issues, because like I said, this can’t be normal.

Anyone have any advice/insight?"

Since I've got older I've had to learn to manage it, and to an extent this has been successful. However, since I hit my 20s I have began experiencing a very uncomfortable aching in my chest.

I sat down and my knees started shaking and I felt extreme fear. Typically, I don’t have any issues meeting people and I get along fine with just about everyone. 

I’m not sure how I should respond when she asks me what I thought of him because I have no reason to dislike him, but I do.

I'm tired of living, all the problems in my life will take years to maybe resolve and I've run out of will,I have nothing to live for."
180,"so, what's my issue?","i'll start off by saying that there is nothing in my life i'd say was a traumatic experience. i come from a military background in life, and thus, grew up without a father figure as he was deployed during my early childhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've always had an interest in odd things, not the normal playful kid. i'd stick around in the classroom when everyone else went outside and spend time exploring imaginary concepts in my head. this obviously reflected on my relationship with my father, as he felt as if i were antisocial. both of my parents were always very critical of my grades throughout my education, if i brought back home anything less than an A, i'd be told off because 'it is not my maximum potential'.

&amp;#x200B;

eventually we packed up our bags and moved, leaving behind our old life and starting anew in a new country. i slowly found myself growing more and more careless about school, and no matter how hard i were to be grounded, i really had no reason to bother improving.

&amp;#x200B;

shortly after, we moved yet again, to a bigger city. i left behind my friends and my first serious relationship. slowly i plummeted into ""depression"" as an angsty teenager and didn't bother socializing. my toxicity and selfishness caused the relationship i had to fall apart, for the better, thank god. i slowly discovered how substances like alcohol can act as vices for whatever i was feeling during the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

relatively shortly after me graduating my second to last year of high school, we moved again. i discovered marijuana and i've been using it to relax my mind ever since the mid-term of my last year at high school. that being said, i didn't do it all too often due to lack of money, and my parents not letting me go out and find a job of my own, saying that my studies should be a priority.

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to the end of the school year, i've graduated (barely) and i didn't bother showing up to the graduation ceremony. we decided to move yet again, to a small city where tuition fees for university would be much cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

i really had no motivation to enroll to university, but i was forced into it regardless. i am studying a subject that i should enjoy, considering my hobbies and my background. hell, i even picked subjects that i'm somewhat remotely interested in. i haven't made any friends since the start of my bachelor's degree, and i don't feel like there is that many options here for me to meet people. sure, i can try the bar, but i'm not in the mood for continuous one-night stands nor do i feel like i am capable of managing, or even deserving of a relationship. even if i do try to just meet new people to hang out with, i can't due to lack of money. and yes, i still get cockblocked from getting a job.

&amp;#x200B;

lately, it's gotten a lot worse. i can no longer focus in class, i can no longer focus on my hobbies. even if i stop smoking marijuana (which is the only substance that i consistently abuse), it doesn't improve by much. i've taken numerous breaks and even reduced how much i am using in an attempt to taper off completely but to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

currently my daily routine consists of at least two panic attacks (on the way to, and back from university), procrastination and sleep. i have an amazing opportunity to start life right at 18 and build a safe future for myself, but i am unable to take it due to my lack of focus and motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

my main issue is the blissful ignorance everyone in my family is embracing, throughout the years. i've not once been shy to talk about my problems with them, they're my family for god's sake, right? i love them with all my heart and i'm pretty sure they have no bad intentions either. but whenever i do bring up my issues, it falls off as me ""making excuses for problems that aren't real"". for the last four years this has been the norm for me, and i've realized that asking them for help or even attempting to talk about my issues will lead to nothing productive.

&amp;#x200B;

i've booked an appointment with my general practitioner this week, so hopefully something useful surfaces from that. i do feel like i am wasting their time, maybe this is all in my head and i should let real people with real problems get help instead of wasting everyone's time.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm just unable to tell what's my problem? why am i depressed / anxious / whatever? am i even experiencing problems with my mental health? or am i just being a lazy fuck looking for an excuse out of life

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

my parents have high standards and dad is ex-military. moved about four times in the span of four years. don't care about how well/bad i do in my education anymore. unable to focus on hobbies i used to enjoy. family doesn't seem to give a shit about my issues, still love them to death. booked an appointment with doc. what do?"
181,Getting diagnosed has pretty much just made me more confused and unsure,"I just feel like I have no idea what's going on with my head and I can never tell if I actually have symptoms or not.

Thought I had depression in high school. Got diagnosed with depression anxiety. Meds didn't help. Had mood swings. Therapist noticed me talking fast (I was excited about a new pet snake, idk I feel like everyone talks fast when they are excited) my thoughts were racing and I had lots of energy and hyperfocus. I thought I was on the autism spectrum because I stim a lot. Therapist thought I had bipolar. Primary care thought I had ADHD. Got diagnosed with adhd and bipolar by psych. 

Was later hospitalised and diagnosed with ADHD bipolar borderline personality eating disorder social anxiety and probably more I can't remember.

Just all of these illnesses have so much symptom overlap and I feel like I have a lot of symptoms from all of them, but am also missing key symptoms for all of them.

It's all so jumbled and confusing and means I really have no idea if my meds are working or not and I am always trying to figure out what illnesses I have for sure but I just am never fully confident I have any specific one.

Anyone else feeling lost and unsure? How do you deal with feeling like you don't know what's wrong with you and what is a product of which mental illness etc"
182,Beware of other peoples standards,"Hey folks.

Im a tough man. Just wanted to admit for the first time ive spent the last month on the knife edge of crying without realising why but more importantly being unable to cry. I havent cried in years.

Im currently suffering from insomnia (never thought that would happen) searching my soul to finally turn my brain off and sleep. The answer seems to be that im striving for unrealistic expectations of what i want. Plus noisy neighbours.

That comes from the internet and the instant access to standards i will never meet. The perfect post of 55 deleted photos, the lack of willingness to show vulnerability. Im old fashioned but having a phone eats away at my curiosity and raises my expectations of real people. Its unfair on all of us. 

Collectively we are dealing with a 'rising' standard we will never meet because were too scared to recognise it for what it is.

Even being aware of this i still i cant cry and i know as soon as i do and let go for the first time in along while ill sleep like a baby. Ye i still cant let go.

Please set your own goals and sometimes realise that if you open a box (whether it be a new kink or jealousy or inferiority) it will never be closed and you cant impose that on somebody else. Its unfair, imoral and cheap.

Not long ago you died of war before you laid with a woman or had children. We have too much time but its your time and the more you define yourself with half arsed curious browsing you giving in to something youll never achieve.

Take care of yourself but more imprtantly be careful.

Peace x"
183,Feeling of nothingness,"I’m not sure if this is the right place but my girlfriend recently broke up with me, rather suddenly, through what she says is no fault of my own. We have become distant since despite my best efforts, but she has opened up to me and told me that it is because of mental illness issues she is facing, and that she is struggling and hurting, causing her to feel nothing for me at all, however telling me to research it as she doesn’t like talking about it, hence why i’m here. I want to be able to understand and help her, our friendship, and also myself as the circumstances have had a toll on me too."

I just wanted to make a post to feel like I'm participating. I am about to have a siesta Sunday afternoon nap. Thank you for your posts, there is a lot of inspiration here imho."
185,I’m not sure what to do,"Hi everyone, my name is Erin and I’m a junior in college right now. I’m expecting to graduate next year with a degree in applied behavior analysis. Anyways, some background is when I was in high school, I experienced some bullying from other kids, three intimate relationships that ended so badly I lost friends as well, and a lot of pressure from my parents to do well in school. It would make me want to stay home in bed sometimes, but I still got up and got stuff done. Currently, I have only been diagnosed with OCD, an anxiety disorder, and I have a history of disordered eating. 

Now I am a college student and I live by myself, and ever since I moved into my apartment last August, I have had trouble sleeping and staying awake and I sleep through most of my classes (even the ones at 2pm). I have never experienced this lack of motivation before and I am halfway through the semester at school and barely holding onto my As and Bs in my classes. Even when I am awake to go to class, I sometimes skip anyways because I don’t want to see anyone. I have gone days without any human contact before (including my significant other who doesn’t live with me). My eating habits have gotten really unhealthy and because I sleep a lot, I normally eat my first meal of the day at 4pm or 5pm and my second at 11pm. Thankfully, I haven’t had any negative thoughts about my weight, but I still don’t think my current eating schedule is healthy. Even though I only see my parents a few times a month, I still feel pressure from them to do well and even pretend I’m fine at times so that they don’t suspect anything and try to pull me out of school or something. I believe they have the power to do this because my mom helps me pay for my apartment and I would have no where to go if she stopped helping me. She once threatened to send me to a center for disordered eating the summer before I started college instead of letting me go to college because I had a relapse. I feel like I need help but I’m afraid to ask for it for fear of having to drop out of school. Any suggestions or comments on my situation would be helpful, thank you."
186,memory loss?,I've been doing a lot worse for a while now and I seem to remember less for every day that passes. it's like my memory is gone. does this have to do with the depression or is it just me. does anyone know anything about this?
187,Your mental illness may not be caused by a chemical imbalance - but instead caused by trauma.,"Before you think I'm a crazy conspiracy theorist - hear me out. Clear your brain of what you know about mental illnesses for a moment. This is very long but what I'm about to share with you has changed my life. I reccomend reading the entire post or you may get the wrong idea. This may not apply to everyone but I think it is worth the read. The point of this post is to challenge you to think differently. Even if I get backlash for this - sharing this is so incredibly important to me.

(Fair warning: this may be triggering as I am going to talk about abuse. I also am not a medical professional - I am just sharing my opinion that I believe in very strongly and have done a lot of research on. This is not an anti-medication or anti-mental help post. Please do not let this post invalidate you in any way). 

I'm sure you've heard many times before that mental illnesses are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Maybe you're depressed, so you go to your doctor and are prescribed pills to treat your depression. Maybe you're bi-polar and are taking mood regulators. Have you ever found yourself never feeling completely better (or worse) with medication? Ever go to therapy to help with your diagnosis but never found true relief? Whatever the case may be, did you ever think to yourself ""I just know my illness is caused by something more than simply an imbalance."" I am here to tell you that if you thought that you are probably not wrong. 

When you go to see a psychiatrist or psychologist with symptoms of any mental illness they will whip out their diagnostic manual called the DSM. They will use that to diagnose you based on your symptoms from a list of mental illnesses. From there, you will be treated - most likely with medication. 

When I was a kid, I was diagnosed and treated for numerous things from ADHD, to panic disorder, to Asperger's syndrome. I grew up trying to accept that my brain was just off and that I was born this way. However, something about that always felt wrong to me. Many years later I had a revelation. My ""mental illnesses"" were actually more of a ""mental injury"" from my childhood abuse. My ""illnesses"" were actually my body still reacting to unprocessed traumas I had as a child. It was never *just* a chemical imbalance. All of my diagnosises have been proven to be false.

When I talk of abuse or trauma, I don't just mean being sexual or physical abuse. Abuse or neglect doesn't have to be extreme to affect you. In fact, I assume at least 1/3 of the population has had at least a slightly dysfunctional upbringing. Maybe you saw your dad hit your mom, maybe your parents never listened to what you had to say, maybe you felt unloved and unwanted, maybe you were bullied as a child. Even the most ""simple"" things that you thought everybody went through can and does affect you, even now. Your trauma is valid REGARDLESS of how small you think it is. All trauma is traumatic. Most of you honestly may think your childhood was absolutely normal and your parents weren't neglectful or mean. I advise you to really think that over. And it doesn't even have to be your parents or family either. It could be trauma from a neighbor, a friend, a teacher, anybody. You may not even have a single memory of a trauma, which is common. Traumas, especially when you're a child, are often completely repressed as a way to protect you from pain. Your body will still react to them even if you don't necessarily remember them. There are certain types of therapies, such as EMDR that can help you remember these memories so you can heal from them.

Trauma is also generational. I was abused by my mother very harshly. My mother was abused by her mom, and my grandma was severely abused by hers. When your parents are traumatized - especially as children - they are a lot more likely to bring their trauma onto you. They may not be the best parents because they are struggling with their own traumas. Does this make abuse or neglect okay? NO. But this realization helped me feel less like I was the problem which helped me heal. I believe a lot of parents truly to not believe they're being abusive or neglectful. They're just doing what they know. But it still doesn't make it right.

Your trauma also does not have to just be childhood trauma. It could be any kind. It could be abuse from your lover, abuse from your job, honestly it could be anything. Even ""single"" (normal PTSD) traumas apply. However, I think childhood neglect and abuse traumas are the most forgot of and also the most impactful on us and completely shapes who we are as adults.

I was emotionally and physically abused from an infant until I was an adult. Even so, I always thought that my childhood was normal. I didn't know anything different. When you're young and being abused you do not have the ability to realize that the abuse is not your fault. Your brain cannot think of it any other way. You assume it must be a problem with you. Your parents don't love you because YOU'RE broken. There's obviously something wrong with you - not them.

I was emotionally abused the most. This completely ruined my self esteem. I thought I was broken, stupid, ugly ect because this is what my young brain decided had to be the case. Why else would my parents not love me? It had to be a problem with me. I had no self esteem and hated myself - even as a very young child. Any time were I felt like I was going to be criticized or put in the spotlight to be judged I would go into an emotional flashback. For example, I could not handle talking in front of people. Everyone would notice how horrible I was. This caused me to go into flight mode - a panic attack. I would shake and hyperventilate and would usually run out of the room. My body was reacting to trauma and in that moment just like I was reliving my parents emotional abuse. The rational part of my brain would shut off as it does when someone is having a flashback. I was embarrassed of my own existence. This would typically be diagnosed as panic disorder or social phobia.

My mother abandoned me for a while when I was a child. This of course affected my self esteem but also caused me severe abandonment issues as an adult. For example, if my fiance would make me feel like he was going to leave me, which could even be triggered by something simple like him not responding to my texts, I would go into fight mode. I would emotionally flashback to when my mother left me, but I wouldn't even realize it. The logical part of my brain would shut off and I would scream and yell at my fiance, calling him every name in the book. How dare he leave me??? I would be absolutely convinced he was going to leave me or that he didn't love me anymore. I was on hyper alert for signs of him leaving me constantly - to avoid having him leave me like my mother did. I would say and do so many things when I was in this state I would later regret. I even flushed our engagement ring down the toilet. It was almost like I was mirroring my mother's behavior towards me. After my flashback ended I would always feel awful but I could not control my emotions and actions when I was having a flashback. It was real to me. There was no logical thinking. I also started self harming as a way to release some of my anger during these flashbacks. This would most likely be diagnosed as borderline personality disorder - or BPD. I would most likely be prescribed mood stabilizers. Would the mood stabilizers help? Yes, most likely. But would they actually cure me? NO.

Here's the thing about trauma. Medication can help ease symptoms, but it is never a complete cure. Medications can only mask the real problem. This is where the ""chemical imbalance"" thing starts to make me mad. It's so easy for you to go to a doctor, explain your symptoms and have them prescribe you medications without a second thought. You're conditioned to think of your symptoms as an illness. You're made to believe that your brain just simply isn't working correctly just because it just *isn't*. End of story. You're more or less led to believe that YOU'RE broken and medications should be able to fix you. Don't get me wrong, medications can be amazing. I'm personally on them and I honestly believe I would not be alive if I hadn't started them. They helped stabilize me enough to function. There's nothing wrong with taking medications - but in the case of trauma, they are not the cure. Medication is a great tool but traumas need to be reprocessed for you to actually heal. Mental health professionals should be looking for a root cause before simply slapping you with a diagnosis and medications. I think so many people end up giving up after medications didn't work for them. 

I am not anti-medication. I've tried to talk people who are about to give up on everything to try a different medication because they've tried many and they just didn't work. People who are hitting rock bottom and are giving up. I think the ""chemical imbalance"" thing makes people believe that if medication and talk therapy didn't work for them, they'll never get better. That's why if treatments aren't working for you there's a very large chance it's trauma related. 

This brings me onto the next thing. The kind of trauma that I'm talking about most here is ""complex trauma"" or CPTSD. There are two kinds of PTSD. Single and complex. Single PTSD (the PTSD that you're probably familiar with) is caused by a single traumatizing event like a car crash or witnessing a death. Complex PTSD is from prolonged trauma, like childhood abuse or any continuous abuse that you have little or no escape from. They may seem similar but they are not. I was diagnosed with single PTSD and it did not even remotely fit me. I recommend Googling and comparing the symptoms of the two. And no, you don't have to be a solider to have PTSD. Anyone can have PTSD. 

CPTSD is not an official diagnosis in the DSM - the diagnostic manual that mental health professionals use in America. Many doctors and researchers have tried to get this added but have been completely shut down by the APA. They claim that PTSD is close enough to CPTSD which is absolutely not the case. There's a real reason why they won't add it to the DSM, however. A traumaologist has said that if they were to add CPTSD to the DSM, the DSM in turn would shrink to the size of a thin pamphlet. This means that a majority of the mental illnesses that we know of are actually caused by trauma. This means that, if they actually started treating our mental ""illnesses"" as mental injuries instead, there wouldn't even be a need for as much medication as there is prescribed today. People would actually start healing. They would lose BILLIONS of dollars if that happened. Of course they don't want that.

*I am not saying every single mental illness is caused by trauma. I am also not saying that medications are bad. What I am saying here is that you should do some thinking about your past and if your ""chemical imbalance"" sits right with you.* If I could've seen this post years ago it would've been the most helpful thing in the world. I was not getting the help I needed because the diagnosises I was getting *did not fit me* and the medications *did not cure me* because my problems were caused by my *traumas*. This took me a many, many years to realize. I think millions of people are not getting the help they need because their trauma is going completely unnoticed - even by themselves.

For a lot of trauma survivors, typical talk therapy doesn't help. 
There are many methods of treatment for trauma such as EMDR or ART therapy, which are extremely successful. I think the key is finding a licensed therapist who is trauma-informed and going from there. They will lead you in the right direction. 

Trauma completely wrecks havoc in the body in so many ways I didn't even know possible. I highly recommend reading ""The Body Keeps The Score"" by Dr. van der Kolk. His book about trauma is what started my deep dive into healing and completely opened my eyes. He also mentions a lot about types of treatments for trauma. I hope this post helped someone out there. Please share this because I believe so many people need to read this."
188,My fkn best friend...,Who are you?.. She leaves me on read every time I ask if she wants to do something. I try so fucking hard to be there for her. I love her.. But she isn't there for me when I need her. She has changed.. Sometimes we laugh and have fun together but only at school. We never meet outside of school anymore.. Does she even want to be my friend? I know for a fact that she has changed since she was in recovery for an ED... I stayed with her through all of that shit but what do I get back...Not much att all. I was suffering to by that.. Nobody really cared because all of her close  friends were hurting really bad. I cried and I cried a lot. Maybe it's selfish to expect something back.. But I want her to be thete for me too like a true friend.. Or maybe my view of a true friend is totally messed up.. Idk.
189,If counseling isn’t working what do you do?,"I started seeing this guy and he wants a relationship. However, I told him that I feel like I have too much emotional baggage to get into a relationship and I don’t want to put him through that because I like him so much. 

I have major trust issues from past relationships. One person was emotionally abusive and would use things id tell him about my mental health against me and tell me I was faking depression and suicidal thoughts for attention. My most recent one cheated on me all the time because my depression and anxiety made him feel rejected so he’d seek comfort in other women. I’d spent so much time thinking I wasn’t good enough. And I deserved to be treated badly. And it was all my fault because I was a bad girlfriend. So I started counseling and gained back my confidence and learned to love myself again. But I still don’t know how to trust another man. I’m scared to put myself in that position again. Can anyone relate? Or tell me how they were able to move past these things and be happy in a relationship again?"
190,Shutting down... Please Help,"I wasn't taught how to deal with my emotions as a child, but I'm trying to learn how to as an adult. I've noticed a disgusting parent of me literally shutting down when others express any sad emotion, and I don't know how to curb this response.

 For example, the one and only time I ever saw my dad cry (as he reminisced to me about his late father, who was his only life support throughout his abusive childhood) I literally just stood there, and felt myself turn inwards to a ""safe place"" and said nothing. I am so embarrassed still, and that was three years ago. I pray that he doesnt remember my absolutely apathetic response to his one time of ever opening up to me. 

I think this stems from my (also severely abused as a child mother) who would (and still does) whip out the tears anytime something happened that she didn't like. She would cry when I spent too much time with a friend, saying that I wanted to be a part of their family instead of my own. Another favorite was I wasn't allowed to go to a different church than her, or she would say I didn't love her. I now haven't gone to a church in 7 years in fear of the backlash.

I suffer from generalized anxiety and severe depression with suicidal thouhgts. Ive been doing well for several years I guess, but I can't stop shutting down. It affects my marriage, my relationships, and my job which requires a lot of empathy. What can I do to make myself less apathetic? I just don't know how to stop shutting down."
191,Thinking with third person He,"I have noticed that the majority of my thoughts use He and I mainly just use I for when I’m practicing something I’m going to say to someone in advance. I am worried the way I think about myself might be weird or abnormal. My thoughts are like He seems a little sad right now, Oh he’s cold, give him his coat and I call him my sweet baby boy and feel sorry for him and try to help him out by observing him and helping him grow. When I see old photos or somehow memories are brought up I feel like I am learning backstory or lore on a story character, that I’m this other being possessing his body and he has his own mind that I can’t access. I think he’s so cute and I love seeing pictures of him when he was little. I love understanding him, I like to look through his brain and physical memories to try to figure out why he is the way he is. Sometimes I stare into his eyes in the mirror for hours because I like it when we’re there for each other and I hope he’ll tell me secrets. I get confused by his emotions. When he’s crying I ask Why is he crying? Hey Sweetie? And I can’t tell if he’s really feeling something or lying or has done something or been somewhere or seen something."
192,Disorder or Abuse Related? Can't love...,"So, quick background on my life. I was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD in the 4th grade. My dad perpetrated a bit of physical, verbal, and emotional abuse in the years leading up to my parents' divorce (ages 9/10-13). My mom ended up abusing me emotionally. Ideas of my own that differed from hers were met with screaming and punishment. I had a few bouts of severe depression and suicidality from mid middle school to the end of high school. The third episode I opened up to her about (senior year) she told me that ""if \[I\] was going to do it, just do it. Because \[she\] can't worry about \[me\] anymore."" The two times I had opened up to her about my depression before that, once in eighth grade and again in sophomore year, she ended up breaking down and saying ""If you're so depressed, then I must be a terrible mother and I should just leave."" I had to console her and reaffirm that she was doing fine out of fear she would actually leave, and I'd end up with my father, who at the time I was afraid of/hated. I hated him for longer than I should have, because people change. I blame the fact there was constant talk between my mom and I that he was screwing us over while he was living the high life after the divorce (not in the slightest bit true). The second half of senior year and the first year of college was spent under constant threat of being kicked out of the house by my mom. Thankfully, after high school ended I started working with my dad in HVAC. I got to know him a bit more, and as we talked, realized the problems I was having with my mom were the exact problems that caused their divorce.

(If there's anything that could use clarity, let me know. I'm pretty much an open book because I look at life objectively when it comes to mental health).

&amp;#x200B;

So on to my problem. I'm 20 and never been in a relationship. I've never felt attracted towards another romantically or sexually. However, I deeply crave intimacy with another person, and I know that I'm gay. I've realized that I often feel responsible for other peoples' problems/feelings. My best friend opened up to me about their recent family problems, and I could tell they were hurting pretty bad (only once I started looking for physical signs). I've been beating myself up for not being able to offer sincere comfort or good advice. When my sister asked me to call my mom every so often (I moved out and in with my dad and his parents approx 6 mo. ago) I explained that I couldn't and why. I explained my experiences. What hurt is that she related so much that she broke down. I felt so shitty for leaving and leaving them as the target of my mom's insecurities and mental health issues. There was nothing I could do to comfort her or guide her. The problem with both these situations is that I didn't experience these feelings out of what one might call ""love"" for another person. They both do so much for me, but I can't seem to do anything for them. I see it more like balancing a balance sheet, and I am in debt. But, when the time came, I couldn't pay up. The same goes for when I am able to do things, say, for my family. I do things for my dad and grandparents because they've done so much for me, and I am in debt. I respect them for the things they've done to grant me with the opportunities I have. At the same time, when they ask me to do something (i.e. walk the dog, watch grandpa while he takes a walk, go to the store for groceries) I'm annoyed by default. I have to consciously process the balance sheet before I can react to the request positively (this idea of a balance sheet is a recent concept I've come up with after having been severely depressed again. It helped explain why I would never do/strongly resist anything my mom asked me to do while I was living with her. She has bad knee problems and is supposedly in constant pain, so she'd often come at me with that).

People in my family (who I know care about me very much) often tell me they love me, and I reciprocate the phrase. But, that's all it is, reciprocating a phrase. It never carries any meaning when  I hear it or say it. The most common inner thought that results from hearing it is ""yeah, I know, you say that constantly."" Sometimes, it'll even be followed with negative thoughts like, ""oh yeah, well why do you do *this* then."" I never say these things, of course. I feel like I'm just being forced to conform to societal norms when I say it back.

(TL;DR I don't think I'm capable of the emotion ""love,"" feel responsible for other people's problems, and act on a balance sheet type system, respecting people I am in debt to and not caring about those I'm not in debt to).

When I was talking to my psychologist about this, he said that it *is* characteristic of my disorder. But then he used ""depersonalization"" in explanation of it, which, due to prior research, I didn't totally relate to/understand. I've also realized my episodes of suicidality are less about dying and more about wanting relief (thank you NF). However, that doesn't stop me from constantly fantasizing about my death. The depression is real and extremely painful, yet sometimes I seem to just try to drown myself in it (playing a depressing playlist on repeat).  


Long story short, I just feel like a complete mess. I'm not sure which problems are a result of abuse or disorder. I deeply want to find someone to have a strong bond/intimacy with, but don't know how when I feel like I can't truly love them. It feels like I'd be constantly putting up a facade. Being 20 and having always been single, I'm extremely worried I'll never be able to form this kind of relationship with a person, and that just feeds back into the depression loop. I don't want to always feel this lonely, but feel I have been damned to that destiny. I'm not even totally sure what I'm looking for by posting this. Advice...affirmation...perspectives...I just don't know what will help at this point. All I know is that I need help...lately, instead of crying when thinking about my death and the people I'd hurt...I've been smiling, and I'm highkey kinda scared. Thanks for comin to my pity party."

195,How do I get mental health help as a teen if my parents are unsupportive?,[removed]
196,A feeling of wanting to loose control? - crosspost,
197,Coping with emotional triggers caused by relationship trauma?,"Hello, first post here. 

Last year I dealt with some issues in my relationship that have caused me to have an violent aversion to sexual content/nudity (this was NOT caused by sexual abuse). 

It's been affecting me slowly, but has gotten to a point where accidentally seeing something remotely sexual causes a panic/anxiety attack. Dread follows, spiraling, the usual. It causes every insecurity I'm dealing with (dealing with through therapy, mindfulness, etc) to surface. The feeling is awful, and my first instinct is to hurt myself (pick my skin, pull my hair, hit my head on the wall). It's been happening so often, and I feel myself relapsing, causing all my progress with this issue to feel useless. Sometimes I don't recognize myself anymore. 

I have no idea how to deal with these triggers, as pornography/nudity/sexual content is everywhere. Is there any tips you have had that have helped (even temporarily)?"
198,No knowledge of mental health. What is my problem?,"This sounds so crazy but I don't know why I believe it to be true.
While driving home I imagined that if I won the lottery, I would immediately contact a girl that I have/had feelings for. We would fly to the Lakers game, and sit court side, and be known as the young rich couple. That thought was kinda cool to think about. Then I thought to myself what if she said no and I had to choose someone else to go to the game with? Who would I choose? I immediately thought of like 3 of my guy friends. For whatever reason in my head I was like what?? That's gay why wouldn't you choose another girl? And it just spiraled out of control in my head that I must be gay, and I don't really have feelings for that girl, I just like her to try and gain ""clout"". Then I looked back on previous experiences with girls, and remember how I felt when I was ""in love"" with a woman, and convinced myself that I would never be able to be emotionally attached to a female again. Obviously, being straight this made me extremely anxious, and the thought of me being gay, or not being able to love a woman again has just been running wild in my head. It's like because at the moment I felt what I thought was gay, that must be how I truly feel. And that because I thought I would never feel love again that I will never feel love again. Now I'm almost frightened that one day I could wake up and instantly be gay, or that I will never feel love for a female again. It's like now I have to check myself by looking at ever female I see to make sure I think she's attractive. And that's not enough, later, I will somehow in my mind convince myself that she was never attractive, and I was just saying that at the time to convince myself of being straight. It's like a never ending cycle of thoughts in my head. I KNOW I'm not gay because I've never had any kinda attraction towards a male, but for some reason I still fear that I've been lying to myself, or will turn gay in the future. I don't know if this is Anxiety, Depression, OCD, or what, but I know what I'm feeling is not me.

It's crazy that I think like this now, because just last week I was thinking that I was the happiest I've ever been, and everything was going great. I knew in my heart that I had such a bright future, and was ready to live such a great life with a beautiful wife and family. Now it feels like I don't even know who I truly am."
199,Trying to graduate from college with crippling depression,"I’m terrified I’m not gonna make it. I’m in my last semester and barely holding my head above water. I’ve reached out to my professors explaining my mental health situation but I feel like it’s not enough. I’m scared they’re gonna force me to drop out for the semester or tell me I didn’t do a good enough job or someone’s going to fail me and I won’t graduate. I started university at 27 because I went through something traumatic and it sent me into a black hole of deep depression, being suicidal, anorexia, etc and I managed to climb out of that black hole and now I feel myself falling back in again. If I don’t graduate it will be the ultimate failure for me and to my family, especially my mother. I have so much homework that’s due tomorrow and I’m not going to have it done in time. It’s yet again *another* assignment that I’m falling behind on because my depression is controlling my life. No medication works, no counseling works, I’m at a loss at this point. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared of failing. My parents are counting on me to graduate and get a full time job. I feel completely paralyzed by this depression and I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what I’m trying to get out of this post I just needed to put it out there into words to someone other than myself. Sorry"
200,Do I have a binge drinking problem?,"Made a burner account to post this. I'm a freshman in college, and I never drank until the very end of senior year in HS, so I thought all this binge drinking was just normal exploratory stuff. Maybe it is, but I realize that I never drink to just get buzzed; I always want to get fucked up. Like very very drunk. Last weekend I got so drunk I did a kartwheel and landed wrong and broke my toe. I still drank friday and Saturday this weekend without much of a second thought. There are things I can't talk about sober that I can talk about drunk (honesty in my relationship and things I want that are too hard and guilt-inducing to talk about sober), I feel funnier and much more confident drunk, I often get a sense of calm euphoria drunk, and I enjoy the spinny, disorientated feeling. I only drink on weekends, but sometimes heavily drink both Friday and Saturday night even though I'm almost always depressed the next day. My friends who have gone through alcoholism before are concerned for me, but up until recently I was convinced I was fine because it was just a weekend thing and I honestly don't think about it during the week, even when stressed or depressed (I have depression and OCD, diagnosed at 11 and medicated) What do you all think?"
201,Very confused and a little scared,"So long story short, talked to a long time friend the other day, and without going too much into it, he had a few rough couple of days and his mental health went down the drain. It really shocked me to hear what he was going through since I always saw him as a well put together person. We started talking and talking about my own mental health and i stated getting really anxious and it seemed like i couldn't verbalize what i was trying to say. So he told me to write down how I felt and he suggested I talk to a medical professional about it. So I wrote it down, and was mortified about how on paper I sound insane. Ill type out what i wrote, basically my symptoms and odd things I've done over the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Very Impulsive with money decisions although I'm more financially literate than most. I budget and have a plan but it all goes down the window in burst of impulsiveness and recklessness.

\-Its hard to keep my focus on something for more than a few days, maybe if im lucky a few weeks

\-My interest are like a rollercoaster, im very obsessive about things i like and will go overboard with research, investing time and money into it, but then will lose interest after a few days, weeks or maybe hours

\-I have burst of hyper efficiency, and then i dont

\-i feel like i have no stability in my behavior

\-I lose interest in romantic relationships, and ill have a really high sex drive for short period of times, then no sex drive at all for a few weeks at a time

\- If i drink, i usually black out. I don't drink often, I'm a very social and nice person, easy going but when i drink i go overboard and end up in bad situations cuz i dont see things as bad ideas

\-My college performance is all over the place. Acing exams one week and studying super efficiently and then for a few weeks my performance drops, and then it comes back up, and then it comes back down

\-I gained like 50 pounds in the last 2 year

\-cant sleep for more than 4-5 hours a time unless I drink heavily, and sometimes i wake up in a panic for some reason

\-Im constantly worrying about everything, its like my mind is either blank or i have 50 tabs open in my head, no in-between

\-I pick up hobbies for a few weeks and then just drop them

\-Ill be in a good routine, eating healthy, doing well in school and then BOOM, i go into these states where i dont see the point and redundant of life, all depressed and everything seems mundane, like theres no point of it. Never suicidal, but indifferent 

\*Then i started thinking of examples of stuff ive done through out the years that maybe seemed like  good idea at first but werent\*

\-Signed up for a marathon and ran it without training. Ended up completing 19 miles. Seemed doable at the time

\-Bid on a car on ebay (a classic car) cross country because it looked nice, won it, and then my coworkers had me email the seller and explain that i couldn't buy the car. Seemed like a cool idea, driving cross country in a convertible from the 80's, maybe sight see, but the people around me though buying a car i had seen for no more than 10 minutes on a loan wasn't a good idea.

\-Went to visit a friend that lived a few hours from me, saw an old BMW for sale, thought it was cool so i called the guy, bought it for 800$ 2 hours later. Found out it had a bad motor so that afternoon i ordered an engine from a scrap yard, youtubed how to change an engine and use tools, and then spent the next 2 weeks traveling to my buddies house to fix the car. Did it. cost me like 4,000 total, sold the car for 1,600 a few months later. All this on credit by the way. 

\-Was driving from work with  buddy and he saw a nice car for sale and said it looked nice, so i applied for a loan and bought it a few hours later. 

\-Saw a motorcycle for sale like at 2pm on a resale lot, thought it looked really nice and i could get into motorcycles. Called the guy up, applied for a loan, bought it that same night. I dont even like riding motorcycles.

\-Dropped a whole semester of classes after convincing myself that we should do things we dont like. seemed logical at the time.

\-Started playing guitar for a week and got super into it. Spent a ton of time on it, after a week i completely lost interest. Now i have a nice guitar i dont know how to play as decoration.

\-Started writing a book about how to diversify income streams. Did a ton of research on it. Then asked myself why the fuck was i writing a book about that, got a chapter in and then scrapped it. 

\-Almost married a girl so shed have a place to keep her dogs. Seemed like the nice thing to do and she didn't seem like a psycho, plus her dogs needed a home. Seemed like a good idea at the time.

\-Got super into cycling, spent thousands on a performance bike, cycling gear, then two months in i stopped completely for no reason.

\-I go from either not sleeping more than 4 hours a night to sleeping 12 hours a day to avoid people and ding things and worrying about things

\-Once i went home with a chick after talking to her at a taco stand for 3 minutes. i was very drunk, she offered to drive, seemed like a good idea at the time.

\-Blew all my savings on i dont remember what a few years back

\-went to strip club and bought me and some guy i barely knew long hour lap dances all in my credit card. cost me 800$, seemed like a good idea at the time.

Those are the ones i can think of, i go through highs and lows and make very reckless decisions when i look back at it. I didn't really think this was odd behavior but after writing things down, my life is a shit show of wild decisions that seem logical at the time. I'm i going crazy? is this normal, are other people like this? Im going to see a doctor next week and maybe he can tell me more. Please share your thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Friend had a mental break down, made me self reflect, think im going crazy. Seeing a doctor soon about it."
202,Sunday March 1st. 9:21pm,"I find myself abusing substances, reaching out to strange men for unwanted affections, and binging food. I'm caught in some sort of constant loop  where I believe I can do better, attempt, succeed, then hit rock bottom again. These feelings are deep, dark, and depressing. Some days I'm enjoying life, others I want to die. Where will time take me? Only the creator knows."

204,I don't know what is wrong with me but I hate feeling this way,"Hello. For some reason, especially in the past few years, I just feel like people don't value me even if they say they do and genuinely mean it. I don't know what's wrong with me. It's like there's a little piece of my mind that says you're terrible and you don't matter and no one likes you, and I try to convince myself that it isn't that way but it never seems to work out. I just don't know if this is normal, but I just feel so hopeless and even typing this out makes me want to cry. Sometimes I want to stop existing. I won't do anything drastic for sure though. I just feel so stuck and frustrated, and whenever something bad happens in my life I get so upset and stuck on it for so long. Like I had a situation with my potential roommates recently which really hurt me and I can't get over it, and I keep chasing the toxic people in my life for the sake of normalcy/optimism. I don't want to live like this and I don't know if it is normal or not but the way I've been feeling is absolutely terrible and that is all I know. I feel like if I go into therapy or whatever, then they'll just say this is a normal part of life and to just move on and that scares me a lot because my life is a terrible way to live. I literally feel like throwing up and my head hurts sometimes in these situations. I just want to feel happy and I don't know how."
205,I’ve been struggling...,"So I’ve been struggling for quite a while now... in July 2019 I was officially diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). Since then, I have fallen down a very unhealthy and mentally ill path... My very, very supportive boyfriend has been nothing but helpful and loving during this time. We decided to try a new lifestyle in which he thrived in and is still going strong. However, my mental health got the best of me and I went backwards after losing 20lbs. This was completely heartbreaking for me as I want to be on this journey with my boyfriend and I want to look “good” for him... I have done lots of reading and experimenting with “low carb” or “no artificial sugars” but I’m a college student on a SERIOUS budget and those kinds of meal plans tend to take most of my money. 
Any tips or tricks from someone struggling with PCOS and/or mental illness on how to get through the day...

P.S. this is my first post so please be kind..."
206,"I've finally recognized that I really need some mental health counseling, but my insurance doesn't cover it; I can't afford it on my own and it's sending me deeper into a depressive spiral.","Over the last several months as my stress and anxiety have skyrocketed, I've noticed my mood plummeting. I am depressed and have extreme mood swings. I have become short tempered and snippy with my loved ones, to the point where friends have privately asked my SO if I'm okay. 

I realized I needed help the other night when my SO pointed out all the minor ways I had hurt her with some of the tones I'd used or words I'd said, or been short with her, or snippy, and I hadn't even noticed. It freaked me out - I couldn't even recognize when I was hurting the most important person in my life and I couldn't figure out how to talk to her about it or how to address it or fix it. 

I decided I need to find a therapist and get some help. I looked online through my insurance and that kind of mental health Care is not covered. I looked into the TalkSpace app - which is something I really think would be conducive to my life and would be super helpful - but I just cannot afford that extra cost every month. Much of my anxiety and depression, I know, stems from financial struggles and stress and adding one more financial strain onto my life is hard to think about. 

Anyway. I'm typing this out because I'm depressed and scared and don't know where to turn. I feel like I had made an important first step in at least recognizing the need for help with my mental care, and then right when I decided to take steps to try and fix things, I hit this brick wall. It's bringing me down and I'm freaking out. 

Advice? Suggestions? I need help and don't know what to do or where to go."
207,Fuck eating disorders,"I want to eat but I also don't. When I eat I feel guilty, then hopeless, and then I spiral into despair and/or panic. I feel like people don't understand it because sometimes I will be eating a lot and I will seem just fine and other times I will do anything to avoid food."
208,Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Neuropsych testing.,"I've always known that my brain works differently than ""normal"" people. I've never felt like I belong in any social groups. I feel like everyone is always looking at me and judging me and I never understand why.

The worst part is that sometimes I just don't understand things about people close to me and overtime I've realized my brain can be very selfish. The thing is I don't notice it until after I've already upset someone by not seeing their side of things and then I have to attempt damage control.

Anyway. I'm going in for testing soon and It's supposed to be like 4 hours long and I'm nervous as fuck. Although I'm so excited to finally know what specific things I struggle with and start tackling my weak points. I hate knowing that I've had such a hard fucking life and none of it was under my control. I didn't choose to be born and I definitely didn't choose to be born with FAS. 

And the trauma begins lmao."
209,I had to euthanize my dog,"My puppy was having repeated seizures today and I had to rush her to the vet. Long story short no medicine was helping her from seizing, it was getting worse and worse and was damaging her young brain. I had to make the painful decision of euthanizing her. Anything else would have bought her time from the inevitable while suffering the whole time she was here. I'm very hurt.. I steady blame myself for it being my fault, I hope she's not looking down on me wondering what the f I did to her.. I miss her dearly and don't know how to cope.."
210,"I am in desperate need of help and people on reddit are deleting my posts, but please help. I am almost certain that semen was added to my wraps after I got a refund on two items.. Ubereats is investigating it but should I call the police directly for lab tests?",
211,Where/how should i get help?,"I am not sure what steps i should take to better myself. I think i have had some mental health problems for a while, i always put it off but i don't wanna hurt anymore people around me or myself anymore i guess. I am strongly against taking prescribed anti depressants/anxiety pills and i think thats why i have put figuring anything out because i feel like all anyone can do is just prescribe me shit. I did do therapy in early high school, though it did not help at the time i would be willing to try it again if i knew where to go. I am an 18 year old community college student in Austin Texas if that means anything. If anyone has any sort of ideas or things i can do to help myself please let me know and thanks for the read, have a good day!"
212,help me understand,"I heard voices for 4 months,they stopped.I hear them again.They don't scream,don't shout,I barely hear them ,because they whisper.I usually hear them at night,But I really don't understand,Is it true?I hear people's who said their voices shout ...I'm not always understand what they're saying,because they're mumbling ....um thats very weird.

When I walked past a man I thought that I just heard his thoughts..Sometimes I think (not very serious, but still have those thoughts)that people read my mind..."
213,I’m sad but I’ve been more stable,"I tried. I miss your presence, I miss holding you and calling you after work. I miss baking for you and spending my days off with you or looking forward to spending time with you. you have the ability to bring me so much joy but lately you only wish to torture me.

it’s been almost a week since I last spoke to you or texted you and my life has been much more calm. i haven’t cut myself in 5 days or drank alone and cried. Ive kept myself busy, Ive spent my free time with my family and my friends and i’ve been painting. i’ve just been trying my best not to think about you. I can not heal myself while you are constantly sabotaging me, telling me i’m your soulmate and in the next breath reminding me what a horrible person I am, and then bringing flowers to my porch, and then telling me we shouldn’t be involved, and that I should move far away, and then holding me close and verbally reminding me of our first night together more than 8 years ago. i cannot handle such consistent instability while trying to heal myself. I wish you had gotten help for yourself long ago. I love you, I’d do anything for you. and I wish I could say I’ll be here when you’re ready, but since that time may never come, I cannot promise this to you. But i have to do this now for me, with or without you."
214,Where is the line between being open and attention seeking?,"My depression has kicked back up again since the start of the year. I've been pretty open about it, if people ask I tell them. I have no issues expressing my frustrations or why I can barely find the motivation to get up if someone asks whats wrong or how I've been. Why bother hide it? I wear my emotions as is and I'd just be lying, which makes me slump even more.

I got to thinking about the people that use mental health as a personality or an accessory. I detest people that brag about mental issues like it's some weird badge of honor. I wonder if my openness has or would be misinterpreted in a way that comes off as that strange bragging. 

I guess what I'm asking is where is that line? How else can I be honest without it sounding like I'm after attention?"
215,Inside a serotonin deficient mind,"So spring semester started and I thought yeah let’s go to the gym and get some endorphins to feel less empty and so I did for a month and truly I felt on top of the world for a bit and I stopped for about the last 2 weeks in February and things just kind of went down hill last night I had my first sleepless night in a month and truly I hated it being alone with my thoughts I just let them consume me and I honestly couldn’t help but realize that I wasn’t really feeling okay I was just distracted from my thoughts and I don’t think it’s bad to be distracted sometimes but I wasn’t really acknowledging how I really felt and I don’t know what to even do anymore because I don’t know even know what I feel I just am so accustomed to repressing my emotions and now that I’m confronted with my emotions I can’t even begin to describe what I feel because I don’t even know what they are. 

I’m not really sure what I’m asking here maybe I just want to hear other people go through this too."
216,I think I’m the only person that exists,I used to get these thoughts that everyone around me is fake and only imagined by me. I just didn’t know how I was doing it so I couldn’t control it. It was a very scary concept I managed to stop thinking about but more and more frequently now I’m experiencing that again I don’t know what this is
217,"Any little thing goes wrong and I want to just end it, anyone else feel the same?","Whenever the tiniest thing goes wrong I’m literally ready to end it. I don’t because I have people to worry about, but does anyone else feel the same way? For example, if I make a mistake while driving like accidentally cutting someone else I automatically deem myself a failure or a fucking mistake and immediately want to kill myself. I don’t have any mental issues as far as I’m aware, just want to know if anyone does or feels the same. Thanks."
218,advice???,"i’m very easily overwhelmed and stressed out about the smallest things. it’s gotten to the point where i don’t get anything done because i’m too scared to even though i don’t even have that much on my plate. this is also interfering with my relationships. i barely ever text my friends because i’m too nervous. instead i sit in bed all day browsing the internet and trying to forget about everything i’m behind on. i want to be able to work on things consistently and not be afraid to interact with people one on one, any advice?? im sorry if this isn’t as major as anything else on here, but i didn’t know where else to go"
219,Sudden and Intense Mood Swing,"Hi, I'm not sure where else to post this, but I was having a really good day all day today, and then out of nowhere I had a very strong sense of loneliness and sadness. I just feel so alone and I don't know what happened but I haven't been able to stop crying and I can't get this knotted feeling out of my stomach. Why would this be happening?"
220,Comfort in worthlessness,"The only thing that calms my anxiety is remembering I have no worth. I don’t pity myself at all, other than easing anxiety the idea just seems neutral and logical. I acknowledge my upbringing and how I handled it put me at a disadvantage early. Maybe if I had learned to help myself effectively or realized I was coping in a self destructive way before I ruined myself things would be different but they’re not."
221,Is it bad enough to get help?,How bad do things have to be before you should get help? How badly does it have to be affecting your life before a therapist will listen to you? How do you know that you’re not just being a weak piece of shit?
222,"I think I was drugged, and I need to get it off my chest","I know it may not be that serious for some, but it is for me. Just hear me out.
There was this party I was looking forward to, be it for meeting new people or just dancing. So I went, got in, had a couple of drinks, and... now I can’t even remember how I got back home.
I know my limits, I know how I react to alcohol, when to stop, etc etc. and there were times in which I drank too much, and never reacted this way, was always able to remember what happened, not this time, I basically lost those 5 hours. I don’t even know.
I, for sure, didn’t drink enough to feel that terrible. Dizziness, throwing up (what looked like a bunch of green, half-digested, spongy stuff, and I didn’t eat anything green, for the record), not being able to talk, bloodshot eyes, hyperactivity, temperature shifts.
Most is what my roommate told me, when I somehow showed up at home, at 5am (the party was 11pm), she said I was talking nonsense, loose words, not even enunciating right. 

Maybe this is not the appropriate place for this, but just needed to get it out of me, and maybe someone can, somehow, talk me out of this, because I’m pretty sure a friend did this to me, or who I thought was a friend, now I’m feeling betrayed, lost, traumatized and unsure of how and what to do."
223,starting therapy.,"i’m starting therapy next week on wednesday. i’m scared. 
i don’t know what to expect. 
everyone says to make sure i’m comfortable w her before getting into deep things but what if she asks before i’m ready. 
i don’t know what to do. 
i’m freaking out."
224,i feel like i’m going crazy.,"i don’t know but i started hearing noises. i’m freaked out and i want to cry. something’s been up with me mentally the past few weeks. i’m genuinely afraid. there was a noise coming from the right side of me. like - music almost. short. 4-5 seconds. ominous and brooding. i find myself being so paranoid recently. am i imagining things? i know, hearing a small sound isn’t a huge deal. but it freaked me out, especially when followed with the jingles i heard all around me. 

i don’t know.
i’m just paranoid."
225,"Why does saying ""I'm a bad person"" To myself make me feel better?","Often when I feel guilty about something, I always catch myself repeating ""I'm a bad person"" To myself quietly, and I keep saying it until I feel better.

I do have a history of depression and anxiety, and I am still dealing with the two, but it has become increasingly easier because I have a support system, loving friends and family, etc.

I'm not very concerned about this issue because I don't see it as a bad habit as much as I think I should. I don't think I should be complacent with this, but I am.

I'm also mostly just curious as to why I do this in the first place and why it makes me feel better. Probably makes me kind of a bad person if this is what it takes to calm my anxiety and guilt lol 🙃"
226,We had a family member killed in a mass shooting (among other issues). Please see description to get a full pic...?,"I am broken, yet am trying to hold it together, which I can normally do until im overwhelmed...then it all comes flooding in. I don't even know what I am asking for, aside from prayers or good thoughts ,please. I know what needs to be done, but I am broken and feel strong, then, weak... So....there's that."
227,I hate how my depression/anxiety paralyzes stopping me from doing the things I want and need to do in life.,"I  have loads of unfinished schoolwork which if I were feeling alright I  would be able to do in a few hours. Instead, all I can do is sit behind  my desk in mental turmoil while contemplating suicide. The worst part is  my parents are going to pissed at me when I inevitably get grades that  are not A's, and I feel completely powerless to stop that from  happening. I'm too distracted  to read anymore to escape any of it or  pursue any hobbies for fear of failure. What is there left for me to do  in life?

I've made and deleted  many posts like this because there are always people who comment ""jUsT  dO YOuR WoRk aNd yOu wILL fEel BeTteR"". If I had the ability to make  myself feel better, I would use for fuck sake. Unfortunately, this is  the attitude shared by my parents and therapist, so I don't really have  anyone to talk to."
228,"How can I assess my risk of how suicidal I am, and at what point will I have to hospitalized against me will?","I know that I am sick, the question is how sick."
229,Can someone help?,"So I made a post on r/teenagers and if you sort by new on my profile you’ll see it, and I was wondering if I should get checked out or anything because of those thoughts or anything? Just asking for advice ig cuz those thoughts have gotten really annoying and they started about a little over a year ago. It’s constant and I hate it."
230,The beginnings of madness?,"I'm not good at writing so here's a list of what's going on.

1. I was standing on a busy london train when all of a sudden all the noise around me stopped and I heard a voice say ""what are you doing?""

2. I keep feeling like I've seen things before but across time

3. I keep getting energy spikes that shoot up from the middle of my spine up to my head and down my arms, generally followed by some philosophical thinking, recent example - before the energy spike my heart started going mad followed swiftly by heavy emotions and the idea that time doesn't exist as past or future but instead is layered like sheets of paper.

4. The filter we all have that stops us acting like bagels in front of people seems to keep turning off.. Eg - I had an hour where I kept making stupid faces for no reason followed by hopping and skipping on the platform.

Any insight into what's going on would be greatly appreciated.

Sidenote - I do not drink, smoke or take any drugs"
231,I just really don’t want to exist anymore.,"I’m just done. I’m sick of being sick. I’m sick of continuously getting fired from jobs because my mental health gets in the way of my performance on occasion. I’m sick of not having a car, and having to ask people for rides. I’m sick of feeling like shit all day everyday. I’m tired of self harming when I feel like there’s no other option. I’m tired of feeling like a burden to the few people in my life. I’m tired of my life.  I can count on one hand the people who are truly here for me. And I hate that. I used to have so much more. Because I used to have my mom, dad, 6 siblings, their spouses, and the 20 something grandkids. But they’ve all disowned me. I know none of them would notice if I was gone. 

I am constant thinking about suicide. I can’t get it out of my head. I’ve come up with many many ways that I could make it happen, and it’s be successful. Cause my first attempt last year wasn’t. 

I’m just done."
232,School and Procrastination are Becoming a Serious Problem,"I'm currently in high school, and I feel completely overwhelmed. I have to get up early 5 days a week, stay in school for 6 hours, go to an exhausting track practice every day, and go home.  By that time I need to do all my homework, which can take many hours to complete; I feel like I work slower than everyone else. I also have a procrastination problem; it's gotten so bad that I'll spend hours just doing nothing productive after school because I'm so tired and over it. That's the problem; I'm just over it. I feel like I'm gonna reach a breaking point. Is something wrong with me? I keep blaming myself for procrastinating, but if I didn't, I'd literally never do anything that makes life worth living. So, why not just say ""fuck it"" and stay up super late anyway? I don't know what to do."
233,"Had to listen to something incredibly offensive at work the other day, and I'm still angry.","At our staff lunch/meeting, where we go over how we're doing as a company, what feedback we've gotten, announce employees of the month, this time we'd received awards from corporate...

And there's always a slide in the power point about how a smile is part of our uniform. Accompanied with horrifying clip art and a speech that includes some incredibly offensive phrases like

""We all make the choice every morning about whether or not this is going to be a good day or a bad day.""

""We can all choose to be happy when we wake up in the morning, and I don't know why anyone would wake up and choose to be depressed or sad.""

at a previous one the presenter said ""If someone comes in and they're feeling bad, or they say they can't smile... Well, buckle up, buttercup.""

&amp;#x200B;

wow. Just WOW. I thought this was 2020, but I guess some of us are still stuck in the old model where we stuff down our feelings until we snap, and where we treat those with mental health issues with contempt and shaming, which is, as we all know, SUPER EFFECTIVE. /sarcasm"
234,I just can't seem to commit myself to anything.,"I'm fairly new to reddit so please bear with me.

My main problem is that I feel like I just can't commit myself to anything. Work is especially horrible. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love my job and my colleagues, and I always leave work feeling good about myself because I know I'm doing a good job, but as soon as I'm home something changes. Every evening, and every morning before work I just dread going. There are days where I have to convince myself to not just call in sick, because I'm just so tempted to not go. But then if I do end up going I'm glad that I actually went. And yet despite being aware of the fact that going to work will make me feel better about myself I still end up in the same dilemma every night before work.
The same kind of goes for hobbies. I really love drawing and learning languages and I really need to get in shape and lose weight, but the most I can do is stick to it for a few days and then I get overwhelmed/distracted and give up. It's like I lack discipline to do anything, and it seems to have gotten worse since I left school. 
If there is one thing that I can however do regularly then it's mindlessly using my phone. 
I just don't know how to become more disciplined to the extend where I can force myself to develop interests and hobbies, and come to terms with the fact that I will have to go to work  every single day for the rest of my life. 
I don't know if this is normal and I'm just over thinking? This has really been getting to me lately, because I honeslty thought I would have my life together by now and have loads of hobbies, and have a good time going to work, but it's just not working out. I hate this feeling of dread every evening before work, even though I know that there is nothing to fear. And I hate sitting on the couch all day knowing I should be reading the book I took out 2 weeks ago, but I just can't bring myself to get up and do it.
So far I've just told myself that I'm just someone who get's bored of things quickly, but how can I get bored of something if I haven't even tried it properly??"
235,I have a friend who cuts herself,"I thought she stopped but she never did, I am the only person she trusts and I feel awful about it. I don’t know how to help and I know telling her parents or the school won’t work for personal reasons. Please help."
236,Would You Share Your Story To Help Yourself &amp; Others?,"Hey guys,

I'm currently searching for anyone who is willing to share their story to me. I recently started a YouTube Channel that is focused on sharing Real-Life stories of peoples backgrounds of dealing with depression, anxiety, or any Mental Health disorders etc. These stories are intended to help and educate others who watch these videos so they too can cope and find peace within themselves.

Would any of you be willing to share your story to me? I would love to offer you the opportunity to share the worst of what you've been through, so others can relate to you and we can all break the stigma of remaining silent to our problems.

I've dealt with Depression, Anxiety, and Homicidal thoughts throughout my life, and this has driven me to want to create a platform that can save lives, and help others through those dark times like when I needed them. I want to be that voice for others so more people can relate, and in return feel less alone about their struggles.

I have videos up and available now. If you choose to share I will create a story video personalized for you.

Thank you for your consideration."
237,Etiquette regarding on how frequently to contact a depressed friend?,"
I'm wondering how to go about it, they normally aren't good at texting but they don't normally leave me hanging. We live far from each other but I'm willing to drive out to see them and check up on them but our friendship is fairly new despite being told of their personal struggles / inner demons, so to speak.

Guess I wonder if I am being annoying by texting them, I see I get left on read quite a bit but I also know they are busy."
238,I need help. How should I go about getting it?,"And if I tell them I have a lot of serious suicidal thoughts on an almost daily basis, will they make me go to the hospital? If so how long will I have to stay there and what will happen?"
239,Feeling like I want to be a different person?,"For a long time I've always daydreamed about being a different person who had an interesting life and was confident and attractive ect. 
Then when its come to my life I just have felt so limited and like theres a barrier between me and the rest of the ""good"" people. Like I know I'm stuck as ugly, uncharismatic, constantly tired, anxious, and I wish I could just force myself to change to be like the lucky people who were born into easy lives so they can be happy all the time.

Is this something that alot of people experiance or is it just me?

Rant below 
Like literally though, I was unlucky enough to have been born into a weirdly neglectful home where we were poor and my mom always had to work and leave me and my sibling home alone. I always had low self esteem and was fat as a kid, then I was sexually assaulted and then in an abusive relationship where I got into drugs a little bit too much. But i still pushed myself and got into a good college on full ride despite all this. But college has been such a struggle for me because now that I'm away from all those bad environments I have to face my feelings from them while tackling a full corse load, plus I'm broke but dont have time to work a job. My body constantly hurts from pushing myself, I'm always sick, and I am always fat and inflammed in my face and body which makes me look like ugly shit. 
I have to watch all these people who are cool and outgoing and dont have existential constant worry in their lives have a good time and make friends easily and they get to do whatever they want and they get to feel good without even fucking trying. 
I guess I am just jealous, but I feel like I'm missing my chance to be a child and have fun in college which I'll never get back and it just makes me want to die because I feel like I already didnt get a childhood in the past either and now I'm just a sad adult already :("
240,Explosion,"The bottle of emotions. This bottle is where I put all my negative emotions to keep them from showing. My positive ones end up in there too but I don’t do it intentionally. The bottle can fill up, it has filled up before. And I kept the lid on and kept jamming stuff in the bottle. The bottle exploded, I felt almost every emotion I’ve been hiding in that moment. This was a couple moths ago. I’ve been in that bottle and it’s filling up again. I’m planning on not exploding again but I’ve just been feeling emptier and emptier. The bottle was almost full, and now it’s like there’s a hole at the bottom that everything is getting pulled out of and destroyed. There’s hardly anything left of me. I don’t want to talk to anybody, my friends, my family, they’ll think I’m mad at them. When in reality I’m just ———————— there’s nothing too it. I’m not mad at anybody I’m not annoyed with anybody. I’m just ———————"
241,"Fired old therapist, got new one, old one won’t leave me alone","Had a very bad nervous breakdown in November after a job loss coupled with horrible suicide ideation. My therapist was useless so I fired her and my psychiatrist and got new ones that specialize in Autism Spectrum Disorder. I also had my meds retitered.

I should also mention I’m a staking/DV victim and someone with serious trust issues.

I’ve now gotten multiple texts from the old therapist asking when she can reschedule my appointments. I blocked her number from WhatsApp and today she added me on Facebook.

How am I supposed to handle this? I don’t want her to say “well he had a suicide attempt so he needs to be committed” if I don’t make another appointment with her or something. But this doesn’t seem right."

245,How to cope if you know you deserve more?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time here and im on my phone so  sorry for the formatting.

I'm a international student in the US graduated in December with my BS in electrical engineering with a 3.89 GPA.

 At my current job i get paid $25/hr(non exempt) with 4hr/month of vacation and same for sick leave. I get only 4 hours paid on holidays too. And i don't do anything that im interested in.

I know i'm not supposed to compare myself to others but everyone i know is doing so much better and loves their jobs and most definitely get better benefits if they're not paid more. I just feel like i deserve better.

 I'm great at electrical engineering and i love it to bits. I have multiple projects under my belt. But every time the job door gets slammed in my face when i tell people I'm from a different country.

I'm sorry to say this but it hurts to see people become more successful than you when you helped them get there. I'm still happy for them but a part of me does everytime i hear how great they're doing at their new fancy job.

Please tell me if I'm being unreasonable. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk"
246,I need advice,I started self harm again but now my cuts are very visible and my watch can’t cover all of them. My school has a uniform and we don’t have long sleeves so what should I do
247,Mood swings/easy triggers massively impacting my life,"I have a question.

Why is my mood so noticeable? If one bad thing happens, it impacts my whole mood. I can’t control it. My feelings just take over my body. I become rude to everyone. It’s really been impacting me at work, to the point where I’ve basically lost my job because of the way I treat people when I’m upset. When I’m angry, sad, etc. everyone can pick up on it and it’s just so visible to everyone. I’m tired of being this way. I really don’t know what a solution to this problem is.

Also, I’m easily triggered. If someone says/does something that upsets me in the slightest, my mood instantly flips. 

It’s impacting me at work. It’s hard for me to maintain steady relationships/friendships, it’s getting really extreme...

A lot of people refer to me as mean or cunty when they first meet me and I’m in a bad mood. I deal with these ups and downs multiple times a day."
248,"Frick boys, Frick.","I still haven’t moved on from the last girl, but I think I’ve started to like someone else. This last girl really fucked me up, I’m gonna call her A. It’s been a long time and I think I’m starting to move on. I don’t think I of her as much as I have in the past. But this girl I think I’m starting to like it’s weirdly mean to me. The first time we ever talked she complemented my hair, and that had stuck with me because it was the first time someone that wasn’t A. But ever sense she’s been really mean to me. She’s flipped me off every-time I see her and she tells me she hates me literally every time she sees me. But just recently she asked what my star sign was and then said that my star sign is the best and that the people with that sign are the most caring sweetest people. I don’t think any of that star shit is real but was that just like a thing that she was doing, she didn’t ask anyone else about their star sign. What was she doing, was she just curious? I think her and her boyfriend broke up recently. Am I overthinking this? Is this normal? I’m starting to like a girl that’s really mean to me. Why, why am I like this."

I come home every day to drama, my dad mentally and emotionally scarred me to where I hate myself, and I just don't know what to do. The last time I came clean with thoughts of self harm and suicide I got tossed in a mental hospital. I'm scared of those places, especially since I can never tell if I'm really having these thoughts. I inadvertently seek attention, and I don't trust myself at all, nor do I trust my family and other adults. I have no clue of what's going on or what to do."
252,Today I Realized I Want to Be a Youth Councilor and Substance Abuse Councilor,"I found someone I think could be my life partner. My soulmate if you will. One of the things we bonded over was our mutually fucked up childhoods and how we both grew to be functioning people with a deep understanding of psychological issues and the struggle to self medicate with substances.

When I hear her talk about how alone she was, and how damaging her life was, I wish I could save her. I wish I could get in a time machine and sit with her in some park on the swings far away from her parents fighting and just talk about punk rock, and how the government is fucked, and how everything seems pointless. Then maybe just maybe by being a friend I’d make a difference. But this is the real world, and I can’t do any of that, no more than she could go back in time and give me any of the things she would.

I think I want to help kids like us. I want to work with kids that are fucked up, angry, and just want to make the world feel the pain they feel. I want to work with the kids that shoot up behind everyone’s backs, because not feeling alive and nodding off is better than suffering through it. I want to find those kids and help them, not as an authoritarian or as an adult, but as a peer. To tell them my stories and hang out and give them outlets that can help them feel in control and whole, and show them a larger world outside of the hell that is their broken homes and downright evil high schools. 

I don’t know where to start, and I know it’s going to break my heart when I fail, but I don’t think there’s much more I want to do in this world than keep people alive and well, using the experience of my failures and shortcomings I’ve beaten in life. 

If anyone here works in the mental health industry, works in social work, please reach out to me and let me know how I can begin this journey."
253,Mentally Abusive Father? Please help,"So I do love my dad, but very steadily over the last probably five- ten years, hes become increasingly condescending &amp; belittling to the rest of my family.

The main thing he’ll do is very actively &amp; PURPOSEFULLY aim to set someone off, make them feel like an idiot &amp; that he’s superior, but then the SECOND you get even a little defensive, he’ll play victim &amp; ask why **YOU** started an argument with him. 

So it’s like he’ll say something completely rude/ out of line to my mom(he’ll say some shit like “oh I guess no salad tonight? I guess you were too busy on Facebook”). My mom will get a little defensive over the statement, and my dad immediately retreats to his line of “oh I guess everyone’s being mean to me tonight. You’re all just mean. I’m going to stop doing all these nice things for all of you if this is how I get treated” and then he’ll make himself a strong drink almost signifying that we push him to drink

He does this every single night, without fail. Like clockwork. And it’s not just this, I can go on &amp; fucking on with stories just like this in a matter of a week. 

I feel silly even saying it, but I feel like this is honestly emotional abuse and I just need some validation at this point because this is driving me to the point of tears &amp; I can’t do it anymore. 

I can’t watch him treat everyone around him like shit &amp; then play victim. AND I FEEL LIKE IM THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES IT. 

Any input on this would be wonderful"

I'm experiencing extreme paranoid caused because of my difficulty to trust in others, in me and in the situation that sourrounds me that actually is really good. This is making me be hipervigilant because I see everyone as a threat and people that surroundsme specially the ones who spend more time with me are feeling it... because I behave really wierd when they are close to me...
and I'm scared because I understand it like if I was a person who make feel bad and uncofortable other people.  And I belive this because I think when someone is feeling bad others persons can feel it because of my vibrations and aura...(I know is crazy) and because of that they start to feel uncofortable, bad or sad like me in that moment and the worst is when im bad and someone is close to me I imagine that they are feeling uncofortable and sometimes my mind is even wanting to cause that feeling in others persons.... 


Have someone ever experience something like this?
Can someone advice me about what to do, or way to deal with this? 

I know is fucking crazy what I just tell...but I needed to put it out to get new perspectives because I've been triying to figure it out what the fuck is going on in my mind by myself for a long time  but I haven't found any good solutions. So please I would like to hear your opinions.

She said she is afraid to fail but I said grades aren't important if you are dead. That it's best she goes and gets help. I don't want her to fail yet I also want her to get help. Shes not okay. Hasn't been for a while. Shes the youngest of our friend group (just turned 20) and I just want to make sure she is ok. She had to take out her piercings, her hair jewelry, and wasn't bringing most of her clothes because you can't have certain items (hoodies with strings, Jean's, tank tops with spaghetti straps). Its really sad. I feel terrible that I can't do much more for her. She is going to miss a lot of events while she is there...but I just wish the best for her."

I saw her go on her phone once where she opened it up to a nude photo of her self. I never brought it up until we had an argument and she played it off saying “it’s a normal part of life”. She thinks it’s acceptable because my father has his thing and she has hers, only difference is she doesn’t spending hundreds of needed dollars on going out. I just feel so betrayed and my mind just puts everything in the back as a way to cope because I never talk to anyone about it.

258,I feel like I am being endlessly punished - suggested treatment options?,"I am writing this post to seek some sort of guidance in which sort of treatment would be of any benefit to me.

A bit of background- I am a full time worker in my early twenties (m) with a long history of anxiety, depression, OCD and anorexia.

I am not a religious person, but most days I cannot help but feel that my immense mental anguish is some form of divine punishment as I cannot find any other good reason why I would be under so much distress.

I am told sometimes that people suffer more greatly than I, and while I can definitely believe this, I only find myself absorbing the pain and suffering of others, therefore adding to my distress.

Mornings are horrible- I wake up wanting to kill myself because the thought of getting up and going to work is so horrible to me. The same goes for most other tasks- doing the dishes, the washing etc. Even on a Friday night, I can never enjoy my weekends because I'm thinking about Monday morning.

As well as feeling depressed all the time, I have extremely bad OCD which mainly attacks my job and my relationship. I am in a 4 year relationship with someone who I love very dearly (we are getting married in less than a month) and yet I am constantly plagued with doubts like ""do I really love her"" ""what if I'm not good enough"" ""what if she's not good enough etc"" and I feel so dysfunctional and horrible for having these thoughts RIGHT before our wedding.

My body image issues have also been coming back badly and I see such a revolting person staring back at me in the mirror.

Everything dear to me is being poisoned

The things I used to love are no longer fun
Seeing friends is just a mere chore and the only time I can feel somewhat happy is when I'm drunk

I have tried medicine which only seems to inhibit my emotions and destroy my sex life (bad)

CBT which didn't work

I am literally considering ECT at this point because my emotional pain is so unbearable I don't really care about potential memory loss at this point"
259,Job Searching Makes Me Cry,"\[Cross-posted under the Teachers subreddit\]

Nearly three years ago, I had a traumatic work experience -- broke my teaching contract, broke my apartment lease, and moved back in with my parents. Much therapy and many antidepressants later, I'm substitute teaching and completing an online editing certificate. 

Subbing is OK, but there are times I have flashbacks, and regardless, it's certainly not something I want to do forever. I've applied for jobs, gone on interviews, and so far no dice. Oftentimes I don't get that far -- just the act of job searching makes me break down into tears, to the point where I'm generally not able to keep looking for the rest of the day.

I really want to move out of my parents' house. I want a full-time job with benefits so I can get past this trauma. I want the funds to be self-sufficient again -- I can't even afford to my parents rent, which at 30, really sucks. I think, in addition to my PTSD holding me back, I feel guilty that I have degrees I'm not using -- degrees I'm still in debt for. I realize many people hold jobs unrelated to their degrees. However, my breakdown happened about two months after receiving my teaching degree, and about one month into teaching. I just wish the decision to change careers had been my own, after at least one full year of teaching -- not the result of a panic attack.

Any advice?"
260,Annoying thing that happens,"Idk if its just a puberty thing but for some reason i go through these mood swings like ill feel very sad and angry for no reason and feel suicidal,i feel very pessimistic and nihilistic and then one second later im all optimistic and i am just full of energy and am very happy n positive for no reason.and then when im at school i feel anxious and shy the entire time and very unhappy but as soon as i get home my mood lifts as if i didnt even go to school.it is kinda annoying because i feel like 2 different people and I can’t properly process my emotions without it quickly changing.anyone else feel like this"
261,I had/have 'depression',"To start off, I am not a sociable person. I never was. When I was a kid I had ADHD, and I had absolutely no control over myself. Nobody likes me and my parents were constantly fighting, so I didnt have a very good start in life. But another part of ADHD (more or less just ADD now) is that I used to be able to completely forget my problems for periods of time. Eventually things got pretty bad, I had a few very close grandparent die when i was young and i thought that was the worst thing in the world. But i still though that life wasnt too bad. Later on a few more family members died and I got pretty paranoid that people constantly die in my family. But still things were getting better, all until my father shot himself. I was completely broken and never spoke about it to anyone. And his gf he was with at the time was crazy and kept everything of his, although that just pissed me off. I started to lose reason in living and I got into a very philosophical state. I am not sure quite how to describe how I felt other than grey, if I wasnt in a social setting I was too deep into my mind and i would constantly remind myself of my poor father who finally got a job and was about to get his own home. I stopped really caring about my friends and just let lose of everything. It took about a year before most of the intense emotions to really start hitting and I had a horrible summer just sitting around feeling sorry for myself(and yeah, i know that's pretty pathetic but i didnt want to say anything about it out of the fear that people would think i wanted attention). A few years later my grandmother had cancer amd died within a week of diagnosis, and I was scared of myself since I felt absolutely nothing for a long time. Since then nothing has really gotten better or worse, it's just been a stalemate and I question if I'm still somewhat broken. I cant think right without meds for add when i was fine before, i started getting medical issues left and right like constant dihareah and extreme headaches. And i cant even tell if I'm happy at any moment. Normally I'd be able to know if I'm happy sad or just kinda zoned out, but now I cant tell the difference, its sort of a bleak existence where I am living it but I don't feel like I'm really here, my memories are foggy past 30 mins and cant remember most of the day before, and im struggling in school because I cant remember for the life of me half of the assignments that I had already done part way. I dont know if this is just a medical issue or if it has to do with my mental health.

I'd appreciate your opinion and I dont want sympathy. Just a bit of observation from experts while staying anonymous. Sorry for any crappy spelling, my hands are freezing and I want to sleep and check this in the morning."
262,Ho’oponopono -- A Hawaiian Practice of Forgiveness,"Has anyone here tried Ho’oponopono? How did it go?

For anyone unfamiliar, it's a Hawaiian practice of forgiveness, consisting of four parts: 

1) I'm sorry.

2) Please forgive me.

3) Thank you.

4) I love you.

My therapist told me about it, and I'm trying really hard to use it with my affirmations (e.g., ""My worth does not lessen because I live with my parents;"" ""My worth does not lessen when I’m depressed.""). So far, though, I have been unsuccessful to get through it without crying. I think this is primarily because I'm supposed to be saying it to myself (technically, the ""me"" of the time I went through the worst time in my life). I struggle with No. 2, because so much of what happened was done out of my control by others. How can I forgive myself when I did nothing wrong?

Anyway, I'd really love to hear how this practice went for other people."

264,"Struggling to cope with my job, and I'm unsure of what to do","Possible Trigger Warning

I have had my job for about 4 months now I work in a hospital as the receptionist. It's very busy and stressful most days I don't get everything done so I come in early the next day to finish it. As well as normal receptionist duties I also admit patients, make up their files etc. I think I present myself at work well enough to hide it but about 3 weeks ago my facade cracked and I knew I needed to speak to someone. I went to the nurse in charge knowing he would be very understanding as it is a psychiatric hospital and broke down. I explained to him how I was feeling, my constant panic attacks throughout the day, not being able to focus on work so I was making mistakes which was making other people's jobs harder so I was putting so much pressure on myself to make things perfect, because of that I felt like everyone disliked me as I had annoyed them, my stomach was playing up due to all this anxiety to the point where I had to be running to the toilet every half hour. Because of this culmination of things, trying to be okay for my job and be happy for my family. I found I had become extremely suicidal, I had a plan in place and it was taking an immense amount of willpower to stop myself eachday and I found myself growing weaker.

The NIC was lovely and explained he wouldn't allow me to leave unless I went to another hospital to have my mental state assessed. I agreed they informed my partner. After 10 hours in the ER I was seen at this point it was 12am I was exhausted starving and hadn't slept, the psychiatric reg was amazing and very understanding I asked to just go home. She got my partner up to date and we left with a plan, which was to see my gp the following day and book in with my psychiatrist. One thing she said stuck with me though, 'have you considered a different job'. 

After seeing my gp she gave me until my psychiatrist appointment off which was about a week and a half as I was in no state to go back to work. She also said to me maybe I should quit and find something less stressful. My psychiatrist also said the same thing he's given me another 2 weeks off as well as doubling my dosage for one of my anxiety medications. My trainer who doesn't work for the hospital had even asked me if I thought i was going to be okay returning to work. 

When I spoke to my partner and family they were concerned for my mental health but also worried for my job security as I was taking so much time off work.  I'm starting to think maybe I am not cut out for this type of work but my family shut me down especially my mum as it's very good job and it's something she's always wanted me to have and she doesn't want me losing it. My partner's also worried about me quitting as I was unemployed for about 8 months before I got this job and he doesnt want me throwing it away because its hard to find a job.

I'm not sure what to do as I feel torn and very lost. I would like advice or if anyone has been in the same situation how have you dealt with it. Thank you

I binged a certain game and every time I try to sleep I keep on having an overload of information like I'm playing the game that just forces me to stay awake. It's like this sort of place in sleep where I'm sleeping but I'm still sort of playing the game in my mind so I'm awake and aware. 

It has become so unbearably strong and I have tried so many things. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I just want to sleep since I have school in the morning at 6 and as the time says, it's 3."
267,Choosing therapists and counselors,"Those of you who go see a therapist/counselor for your anxiety/depression/other mental health issues: what do you all tend to look for when searching for the right therapist/counselor? Aside from the more obvious stuff like if they accept your insurance and if they specialize in your specific issues. I’m wondering about stuff like the age of your counselor and how you “vibe” with them, so-to-speak. Do you prefer someone more relaxed and someone who talks to you more like a friend? Or someone who is more professional and talks to you like a client? 

I went to see a counselor for a few months about 2 years ago. I didn’t feel like she was a good fit. She was more middle aged. DEFINITELY not professional (she showed up to pretty much all of our meetings in ripped jeans and t-shirts. Not saying that’s a problem because I don’t mind her acting more like a “friend” than a “therapist” but she might’ve been a little too relaxed and unprofessional.) anyway, I stopped going because I felt like I couldn’t really connect with her. I feel like she didn’t help me much. She laughed after a lot of things I said and I don’t know if it was just a nervous reaction on her end, or if she was trying to lighten my mood so I wouldn’t feel so down while talking about my problems. Of course my anxiety told me she was just laughing AT me though. 

My mental health problems have not gotten better in the 2 years that I stopped going, so I’m starting to look for therapists again. I prefer someone younger or closer to my age. I’m about to be 23 and I think it would be easier to connect with someone closer to my age. But then again, older people tend to be wiser. Obviously I have to go with someone who specializes in what I need, but I have a list of therapists I’ve been looking at and they all have pros and cons. 

So, help a girl out. Tell me about your current and past experiences with therapists and counselors and tell me what you tend to look for in the right one. Thanks in advance."
268,My boyfriend admitted he hears voices,"My boyfriend (29M) recently admitted to me (23f) that he hears a female voice that tells him to do violent things. I know he had an extremely rough childhood from the limited information that he is willing to share on the subject.

I want to bring it up for discussion so I know what’s going on, but I know he has a hard time talking about his problems. Usually all I get is “it’s life, you just gotta deal with it.”

269,Need help fixing my sleep schedule,So I couldn’t find a better sub reddit so I hope this is the right place. I can’t remember the last time I had a normal sleep schedule. It’s probably been since I was in elementary school. I’m currently a sophomore and I run on about 2-4 hours of sleep on a daily basis. About once a week I’ll come home from school and immediately go to sleep. And I take constant naps at school and it’s definitely affecting my grades. On the weekends I stay up all night and normally wake up between 2-4pm. And it’s not because of school work. I just always feel like I’m wasting the time I have to myself when I sleep. I also don’t like talking to people so being awake when my family is asleep is always a joy to me. Maybe it has something to do with depression which I believe I have (self diagnosed so take that with a grain of salt). I just have no idea how to fix it and it’s really screwing up my life.

274,Help. Please.,"I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety all my life. I’m 20 this year and worse than ever due to a combination of a new medication being tried, low-key agoraphobia causing me to stay in for weeks at a time and hygiene going oopsy. What would some common signs of ocd usually attain? The last three years and more so since December last year this has been my life although the numbers/phrases can fluctuate: 

Stay awake till 7am and either sleep till 3pm or stay awake 30 hours and sleep for another 15. 

Wake up around 5/6 

Repeat the phrase “Good mood, have fun, look hot.” In my head six times over so as to make a block of SIX then I repeat that three times over so it makes 3 lots of six. I would then repeat that again so then I would have six blocks of six. 

Then I repeat the phrase “Good couple of days, weeks, months.” In my head six times to make a block again and then repeat it so I then have two blocks of six. Then I repeat this phrase five times and then on the fifth time I instead say the phrase “Good mood, have fun, look hot.” 

Followed by “Good day tomorrow, look good tomorrow, good food tomorrow.” And then I would do this push thing from within almost like going to the loo lmao. (I use lmao and lol because I’m embarrassed for being a freak lol.) 

I then repeat this with everything I do throughout the day with literally everything. Opening an app on my phone? I’d close it and shut it down to then open it up another eight times so the bad feeling goes away. Xbox menu opened to look at the time? I go back into a game and open the menu and repeat it all eight more times. 

You get the gist. It’s ruining my life tho lol and idk what to do because finding a therapist is impossible cos I’m a broke ass student."
275,Worried for coworker,"I asked this guy at my work how he was doing. I noticed for the past couple weeks he had his posture really strange (like head tilt up in a confrontational way). He just seemed off. He’s always been quiet but never so, just not there before. After I asked him he just responded, “I’m doing as usual”. I asked him what that meant and at this point I was feeling a bit uneasy so I just straight up asked if something was wrong and if he wanted to talk. He replied saying “no I just have my emotions turned off”. He explained it was difficult to turn them back on once they had been off for a while. I asked if there was any reason he felt the need to do that. He replied saying that’s what he’s always done and that it’s just difficult to switch back. All this is being said btw with a complete lack of emotion from his face and the same posture I spoke of at the beginning. I was super unnerved but kind of felt like he was saying it to be different if that makes sense. I don’t mean to seem so ignorant, but it really sounded like something out of a twilight fan fiction book. I don’t know if I should be worried or what to think really. It all just made me feel really unnerved. So anyways my question... Has anyone dealt with this? Should I just ignore this trait in him or should I try to talk with him more about it?"

I just think it would be so much better to be dead but again, I'm not in a place where I could actually do it. Is this normal or any cause for concern?"
277,Called APS on my dad,"I'm having a bad time and this is why. I'm starting to fall into a dark place again...

My dad has diabetes, dementia, and high blood pressure. He wasn't taking care of his health and it resulted in him losing a toe.

He's been hospitalized 3 times for refusing to take IV antibiotics. Recent xrays have shown that every bone in his foot is broken because the infection is eating away at his bones. He continues to walk on the foot even though he's supposed to use a boot and crutches. He goes to a wound care clinic to get his foot cleaned once a week. They've told him repeatedly how to clean his foot properly at home. He refuses.

He experiences no pain due to neuropathy. He uses the rough side a kitchen sponge to scrub his foot and the open wound. He uses a callous grinder (think pedicure egg) to get rid of the dead skin on his legs until he bleeds. Then pours peroxide all over his leg and foot. He's convinced himself that his foot will heal on it's own. Newsflash, it hasn't. In fact, it's gotten worse. He refuses to let me clean his wound or go to the hospital for treatment.

I called social services because I believe he doesn't understand the severity of this infection. The social worker came by and told him he may have to be put on an involuntary hold at the hospital the next time she makes a visit. I showed her the living conditions of the house. There's rat poop everywhere (rat infestation that went on for a year because he didn't tell anyone about it.) He's been eating expired and moldy food. All 4 bedrooms in the house are unusable because my dad hoards tons of 45 gal trash bags filled with literal garbage in all the rooms.

Now, half my family is mad at me. They're telling me I should mind my own business and let him do what he wants. Thing is, what he wants is going to kill him. Of course my dad is mad as well and has been calling me awful names everyday ever since.

My family and my dad has been treating me like s*** ever since this event."
278,"Weird state of mind - need help, but don't want help","I'm currently in a really weird state of mind. I clearly need help and I could get the help I need, I guess. But somehow I don't want help. I'm about to destroy my life and I'm pretty aware of that. I kinda want it that way, I don't want someone to help me. I don't know what this is, never felt something like that. It doesn't make any sense. 
Anybody else?"
279,I don't know how to deal with myself anymore and kinda need some advice,"So yeah, this is kinda a vent/advice needed. I don't kinda think I have think few mental problems, although I have never checked with a counselor/psychologist so I don't really know if I have any of them or not, although if I we're to diagnose myself I would say that I have social anxiety and I'm paranoid. I was never a social person and due to some mistakes I made I'm even more isolated lately, even not eating lunch at all everyday so I can just hide. I always tough my classmates spoke behind my back and in social groups I'm not in but lately they have been directly attacking me verbally, such as kinda making fun of my name or making jokes about my way to talking or insulting me with jokes. Today one of them Sayed that if I should just drop out. This is kinda leading to seriously bad toughs, such as taking my life and searching the best method for it online (apparently the best one I found is blowing my head with a shotgun or cyanide), coming to my school with a knife and stabbing a few of the person I seriously hate most. I'm lately seriously thinking in dropping out and somehow make due since I'm almost 18. So yeah, can somebody give me some advice on what to do, because if it was for me I'm probably just going to jump in front of a truck haha."
280,I think I have schizophrenia.,"I'm an 18 year old male in a city in New Zealand. I was born prematurely at 25 weeks gestation and I've been diagnosed with non-verbal learning disorder. My grandfather has bipolar disorder, and my uncle experiences psychosis. 

I started hearing voices (that usually say my name only and are different voices every time) when I was 4. Once I started going to school at 5 I developed quite closed interests. I also believed I had magical powers, to the point where I made my parents literally put them in a bottle so I could take them on the plane. I didn't hear voices from age 4 to about age 10, which is when I had a religious identity crisis, went emo, and believed I was a vampire. I didn't have any stable friendships bar one and was bullied. 

An earthquake occurred a year before and I had to move out because of it, and my best friend's mum (who used to take us for outings and generally involve herself with us) died. My parents divorced and my mother took it out on me. She frequently accused me of favouring my dad, got angry when I didn't agree with her, and violated my privacy, and I've come to resent her for it.  

I became more 'normal' around the middle of high school and developed a wide range of friends and interests, but the intense interest in religion remained. My mum and stepdad moved into a new house. It was immediately after then that my mum began enforcing a 'no-electronics after 5 pm' and 'close all your drawers completely shut or you won't get pocket money' rules, which I hated. One of my stepdad's sons, who was older than I was, had jealous fits of anger and was incredibly manipulative. I've since graduated from high school and started fast-food work, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. It all started when I was smoking cannabis a couple of weeks ago, I kept hearing voices saying nonsensical things and narrarating my actions as imperatives (eg. 'open the door' as i'm opening the door). I also heard voices singing a name of a politician I admire over and over again in the same tone for extended periods of time. I thought people were living inside my house, then invading my house, and that the cops were raiding my house after the neighbour called the cops on my weed. I went outside to get some fresh air, I walked past a lady with a stroller and I heard a women's voice say ""close the back window"" RIGHT IN MY EAR when she was quite separated from me. i thought that it was her and that she was a sympathetic invader, and then i closed the back window. I can't sleep, and when I do I don't sleep for long. I eat little apart from family dinners, I feel clumsy, disoriented, paranoid, and confused. I regularly cannot comprehend what people are saying. I'm momentarily suspicious of others, along with thinking they don't like me, or thinking they think I'm significantly disabled. I think something's wrong."
281,Am I okay?,"Current situation: I am 20 years old. I work full time for minimum wage. I'm not currently attending classes. When I'm not at work, I sleep or browse the internet. I eat one meal per day. I am nocturnal. I have no friends and I don't talk to anyone outside of work. Even if I had the chance, I would choose not to because I consider myself a toxic person and that cannot be fixed or controlled.  I don't do anything that I enjoy, and I have no will or plans to do so.  I don't go anywhere outside of work, with the exception of the occasional midnight store run. I have no will to live. I have no will to die. I have nothing to look forward to. I have no emotions. I'm just here. I'm not happy. I just exist. I have dreams but no plausible plans. Advice? Ideas? Commentary? I'm not sure what I'm seeking."
282,How do I keep comparing myself to everyone else?,"I am a 24F with Turner Syndrome and Traumatic Brain Injury. I am also a product of emotional abuse, which caused me to isolate myself from others. All of these factors have socially stunted me, which makes it harder for me to connect with people. I have been on a few dates but I have never been in a committed relationship. I have never kissed anyone either and I am still a virgin. All I can think about is being in the company of a handsome and charming man who I can kiss, cuddle, laugh with, make love to, and be my companion. But that will probably never happen. After all whenever I meet men, I have a tendency to develop intense feelings for them very very quickly but they all reject me in one way or another. I don’t blame them. After all, who would want to date a 16-year-old girl in a 24-year-old woman’s body?

Every night, I feel so very lonely while wishing I was a neurotypical. Wishing I was creative and as good of an artist as my best friend. Wishing I was as pretty as the female servers at the restaurant I work at. Wishing I had a fun/exuberant/dynamic personality like one of my former friends. Wishing I could be like Ariana Grande in the sense that she is able to carry herself like a princess even though she struggles with mental health issues due to the  hardships she faced recently. Hell, when I look at the lyrics of her song, Thank U, Next.....I choke up a little bit when I hear the line: “Besides I met someone else...../Her name is Ari”. The reason I choke up when I hear this line is because I wish I had the courage to be my own best friend and not feeling like I need a man to define me....but that’s not the case.

Any advice?"
283,What type of mental illness does my mom (probably) have?,"My mom has a history of mental illness, and whenever she goes to a healthcare professional/psychologist she fakes it to make it look like she is perfectly fine, when in reality she is just off. I will try to provide as many examples and background information as possible. My mom has a history of undiagnosed mental illness. It's probably schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and because of it, my little brother and I were removed from her house in 2014 for emotional and physical abuse.

* My grandma said my mom has always been a little off, but I have noticed she has gotten worse under stress and after my ex-stepdad left her around 2010. 
* She has chronic migraines and had a head injury as a child. 
* She started out subtle by asking me what kinda dreams I had, and told me to ""smash any mirrors you see in your dreams because bad people are hooking you up to machines and this isn't real."" I could go on about the types of things she said/says, but I have a couple of images of notes she has left around her house (that I will link below). The types of things she says are just so far-out, that it's incomprehensible. She has told me to put cotton balls in my ears, to ""register myself as a clerk in the realm,"" etc. Most of her sayings are conspiracies or nonsense.
* She has never mentioned anything to me about voices in her head, but I'm not sure if she does or not.
* She is extremely quick to anger and calm down. One time, we got into a HUGE fight when I was 13, and I ran away to my grandma's. 5 minutes after I arrived, she threatened to ""beat my ass,"" then when I got home she looked at me, smiled and said *""Hi \[my name\]!""* as if nothing ever happened.
* She goes up to strangers and pretends as if she has known them for years, which usually scares the stranger.
* She mutters things to herself and laughs.
* She can never really keep a conversation. She will start a sentence, pause for a few seconds, zone out, and either continue her sentence or switch the conversation.

Any ideas? I will happily provide more information as needed.

284,How do I stop,I’m quite suicidal. I’ve been recently diagnosed with bpd and I’m so codependent. I also just got broken up with by a long term relationship. Being happy revolves around that one person because I was never truly happy before. Throughout the day I distract myself by going out or watching tv and forcing myself to not think about it.

Today we were really worried about her so we reacted in the worst possible way we have been trying to talk her out of her bad eating habits but she refuse to listen and her excuse is that we are making her mad and she eats according to her mood we are encouraging her to go on a healthy diet and exercise but the is starving her self and I honestly don’t know how or what to do to help.

290,Help me. A list of things that have happened in my life.,"- I was born. July 2003. 

- Foundation I was a bit of a loner but still knew everyone and they knew me. 

- year 1 I started making more friends 

- year 2 my best friend moved schools and I became a loner so I started reading books, revising alot. 

- year 3 I tried not going to school much because I hated my teacher and she hated me, she always treated me like shit even though I was only 7-8? 

- year 4 I tried to stab my friend that lived across the street just because she wanted to go home. I apologised the same day and all was good with her after. 

- year 5 I met a couple new girls who I became close friends with, neither where in my year thought. 

- year 6 my friend and I met another girl, they then both started hanging out without me and I got really lonely, I started binge eating because I was always bored and I got really upset. My mum also got her first boyfriend since I was born, he just moved in about a month aftwr meeting with his two dogs ( we had to give away my cat that we’d had about 6months, but I really loved her, and I think shes the only thing Ive really loved.)

- year 7 my mums boyfriend moved out and I met one of the girls I knew in year 5 aswell as another girl but then soon got abandoned. After Christmas I started hanging out with a massive group; two of them had anxiety, one had depression and the rest were all nice other than one who was like the “leader”. She said I couldnt hang out with them and nor could the two with mental health problems. She then told us to go away, so me and one of them did, but the other had an anxiety attack. At the end of year 7 was my birthday - I invited the 3 friends I was closest to and 2 of then dumped it on me on the day that they couldnt come, I got angry about it and lashed out at the girl with anxiety. I left her in a place she didn’t know. The last week of school was a year 7 camp trip, I was in a tent with a girl who I was “friends” with, she always made things about guys though and would try to sleep with them. 

- year 8 I was friendless going in but had anxiety and anger management sessions first thing every monday morning. 

- year 9 I large hit of depression hit me like a truck. I started cutting, crying, wanting to kill myself. I ate my feelings for half of the time but then my mum put a lock on the kitchen door and then my method of dealing became selfharm. I did art and one of my teachers were really supportive, but the other seemed to hate me. Im not sure why. At the end of the year my mum got a new boyfriend and he started taking her away from me. She’d leave me alone in the house from 9am-12pm. I felt abandoned. I tried commiting suicide in June and hoped by the time I did it the ambulance I called would be there so my mum didn’t have to see my body. My grandad came round though while I was about to do it. I told him an ambulance is on it’s way and showed him my wrists. He then got in his car and left and then my aunt and cousin came over. I was in tears, I couldnt talk to the ambulance people when they got there. Id just lost everything snd I didnt want to be alive to witness more people leaving. I then stopped going to school until september. 

year 10- I moved school because I was scared that people knew. I couldn’t do a full day so they put me on a 25% time table but I was still unsure. I did english, art and business at first, then added geography and maths before dropping out again. I was still cutting and felt lonely all the fucjing time. I wasnt happy more than once a fortnight - not even for a split second. 

year 11- I moved to my aunts house and got enrolled in college a year early, I started doing 1 day a week but moved that up to 4 then back down to 3. I started to be happier. In about february I was meant to meet up with a boy, my aunt some how found out and wouldn’t let me go. She then told me she read my diary and I started hitting her - like I used to hit my mum. She left the room and I was on call with someone so had to quivkly switch from “I hate you I hate you!” to “hey how are you? in okay thanks” wven though I wasnt. My aunt walked in again after that and was pissed because I acted like nothing had just happened. I quickly shut my laptop down and shoved her out. I called my mum and made her pick me up. I packed all my things in a couple of bags. Sadly I had to move back to my aunts the next day. 

- in year 11 there was also May. Me and my mum went to meet a boy who I “edated” and he never came. I got pissed and so did my mum because we travelled over 200miles just so I could meet him. I thought Id be happy. but the few days I was meant to meet him were the biggest switch in difference of my mood. The travel day I was so happy and excited, I couldnt stop smiling or talking, my cheeks really hurt I was grinning that much. The day we were meant to meet I started to calm down and get anxious but then he said itd have to be later, so we postponed till 4pm. He never showed up and I just wanted to cry. Then we saw him with his friend, his friend started me dead in the face while I dont think he even saw me. I wish we timed that so that we ran over and killed by him accident sometimes. I hated that he did that to me, I cried internally so much and refused to eat more than a banana for about 3 days after. 

- in june we went on holiday, myself, my mum and who id class as my “dad”. We went to scotland, nearly got in a carcrash, well we kinda did. and all I wanted was for us to have actually gotten in it. Id be dead if a car came from the other direction at the right time. 

- in july hust aftwr my birthday I met this boy online. He lived in america but we started spending alot of time together. I started staying up to call with him and wed watch movies, play t or d, play video games or just talk casually. We laughed and I started to fall for him. Everything seemed right, everything seemed pure and he was the one person that seemed to understand me. I dont care if people die, I care about losing people when I could have prevented that. And in the new year, he became one of yhose people I loved and lost because I pushed him away. 

- in september I moved back with my mum abd started missing college again. I got depressed and started to selfharm like there was no tomorrow. The boy I loved knew that and he tried stopping me. Actually he did. Then he said he was gonna kill himself. and he attempted. He failed. When he came back things were different though. We stopped calling and i got scared. 

- in november a new girl joined the community and they started talking as fruends, I got jealous. I was jealous of her. She was beautiful and everyone liked her. I thought he’d start liking her more than me and he gave signs of that but alwags denied it. 

- In december I spoke to him like 3 days out of the 31. He was busy with his irl life, and I understood that but he didn’t need to come back mad each time just because I was trying to be happy. I made plans to meet 3 boys feom online in birmingham which was a really good day, I really enjoyed it. After that I stopped talking to them all though. I quit using my pc and just wanted to be happy.

-january. I messaged the boy I “loved” when I was high and wanted to talk with him. Get “closure”. I wanted to understand the situation even though I knew what it was. And we did that, we said we’d be friends? but how can you be friends with someone you loved and I knew I wouldnt be able to. I ruined any chance of being friends though when I asked if he could help with my english homework. He saw red and that was it. It was over. He messaged me on twitter a list of what he didnt like about me (basically everything) then said hed “met someone” irl. And I just cried. Im still crying. 

- Now. Now Im just sad and lonely. I dont have anyone irl or online. No one understands me. I hate myself, my mood changes from hot to cold, I want to cut myself, I want the people I lost back and I want them to love me the way I loved them. But Im never going to have that. I should be used to everyone leaving by now. But truth is Im not. So maybe I should be the one to leave for once."
291,How do I book a doctor's appointment to talk about depression?,"I want to book an appointment with my GP so I can talk with him about my depression and some treatment for it. But I don't know what to do? Like I know, call the office and say I'd like to book an appointment. But I know the administrative assistant answering the phone is going to ask what the reason for the appointment is, and I really don't want to just say that it's because of my mental health. I don't want to talk about that with anyone other than my doctor, I'm really private about that stuff. Please someone tell me what I can say without giving away any info about it. I'm having a lot of anxiety about it, and it may seem stupid but I've been putting this off for weeks literally because I don't want to tell some random person on the phone that I've got a mental illness."
292,I've lost all intrest in life,"I have lost all interest in life. I have my maths exam tomorrow and it is a big one, but I honestly don't give a shit if I pass or fail or even top. I don't even want to do anything at the moment. Can't go to my friends coz they have to study for the exam and can't go to my family coz they are the cause of it. Honestly debating killing myself at the moment. Any advice?"

294,Extreme paranoia,"My brother is experiencing extreme paranoia.
He leaves his pee and stool in weird places, wont shower and became religious and straight (he is flamboyant,gay and super outgoing) now he wants to get married..
I dont know how to deal with him, my parents are passive with him I'm the only one that questions him and trying to make him make sense? 
He was fine a week ago and he has a appointment with a psychiatrist in four days
How should I treat/ act around him ?"
295,My partner gets angry when i do something that sparks their anxiety. How to proceed going forward?,"My partner is currently in a job that cases them very high anxiety. To be fair to them they have tried therapy and medication. They recently came off the medication after a discussion we had. Neither felt it was making a difference other than the negative side-effects. 

The job will end in a few months and the agreement we came to was that once the job is done i will no longer give them any validation etc for their anxieties. 

The issue currently is that things happen that i don’t know will spike anxiety and they get really angry in the moment. I don’t know if anger or panic is the right word but it is very emotionally draining for me. The anger is never physical they just get really annoyed at me."
296,Never will things go well,"I was well mentally and physically I was creative and about to start my life and achieve my goals.... 

But oh I had to fallen mysteriously ill and lost a whole bloddy year of my life then going to start again going to start my career going to be happy and just well and oh the amazon caught on fire and then Australia blazed up and then when things were looking well the caronavirus came out of nowhere and no one gives a shit they go out they sneeze all over you they travel and expect to not be disrespected...

I wa suicidal and now I'm not because there is so much to live for and oh the world is ending and instead of jumping of a cliff and end it all I'm just waiting to get sick to be forced to go into hospitals which I hate why should I plan why should I think about the future why should I 

but I am I'm just living till it over but this is too much everytime I live to be happy something happens all the time 

I smile someone dyed I laugh someone gets cancer I am pleased a war will start... and then nothing happens and I continue 

so I'm assuming that this time its like that all of this is just faith messing with to not be happy but then nothing happens if I be happy.. 

I suffered from ocd and schizotypal and many say it's a disorder and delusional but are they if they are actually happening how can they be false if they are real....

why dont people belive me when I say that I am cursed"
297,Narcissim (NPD) X Antisocial (ASPD),"I think I have both, and I would like to know if it is possible and if so, what is the name of this. I've thought about it, but I don't know. I think I could be a kind of fusion of psychopathy and sociopathy."
298,I’m afraid I’ll kill myself if my boyfriend doesn’t take me back,"We’ve been together over 6 years, I’m 25F, he’s 26M. I’ve had trust issues and I annoy him with it. I didn’t go to enough therapy to fix it. We went to a party Friday night and I got very drunk and blacked out at times (I don’t usually do this.) I don’t remember the following: We were on our way out and He went back for my stuff and accused him of wanting to go back into talk to this chick. I have no reason to distrust him. He said I kept accusing him and wouldn’t listen to reason and then attached him. He said I punched and kicked and scratched his arm. He showed me pics of the scratches. He says he can’t and won’t be with me. 

I’m hopeful in time he may consider having me in his life. We had no history of violence, ive apologized so much and tried to talk it out but he didn’t want to hear it. How could I do this to him? We had plans of getting married next year, we hang out every day, play DnD together twice a week, all of my friends are his friends, his family is basically my family at this point. I have no idea how to go on without him.

I’m thinking I may try to talk in a week because I know he told our DnD groups “I just couldn’t make it” as opposed to, “she attacked me and it’s done.” I dont feel like my life is worth it without him. I’m waiting to be matched with an online therapist but I’m scared I’ll just end it this weekend if he won’t take me back."
299,"""Sometimes, even to live is an act of courage."" -Seneca","I am thoroughly ignorant on the pain you are withstanding at the moment. 

I have no idea of the sadness that cripples you, the weight that hinders you, the trauma that haunts you. I know not of the anxiety that grips you every morning, wondering what fiends would seek your destruction today. I cannot share in your loss; the torrent of tears that dampen your pillow, emotions broken on the rack of heartache.  I bear no relation to your depression, for I am not you, and you are fighting this battle on your own field and in your own methods. 

But if you're reading this, I know then of your courage. 

I know of your faith in tomorrow, no matter how faint, and I can feel the soul of you that grips onto hope in a vice lock of determination. I can share in the belief that you possess; the knowledge that this too will pass, and that you will once again walk in pastures of peace.  I bear your bravery and fortitude as bold inspiration. I am smitten by your tenacity, humbled by your resolve to continue the quest. 

I feel the poetry of your struggle, for I too am human, and I too see the power and beauty of your will. 

So fight on until tomorrow, and the day after, and again, and again and again. Battle on for those that love you. For the one's that both need and cherish you. For those worthy of your affections that you haven't even met yet. Fight on unrelenting, until the battle illuminates your strength and worth. Believe in them, for even if all around you do not...I do. 

Yes, we are strangers. What harm then in my beliefs if you prove them true?

If you take my words, then give me your trust when I write: 

You *can* weather this. You *can* surpass this.

You *will* triumph.  

(I simply hope this helps. Have a great day!)"
300,Dealing with anxiety and depression for the first time.,"I’m a 23 year old male who graduated with an undergraduate degree in entrepreneurship last spring. I live in and have grown up in the US. I’ve been a really genuinely happy individual for all of my life, and have always had a go with the flow disposition. I started my first very well paying salary job halfway across the country as a project manager for a large company in September (not in an industry I thought I would ever really go into), and have been going through 6 months of training with a deadline on March 9. I have also been assigned a customer and often travel for work to their site. This customer is on an expedited timeline and I joined mid install due to someone else in my role quitting. I had a week transition period. This customer deadline is April 1, less than a month away from my training requirements’ deadline, which is almost unheard of for new hires.

Recently, I have been extremely overwhelmed with the customer work that has been given to me. Many of the people involved in the project also seem overwhelmed and exhausted, and all of the people that I’m assigning tasks to that have been here for 15+ years say they’ve never been this busy in such a short amount of time. I have tasks coming in faster than I can complete them, which often means I need to work 10+ hours a day, 5 days a week. While all this is going on, I’m still expected to be completing my training requirements, so that means I’m expected to be working on weekends as well.

I think it’s worth mentioning that this company has a reputation of hiring people fresh out of college and burning them out quickly. The benefits and pay are usually great enough to justify sticking around for most people. My role and app that I’m on is notorious for being one of the most difficult, and we’ve been bleeding quite a few people over these past 6 months.

All of this has lead up to me experiencing severe anxiety and some depression. I often cannot sleep at night because I’m constantly thinking about what needs to get done or what I didn’t get to. I struggle to get out of bed every morning and face the endless list of tasks, just to work my ass of in doing them but still being told by my superiors that it isn’t enough. My days consist of getting ready for work, heading to work early, staying late, coming home, maybe eat if I can, reading for an hour, trying to sleep early so I can catch back up on sleep, even though I still wake up usually after my first REM cycle and being unable to fall back asleep. I feel isolated and lonely most days.

On the weekends I sometimes see the two friends I have here, but it’s mostly spent with me being inside playing games talking with longtime friends, watching something on streaming services, or reading. My enjoyment of these activities has also been getting less and less each weekend. 

I feel like I’ve done everything I can to help: I’ve stopped drinking, stopped smoking, tried to go to sleep on a regular schedule, bought a weighted blanket, read before bed to clear my thoughts, drink lots of water and tea, stay away from caffeine, and I just started seeing a therapist, but I’m still feeling anxious and depressed.

I have breakdowns often, especially on Sundays. I feel like a failure because I can’t get ahead. My motivation extremely lacking because this job loop just isn’t satisfying to me, and I don’t enjoy the industry I’m in. I have reached out to my superiors for help multiple times with little to no success, and it’s hurt my faith in the company as a whole. I feel like a failure. I want to quit at the end of this project, but the money and benefits will likely not be matched by anything else I can realistically obtain. Plus, how do I know the next job won’t be worse? My current thoughts on what to do are to start applying to other jobs and quit once this project wraps up in April."
301,Please help,"I have been posting in this subreddit a lot. I want to kill myself. I don’t want to die I just want school to end. I hate going there. It causes me mental pain every time I have to get out of bed, hours and hours before I would on a weekend. It never get enough sleep. I want it to end. I hate school. I wish it would just end. It has caused me severe depression for a few years. It is causing so much more harm that good. I don’t remember a single thing I’ve been taught this year. I cant Stand it anymore. I want to kill myself because I want it to end and I’m too afraid to tell anyone."
302,Feeling out of control,"Everything irritates me ... I feel annoyed 90% of the time and 85% of the time I don’t even know why. I spend time trying to justify why I feel so annoyed but I always come to the conclusion that I am crazy. And the worst part is I take it out on my fiancé who is the most understanding and patient person. I feel scared of myself... like I don’t know how I’m going to react to something and I feel like I can’t control it. I’ve never experienced this until the last month. And I do think a lot of the reason is because I moved to my fiancé’s country to stay with him while we wait for his visa to process to come to the USA. We live with his family and it’s so much harder than I thought it would be. But I feel like a beast because they are amazing people but for some reason little things make me so upset or angry and I never used to be like that. I am generally very laid back and understanding and now I don’t even like who I am anymore. But I don’t know what to do. I feel like there’s no solution. My fiancé is so good to me, always comforting me telling me that it’s normal because it’s not easy living in another country and trying to adjust. And I’ll feel better but then the next hour I feel so irritated again like I’m going to have a mental breakdown and I just want to shut the world out so I don’t hurt anyone, especially him. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m at my breaking point or close 
Has anyone else experienced this ??"
303,I haven’t been properly diagnosed for anything but I’m pretty sure something’s wrong,"I don’t know what triggers people but i’m describing my experiences recently so i dunno if it’ll be a bad thing to read for others. Rest assured, theres nothing visceral/traumatic in it.







I’m pretty sure it’s not normal to feel scared when your groupmates chat you personally because you havent been online this entire weekend because you just ”didnt feel like” opening messenger but actually was avoiding everything because you have an irrational fear of disappointing everyone and the only solution you thought of was to ignore everything and just read manga the entire time.

I’m also sure that crying after being messaged and overall kind of feeling of dread up till now isn’t something you should be feeling and doing when there’s a simple solution such as looking at the message and replying to it right there in front of you and yet choosing not to isn’t something someone with a normal brain would do.

Plus i think not everyone is wishing that violent and debilitating accidents/illnesses happen to them just so that they can explain why they couldn’t reply to said groupmates before now.

Aside from that, i’d be surprised if anyone could get to work if everyone fell asleep/felt like they had to punch something whenever they tried to work or daydream an entire life based on something interesting they heard from what they were listening to or somehow lack the innate talent of organizing ideas into something coherent, whether orally or written.

I don’t know what to believe anymore. Every introduction i gave when school started felt like a lie while they were leaving my mouth. Smiling makes me feel happy and ive been using that to hide my sadness for a while now.  Now i dont know if i’m sad or not, except for the times that i just cry.

I dont even know why i’m still typing out my screams of help inside my notes when i know no one will read them if i dont show it to someone."
304,I discovered that my girlfriend has a dissociative personality disorder (multiple),"Descubri que mi novia tiene trastorno de personalidad disoaciva (multiple) Necesito ayuda, piensa mucho en suicidarse y  pareciera que mi novia que conocí está siendo rehen de su parte ""mala""

305,"In need of therapy, but too broke to afford it lol","ok so lately i feel like i fell into a big whole of saddness but i cant explain it and i find it really hard to express my  feelings. i always stay in my room at home and cant stand my parents coming into my room but at the same time id really freaking love to be with them (idk if it makes sense)
 i barely ever told my parents i love them and i really want to but i cant seem to get those words out even tho i really am grateful for them
 ive wanted to get therapy for quite some time since i hate talking to people ab my feelings (as i said earlier) but that ruined many of my relationships with people around me and i feel like im really hurting my parents.
 i talked ab it with my dad and he tried finding a way but we're your typical family that lives on one salary (my mom is stuck in bed bc of her illness), as yall.know, therapy is hella.expensive. My dad is a sculptor so his salary is pretty small, having to buy food for 3 people, and the many expensive pills my mom needs, so i gave up on the idea of seeking proffesional help but so far i couldnt deal with my emotions myself.
   So, the whole point of this long ass thread is basically to ask if anyone knows any therapy sites  or anything that could help that is free or smth convenient.

306,I feel like I get overly attached to anyone who shows me fondness,"A while back I was kicked out of a friend group because of some arguments and now every time someone is friendly to me I can't help but feel like I must cling on as hard as I can so I won't be alone, I'm worried that I will grow increasingly controlling over them and appear overbearing. It's even worse as I realize that the majority of these few people don't even care that much in the first place, I'm just someone they talk to sometimes while I worry about angering them, or saying the wrong thing, or revealing too much of myself etc, and distancing them as a result. I feel so conflicted, can someone give some advice?"
307,How to start a conversation with an old friend,"I ran into an old high school friend yesterday and dealing with depression/ anxiety myself I could tell that he’s battling with it. I haven’t talked to him in years, so we practically have no relationship anymore. I want to figure out a way to let him know that he can talk to me if he needs but I don’t know how to create that conversation. Also he lives a couple states over now so I won’t be able to do it in person. How should I bring up the conversation and let him know he can talk to me."
308,I feel so lost.,"I feel so lost. Everything just feels like it’s sloppy away. I’m usually good at writing how I feel, but I just feel so numb, so lost and so alone right now."
309,Increasingly feeling out of emotional control?,"Over the last year or so I (26f) have struggled with an increasing amount what I call 'bad days'...these are days when I feel so overwhelmingly pessimistic that nothing good can reach me. I am needlessly mean to my husband, all those who work around me and find myself not caring about others or my life at all, which is very different than how I normally am. I think about walking away from all my responsibilities when the day before I was happy and cheerful and loving my life. I feel like I try and be happy but there is this intense haze that makes it impossible. 

I used to only get these days every few months, then it increased to once a month a week or so before my period (i am on birth control and have been for years) now I get them randomly at least four or five days out of the month, with no correlation to my cycle. I am scared because I feel I am absoloutely not myself and have to fake my way through the day without yelling or being irritated at people when I just want to be left alone. I have no history of mental health issues. Is this normal? Is it part of getting older and does it get worse? Should I be seeking help? 

Thanks!"
310,"I am an extrovert to the point where my ""recharging"" is done with people. Is that bad?","Hi guys. I just had a question

So I am an extrovert, and it is to the point where I need time socializing in order to ""recharge"" me before I can spend time alone (studying, etc). This has always been the case.

Recently, however, it's kind of intensified, probably because my schedule is diverging from my friends' (intro classes are ending). The question I had was: Where is the line between this need to ""recharge"" with social interaction and just plain loneliness?

Any input is appreciated, thanks"
311,How to not be SAD?,I recently was diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and am trying to find ways to cope. What helps motivate you to get out of bed in the morning? This is what I struggle with the most. Any advice is much appreciated!
312,Struggling with Reality,"Hi there,
I'm going through a very difficult time. I'm unsure whether my relationships with other people are truly genuine and in a way real. I hope this makes sense? I'm feeling very alone right now and don't know who to turn to for help. Has anyone else ever felt this way? Sort of like you're living in a dreamworld or that you don't mean to other people what they mean to you? 

Also, I want to encourage you, that no matter how dark it may seem, there is still hope, so don't give up! I'm rooting for you, I'm in your corner! 

Please share your experiences, if you feel comfortable."
313,"mind vomit on shit karma, trust issues, and overthinking","This is one of the first posts I've ever made here. I just officially got a reddit account after anon lurking for quite some time. But recently, my overthinking is becoming overbearing. I am emphatic to a fault. Since I was little, I learned to be a people pleaser. I was always hyper aware of other emotions, could feel them as they were my own, and always put others before me. Even if it was detrimental to my mental health and well-being. Probably started by my narcissistic mother from a young age, which strung into a pattern of narcissistic partners (not all but most) who were emotionally and verbally abusive. Most partners before me have cheated on me. Often times with 1 person, but sometimes with two. Later, got married and was highly unsatisfied with a severe lack of communication skills and maturity, I cheated on my ex husband. I broke it off with the person who I ended up falling in love with to try and save the marriage. Went to couples therapy a few times. I went to individual therapy much more consistently. My husband didn't, and I was worried because I knew the pain I caused. The last 6 months were shit but more often than not I think I deserved it. Much to my therapists dismay. He sat in his pain, becoming emotionally and verbally abusive. Not to say he wasn't before. He had a controlling nature but if was few and far between. But after we both agreed to try and make it work, it became constant berating and verbal abuse. I tried to become as agreeable as possible. To be open and honest with him. He had access to everything as I understood what I had done, and him being paranoid, insecure and unsure. And I wanted to make him feel as  comfortable as possible. Long story short, it didn't work out. We ended it.

So now...its been some time. I'm in a new relationship. Haven't been able to go to therapy since it was finalized because money has been tight. He was the breadwinner and didn't want/find it necessary for me to work so fucked myself on that one. I have anxiety and depression, and am a chronic overthinker. And in this new relationship, I never noticed how fucked up I was until he tried to love me. He's brutally honest, which is nothing something I'm used to. Not in a disrespectful way. So he seems trustworthy and honest. He hasn't given me much (if any) reason to not trust him. But I find my trust issues are worse than I imagined. Not only because I was cheated on numerous times before my ex husband, but because I in turn became a cheater and did the thing I swore to never do. Something I never was before. It's like...you know the signs from both sides. And sometimes it may not even be that. It could just be paranoia. Scared that shit karma will come back from when I was a shitty person. Sometimes what I think is idiotic. He says he's going back to bed (cause it's ldr and we fall asleep together most nights on call) and I see fb chat says he's active...even knowing that shit is inaccurate still makes me suspicious and my mind wander. And lately, feeling insecure with high depression has my mind in a blitz. Constant back and forth. Worrying. And the double-mindedness of worrying over 9000 and being numb/apathetic and accepting that things happen as they're meant to.

Just don't know what to do or think. Don't even expect replies. I just needed to get some of it out. Wish I could get out of my head."
314,Do you believe that depression is caused by both genetics and environmental factors?,"I don’t understand how the environment can contribute to depression, unless you were abused as a child. Everybody has environmental stressors (bad things happening), but most people don’t have depression."
315,I’m loved but I never belonged,"So I’m not 100% if this is the right place for this, but like I need to say it somehow.

I want to preface this by saying I feel loved and welcomed, I am usually happy and can make friends wherever. But I have never felt like I belonged. Even at home growing up, my family is close and we talk and we share but I still feel like an outsider.

And I don’t know why. I know people care about me, and I care about them, but I constantly feel like I’m a guests (not over staying my welcome) but still just a guest. This makes it so I never full relax. Even when I try to make my own apartment my space it just isn’t where I belong. I am 23 years old now and have not once felt like “this is my place, these are my people”.

I love my friends and family dearly. I would do whatever it takes to make them feel loved and happy and they would do the same for me.
Which is why I feel guilty— but I can’t help but feeling like this isn’t my place.

I don’t even know if I’ll ever have a place, a community, I connect with. I’m envious when I see other have it. I don’t want to invalidate my own feelings because I do know I have such great people in my lives, but I also feel like I shouldn’t be like this. But I am.

And that’s the main problem, that’s what gets he depressed and anxious. That under lying feeling of staying separated and alone."

318,"I don't know whats wrong with me, and it might get me fired.","Hello,

I live in the US, and I kinda feel like I should use a throwaway for this, but I feel like I shouldn't. I have struggled with depression/ depression related symptoms for quite a while. I used to live in another state, where my life fell apart, with me trying to commit suicide 3 different times, and being hospitalized for two of them. It got to the point I couldn't find a job, so I sold my house and moved. I moved to a new state, got a nice paying job. (highest paying so far.) I figured since I got myself rooted in this, I might as well work to get my mental health in check. The path wasn't easy, as many of my therapists were not very helpful. I don't really have the 6 weeks to check on if a medication is working or not, and it always bothered me about spending so much on meds to ""see"" if they work. Anyways, after talking to my doctor, and moving with a therapist, it was recommended to get TMS therapy. I was all for it, since it has a really nice success rate of almost like 85%. Throughout the treatment, I was stripped of my ""safety"" depression layer, which kinda allowed me to be overtly neutral to everything. After it was all said and done, now I am a hot mess. I am always sad, I am always upset, and I am always miserable. And with a pile of work that seemed to have failed on my watch, where I couldn't get it fixed or provide an answer, my confidence is shot too. It has boiled over to my home life, where now everywhere I go I have no confidence in anything, except for sleeping. I don't even know what to do anymore, as every answer is a resounding ""I don't know."" A co worker told me that my boss has been asking about me to see what was up, and with personal experience, that is a death sentence. I can honestly say, if I get fired it will be 100% my fault, and I fully accept that. But I am just kinda standing in the middle of my own miserable world, looking around, being completely lost. I don't know where to go, who to talk to, or what to do. I debated getting more therapy, but I really am afraid that it won't be fast enough to fix it, not to mention everyone I confide in is just a similar ""Only you can make changes in your life, if your miserable its your fault."" I get I am in the middle of this mess because I put myself there, but I just can't do anything. I feel stuck. I feel lost. I feel.... Alone. Does anyone, anyone at all have any ideas? What do I do?"
319,"so uhh i really nees help, due to my social anxiety and daily panic attacks its hard","basically im 14yo dude, ive been struggling with depression and selfharm since i was 10. my first suicide attempt was when i was about 11.  ive been to therapy for couple of years, still i cant talk to her because it makes me anxious and ruin my routines. i really need help because i cant continue like this. also i vent thru a breakup/lost my first friend. he doesnt want to be my friend, but a mutual. im also trans (ftm), and haha my moms a fucking ex-alcoholic and drug addict. havent seen her in a year. i cant talk to my dad or therapist or anyone no matter how hard i try. last time it lead to me going to an """"""open ward"""""" and me living for a while in my foster care. rn idk when im permanently going backnto home, but i see my dad evey other weekend and every tuesday to wednesday. fuck this just sucks, i need some fucking help"
320,have any of you guys been institutionalized?,"have any of you guys been voluntarily hospitalized or even involuntarily as a minor?
my mom has always stopped me from going to the hospital when I'm suicidal and don't trust myself. she'd always tell me cps would get involved and make me live with my father which I didn't want so I just had to somehow make it thru it. now I don't have my mom to stop me and I want to be brutally honest to my new psychiatrist about my suicidal tendencies, manic episodes, ptsd and self harming, I'm not sure if she'd say I need to be hospitalized but I think I would do it. please give me your opinions on this I don't want to end up doing something that can potentially make me worse."
321,"People I consider close often belittle and insult me, and it’s starting to get to my head.","I need advice. I’m not sure if I’m over reacting to these remarks or if I’m justified in being upset.

It seems that my close friends and family, including my girlfriend, often mock me. They will call me stupid, idiot, dumbass, etc. I get the sense that a lot of it might just be lighthearted and done out of love, but I’m not sure anymore.

What I don’t understand is why. Nobody else gets called those things (that I’m aware of) except for me. I know I’m not an idiot. I can take apart an entire engine and reassemble it, I can build and set up complex computer systems and servers, I have an eidetic memory and can remember lengthy numbers. You get the point, I consider myself to be reasonably bright. The only area I could improve is my short term memory which I believe ties into my ADHD. If I don’t pay extra attention to something my mind won’t hold on to it. 

Aside from that I’m always kind, understanding, and generous towards those people. I always go out of my way for them and I always try to do things to make them happy and their lives easier. Am I too nice? Do they see me as venerable, and as such, consider me an easy target? 

I’m not a machine, those comments fuck with me. I’m already struggling mentally, I don’t need more insecurity and instability.  

I just really need help right now. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
322,I Can’t Get Negative Obsessive Thoughts Out of My Head. Please help,"The last two weeks for me have been a waking nightmare. I’m in the middle of a crossroads with my girlfriend. We’ve been together for the past year and have done all kinds of things together like dinner and a movie to day trips, etc. I play baseball and she has come to see a bunch of my games. We live about an hour away but have still made it work.

About two months ago, her father died and it has been a rough go for her. She’s had drama with that, her job, her friends, etc. She currently sees a counselor for grief and we’ve been on a date since the death. However, it appears things have changed.

We’ve been sending texts over the past couple of weeks and both of us have misinterpreted them. She thinks I’m mad at her and I think she’s ignoring me but none of these have been true. Last week, she said she would get back to me after I called her and left a message but I waited three days with no response. I reached out to her and explained that I was worried for her.  

During that same phone conversation, I asked her that I was concerned about us and didn’t know where I stood. She told me that with everything going on, she didn’t know what to do with her life. She also said she had been busy and didn’t mean to ignore me, which has happened in the past but have always moved on with. She also told me she wasn’t ready to commit to a full relationship given what’s happened. However, we had a talk several months earlier when her father was still around and she said the same thing so I suggested we just continue dating and just enjoy each other’s company.

We talked again this weekend and had a more civil conversation. I brought this up again and again she said she doesn’t know what she wants. All I’m asking for is better communication and to keep seeing each other the way we have been.

She does care for me, saying that she doesn’t want to hurt me or hold me back. She wants me to start thinking of myself and move on if I wanted to but I’ve said repeatedly that I’m not going anywhere and she still had me as a friend. 

I’m just hung up on the thought that she may no longer see me as a romantic interest. Like I said, I just want better communication and for us to keep up the same pattern of dating we’ve been doing. I’m not pressuring her for a commitment.

I talk to a therapist and family but I feel like I’ve driven everyone nuts. I overthink constantly and only feel better when focusing on the problem and looking for answers. 

I really need some encouragement, comforting words or any other advice that may help.

Thank you"
323,Let’s all remember to give ourselves credit for what we accomplish every day.,"We have to give ourselves credit so we can slowly build up memories of our capabilities and get stronger. Know that we can accomplish things. 

Nothing is too “small.” Don’t let anyone define what your accomplishment should be to count. 

My accomplishment for yesterday was buying one pint of ice cream instead of two. I’m in a serious binge episode. Today my accomplishment was to deal with a major problem with the IRS. Two totally different accomplishments, but both deserve credit."
324,My depression is ruining my day to day life.,"I'm working at a very stressful job I cant take anymore. I'm wanting to quit to start school again and maybe work part time. I like what I do at my job but the people are awful. Theres only 8 of us running a store and the managers want you so involved it takes over the other parts of life and I cant stand it. My partner is working his dream job and loving life. I (20f) have been depressed for most of my life but a lot the last 5 years. It got better after moving in together, he makes me the happiest person alive. I was on 2 antidepressants when we started dating but I hated the side effects. Now I have my legal medical mj card which suits my life better than what I've tried in the past (different for everybody). Now my issue is just random mood changes and depressive moods. I feel happy all day and then one thing happens and I'm sitting here hyperventilating in tears. This happens everyday. It gets bad to the point where I wouldnt eat for days(I eat on my medication now). I just sit on the floor and do nothing. I cant bring myself to do anything else. I dont want to do things I enjoy because it takes too much effort. I get physically sick when I get this upset. I dont know what I'm doing with my life and I'm going crazy in my head. Nobody else around me understands things I've went through so I cant really talk about it to others. Just gets blown off everytime. I dont know what to do anymore..everyday life is so exhausting to me at this point"
325,Any advice?,I'm considering going to a psychiatrist and asking about taking anti-anxiety medication. Any testimonies on how it works? I feel like I'm always stuck thinking negative. feeling hopeless. even though I can try to think positive it's like there's just a weight holding me down. I'm always anxious of losing my wife and my job and feeling like everyone is always going to leave me. Do these issues seem like problems that could get solved with medication?
326,Struggling with analyzing my romantic relationships,"I’ve been in a relationship for about 3 months now, and it’s been a huge trigger for depression and anxiety. I was mostly single for a year and a half before that. And during that alone time I definitely had my bouts of depression, but it didn’t affect me as much because nobody else really had to deal with it. I have had serious relationships before, but they were often sort of emotionally taxing, and a similar pattern occurs. 

I just don’t know how to tell if things are good or if I’m “happy”. My depression has been bad this winter, I don’t feel any joy or desire for anything, much less excitement about another person. But logically I know there are a lot of things I like about my partner. He’s always supportive and showing me love. He has his downfalls like anybody, and I have a hard time not hyperfocusing on them. Like the instant he says something I disagree with, I’m instantly like—“see I knew this man would hurt me.”

I think my possibly Borderline mother, several mental/physical health issues, and also some painful relationships, made me absolutely terrified to let myself love. But I don’t know how much of this fear is me being guarded, or if I just straight up am with the “wrong” person. How could you ever tell the difference when you have apathy about most things? I’m always questioning people's value and whether they've “tricked” me into loving them. 

Besides, I believe people look for this movie romance, always believing something better, or The One, is out there, when the truth is real life doesn’t look like that—it looks more like a steady companion who’s there in good and bad and not always easy. It’s about who you actively choose to love.  It's just hard to know the difference between choosing and settling. 

My therapist, my friends and family, they all think it’s normal for me to feel this way when I’m depressed and tell me to keep my expectations low and take it day by day. That it's nothing wrong with me or him but just my inaccurate thought processes. But I obsess over it. The more I try to just enjoy the positives in our relationship, to relax, the more I think about it. And of course you’re going to feel shitty if you’re constantly thinking about how bad things could be and beating yourself up for not having the supposed right feelings. 

Comparing myself to neurotypical people and relationships just makes me feel panicked that something is wrong because I don’t feel what other people feel. And it makes me feel like maybe I’m just broken. 

Mostly a vent, and I’m curious if anyone can relate."
327,My medication isn't helping,"So I have been taking Zoloft for a few months now and it's not helping anymore! I am beginning to seriously wonder if I am becoming immune to it...

328,Looking back on my least favorite psychiatrist,"The one that said ""you may not know what you feel, but we do!""  
Last night when I couldn't sleep I thought it would be a good idea to find my old psych journal from 2013 (when I was 14) and find out where everything went wrong lol but it ended with me underlining all the lies and false information.

One thing that stood out to me was a conflict between me and my dad where I wouldn't allow him to monitor what I did on the computer (as in connect my computer to the tv and I was only allowed to use it when it was plugged to the tv for everyone to see). He took my phone as punishment and then talked to my psychiatrist (or t*heir* psychiatrist that they talked to about me) and the psychiatrist was basically like ""well parents need to set rules!"" and justified it. Like everytime we got in an argument about them not being allowed to look through my phone which sometimes ended with me not being allowed to have my phone. They would also take my phone when I was sleeping and go through my text. I didn't do drugs or anything before anyone asks, I still when I'm older think it was completely over the top.

I also wasn't allowed to go to school at one point because my parents didn't want me to but no one found this concerning?

I only got a year into the journal but I'm reading me going from happy and social in meetings with them to me not wanting to say a word to them and them saying ""clearly she's autistic look she has selective mutism because she has trouble talking!""

Also half of it was about me being ""anorexic"",,,, i was not anorexic. They also wrote I refused to eat unless I wasn't given ""special food"" but i was , a vegetarian. of course they didn't write that part they just wrote it under ""eating behaviours"". I remember he even wanted to get me into an eating disorder clinic.

I think it's very very concerning that I was about to underline at least 1 thing every page and how to this day I'm facing the consequenses of what this psychiatrist thought of me."
329,Good things don’t happen to me,"I’ve been trying to start my life over after a big trauma happened to me 10 years ago, and I really spiraled for a decade. I spent a lot of time doing drugs, drinking alcohol, and just making really bad decisions. I sabotaged myself a lot, and it made her life miserable for a really long time. I finally started getting my life on track a little bit by keeping a job, working on my health, making choices that are the best for me. I decided to move back to my hometown because I really wanted a fresh start and I wanted to live by myself so that I can get my life on track and do things for myself that I need to do. Found this house for rent in my hometown, which is really small and there are never any rentals, so this was a gym but I just got turned down for it and so that dream is now gone. There are no other places to rent and I really have no other options. So I guess I’m just going to have to keep staying in the misery that is my life for however much longer. For the last 10 years I’ve had this mantra that nothing ever good happens to me, and there for a couple of weeks I’ll let go of that so that I could feel good things like the opportunities and maybe feeling some hope, but reality just smacked me back down again. I should never of straight away from that mantra because that is my life. Nothing ever good happens to me. When I try and I think of being hopeful, something always comes along to remind me that that is not what is meant for my life. Good things, fulfilling things are not meant for me."
330,Panic Attack or something else..,"Last year mid April I was heading out of my house to travel to the airport to start my new job as a treeplanter. Unfortunately my dog ran out the gate and I had to sprint to catch her, four blocks later and I’m able to grab her. As we are in the car finally on our way. I’m catching my breath but not fully. As I am sitting in the passenger seat, it felt like half of my lungs weren’t giving me oxygen as I was trying to get my heart back down to a resting beat level. As we are getting closer to the airport my mind is filling with thoughts of self doubt in being able to even do my new job properly.

Then the tingling started to happen, it started in my calves/knees and worked its way up, then the tips of my fingers started too, more minutes passed and my entire hands and most of my lower portion of my body feels like its asleep/numb. The feeling started to creepy into my chest cavity and made my stomach feel like it flipped. My arms started to fold themselves towards my chest and then tingly/numb feeling was creeping into my lower jaw. My voice was slurring like I was having a stroke of some sorts. We pulled into a parking lot and after about 30 seconds of getting out of the car my body was fully functional again.

This has never happened since that occurrence other than a minor reoccurrence of tingling the next day in my knees and finger tips but other than that I have no health concerns or records that can help me relate to what has happened to me. To this day I am still wondering what had happened to me.

TLDR; Suffered stroke like symptoms from what  I think was a panic attack but need further opinions. Thanks!"
331,I keep bragging with the things I have in order to feel better about myself. How do I stop?,"I’m not sure if this is the right r/ for this but anyway, I am a teen girl and I come from a family that’s kind of well off. Therefore I have a lot of expensive things, clothes and I travel like a lot! But lately I’ve noticed that I can only feel good about myself when people acknowledge what I have so I keep kind of lowkey bragging with it. I feel like everyone’s gonna say that I’m a jerk and yeah maybe you’re right but at least I’ve realized that how I feel is wrong and I want to change it. Like deep down I know that I’m not more than others just because I have expensive things. 
I think it might be because when I was little I used to be made fun of and I often felt like I was less than everyone else (I still feel this way sometimes) and the only thing that works and makes me feel like I’m worth something are my expensive things. I really wish I could change this way of thinking but I don’t know where to start."
332,How do i stop selective memory,How do i listen and stop my selective memory
333,need help with current mental condition that i am afraid i am not able to treat well.," m 14.

i am having strong panic attacks and extreme paranoia from time to time, as well as anger issues. i just had my biggest panic attack in a long time.

i've noticed that something's wrong with me when i was 12, but it just degenerated even worse. when i was 13 i asked my parents if we could find and consult a specialist, which we did. but the psychologist i we got apparently doesn't get the situation like i do, and sometimes gives me questions about my problems that i can't answer, like ""what did you do that probably could've stuttered your emotional condition before you got driven mad?"" i don't fucking know, it happens for no reason

i feel like i should get special treatment because those simple techniques like telling myself to calm down during a panic attack, forcefully easening my breath don't work anymore. they did work before, they just stopped. it doesn't help anymore. but to get special treatment i should be diagnosed or at least have a receipt for medicine, which i can't get due to heavy load of time and the fact that there is no local psychiatrist for my area.

only thing that can stop my anger and/or panic attack is sharp pain, like a razor cut, which i use, but i know that this is not a proper way of treating my mental problems.

and to top it off, my parents often forget what my current condition is and do things that push me to another panic attack.

i am totally serious.

i don't know what to do. please help me. i don't want to live like this. i can't interact with people around me because of what i suffer."
334,How do you get over the fear?,
335,"Im breaking a law, but I think i3 won the fight with depression because of it?!","The fear is kicking in but the adrenaline keeps me going. I'm doing something illegal and I fucking hate it but I also LOVE IT. No, I am NOT hurting anyone. I am just breaking a law. 

It changed me. Just 4 days ago I was depressed and just thinking about others and how can I help them. Now I'm cold...I hate it but its true. I became a perfectionist, stronger and I actually smiled today...I'm not afraid of the dark anymore, I enjoy it. 

I feel this adrenaline kick every once in a while and I feel like I finally won this PTSD, depression and anxiety I've been fighting with since I was 15. 

I know and I am very aware of the fact that this is wrong but it's fucking amazing too. I never taught I would become this person because I was always that girl at the side, giving fake smiles, always happy but dying inside, always making sure others are okay and forgeting about myself. 

I don't feel the need to eat or drink, time seems to go by faster, I feel strong, I exercise more then 2 hours a day and before I'd exercise for 1 hour and feel dizzy.

What is this?! Am I going crazy or did I just beat my depression, PTSD etc.??"
336,Advice requested,

339,"I [F20] don't want to die, but I dont want to live anymore","I've struggled a lot with my mental health since I was about 11-12. Took a lot of different pills now, don't know if it's enough to do any harm. I posted a similar kinda post when I was 16 hoping for advice, I was desperate to hear that it would get better. I feel like it never does. I just really wish I was mentally healthy, it's all I want in this world. I feel like everyone thinks I'm pathetic and overreacting because different things trigger me and my emotions are so intense. Doctors think I might have a personality disorder, I think so too as I feel like I feel so much more than everyone else. I feel so much sadness, anger and frustration, my emotions are always so overwhelming and I HAVE to let them out. I was able to keep my head up this past week, but suddenly I became so angry over everything and wanted to punch someone. I want to scream and break things and hit people so they can see the pain I constantly feel inside, I'm not overreacting; I'm in pain!!!!! I don't know what to do anymore. I wish something happened to me, that I was pushed in front of a train or got a terminal illness. People only see struggles if they're physical, I'm tired of being in pain constantly. I want to be happy and able to experience romantic relationships, too, instead of always being scared and think that I just have to accept that I don't deserve love and that nobody really cares.

340,i know something’s wrong with me," i know something’s wrong with me, i know what it is, but i don’t even know how to walk into a therapist office &amp; tell them without thinking i’m lying or just trying to get meds or anything. i just want help, and idk what to do."
341,My friend completely changed her behaviour and mental state in a matter of weeks,"I know her for over 8 years. She's always been this caring, nice, popular funny person. Not too down to earth, but enough to count on her.

End of summer last year, after over an year of long distance relationship she moved aboard with her boyfriend. New place, jobless, new life. With him. He loved her lots, awesome guy, the only down side was that he used to get a bit too jelouse, even on her friends. He was trying to keep it under control so I didn't worry much she wouldn't be happy. Yet, she was crying every time we talked saying she feels lost, she misses her friends, colleagues, everything. But she promised me she will try to fight. She got better and better in time, especially after she finally found a job. 

Fast forward beginning of this year, she came to visit us. She seemed extremely happy, hyped. She was acting like she owns the world and nothing can break her. I thought that was hot and felt happy for her. When I drove her back to the airport she started telling me she decided to break up with her boyfriend and come back home, because she found her soul mate. And stated that she saw the ""signs"" that lead to her destiny. I tried support her, all I asked from her was to be smart about it. She needs a place to live, a job, she can't just go, split and come back with no back up. We live in a poor country, it's hard living. From this point, things go crazy. She started yelling at me she owns the truth and we're not on the same level of knowledge, but in time I will grow to understand, so she will be patient with me. Signs are there and she can see them, I'm too blind to see them. That night she left her boyfriend. Our group of friends supported her with money for plane, food and a place to live until she figures things out and find a job. 

Except, the minute she got back, she started preaching about the signs and how we share the Eve's sins. How she found the secret and how secret services are tracking her. She spams everyone with messages about the ""truth"", stating that something big it's gonna come. She got obsessed with her ""soul mate"", chasing him at work and the places he goes to, texting him about these damn secrets, signs and truths. He got scared, reached to one of our common friends and eventually blocked her. 

She is verbally agressive and call us blind, mundane, not open to debate ideas, even though nothing of what we have to say matters to her, as much as we try to listen to her and further understand. She doesn't sleep, she is on the phone 24/7 texting people, writing ""articles"" and Facebook posts. Donates money to charity and spam us to donate as well, even tho she has no money, she lives on our money and the little her family sends her in order to survive. Donating it's a beautiful thing, but she is getting things to the extreme. Even nice ones. And the way she is approaching everything looks like an obsession. Not to mention extremely distructive. Everyone is avoiding her now and are scared of her. We all told her she needs help, but she claims that we are the ones that need help. She is helping us and the world to see the truth, even tho we fight it. We can hate her now, but we will thank her later once we are awaken. She is mean to everyone and has this weird superiority. She shows no respect or gratitude. She won't accept help or any word from us, except money.

Her family it's basically non-existent, her mother is old and weak. Us, the few friends that are still around, are all she's got. And we don't know how to help her if she doesn't accept any sort of help. She is getting extremely hard to live with, not even gonna get into that. 

There must be some back window in her brain to access. We talked to therapists but they can't help without her actually stepping their door. Which will never happen, since in her mind, she is above everything. All I have said it s only 1% of how bad things are. And are evolving to the worse extremely quickly.

If anyone experienced this or has any input, I'd be forever grateful. I am literally out of options and ideas.

Thank you so much for the patience of reading all this, I'm sorry I couldn't be shorter.

Tl;dr: My friend went from this nice balanced person to this superior being that owns the secrets of the universe and it's here to rescue our souls, preaching about it, getting obsessed over things, paranoid, delusional, mean and she won't accept any mental help. She is scared to go public with everything she knows because ""the Secret Services"" are after her. She shows no gratitude, respect, or notion of the material world. She bareley sleeps. She is hyped with her ideas, constantly telling she never been this happy. She states that she is changing the world, saving it. She calls everyone blind, mundane. She chased a guy at his work and to places he was going to, from the shadows, because he is her ""soul mate"" and she wants to be close to him, even tho he rejected her. All she sees are these ""signs"" she won't stop talking about. Almost lost all her friends already. Helpppppp? :((((

342,Seeking help and not finding anything,"As a 30 something Irish-American man, simply working up the nerve to look for and pursue some form of therapy has taken such a leap from me. Mental health is simply not something that is acceptably discussed in my family, among my friends, with my coworkers. I cannot find the words to describe the anxiety I have felt over just searching. It feels like being in water and thrashing and slipping below the surface further and further (I am an excellent swimmer and this is a visceral feeling I have constantly). Now that I have tried contacting 4 different therapists and either received no responses to messages or been told that they simply don’t have room in their schedule I feel completely defeated. I have no idea how to do this. One of my biggest problems I have that I am seeking help for is really crippling anxiety over exposing myself like this and I can’t even get in a room with someone. I want to give up. I know I shouldn’t but I want to because now my inability to find help seems to be snowballing everything. I am not sleeping well and I am crying a lot. I don’t know what to do anymore."
343,HELP I WANT TO LEAVE,"I recently made a post on this subreddit about how I wanted to terminate my services with my therapist. She is a psychiatric nurse practitioner and after our first session I realized it would probably be better if I saw a licensed professional counselor.

However...when I told her I wanted to leave in the email she responded to me saying:


""That I needed to come in for my Friday session because there is paperwork I have to fill out in order to terminate services.""

Is this true?

Can't she just email it to me?

She also told me...that she wanted me to come in for my Fruday so that we can DISCUSS discontinuing treatment.

SHE'LL PROBABLY STILL CHARGE ME FOR THAT SESSION.

ANY ADVICE?

IM NOT SURE IF THIS IS BECAUSE SHE'S A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER"
344,Fresh self harm and upcoming psychiatrist appointment,So... I have pretty recent cuts (today in fact) and have a doctor appointment on Wednesday. What reaction do you think I will get? I’m not suicidal at all.
345,The parabole of productivity,"I fell into a cliche of mine again. At the start of the school year, I've decided to be more productive, take care of the house, school and personal projects. There were small bumps along the way, but overall I showed stellar progress. Even though I did a lot some days, I didn't feel drained. Eventually, the routine became the basis of my motivation. It still worked, but only for some time. Until I started struggling in school. It's nothing unusual - the end of the term is approaching and I have tons of tests to study for and some larger homework. But it was more than enough to completely throw my habits off. Because I slowly started dropping them even before that. And now I'm just tired (and a little sleep-deprived) high-school student that keeps postponing her work. I know I should do it. But lately, I don't have the energy to motivate myself to get up from that console/book/website or whatever.  Even now, instead of studying, I'm ranting on Reddit, and just a moment ago, I was writing a journal about the exact same thing. I can't help but feel I've been here before. That I've been here before so many times. That so many times I've tried to achieve something - write a book, a game, draw a story and tons of tons of other ideas. And even if I planned it out, even if I followed it for a while, ultimately it always failed. I know that I have the entire life ahead of me but I'm just tired of this. If I continue working like that, I will never do anything. For now, I dream of merely publishing a project. It doesn't even have to become popular. I just want to show myself that I can finish something on my own. And times like these make me lose faith in myself. I know I'll get up eventually. But will I ever actually bring any of my ideas to life? Does anybody relate? Do you have any methods for regularity?"
346,I’m not coping well and don’t know what to do,"For context I’m a 19 year old Male and in the past year I’ve lost 2 family members who were really close to me but I don’t think Ive coped with their passings well.

I moved house at the beginning of last year and haven’t really settled in making little friends, I’m still close with my old friends but don’t get to see them often and the only way I can contact them is through social media but it can get kind of lonely if I’m not speaking to them. 

My life seems to be very repetitive, boring and linear with nothing to do as the days pass by and I feel like I’m getting fed up with it.

This is the first time I’ve opened up about this and to be quite honest, I don’t know what to do, I usually put a happy face on when I’m around my family so I don’t worry them.

Any help would be appreciated."

348,I built a simple mood tracking application to make mood tracking easier and more intuitive,"Hi! I am currently working on a simple application for mood tracking.

Many existing apps ask you for a lot of writing and selecting stuff when you want to just quickly write down your mood and get back to business. These apps present your mood as a big still table where you have ""entries"".

For me, mood is more about a continuous flow. My design goals were to show all my mood as a continuous line where it would be easier to find patterns and to let me put down my mood in just one tap.

Please let me know what you think, the app is free: [https://apps.apple.com/app/moodline-track-your-mood/id1500129608](https://apps.apple.com/app/moodline-track-your-mood/id1500129608)"
349,Too many thoughts in such little time. I can never focus.,"I can't focus on anything ever. My mind is always racing with thoughts. I could be in class and think of the material, then random topics of music, politics, entertainment, life, dieting, peace, meditation, suicide, depression, statistics, death, dating suddenly pop up. This happens less than 30 seconds. All these random topics attack me all at once.

I can never focus on 1 particular thing. If I'm doing a task, I stop and go to another activity. This has been going on since childhood and it's very annoying. It can be a very serious situation and my mind still does this.

I don't know what it is. All I know is I need help, I was thinking of maybe weed? But at the same time that can be treating the problem and not getting rid of it."
350,"Not PTSD, then what?","Hey, I wanted to ask for advice, as I’m not sure how should I bring this up, or what to call this when talking to a doctor/therapist. This needs a bit of a back story/context, I’ll try and make it to the point and short.

Basically I get really uncomfortable/anxious/uneasy when hearing sudden noises, like someone slamming doors, screaming, dropping something, anything really. It mainly happens when the noise is unexpected. I don’t feel particularly comfortable in loud places, but I can handle it, on a busy street for example where I expect it to be loud. Tho I am still very jumpy and somewhat on the edge at all times.

Where it comes from is that I went through a stupid experience few years ago. For about 1.5 year I was constantly exposed to deafening noise at my place. The store on the ground floor of the flat that I lived in was going through renovation, so there was some demolition taking place, I think it was a handheld pneumatic hammer. Which is understandable. What isn’t is how the hell did it last for so long and more importantly why for this whole period the noise was focused on the wall that my head was next to when sleeping. (I swear they had to tear down and rebuild the same wall, over and over again, there is no other logical explanation for how could that last so long)

So I had a horrible wake up at about 7:30 AM, which lasted till about 9:30. Then I would over sleep more and more after it finally calmed down, which led to problems with falling asleep at night, which only got worse and worse with time. So all that time I slept like 4-5AM – 7AM and then 9AM till 12-1 PM, and under a constant fear of the noise coming back. It was loud in the whole flat, it was just the worst on the wall behind my head.

Now I know you might think, why did you not just move. Well I already moved once while there, plus it was a difficult time overall, 3 years of non stop stress (outside of the noise), even if there was no renovation. I just wanted for it all to be over and go back home(the town I was in was around 400km away).

So I talked about this with the therapist and I was told that „This isn’t PTSD, because there is no one specific event that caused it and that keeps coming back to you.” (as if how it would be with assault/rape victims)

But then what is it? I get regular panic attacks and the situation that I’m in now isn’t all that better when it comes to noise. Even when its not a full on attack I get into this state of distress where I can’t focus on anything and my thoughts are completely scattered.

The mental health care here is pretty lacking overall, I have one appointment every few months and am on antidepressants, tho I can’t say I see much of a difference. Either way I don’t know exactly what I am diagnosed with. Depression, insomnia, heavy anxiety are the ones I can guess at. They also suspected psychosis, but I think that one’s off the hook? I don’t know, they don’t really tell me much.

Anyway I would be grateful if someone could maybe share similar experience or if you know what this might be called, so that I can get some help regarding it. Thank you."
351,I can’t be bothered with anything anymore,"I just can’t be bothered with life. I don’t want to exist. I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to exist. I want to sleep and not wake up. When I am awake, I feel like I just  manage to control myself through the day and just stop when I get home. I binge eat then feel crap then feel worse. I get an intense emotional pain and need to cry but I can’t. I used to resort to self harming but haven’t done for years. I think that’s why I binge eat. I get angry with my husband over stupid things and we have a huge argument then I cry and feel even worse because I’ve caused an argument between us. I don’t know why I feel like this and I don’t know how to explain it to him.

Saying all this as a practice for how to word it to a councillor when I eventually get up the courage to speak to one.

I noticed for me when I take it at night(when prescribed, always) I’m much more able to concentrate and think clearly- even to the point of being able to accomplish stressy things I couldn’t do during the day. 

I’m thinking the ptsd/adhd part of my brain gets hushed from the gabapentin and was wondering if I’m the only one."
356,Some help with hypochondria? [20F],"I think I have always had some anxiety and hypochondria problems, but recently I've noticed it getting a lot worse and I don't really know how to deal with it. This may be caused by some recent occurances such as my first UTI and getting my appendix removed, both of which were pretty traumatic. It's not uncommon for me to be worrying about several different parts of my body at a time. I know therapy is the main answer, but does anyone have any other tips on how I can work through this?"
357,Here's to being never good enough,"I'm tired of trying, really. 

This isn't a ""People love me but I can't feel it"" bullshit. I was it was true. Some people are NOT good enough. No matter how hard they try, they'll always be unloved. They will never really exist in the world. They're boring, vanish too easily, unimportant. Some might cry if they kill themselves, but so what? Why does it matter? It only matters how people treat you while you're alive."
358,I think my coworker has an eating disorder—should I do anything?,"So for a few weeks when I went to the bathroom I’d occasionally hear a weird squelching but ignored it respectfully thinking it’d just be someone having stomach problems, but as time has gone on it’s been a regular thing and I noticed whoever’s feet facing towards the toilet and I’m 99.999% sure this girl is purging or something. 

I don’t know her personally or work with her even. She’s on the same floor but with a different team entirely and we don’t cross paths. All I know is that we were hired around the same time this past year. 

I don’t plan on doing anything at the moment or asking—I assume it’s not something she really wants to talk about especially from some stranger. I just am kind of worried as it’s a little disturbing to hear someone vomit regularly for whatever reason. 

(I also don’t know if it’s a pregnancy thing either but I’m not really thinking it’s that?) 

Does anyone have any advice or reassurance of what to do or not do? I’m worried and I don’t know if she’s alright or not or already being supported.

360,Trauma related memory loss,"So the word trauma may be a bit too dramatic for my case, but I'm not sure how else to describe it. I have always been easily embarrassed, and prone to feel intense shame. This is mainly associated with social anxiety. My brain impulsively gravitates towards these negative ideas, and I'll get lost in a painful cycle of self depreciating thoughts. As a result, I struggle with self confidence.  I've recently started to realize this is both abnormal and unhealthy, and have made an effort to change it. When I start to think about something I said or did that embarrassed me, I begin to humm or make some sort of sound, which pulls me out of my thoughts and back to reality. This allows me to gain control and redirect my thoughts. It was hard at first but I've gotten better. An unintended consequence of this is that I have memory loss associated with the incident that caused embarrassment. I will forget details within a large ""radius"" surrounding the event. Anyone have any ideas or tips, or is this something I should go to therapy for?"
361,IOPs?,I can’t maintain this anymore. I feel on edge and close to another suicide attempt at all times. It’s beyond weekly therapy for me and I’m spiraling into the crazy ass downward trajectory that landed me in the psych-Ward. I have no money but am willing to foot a huge insurance bill if it means nipping this in the bud. What are my options for IOP’s? How do I do it?
362,Can anyone give me advice?,I am freaking the fuck out the thing is I don’t feel as anxious as normal but somehow this is worse I guess I am used to anxiety but Right now I feel like there’s a rush of adrenaline through my veins I feel scared for no good reason what can I do to help?
363,Can not just be happy,"Immediately i get a good news, i get another bad news after. I dont know how to truely be happy and just relax, cos in my mind if there is a good news now soon next a bad one will follow which is worst than a good news. Its like my heart is on pause. I dont know how to carry on.. its too much ups and downs"
364,What the fuck is going on?,"I've struggling with mental health for about 2 years now, since I was 13, it was when I realised that there are not many people who think similarly to me, even most grownups. Im turning 16 now and I seriously think that I have developed emotional numbness and have some sort of bipolarity. Like ok I get it those two things are pretty opposite, but like there are periods where I just live on autopilot, I cant cry, only feel fake emotions which feel like instincts rather than sth deeper, I dont even remember how true happiness feels like. And then there are periods when at the same day, one moment im the happiness person in the world, and then a slightest inconvenience turns it upside down and im so fucking sad, the worst part is that those emotions dont feel real either, they just feel like instincts to protect myself. I just want to cry for hours and hours like I used to, but even now when im writing this I cant push any tears. The worst part is that I cant talk to anyone who understands cuz yeah, im a boy, and apparently most people back off cuz of sexism, everyone thinks that only girls have mental health issues but why the fuck would anyone think that. I've been so fucked up for the past years, and still no one understands what I go through. I went to psychiatrist just to get to know things that I already knew, I have problems with anxiety, depression and shit I dont even know exist. Like dont think that im self diagnosing out of nowhere or sth, I really do have those problems. Like everyone keep telling me how intelligent I am and stuff, I dont care, this so called ""Intelligence"" and complicated world views I have are the core of my problems, why I cant connect to people. Even if I find people who understand me and are same age as me I cant connect to them cuz my social anxiety kicks in and I cant be myself and start to force myself too much. I tried to suppress my problems by going to gym 5 times a week, playing guitar, and many kinds of things but that makes me feel more lost cuz it just locks my emotions in and I cant do anything about it. I lost my soulmate cuz of my own stupidity and anxiety and ruined things for both of us, she got over it but shes stronger than me mentally, I'm not. Like I dont have any reason or motivation to push on anymore, wheres the point? School is making it so much worse cuz of school society which in my school is full of awful and selfish people. I am so afraid of my future and mental health, I feel like I need medication to feel happy again, but I dont want to risk getting addicted to meds. Please, I need help, I dont know what to do anymore."
365,"META: Please remember, if asking for help in seeking services, in any capacity thereof, you need to include your country","I want to help anyone who wants to seek help. Or navigate this complex system in any capacity. Because seeking effective and appropriate treatment is not easy, and I have a ton of resources, a ton of friends with resources, to help with what to say, how to say it, how to talk to insurance companies, where to start, what to do if you don't feel you're getting the right treatment, how to get help with paying for treatment, medication. I even have connections on how to navigate getting disability for mental health diagnosis, subsidies, social workers, etc etc etc.

But none of that may really apply to someone in the UK. And it's not that I don't want to help, but writing out for an hour on my little cell phone on how to talk to an insurance company, to get a response of, ""Oh, I'm in Britain,"" is... Frankly demoralizing. I typed an hour on a cell phone for that information. 

If you're in the USA, even including a state can help. I'm better at NJ because that's where I live and that's where my cousin got all the stuff she needed. And my wife. Yes, some sources are nation wide, some are state specific. 

So please, keep in mind, anytime you are asking about anything related to *seeking help* you need to include a country. The system can be very hard to navigate in any country, with the stigma, payment, confusion, doctors, therapists, treatment options. But you will get much better information from someone in your own country than placing a general call-out, and sifting thru irrelevant information. It wastes your time, and, wastes mine as well, unfortunately."
366,Should I speak to someone?,"Hi everyone. 25M here. I'm 1st year college in a pretty big city, and while i enjoy living here, I have become aware of just how incapable I am in social activities and making new friends. This partially stems from me being a mature student in an environment where the majority of people are around 6 years younger than me. Although this doesn't sound like a big deal, i initially, and to some degree still do, had an incredibly hard time fitting in.

Recently I have become increasingly self concious and find myself distancing what few friends I have, for no apparent reason. I get on well with my flatmates, however I am increasingly avoiding them as I simply feel embarassed with my presence as I can never think of anything to say, im reasonably convinced that they too feel awkward around me as i've made things weird. As I type this, Im sitting in my room hungry and wanting to eat, but 2 af my flatmates are in the kitchen/communal area and going in there fills me with dread.

Regardess of the crowd, any social event I try and throw myself into I find myself locking up and overthinking everything, and instantly become the quiet guy in the corner. My brain just goes blank. Although I know i have interesting anecdotes and input to conversations that i'm 'part of' I simply don't have the confidence to speak. And of course any girls that I'm attracted to or I know are attracted to me the problem is massively amplified.

I enjoy peoples company and when i can, love speaking to people and meeting new friends. I have taken numerous solo backpacking trips abroad and met countless friends in countless ways and never envisaged a problem like this affecting me but here we are.I've 'kind of' had periods of being depressed before but never seen anyone about it. Is now the time? 

Help."
367,Doing Better Doesn't Seem To Make Me Feel Better,"I live with some anxiety and depression, and I've been doing my best to manage it without therapy or medication *(sighs in self-employed American.)* I have a bunch of friends who go through the same, and I see them posting on Facebook about their little victories and how they're so fulfilled by the journey they're on, and...I don't get it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy for them and I love to see them healing; but when I'm in similar situations where I need to conquer some mental hang-up, or 'rise above' that darkness, I don't get those warm fuzzies or any kind of sense of accomplishment. I don't feel 'stronger' after, I feel like a cat that's just returned from the vet; like I want to run and hide under the bed, and like I'm now resentful and suspicious of these caretakers (even when that caretaker is myself) for putting me in that terrifying situation.

I think what makes it worse is people's reactions after the fact. They'll be standing around like, ""Look at you, don't you feel better now, aren't you so proud??"" and inside I'm like, ""No, I felt like I wanted to shrivel up and die the whole time, the only thing that got me through was thinking about how afterward I'd be able to retreat to my couch in a haze of weed smoke for the rest of the day.""

But if I were to ever voice those thoughts, people would tell me what an immature brat I'm being (I know that, because I've tried it before.) So when is it supposed to start feeling good? Is there some kind of tipping point if I just keep at it long enough, or is 'immature brat' another thing I need to put in the Self Improvement column?"
368,How can I help my friend who won’t seek help?,"Okay so to preface, I am a nursing student (22M) and I have a friend that I’ve cared for like a sister for the last 4 years (24F) she has always been in a rough spot mentally and even more so in the last year due to losing her mom. We’ve always been able to talk and she had been going to therapy for a while. Things were getting better until I walked into class today and she is completely silent, refusing to talk unless texting or writing down words. Basically telling me that she has DID and Anna is no longer here and I’m talking to (insert name here). Now I support her in most all her decisions (coming out, financially etc.) but this can’t be healthy? She also has refused to take any meds or see any counseling service. I just need advice because I don’t know what to do and I just want my friend back. She has a history of suicidal ideation and went so far as to say one of “us” killed themselves last night."
369,A Longtime Friend Cutting Everyone Out?," \- This is in the U.S. -

What the title says is the TL;DR - I'm wondering if this sounds like mental illness? 

Warning: long backstory here.

I know this person - let's call her Lila - myself, her, and a group of about 10 people are all in our thirties and have been a friend group for 10-15+ years. We're very close, we've gone on trips together, still all live pretty close and get together about every other month or so pretty consistently. 

Lila was the first out of our friend group to get married, buy a house, and have kids (none of us have kids, she has 2). She's always been the type to pressure everyone else in the group and try to push a traditional path of spouse, house, kids. Most of us are not really into those traditions. Plus we're older millennials who are just now getting financially stable enough to ""settle down"", if you will. She's been for 5+ years. She worked really hard in college and early twenties while most of us were just figuring stuff out. She knew what she wanted and how to get there. 

Her second child was born about 2 years ago now and we believe she either had undiagnosed postpartum and/or maybe the pregnancy triggered a chemical imbalance of some kind. If that's even possible. About a year ago she had some kind of mental break and attacked me (verbally) and said some things she couldn't take back. So because of that fight, we had a falling out. So stupid but I don't have time for that kind of negativity in my life. I have no problem cutting out emotional vampires.

Fast forward a year later to this week and she has ""broken up"" with each of our friends individually and left the group message. She called each person riled up and looking for a fight. Their stories sounded just like what she had done with me a year prior. She said that nobody else makes an effort (it's about even from my point-of-view as to who plans outings). We are a very supportive bunch but she claims to have no support. She complains that raising kids is hard and nobody ever volunteers to babysit or that we don’t consider whether things are kid-friendly when we plan things (90% of the time those kids can and do come along).

\- In a venting moment she has said she ""hates"" her husband in regards to her being overwhelmed by all of the house work she had to do. (her and her husband both work full time)

\- In another venting moment she has said she ""hates"" weekends because she has to spend all day entertaining her children whereas on weekdays she drops them off at daycare and goes to work.

\- Some stories she has recounted to myself and friends about her kids' behaviors and the way she handled them were concerning.

\- She confided in one friend that, after she had her second child, she had drafted a suicide note but scrapped it. She says she would ""never do that to her kids"". 

\- We are not sure what her husband's point of view is on all of this. He is basically part of the friend group as well but not really in touch with anyone, basically everything goes through Lila. She has said they are both on the same page about cutting out the friends.

\- Her side of things seems generally inconsistent with reality.

She claims to be ""better"" now (out of the funk she was in post-baby) and yet she is acting worse than a year ago when we had our falling out. Plus, she has not used or even looked into any of the resources friends have gently suggested to her (names of therapists, articles, ideas, etc). 

It's tough because on one hand, there is this person who is hurting people we love, and on the other hand it's like it's not even ""her"" doing it if she does in fact have a mental illness. Do we give her space? Do we contact her husband? Do we check-in every once in a while but don't hang out?

Does this sound like mental illness? 

Any insight or advice would be so appreciated."
370,Despite this,"Where did she go? The girl I once knew. So carefree and kind she was. She helped me through. Times are tough and the world is sad. Just seeing her face helped me feel less mad. Now I know she needs someone but where did she go? The last time I saw her true concern would show. I should have reached out but what would I say? What on Earth could have you feeling this way? For that is a silly question, take a look around. There is greed, hate, violence and war abound. If I see her again I’ll make sure she knows how appreciated she is. Her love always shows."
371,Time to Change Antidepressant vs. A Bad Day,"How do you know when it's time to consider changing a dosage/type of antidepressant, and when it's just a bad/weepy day?

I'm on the fence at the moment. I'm going to ask my therapist the next time I see her, but that's nine days away and I thought I'd ask here in the meantime.

Thanks in advance for any input."
372,I am always tired,I am always tired even though I sleep enough for a average person. I can’t seem to get enough sleep and I somehow feel better when I’m sleep deprived . Well at least for a little while. I also am completely exhausted after school and I don’t have energy to make my homework making it worse. (I have ADHD and PTSD) has anyone a idea of what could cause this?
373,Im 20 and i feel like im gonna have to kill myself soon,"Idk where to start this off...

I’ve been mentally I’ll since I was 13 with anxiety and depression

I won against it, and felt quite “ok” for a while.

When I turned 20 I tried to kill myself 2 times in half a year and was put into a psych ward for a couple months.

Ever since I came out from there I feel so fucking weird all the time.

I can’t do anything but be in my bed and play video games.

I try so hard to battle all this, with yoga, good diet etc

I suffer from extreme derealization 24/7 for the past 7 months or so..
Recently I started getting so sick, I always feel like someone punched me in the stomach and it’s hard to breath.
I have loss of feeling in the left side of my face, forehead and inner eye.
I freeze all the time, my hands and feet’s are always cold.
I feel like I have a fever everyday.
My body hurts.
I can’t think straight anymore, I can’t focus on anything either.
I feel like I have to pass out and have a nerve break down anytime.
I’m shaking so hard.

I feel so weird and so not myself, everything seems off I can’t describe it bc nothing is off, I feel like I’m going fucking crazy.
I feel like my body is dying and I can’t move soon.

Has anybody ever experienced this and found out how to deal with all this?

I’m 20 and diagnosed borderline, depression, anxiety and pcos.

I am well aware that my mental illnesses can cause a lot of symptoms, but this is outta my hand I can’t function anymore.

I’m crying so much, plz help me."
374,My life is dull,"These last years I've always needed something to keep me distracted. When I don't have that I get depressed - sometimes severly. I've been much better lately with finding things (working out, eating healthy, workstuff.) to keep my days as busy as possible, but right now I'm in a place where I have a lot of free time and there's nothing I can really do about it (as far as work/studying goes. I'll get busy in the fall, but right now not so much.) 

This leaves me with a feeling that my life is incredibly dull. I can keep myself busy with my writing-work and fitness, but in the end I'm never fulfilled and often desperatly bored  - even when I'm doing stuff!

I feel that I'm working hard to stay happy, but don't really see the benefits - other than keeping me from going into a depression (again). While that's obviously a good thing, it reminds me of a quote from a TV-show, talking about addiction in this case, which goes *""It's just this leaky faucet that requires constant maintenance, and in return offers only not to drip.""* 

Not really a question or anything in there but thought I'd share in case anyone can relate :)"
375,Rant about parents,"Yes mom, i know i was absent 2 days last week, but i 
still need a day off tomorrow. 

I feel horrible and i know you dont understand how exactly depression works, but i am thankful that you are willing to listen.

Please understand that i do not find joy in this life, i am not staying away from school because i hate it, im lazy or anything like that, i love my friends and they do their best to help me cope, but my mind needs a break from stress.

I can no longer stay awake during classes, even if it's only my mind that wanders off, i gain no benefits from being there.

I feel like giving up, but i know i wont, at least for now.

I promise to do my best, but it is hard, when even your teachers think that you need more help, than you are getting.

I never wished to feel this way.

I am sorry that i lied to you, just now, when i said i would go to school tomorrow. I cant. I wont let you worry all night about me. 

I am sorry that i am a burden to you.

I dont know how to move forward."
376,Idk if I love my parents or not,"I’m not sure if this is because I’m only 18, but I don’t know If I love my family. I don’t hate them, and I still care about them, but I don’t feel love towards them the way I do with my cat for example. I’m sure I’d be torn up if anything happened to them still, so I don’t think i’m a psychopath. 

Is this a normal part of growing up? Sort of like an indicator that I need to go into the world on my own soon? Should I see a therapist?"
377,Which antidepressant should I take? Moving on to pill #5 and feeling hopeless,"So, I’m 20 and on Wednesday I’ll be visiting the psychiatrist to try yet another antidepressant. I’m just so sick of them all making things worse. Here’s a summary of what I’ve taken (all at the lower starter dose):

Zoloft - age 14 - triggered daily panic attacks

Lexapro - age 14-17 - had to sleep 9-10 hours per day in order to function (even after taking it for years) and libido was at zero. I will go back to this if I have to because I was somewhat stable at least on it. 

Prozac - age 19 - triggered cyclothymia. Crazy sex drive, made a fuck ton of reckless decisions, racing thoughts interspaces with horrible depression. Awful. 

Celexa - age 19 to now - thought this one was working but when I upped the dose it did me dirty. Started getting panic episodes (not sure what to call them) where I was terrified and convinced that my brain wasn’t working because everything was moving too fast. Progressed into blackout panics where I remember nothing but I apparently threaten to kill myself in order to make it stop. Also have delusional thoughts where I’m convinced there’s a black spot on my soul. 

Is there any medication that won’t make my head spin? My therapist said that the next drug will probably be Wellbutrin, but I’m scared that that drug will trigger some sort of head spinning as well. Have any of you guys managed to find something that helps depression yet doesn’t make you manic?"

383,Adjusting the meds,So I have tried 6 different kind of antidepressants... and finally found 2 that work (zoloft and wellbutrin). Going outside isn't hard anymore and I have energy which is nice because I have two kids that I don't want to ruin with my shitty moods. I also don't think about dying 24/7. Anyway. The meds worked great for a few months but now I'm noticing I'm getting mood swings... like hyper go-go-go and then hyper desire to self harm and just basically extreme moods that I am not used to. For the most part I am able to keep them under control and I really don't want to adjust the meds AGAIN... especially since I finally have -some- good days after years of bad days. Also going to the doctor is not cheap. Has anyone else had this happen? It's been 4-5 months maybe I should just give it more time or maybe this is just how normal people feel?
384,I feel like having a job would help me,"I've never been a joyful person, always isolated myself and felt like shit most of the time. In past times, during school, I got through those feelings because I had an objective ahead of me. Now I'm unemployed, aplied for a job pretty much in every place in the city and not even mcdonalds or other similar places give me a call, I'm just stranded. Can't help but feel worthless, I don't know what I have to do anymore."
385,Agoraphobia/Anxiety/mental health page on insta! Pls follow! :) @morethanphobia,"Hello everybody! I have a family history of bad mental health from bipolar, schizophrenia, ADHD etc. Because of my childhood trauma I developed crippling anxiety, a panic disorder and agoraphobia. I made a page on INSTA for my day by day tips, motivation, the good the bad and etc. Something RAW. I am not afraid to show the truth and it’s true we don’t always have good days and we should have something to do to keep us away from those negative obsessive/depressive thoughts when we do. I will discuss about a lot of things and it’ll be something that will help me connect w you guys and you guys connecting w eachother. I find this helpful specially for those who have family who ignore mental health or undermine you because of it. It’s real but this page is also for motivating to always do better for ourselves. To find our worth even with whatever is going on. To PUSH. We shouldn’t be always comfortable where we are and there’s always going to be a time where we have to change and change is scary but that’s what this page is here for. To ground you. To tell you it’s okay. To make your feelings valid and to accept. But we will ALL rise and do the best we can. Also no comparing w eachother, we all live different lives the point is to move foward from where we are. Thank you everybody! I hope you support the idea. I will list healthy habits, discuss medications, obsessive thoughts, CBD oil, what is good for your gut. And I’m 100% not doctor so we can all educate eachother. Again thank you guys. You are worthy, amazing and strong! Keep fighting. 💛 be you, be real and be in the NOW. You matter! #morethan"
386,I don’t even know if I’m okay or not,"I thought I was okay again. I mean, I’m able to joke around with people again. I’m able to be myself for the most part.

Then, I have time to think. Once I have a moment to think, I’m not as alright. Then I start worrying. Worrying about anything. My mind can always find one thing to think about that makes me unhappy, and I can’t stop it. It’s almost as if I’m using humor as a way to cope, and once I can’t, once I have that time in my thoughts, my real self starts to come out. The me that hates myself and wishes I could just disappear and forget about everything. 

But of course if I show that side of me again, people will assume I just have an attitude and that it’s just a bad mood. 

If my parents find out the truth, they’ll worry again. Though what did they do when they were told I need a therapist? Nothing. They gave me false hope. I asked multiple times if I was going to see one, and they said yes. They said they were still looking. Nothing ever happened. Not a damn thing. So I guess it doesn’t matter anyway."

I’m at uni now and I’ve managed to make quite a lot of friends now who I can be myself around but yet I’m too socially anxious to date as I think the person is better than me and I’ve had bad experiences of boys being awful to me in the past. If I’ve been on dates and I like them I get extremely anxious and my heart starts to beat rapidly like it’s a performance situation. I’ve tried CBT and anti depressants but it feels more like a phobia of performing badly when I date. I just feel really exposed. How can I get over this? When I like someone I’m INCREDIBLY nervous around them and can’t accept people like me"
389,I need your help pls,"Im a 17 years old guy from Germany and first of all im not really mentally ill or anything. Im just not really happy, even though my life over all is going great. I live in a house with a more or less healthy family, i have my own room where I can get privacy and time on my own if I want to, I have good grades and I just nailed the theoratical test for my drivers license. I also have many friends, some of them good ones. I have a couple of Hobbys and I spend as much time on them as school allows. But heres the point: I dont see any meaning in life. Though Im really motivated to always get better and Im really into this self development thing, I cant find a reason to work hard and grind. Also Im pretty socially insecure and Ive never had a girlfriend. Dont understand me wrong , Im not ugly and Ive had several dates, but Ive never gotten past that state, which is kind of weird considering im 17 now. Also Im addicted to Youtube and videogames and even though I can control, how much time I spend on my phone/PC quite well, I never achieve full control over it. And believe me, Ive tried many things. Also I go to the gym fairly regularly (I try 4 times/week) but I cant pull it of to go consistently over a long period of time. Same goes for piano, which I started playing recently. Also I tried to really get better nutrition and eat 3000 cals a day to really build muscle and stuff, but I dont do that either. I really want to do all of the stuff and Im sure I can, but Im lacking motivation. And thats the problem, I just dont know what to work for. I dont see any meaning in life. Also I have no Idea what I want to do for a living. I really want to do big stuff for humanity and be remembered and do good things for the environment, humanity, etc. but I have no idea what. And thats why I dont have motivation and I sometimes feel depressed. Does anybody feel the same and can maybe give me some advice, Or is it just because of my age?

Btw im sorry for my English, Im from Germany..."
390,"Does anyone else do this,?","Does anyone else create a fantasy world or scenario in their head to escape their mind? I've fantasized that I'm happy and in love with someone and we get married, I've dreamt of living in a fantasy world and i met all kinds of people and go on adventures I mean when it's over I'm miserable again but for that short time it makes me happy and I'm not a depressed mess while I'm imagining it all in my head .."
391,Focusing on bettering myself,"I'm going thorugh a nasty breakup (my fault and I'm owning up to that) and aside from that feel like I've lost a bit of direction in life and have been feeling quite miserable because of it.

My first step into focusing on bettering my mental health is to quit drinking. I noticed I was feeling like a drink would help me feel at ease when I was upset, and if I was out drinking heavily I'd be getting extremely upset, so I've decided to stop drinking until I feel healthy again.

In the free time I have now that I'm single I'm reflecting on my behaviours, attitudes, and goals and trying to learn from mistakes so I don't repeat the same faults I've done before. I want to recognise which traits of mine are flawed and work on them so I can be a better person.

I still feel bad for how my relationship ended, but I've owned up to what I done (we were trying to see each other again and weren't actually together, and I lightly flirted with a customer in front of her, not to be malicious or cruel, I honestly wasn't thinking) and apologised to her. I told her I can understand if she doesn't want anything to do with me and I'm giving her space to heal (this also gives me time to reflect on what happened and learn from it).

I know I've done bad things and feel like a terrible person, which doesn't help with already feeling miserable, but I'm wanting to become a better person and find a path that will lead me to being happy."
392,I want to start cutting myself again just for that,"To summarize, I’m addict to attention and want constantly. Of course I’m aware of it and do my very best to hide it from everyone. So when I get super jealous or angry from not getting enough attention I never show it.

I’ve have a period where I was cutting myself to get attention, plus I kinda think of that every day so I think I liked it at the same time. But never mind, when adult start to make a fuzz after noticing my cuts, I stop doing it because it was just bringing me too much problem. 
When my best friend saw it tho she just asked me why I was doing it and she didn’t do anything else. Like, she would just stare at It but didn’t do anything or tried to convince me to stop. It made me very angry and frustrated by I didn’t say anything. 
Today she came up to me to ask advice about a friend of hers who cuts herself and she wanted to help her. I talked to her for a bit about her situation and tell her to convince her to go to therapy for a starter, since she seemed she needed to just let her feelings out.
But when I saw my best friend concerned about her, it made me very jealous. And I also just have this feeling of not mattering. I didn’t let any of this being shown of course. For the rest of the day I was feeling like going insane tho. I wanted to scream and cut myself again. But like until bleeding to death. I have this thing of imagining me dying, but i only was doing it before sleeping because for some reason it make me feel great. For the first time I really thought of doing it for real once I could get something sharp.

I don’t wanna go to school tomorrow. I just feel worse and worse. I tried to call people that seemed cheerful to up my mood but it didn’t worked. I’m also afraid to talk about it to a friend I love very much. I just want to be alone for an entire day doing nothing. I feel like I’m going to be insane if I go to school tomorrow. Especially if I see my best friend, I don’t know if I’ll be able to crack jocks like I’m use to."
393,(Vent+Rant) Identity,"Hello, so for a while I've been struggling with my identity and I feel like it has turned for the worst I guess.

Basically I've been quite depressed since last week and on top of that my identity issues don't really help. And no, these thoughts aren't just something that pops up when I'm depressed - they've been here since the beginning of last year. I really wanna be able to figure out who I am and who I'm supposed to be.

I consider myself to have no actual personality and I don't know if my sexuality is actually for me or because of the chances I might have a disorder or something of the sort. The same goes for my gender identity. All my friends seem to have it figured out for them, not seeming to bat an eye at their pronounces or sexuality while I keep saying ""oh I'm x, y, z-"" and so forth - but in the end I keep hesitating and thinking over it on repeat.

I don't know if when I'm with my friends that I'm truly me because I consider myself to have no other personality traits than ""being weird and saying weird, unexpected things"" - I'm basically nobody in a conversation and can't keep them up for longer than what seems to be 5-10 minutes or even less. I have so many walls with who I'm with and where I am, I have so many different ways to speak to people and I really don't know how to just be the same, general me whenever.

If anybody have any tips in regarding what to do, please tell me and how I can properly discover who I am. :'] Sorry for it being so long.

TDLR: I have so many walls depending on where and who, I barely have any personality traits (or so it feels like - I can't keep long conversations with friends), I don't know if I truly identify with my gender and-/or- sexuality, and I just really wanna be able to figure out who I am and who I'm supposed to be.

Extra: I know it isn't actually ""necessary"" to label myself with certain things but I have an urge to because otherwise I feel even more lost than before. I've tried."
394,i want to dropout.,"I’ve completely lost motivation to go to school. Idk if it’s just senioritis or that I’m in a shitty place right now and struggling with my mental heath. I just can’t do anything for myself anymore. But I’m actually trying to graduate, but’s it been difficult because I can’t bring myself to even go to school and attendance is really important. It went from once a month to missing weekly. I know it’s bad, but I really can’t bring myself to commit to school anymore. It’s honestly really draining and I’m exhausted. 

I started off with a positive attitude, telling myself I was going to do good this year after coming up from bad marks and lacking. But now I can’t even push myself to get dressed and go to school. I’d get dressed just to stay home, telling my parents I’m sick. I know it’s bad, but I need motivation to finish this semester."
395,Looking for ways to practice positive mental health,"Hello,

I've been in a downward spiral for the last year and a half. I fell into a major depression and it only perpetuated itself. Small everyday decisions have become mountain of a tasks. As I'm working my my self destructive behaviors I have a question.

I'm searching for ways to: Affirm faith in other people, believing others like me and I'm worthy of good things, practiceing positive efforts resulting in positive reward, practicing courage, accepting good things, and dealing with adversity with a calm assertiveness.

What are some good ways to do this? What has worked for others?"
396,"Was finally in the right place to talk to my GP, and now I can't find a psychiatrist.","I spoke to my doctor almost a month ago now, about my mental health, and requested an ADHD screening. She submitted a referral, so far so good, they finished it in a timely fashion, great, I call the guy, aaaand he's not taking new patients.

Queue like three full afternoons of calling my insurance for alternatives, calling probably a dozen possibilities only for most of them to either specifically be child psychologists, only take referrals from doctors in their own hospital, or to not answer the phone, or call me back. The only person who currently seems like an option is someone I'm really not comfortable seeing. (Old white Christian, which is not an issue in basically any aspect of my life, but I've realized is for me, when it comes to therapy.)

I'm just getting so burnt out. It took me like 8 years to even manage to talk to a doctor about this. There are only so many people I can call, before I just run out of possibilities, and I really don't know what to do at this point, aside from potentially just eating the cost of seeing someone who doesn't take my insurance.

I'm just very exhausted and frustrated right now. I don't know if there even is really any advice for this situation. I'm just tired of sitting here, being pretty sure of what's wrong with me, and being unable to actually do anything about it despite having fucking insurance. It shouldn't be this hard, right?"
397,I think I'm dead before turning 40,"Had a traumatic childhood, lost both parents, my mum first and then my dad 7 years later to suicide. My dad only cared about his own ego and would randomly call me a fag because I was in my underwear. Basically I became insane because of my youth.

After my dad died I started to smoke cigarettes and spliffs constantly. I ate poorly too. Quit this summer after 9 years and I had a mental breakdown after that. I couldn't stop worrying about getting lung cancer, became extremely stressed all the time, had major depression and couldn't leave my bed anymore because I felt I had ruined my life. In the end I wanted to kill myself because after 3 months of total misery, I was done. This made me happy for the first time in months so I decided to keep living.

All this time I had to solve everything alone. I had to force myself to stop stressing. I had to bring myself to the point of suicide to produce some serotonine and keep going. I'm so angry because of this because I asked for help of a psychiatrist in December and I'm still on the waiting list. I had such intense stress and extreme sorrow because of my past that I most likely gave myself cancer because of how bad it was for my health. I had acne. I look 10 years older. I have a deep frown. I'm constantly tired.

Ugh, I'm not ready to die, but I know I'll be gone before 40. No talent, no determination and extremely poor life choices will be the end of me. Either by suicide or because of cancer. People will remember me as a failure and it's all because my brain is my own worst enemy."
398,Blog,I everyone I’m attaching a link to a blog I’ve started. I’ve struggled with my mental health since my early 20’s. It’s a perspective as to what my life looks like day to day. I’ve created this in the hopes of helping others as I’ve relied on others for help. [JL’s blog](https://thementalthoughts.wordpress.com)
399,I think I need help... But my GP sent me away,"I am okay most of the time, but when I'm low I'm pretty good at hiding how I'm feeling which is probably why everyone thinks I'm fine...

I get anxiety, I cause arguments all the time between me and my boyfriend because I get paranoid about our relationship, and the future. He's been amazing with helping me, but I physically can't be apart from him otherwise I become so depressed; he's the only close person I've told about my feelings... I get panic attacks over little things he's done when I'm not with him (whether he meant to do it or not), and I get incredibly tired after the panic attack and it causes me to become depressed. When I get low, I'm sure it's more low than most people would feel, and it's lower than how I have felt in the past... If I'm in an argument with my boyfriend for example and he's upset me, it gets to a point where I just physically can't fight anymore... I try to listen to him and care about how he's feeling but there comes a point where I just can't respond or think rationally, and I just sit there, and things he says just go straight through my head when I don't mean for them to. And when we've sorted it out and it's okay and quiet between us again, I start drinking just so I can feel a bit happier. But it's not just my boyfriend that triggers me, although he does make up for a most of my emotions.

I can tell when my depression is bad; I start getting incredibly irrational thoughts. Like, I thought I was going to harm someone while handing them a cup of tea, or thought about what would happen if I stuck my foot out and tripped them up... I know I never would have, but those thoughts are not pleasant to deal with. I'm back with my boyfriend now, but I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and have been a little bit obsessed about it. I've also been quite obsessed lately with alcohol and pocket knives... I've been too scared this week to work on any work-related job that might be stressful because I don't think I can handle it; things that trigger recently cause me 10x the amount of stress.

The worst thing I've done is gotten really drunk after an argument, and walked outside alone at midnight in a dangerous area, down roads I didn't know. I don't know why, but I just felt like I had to do it, and I feel like my drunk state wanted me to get hit by a car or something. My boyfriend had fallen asleep and I had drunk messaged some friends (that don't know what I'm going through) that were planning to go out and look for me...

The GP has sent me away twice, my boyfriend wants me to go back... The last time I went too, the GP barely explained the differences between getting therapy or medication; or what I needed. They just said ""which one?"" ... The therapist thought I was fine.

I have also been getting horrible pains along my left side for the past few weeks; bottom left of my abdomen and at the bottom of my left/central rib. I'm unsure if it's related..."
400,My mental health,"When I was 19 I visited a doctor about how I believe I’m not “normal”. He asked me why and I explained how when I was in school, the school advised me to see a therapist because of my behaviour. I was in top sets and one of the smartest in my classes but still didn’t land any grades because I would rarely show up to school. I would be too busy roaming the streets doing whatever I wanted. 

I explained to him that I had smoked weed since I was around 13 and it may have made me worse. I told him my symptoms and then he offered me pills, I refused to take any. I basically begged him to let me see a mental health professional. He refused and told me that waiting times very long, and he told me to keep a diary about my feelings and see him again in a month. Not sure if it’s relevant, but when I was very young, I found pleasure in killing frogs and fish. I would pick up the frogs and just slam them on the ground. I would also cut the eyes off of snails and slugs... fucking crazy I know. I wouldn’t do nothing like that now, but I thought this behaviour might be worth mentioning. 

I’m now 21, didn’t re-visit my doctor all that time ago. Lately I can feel myself going insane. If I’m not thinking of suicide then I’m thinking of killing someone else. Someone completely random or just somebody I don’t like. I don’t even know why, I just obsess over it. I abuse drugs, alcohol and I sleep around with girls. I am quite a popular person and have good social skills, so nobody would have a clue as to what really goes on inside my head. my life is just full of self destructive behaviours, most of which I don’t even want to get into. I can’t hold down a job, I cut relationships off with family and it doesn’t effect me in the slightest. I’ve ignored my own mother for 9 months and I don’t miss her at all. 

Surely, this behaviour and thoughts aren’t normal. What does it sound like I have? I’m not ready to see a doctor right now because I don’t want any of this on my records, I just want some advice on what might be wrong with me... and maybe somebody here might be able to come up with a conclusion."

403,im extremely sensitive and jumpy,"im a dude, almost 16 and i wanna get stronger emotionally

literally the simplest things make me anxious, make my heart race and make me feel like im under pressure

also im very jumpy with the smallest things, anything sudden (movement/sound) or something im just not expecting, whatever it is

i was pretty damn emotional as a kid too but id say ive gotten only a little bit better from back then

recently i walked in on a family member crying and only seeing that made me very anxious and it made my heart speed up but i guess i managed to calm down eventually. thing is, i still hate the fact that i got so startled by that

is there any way to keep this stuff from happening as many things are expected to happen in life and id rather keep calm in most situations or at least, if i do get startled and anxious, i want it to be on a more natural level rather than on a im-about-to-have-a-heart-attack level  
i really hate it and id do anything to get stronger"
404,"People that know about Mirtazapine, I could use some help.",
405,How do I (20F) become okay with never receiving justice?,"My father sexually abused me from ages 8-12. He forced me to sleep with him every night and would ""cuddle"" me and make me feel ""special."" I even have a memory of me asking him to touch me. He was extremely manipulative and brainwashed me. He left my family once my mother found out he put us in thousands worth of debt, and he then left the country.

For years my mother asked if he touched me. I said no. At 18 I finally spoke up and said it happened. My mother then proceeds to sit me down and explain there is reason to believe my father raped his younger sister and got her pregnant. *yup.* My father got my aunt (his blood sister) pregnant and she had the baby. The baby is now around 30. My mother just never thought this was relevant i guess? That my father has a history of being sexually abusive? 

My sister was raped. Brutally. My father ended up finding out through his employee/my sisters friend. One night my father gave her some beers and told her they were going to a fire at a campsite with a few buddies. He got her tipsy, brought her to some sketchy fire site, and proceeded exchange a few words to the men, and then left my sister with a bunch of middle aged men who raped her. My sister confronted my father about this and all he could say was ""I hope you learned your lesson for being a slut."" This rape was planned by my father to teach my sister a lesson from the first rape. 

Just to say 3 things out of **many** that he has done to prove what a monster he is.

&amp;#x200B;

I will never in this life receive any form of justice for what my father has done to me and my sister. And I am not okay with that. I am not okay with accepting the torture he put me through. I will never be the person I could have. I will never fully recover from this. I will always have those memories, I will always be that girl who got touched. 

Honestly, this is the best I have been doing in my whole life. And yet...it is just not enough. I want more. I want some form of justice."
406,After Uni?,"Hey guys, at the moment I'm doing alright. I'm doing a degree so the same routine every day means I don't really get anxious about what's going on, I've been at this place for 5 years. I also have a 10 hour a week job cleaning at my uni which is nice and quiet.

But 6 months from now I'll have my degree, and I don't want to be cleaning my uni for the rest of my life. So what do I do? I get SO anxious about answering the phone, taking public transport, learning to drive, serving the public, I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to cope after I get my degree and that scares me so much.

Newest info at end of his e-mail to his U of California staff &amp; colleagues.

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic

Dear Colleagues, 

As some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.
The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.
Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. 

Good luck to all of us! 

James Robb, MD"
408,Talking to Myself,"Hi, all. It's a song by George Watsky and I believe a lot of y'all would be able to relate:   
""One day you opened up your eyes inside of you   
Inside a world inside a universe you didn't get to choose  
You didn't get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace   
Or cast the cast and crew you didn't get to pick your starting place  
And though it was a race you didn't understand  
You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran  
And when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground   
And picked your scabs you knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began  
As you got older there were days of cold surrender  
Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor  
But as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view  
By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew  
Yet there were moments   
There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head  
Outside your pain outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage  
Outside the need to get it, get it, you will never get it, that's okay

Have you felt a little off today  
Had a lot to say  
But wound up talking to yourself?  
Have you hunted for a kindly ear  
But couldn't find one near  
And wound up talking to yourself?

Had a little spot where you been going through a lot  
Wanna shove it to the bottom but a trouble gonna bubble to the top  
Then the bubble gonna pop and the hustle never ever gonna stop  
Cause you get up in the morning get ahead then get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop  
You need a plot, what you wanna witness with this life you got   
You kicked and fought trynna get up in your skin and pick this lock  
That ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu   
Issues someone fit to quick should sit you should down to talk  
Ever wonder who's the crazy the one, people walking to work as if nothing is off  
But if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebody's head and looting from shops  
Are there times you're alone now when nobody's home but you walk around muttering under your breath second shit saying goddammit goddammit goddammit just whispering soft  
Do you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts, tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through  
When you tie your stomach into knots that you don't know how to undo  
But do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see

409,Struggling and need advice," 

Hello. This may be a long one but I appreciate any input or advice on how to handle my current situation...

Ok so for the past few months I may have been suffering from depression or just struggling with my mental health. There has been some rough patches and some good patches, just like in anyone's life. I am somewhat close with my family so whenever I am upset about something I will vent to them and others times I may not. Sometimes I get into fights with my parents and do what any young adult would do and just overreact.

  
Lately though I have had a feeling that instead of discussing things with me, about how I feel or why I am upset, my family has contacted my friends to check in on me and make sure I am ok and do not harm myself. I would never harm myself and it truly hurts knowing my family thinks I would do such a thing. I have a very strong feeling that they are discussing things with my friends because there has been more than 1 occasion where it seemed like my friends were acting weird towards me or taking extra precaution with how they spoke to me.   


It also puts me in a very awkward spot with my friends because now they know about my personal situations which I would have liked to keep private between my family and I. It hurts the fact my family went behind my back to contact my friends and inform them of whatever is going on in my life and how they are worried about me and to tell them to keep an eye out for me/try to make them hang out with me to make me happier. It just makes me feel even worse that everyone knows about my mental situation now.

  
The hardest part of what I'm dealing with is how to bring this up to either party. I want to know exactly what my family has said to my friends and how long this has been going on but I am afraid they will not give me the truth. I haven't even considered telling my family I know what is going on because they will just deny it and then it will make me feel even worse because I will be upset knowing that they are lying.  


I know my family cares about me a lot if they are willing to go to this length to make sure I'm okay. But the part that hurts the most is that they don't understand that I would rather keep things private and not in my friend circle. I feel as if now my friends will look at me so differently because of all the things my family may have put in their head..."
410,I can't physically feel love.,"What the title says. I can feel love in a platonic sense, but never romantically. As soon as someone admits feelings for me, even if we were great friends before, my go-to instinct is to cut them off. I feel absolutely horrible and fucking hate myself for doing so. At this point I can't even help it, but it's just a habit. I've lost too many friends because of this and I feel like I'm just in a cycle of constantly pushing my closest friends away. I've been trying so hard to stop doing this as of recent, but it's so mentally draining to pretend until I admit to them that I physically can not reciprocate their feelings. No matter how close we are. I'm afraid of hurting them by admitting this however. This is why I either enter a relationship against my will with them, or keep them waiting for an answer. The only time I admitted this to someone who had feelings for me, they didn't accept it at all. They threatened to kill themselves if I didn't get into a relationship with them, regardless of what I'd told them. And when I finally ended it, they screamed at me for lying to them/ leading them on, even though I told them everything beforehand. 

I don't know what to do about this. It's getting me seriously down as of late, as I don't want to push anyone else away. Has anyone gone or is going through a similar thing to this?"
411,"I posted this in r/lonely, figured I should put it here too",
412,I need some advice,"So recently I noticed a pattern in my behaviour which leads me to believe I might be depressed and possibly suffering from APD (sociopathy to be exact).

A couple days ago I was watching a video and the subject of sociopathy came up. The video explained how sociopaths are compulsive liars, have trouble forming social bonds, and shape their personality to fit the person they're interacting with.

While I don't usually jump to conclusions it seems to much of a coincidence for me to have almost the exact personality the video described. Growing I told so many lies my own parents don't even trust me anymore and at work I keep finding myself doing things I could easily get fired for all for my own benefit. I don't seek out these things, but when I see an opportunity to get something beneficial I take it and think about it afterwards. When I meet someone I fake being a social type of person while I'm a (probably autistic) introvert. The only thing I don't recoqnize in myself which fits sociopathy is arrogance. The last couple weeks I'm starting to feel more empty and emotionless, feeling worthless and generally feeling lazy and tired. I procrastinate A LOT and I regularly wake up to find myself cancelling plans to go to the gym or other productive things. 

I've also done some online tests (not the most reliable, I know) which all indicate I have a severe risk of being depressed and a very high risk of being a sociopath. They suggest consoling a professional but I'm too scared to confront my parents about it because I feel like they won't understand (my mom is not the brightest and my dad's autistic).

Is there anything I could do to confirm whether I'm depressed/ a sociopath? Is there a way to bring this to my parents in a way they will take me seriously?

Please, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."
413,Im being widdled down to nothing and I feel so helpless and stupid about FEELING the way I do let alone feeling at all.,"Life, could you please stop beating me and at least let me get up off the floor for a bit?

- Illness within my family, non stop causing me to use all of my sick and over 80% of vacation before March even started.

- Possibility of losing job due to said days off

-Awaiting FMLA/Short term disability to be approved 🤞🤞🤞

- Because of submitting for FMLA/ short term disability, I'm losing 28 hours worth of pay that I HAD PAID DAYS OFF FOR THAT WERE COUNTED AGAINST ME so now I want my fucking days back if you're gonna count that shit against me and not pay me for it, but no. I'll never see them nor a dime of what I EARNED VIA THOSE DAYS being you know PAID DAYS OFF?

- Being told I'm ""immature"" by my boss because of a work rule that severely prohibits me keeping contact with my mom whom is a serious fall risk and last time she fell, she laid there, on the floor FOR OVER 8 FUCKING HOURS and im expected to just deal with it? Also a serious coping mechanism that I'm restricted on using which does and HAS affected my productivity and concentration along with pure loathing of going to work everyday in fear ill get caught checking to see if I've a message from my family or switching songs. Yet, ""i ShOuLD Be ThAnKfUl I HaVE iT tHiS gOod"" (no cell phones what so ever to be seen outside of pockets or purses, i cant feel mine go off cause of nerve damage and the vibrations arent strong enuff thru my pants) i cant even, without fear of an immediate write up or termination, change my music or scroll whilst on break or lunch unless im practically out of outing the fucking building. 

- Im over having zero people on my side who genuinely give a shit

- Mental health(and physical obviously) are struggling SO badly I honestly am reaching a breaking point.

- Theres more, of course but as I sit here and type this out, I feel like a fool for even venting and getting this out of my system in a ""healthy"" way because it will do no good. 

Am I just a ""spoiled"" weak person, not worth of living or is there something SERIOUSLY wrong with society these days. Both perhaps?"
414,Im lost,Im sorry for the language but i hope you will translate and read. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qC6zAElhKlHU8GBXtrLQy159dnJEJtta05nyPFmgfmo/edit?usp=drivesdk
415,How can you find out if you have a certain mental disorder?,"Hiya! First off, sorry if this isn’t the right place to put this! I couldn’t find a more relevant subreddit, so I thought this would be close enough! 

As much as I’d hate to add onto the list (ADHD, depression, anxiety/social anxiety), but I think there’s something wrong with me... to put it bluntly, anyways. 

I’m not sure if I should go into it more? Just… I believe I may have some sort of personality disorder, but I don’t wanna be like “oh i’m positive i have this, I don’t need a doctor to confirm it, blah blah-!” yeah no, I know it doesn’t work like that. You need to be diagnosed by a professional (i believe so anyways). I don’t even recall how the heck I got diagnosed with my other disorders, one day they were just _there_, so that’s why I’m asking this because I’m not so sure on how to go about it!

How would you go about getting checked for possible disorders? This has been on my mind for a while because I noticed something seemed very off about me, and it’s only got more apparent since then.


Sorry if I sounded... annoying, or really anything bad, in this. If I did, I’m sorry!! Never posted here or anything regarding this, so idk how to do this lmao


EDIT:// oh, if you wish for me to go deeper into it for more information or anything, lemme know and I’ll reply back with my kindofalreadymade explanation (i do that out of habit lol)! 

And, if the ways to do it are somehow different everywhere, I live in the good ol’ state of Wisconsin (US) :3"
416,How to support a friend with depression if you can barely support yourself?,"Hello. My partner is falling deeper and deeper into a depression and I am not strong enough to support him. I barely started to be able to stabilise and support myself after years of anxiety and panic attacks and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I am more of a burden to him than anything else and I feel so helpless seeing him getting worse and worse. He doesn’t want any help from anyone and said he’s giving up. I know I can’t force him to get help but I don’t want to see him die either. “Just be there for him” is not working well, he is pushing me away and that’s firing up my anxieties. I had a panic attack today, the first in months, and I ... I just feel so helpless and useless. I don’t really know what I want from this post, I know there is no magical cure, but maybe someone had similar experiences or... idk 😞"
417,"I don't really know where to ask this, so...","I sometimes have weird dreams. Not weird as in something literally odd or unreal, as in some giant octopus coming out of space or something along those lines. I mean like I have dreams of common things happening, like being in a car ride, or talking with someone, though these dreams are not anything I had done/have experienced in the past. To say, it's more like glimpses into the future or something. I have poor memory, so I might just be wrong, but I swear I remember having dreams in the past and feeling déjà vu of sorts whenever at random at some point about something I did or done around the current time of remembering. I experienced this quite a few times in my life, the most being four times in the span of two days, two each. Thinking logically, it probably is just me overthinking and falsely remembering things, but I thought I'd ask for a actual answer. I thought I'd try writing down my dreams, though as mentioned, I have poor memory, so I might end up forgetting to do so more than forgetting the dream."
418,I'm getting better and it feels weird,"I've struggled with moderate-severe depression and social anxiety my whole life. A few months ago I finally decided to do something about it and I'm actually seeing results. I started seeing a therapist, taking antidepressants, and for a while I fell in love (though I had to move overseas so it didn't work out). 

Since basically November I've been so much more confident, or at least *less* self conscious. When I look in the mirror I no longer see a hideous visage staring back at me, and I actually think I'm pretty attractive; wearing nicer clothes and grooming myself better have contributed to this. I'm still very lonely but I have a bit more hope that someday I'll find someone and I've been maintaining closer relationships with my friends, as hard as it is whilst I'm living abroad.

But, all that said, it feels weird to feel good. It's like I feel like I should be hating myself or having suicidal thoughts but I just can't find those thoughts in my brain and it's making me uncomfortable. I don't plan on stopping treatment or anything but I just wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with this. It's as though I don't know how to function like a normal human being with a healthy mind, it's so counterintuitive. Will this feeling ever end or will I always be a little uncomfortable no matter how much better I get? Any advice would be really appreciated."
419,Is it not depression?,"I’ve heard depression comes in episodes but I have been in the same mood with no highs or lows for years, since I was about 13 and I’m 21 now. When I was 15 it did get worse in a way, I lost interest in all my hobbies. I don’t even feel sad, I know at some point I did but I can’t remember when. I’m just emotionally flat, withdrawn, and apathetic now and have been this way for 6 years. It feels like it part of my personality, I’ve considered I may have a personality disorder such as schizoid pd since I have all the symptoms of it. Is it possible that that could be mistaken for depression? Doctors tend to slap the depression diagnosis on anyone that even slightly meets the criteria. I’ve taken different kinds of depression medicine with no effect."
420,I can’t stop overthinking,"I [26F] was dumped 8 days ago by the woman [30F] I thought I would marry. Everything was going well, we were talking about our future together, speaking of buying a house, we have been living together(and still are due to how recent this breakup is), she even mentioned wanting my last name on multiple occasions. We didn’t argue about anything, had the same values and our goals aligned. When she ended things, I was completely blindsided. Her friends and family reached out to me about the breakup and told me they were very shocked that she ended things because everything appeared to be going well.

I’ve gone through all of the emotions. Cried it out, gave her space, and told her that I respected her feelings and support her decision even if it means we aren’t together. I’ve been doing a lot better, but I can’t. Stop. Overthinking!!

I’m overthinking about her friends and family saying they are shocked.

I’m overthinking about her mom telling me a couple days ago that she was “so sure we would get married”.

I’m overthinking about a meme she showed me about being depressed. I’m overthinking about my response and her lack of reply.

I’m overthinking about how she is doing. Is she feeling okay? What can I do to help her? How can I support her?

I’m overthinking about the potential of us getting back together again after the dust settles - but also trying to accept that this may never happen.

I’m overthinking about the lack of closure and how I didn’t see this coming at all.

I can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t stop worrying that she isn’t okay, but I don’t want to overwhelm her by coming at her with questions. I want to honor her feelings and give her space if that’s what she needs. But I am SO worried about her right now.

What do I do? How do I stop overthinking all of this? I love her and I care about her so much and I just want to make sure that she is okay, but I also know that I need to take care of myself too."
421,Seeking mental help for the first time.,Hey guys and gals I’ve had a rough couple of weeks and it’s made me realize that I should have seekd mental help a long time ago. I’m not going to go into details but I would like to know what the best way is to start seeking help. I’m 25 years old and I have a hard time communicating what is going on in my head and making it make sense. If anyone could point me in the direction of some links on how to seek help and how to form my thoughts a little easier I would greatly appreciate it.
422,therapist of 3+ years went behind my back,"i’ve been in therapy since i was 7. i’m almost 18 now. i’ve been through multiple therapists and never have been able to click with one until the person i see now and have been seeing for over 3 years. today i think was my last session with her. i’ve cancelled on her the past few weeks because of certain reasons and today was the first time i went back. i found out my mom has been going to see her on the days i didn’t go. i felt so betrayed seeing how my mom is mostly the reason i’m in therapy the first place. (we’ll call my therapist amanda). for the past 3 years i’ve been pouring my heart out to amanda about how much my mom hurts me and abuses me mentally/emotionally. every single session. she was the one person who was on my side and wouldn’t say “but she’s your mom” or “that’s your family she still loves you”. i felt so safe in her office and finally emotionally supported. but now i feel like my mom tainted her and i can never see her again. she started to blame my problems on my cousin who my mom made out to be a bad influence when really she took me into her house and let me stay there for MONTHS when i couldn’t be at home with my mom anymore. my cousin went through a lot of childhood trauma also so she really understands and i love her to death. and i’ve never felt like i’ve had to defend her ever because she is the most amazing loving person in my life. it hurt me so much to have to come to her defense to my therapist who is supposed to listen to my side of things and my side only. not my mothers. both my mother and her went behind my back and i feel like i’ll never be able to trust anyone again. this ruined everything for me. 

sorry that this post was messy and everywhere i’m very bad at explaining things :’)"
423,I know I have something wrong with me but nobody believes me,"I’m 19 and since I was about 13 I’ve known I’m different, I struggle with things others might not like socially and if I’ve done something that embarrassed me even if it was 10 years ago I remember and relive that feeling over and over.

I can’t stop myself from telling small lies wether it’s to make myself seem cooler or to get attention in some way and I hate it I try really hard to stop that a lot of my flashbacks are me trying to get attention and if makes me want to jump off a bridge because I hate that I did that stuff.

These thoughts go around my head constantly about things I did and sometimes I’ll start second guessing if I did things like turning off the straighteners which will stay in my mind all day 

I get these rage fits to the point where I can’t remember what I did or said and have little control over what I do in them, I have seriously injured my self in these on occasion. 

I can’t stand farts I feel like the gas in farts are swallowed and inside my lungs and it makes me feel really sick and I can’t breathe again till I breathe in some spray deodorant 

I don’t have any friends and have been through 3 groups in the last 5 years and each has ended pretty badly 


I’ve attempted suicide 5 times


I have trouble sticking things out for longer than a year( school, job, clubs) 

I enjoy getting my Lego and putting them in piles according to colour and shape then arranging them into one big Lego box 

I’ve been to my doctor tons and every time she says a therapist but I want to know what’s wrong with me why I am this way I want a diagnosis I’ve don’t CBT and DBT but they just discharge me without any explanation and no suggestions of how I should continue 

I just want to find someone else like me who is this way because I feel so alone and just want to know what’s wrong with me"
424,Nightmares often predict my lows,"When I start having nightmares I know I’m heading down a bad depression hole, and I’m starting to wonder if terrible, hyper-realistic, and nonstop nightmares are actually a form of or symptom of psychosis. When I start feeling this bad I start feeling as if I’m having a psychotic break but I never have hallucinations while awake—are hyper-realistic dreams in any way a form of hallucinations? Because these nightmares really do affect my day-to-day, I can’t really escape the mood they put me in."
425,Help me. I dont know whats wrong.,"I dont know what the fuck is going on. If its me or the world. But I want it to stop. What the hell is going on. What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck are we doing? Why are we waste, why?

Why do I live here. Why the fuck cant I be dust around a dying star or a fucking rock on the moon. Why the fuck am I here stuck with imbeciles and the only good thing being my own fucking mom. Why does she have to suffer for all of this bullshit. Why do I. I want to go back to whatever I come from and I want all of us to just cease to exist so all of this stops going on and we can just fucking rest."
426,should i seek professional help?,i’ve been self harming for about four years now and have had frequent anxiety attacks for longer but i’ve never been to therapy or been to the doctor about mental health before so i’m not sure if i should talk to my family about seeing a therapist/getting medication or not because i feel like my problems aren’t bad enough if that makes sense
427,Finally admitting I have a problem,"So I am pretty sure I've struggled with depression for over 10-15 years. I have had ups and downs along the way, had thoughts of dying/wanting to die/or killing myself, binge ate and starved myself, had really high times and really low times. I've made attempts on my own life and thankfully none of them were successful. When I turned 21 I began drinking, responsibly at first, but over time I've started drinking to forget or suppress feelings. I've been easily irritated and exploded in fits of anger at the simplest thing, and I've also gotten incredibly sad and beaten myself up for the same little things. This is easily the hardest thing in my life I've had to admit to, and it was having to admit it to myself that I'm not ""fine"" and that I need help. The other hardest part has been opening up to my therapist, wife, parents, and a few friends. Since admitting I need help and that I've had a problem, it feels as though a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I can finally stop pretending that everything is ""fine"", and I can stop trying to tell myself I don't have a problem.
It is still extremely difficult opening up to people, and it is hard to accept the fact I need help because my mind is still trying to believe the lie I've been living for so long. I'm hopeful that with help I'll get better and finally be a happier person. I hope that for anyone suffering that you are able to reach out and get the help you need and deserve! You are worth it, you have meaning, you are strong, and you are loved!!"
428,does talking about my mental illness annoy people?,"i have been struggling with my mental health all my life. i’m diagnosed with ocd and schizophrenia but it is extremely rare that i talk about it/am open about it to anyone unless i’ve known them for a long time &amp; am comfortable with them. i have a hard time even opening up to therapists or doctors which is why i stopped seeing one (even though i would probably benefit if i could stick with it). 
when i first got diagnosed a few years ago, i told some of my close friends. some were understanding, but i felt as though they were all SUPER annoyed by me mentioning it. i just felt like such a burden to them and so since then i have stopped talking about any of my problems even if i want to vent to someone, i just end up talking to myself.... my parents are also very dismissive since i am doing a lot better than when i was in a psychotic episode and now they act like everything went away, even though i struggle with it still. 

lately i have been trying to open up to my new boyfriend, but it’s so hard. i told him briefly about my diagnosis but i never went into detail except some of my past delusions. he also sees the self harm marks on me and ive told him i tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past, but i try not to say anything at all, i just tell him after he digs deep into it and asks me to elaborate. i don’t even know if i should be opening up to him about these things. i feel like such a burden and so annoying everytime i think about bringing something up, like when i have sensory overload i want to tell him because he gets confused what’s going on but i can’t even tell him. the words just won’t come out. 

i don’t know why i’m venting here. i just would like to know if anyone else can relate/how you deal with it?"
429,Why am I doing this?,"These past two days I’ve have two close friends cut themselves and try kill themselves, one was today the other yesterday. I’m not sitting on my bed not being able to stop rocking back and forth and repeating “the did this to you” while continually cutting my arm. I can’t stop humming and hyperventilating . Can someone help, before I go crazy"
430,I created a community r/fearful for people with anxiety and panic disorder.,For people to discuss and get support only! No judgments.
431,Seeing eating as an addiction?,"I am currently recovering from an eating disorder, I eat a bit more but my view of needing food makes me feel like I lost control. Like I’m addicted to food and I’m scared that I won’t be able to starve again. 

I don’t know if it makes sense, but do you have any tips? 

Thank you. :)"
432,Head twitching,"My head keeps on twitching, it happens more when i'm stressed but it also does it when i'm not. I've made a post earlier and someone suggested brain zaps. I've looked up on it and I see that they are a side effect of anti-depressants but i'm not on that. It's no big deal to me but I just don't like it when I twitch out in public."
433,Is it possible I have schizoid personality disorder?,"I tend to overthink everything, but I feel like this might be a possibility. I can’t tell if it’s depression or SPD. I still like to have relationships and i’m kind of social, but I get anxious when talking to people I don’t really know. I’ve also lost a lot of pleasure in the things I used to enjoy, but this could be because of depression."
434,Dealing with feelings of loneliness,"Hello all. 34 year old male in the Eastern United States. I'm not sure if this is the right place to frame this question, so maybe if someone thinks there'd be a better avenue, please let me know. I will try not to be too long winded.

I've never had hoards of friends. I have several amazing friends and a great group of amazing acquaintances. The problem is, they're all somewhere else. I relocated a few states away two years ago for my wife's work and so now my closest friends are eight hours or so away. A couple of my best friends struggle with being very sociable, so sometimes texts and phone calls net a decent conversation, however most of the time I feel like I'm just reaching out and we exchange messages for a few minutes and that's that. I've been able to see a few of my good friends on one or two occasions since I've moved.

I haven't really made any friends since we've moved and it sometimes gives me feelings of anxiety thinking about the loneliness and whatnot. I do have a few acquaintances through work, but our interests very too greatly to see me spending too much time with them outside of work.

I came to think about posting this because I just came back from spending a residency weekend on campus at my school- I'm working on an Online MBA (mainly because of my work schedule, not because of any particular anti-social reasons or anything). I had an amazing time with the whole experience. With what little downtime we had, two of the guys in my group and I went out and had several beers, bonding for 6 hours or so before calling it a night. We exchanged numbers, and I connected on  LinkedIn with several people I met over the weekend.

When I got home and had a chance to wind down, I couldn't help but notice my first feelings were of overwhelming loneliness, missing the connection with the guys I met over the weekend too. Is this a normal feeling? Do other people experience these miniature existential crises? It's frustrating. I just don't really know how to process feeling like this, but I do feel like it would help if I could establish a friend group where I am now.

I'm not really sure what I hope to achieve by putting this all out there, beyond confirming my questions I guess. But any insight, or hell, even the conversation would be appreciated."
435,Anyone tried Lamictal or have a medical background that can explain why it's helping my anxiety so much?,"&amp;#x200B;

So I finally found a new, private psychiatrist 6 months ago who has been a Godsend. He's an absolute genius, but also doesn't take himself that serious, is goofy, and is completely present every second when with him. Hard to explain. Anywho when I first saw him, he kind of pointed out some obvious things, ""You've been on serotonin targeting SSRI/SNRI's for over a decade, yet your anxiety hasn't really gotten any more than slightly better from my understanding."" So he said every brain is different and for some antidepressants just aren't the answer yet a lot of psychiatrists/docs keep throwing different versions of the same thing. Antidepressants he explained are like ice cream. Vanilla ice cream is a lot different than chocolate ice cream, but they are still just ice cream (I'm very aware of some SSRIs help a lot people tremendously).

Anyways 2 months ago, we started weaning off the SSRIs and he put me on this anti-convulsant (epilepsy) medication that many people with seizures take. It's off label use, yes, it is a mood stabilizer, but its mostly for epilepsy. He had a reason for why he wanted to target different wiring of my brain with but I didn't really understand. He put me on 200 mg and I noticed it helped a lot. Not a ton, but it helped (like going from a daily anxiety level of 8/10 to a 6-7/10. He said let's stay there for a bit. Well, two days ago I accidentally took double my dose. I didn't even realize it until later that night, but all day I was confused about why anxiety was like 2-3/10. For me, a 5/10 is my baseline. I know I shouldn't of but I felt so much better I said I'm going to take double my dose one more day just to make sure it wasn't a placebo. Felt just as good as the day before. Have 3 more weeks til I see him again, but I think he's on to something with this Lamictal.

Does anyone with a medical background understand why an epilepsy medication is helping me so much with my anxiety? It's baffling me. Trying not to get my hopes up finally something is going to work, but I feel really hopeful for the first time in a long time."
436,Just having a very bad mental health day.,"First time poster here, many time commenter (hi!)

I am just wondering what tips other people can give me as to what to do when they start to feel down in the dumps about looks and things of that nature. Having a hard time as things romantically have not been going well recently. Not going to go into too many details, but it's just been one rejection after another, or just things going nowhere. My mind has now convinced me that it is because I'm unattractive and that no one wants to be with or around me, even though I know that's not true. 

Any tips or tricks would just be helpful. Thank you in advance."
437,"Lonely, but socially anxious","I'm crying right now, I really don't know what to do. I have tried so hard for 5 years to make friends, and I haven't found people I'm happy and comfortable around. It's hard for me to talk to anyone but my parents and brother, I just wish I could find one friend, anyone who I could feel as comfortable around as my family. I feel so far away from everyone I meet, and I'm always in my head. I know friendships take time, I have given so many people a lot of time and I still feel like I'm performing when I'm around them. I don't even know how to talk to people, so I spend most of the time silent, thinking of what to say. I'm terrible with questions, and I know that's the most important aspect of a conversation, but I can never come up with any. Socializing is so stressful that I feel like I'm going to break, and yet loneliness feels the same.

I have tried putting myself in plenty of social situations to get more practice, I have had a person hired by my parents to help teach me good social skills, and I have read so many self-help books, but it feels like nothing is helping. I'm not making any progress and the loneliness has been slowly eating away at me.

It's gotten to the point where lately I dont want to try to talk to people because I'm so drained. I need help"
438,There's a wall between me and other people,I have an easy time getting along with people and making friends but I struggle with deeply connecting to them. I can do it but after being abused and having my trust broken too many times I won't anymore. I want to disappear into the woods and live alone. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging or I'm some amazing person but I've been told many times by people that they've never felt so connected to someone. It's basically impossible for me to feel that way about others. I'm surrounded by people but I'm really alone.
439,Is this normal/healthy?,So I recently remembered that I used to do this and I’m wondering if it was something that negatively effected my mental health or something. But when I was a little kid I may or may not have been a little shit but my mother was a single mother with a really stressful life so sometimes she’d get extra upset about stuff and at that age I had some pretty bad anger issues. So when I did something wrong and we’d get pissed at each other I wouldn’t want her to be mad. I’d lock myself in my room for a little bit and I’d force myself to smile and just convince myself I was happy instead and not really deal with the emotions. Is this bad? Could it have effected my mental state in a bad way? Like I said this was a really long time ago and I’m just wondering about it. Thanks!
440,a tiny rant,"so like??? apparently I've been having panic attacks my entire life without realizing. I went to a new therapist today and she asked me about my anxiety and if I had panic attacks and I was like ""idk"" so she described them to me and Im like;;; Shocked ok because it never occurred to me I was having panic attacks for some reason? bc like I just thought that was normal u know and I didn't really look that deep into it anyway this is shocking info just wanted to rant for a little"
441,We have to stop calling trauma Mental Illness. Mental Illness is typically emotional weakness.,"I was born in Atlanta Georgia USA 1987. I survived a birth that was 2.5 months premature to a heroine addicted mother and have some very minor physical deformities.

These issues were the catalyst for me to invest in being diagnosed with any possible mental illness as my biggest struggles in life were, making friends, doing well in school, and doing things that I knew I was supposed to. 

This completely made me disregard the fact that I had not only had a drug addict mother but experienced severe abuse and neglect after being born. While in my mother's possession I had been kept in boxes alone, beaten, and burned. I have skin grafts from being less than a year old where I was held down and had boiling water poured on top of my foot where my mother thought she could hide it. As I grew older I was still physically neglected and I remember being driven in a car frequently feeling like it was going 100 MPH and my mother picking up some sort of medicine every weekend. It was a square bottle with pink liquid. I learned much later that she never got up on time to get her methadone before the place closed so even thought I held my eyes closed with my hands, and would stomp on an invisible brake, she never made the decision to leave earlier. 

I never knew who my real dad was, didn't have a friend until 12 , never was taken to a doctor as a kid even when needing stitches. 

After having a hard time becoming an adult I decided to see if I might have mental illness. I remember not doing well in school, not having friends, and not doing things I was supposed to do because my parents advice was ""Just do what you're supposed to do"".

Sounds an awful lot like ADHD.

I studied thousands of hours of math concepts, physics, how we build language, and how the brain works for years trying to fix my broken self. 

My struggle comes from being lied to my whole life so when I speak, I don't give people enough verbal information to work with. I had to extrapolate my whole life so I have assumed all of you could too. 

I've gained a very complex study of the physical world and now understand math like never before. I have never gone through the pomp and circumstance of ponzi scheme college so anything that I express that is factual is ruled off as mental illness. 

My issue is telling people what I need from them, being able to explain myself well enough, and why my understanding of certain situations are far more complex than most people. I was trying to fix a problem I didn't have which resulted in the development of a super power at the cost of losing a normal power. 

If you think you have mental illness from trauma, just wait before you tell someone. You probably haven't seen what your real issue is and it is a matter of facing the source of the problem. I personally believe most of, if not all mental illness is behavior illness. I also feel like people don't differentiate between mental disability and mental illness enough because of the stigma on depression.

If you have mental illness, wait on telling someone because they will not see the trauma in your life because you don't either. The first thing anyone should do when expecting mental illness inside themselves is studying how to be self aware and how to observe your emotions so that you can see clearly. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you know someone who has gone through this, STOP BEING INDIRECT TO THEM. STOP CODDLING US. Just tell us the fucking truth so that we don't have faith in you and act on your words. If you don't know what you are talking about, we can't explain that ""the stupid one told me to do that."" People who suffer from trauma need truth because life hasn't been seen for what it truly is yet but trauma victims. Not because they can't, but because we keep blaming the issue on mental disability."
442,It hurts to see the truth.,"I opened my eye at this morning to the fact that I’m a loser. I didn’t realize how bad it is.

In my major at school, literally no one cares about me. I have no friends. No one ever listens when I speak.

I realized that I talk to myself, mostly because no one ever listens and so there isn’t any point in speaking up.

It’s not that I’m dumb. It’s that just that *no one has any respect for me at all,* and even when I suggest a good idea that will help, no one will ever listen. And that’s just the way it is. No one ever listens.

I think I’m going to stop trying. If they won’t listen, I shouldn’t even try to help. They don’t deserve it. I will just watch them suffer and I will suffer along with them knowing there is literally nothing I can do to help.

All I want to do is help. That’s all I ever want to do. I want to use my skills to make the world a better place. But I can’t, because I don’t have the skills needed to use my skills.

I just wish I was still depressed. Because it didn’t hurt like this when I was depressed. Nothing mattered because “I’ll just kill myself anyways.” I was numb to everything.

It’s okay, though. I’m sure I’ll be depressed again in a couple weeks or months or so. That’s just how it goes with me."
443,Curious about Grounding Techniques,"I’ve only had three panic attacks in my life. The first one was over a year ago, but the last two were within the last week or so. I know a little bit about grounding/calming techniques, but not as much as I probably should. I was wondering what methods you guys seem to think work best for you."
444,I’m Struggling and I Have No Hope,"Struggling. Severely. Can’t sleep. Can’t self medicate because I’m trying to find a job. Can’t find a job because the prospect of a job makes me feel -darker-. No hobbies. No friends. Moved 16hrs away. Staying with grandparents. Mooching off grandparents. Intense guilt because of mooching off grandparents. No money. Barely scraping by on fiancés pay. No hope of moving forward or getting out of this rut. No mental health care without going into debt. Parents want to pay for it but parents are broke. Always been broke. Can’t let them go several thousands of $$ in debt each month for this. Can’t. 

I know the solution. To stop this hurt. 

Sadness. 
Anger.
Fear.
Trauma.
Anxiety.
No self esteem. 
Body hurts.
Exhausted.

Help me see the light. It’s so dark in here."
445,Does it count as a relapse even if the self harm wasn’t bad?,
446,Feeling really lost (F 27),"Hey all,

Sorry if this is long and rambling- Im not sure where to start on this, I guess lately Ive been feeling really empty. 

Recently I started a new job in a city 2 hours away from my home, I was very excited for this opportunity but I entered into a workplace that is predominately male. Because of this I have found it really hard to make connections, these guys are all bros and while they are polite I feel extremely isolated. 

I came from an office that really was more friendly and diverse..and I felt appreciated and supported so its really hard to walk into this dynamic, more than that I dont feel like Im making the positive impact I thought I would in my position.

I know a lot of the negative things i think my coworkers are thinking about me are probably based on my own thoughts and insecurities. Ive been there for 2 months and I literally go to work and go back to my apartment, its a beach town and i literally cannot  motivate myself to go watch a sunset even though Im 3 minutes from the beach. It all seems so useless without the people I love around me. 

I also have issues with drinking and smoking weed and Im really seeing i use it to quiet my mind. My mind is constanly racing, Im either trying to figure out what people are thinking of me or analyzing all of my actions and motivations and I just feel selfish for how self centric my thinking is. 

I lash out at my bf and lately cant even feel love for him..I feel like I love him when Im away and Im with him I almost feel disgusted. I just feel terrible. I feel like Im using him, I feel like a liar every time I say I love you. But Im just not sure if it is just my mental state thats making me feel this way. I feel.numb

My father recently passed, about 3 weeks ago and there was a lot that was unsaid, he was an alcoholic and very reclusive but always lived in our home. I am afraid I will turn out like him, just watching life go by and pushing people away. 

 In the past I used to hit myself pretty hard when I had a melt down, would threaten suicide and act recklessly; speeding down roads and opening my car door. 

Every time I leave home for work I cry, every time Im at work Im stressed, every time I come home I smoke and drink to soothe myself. I have always felt like I keep everyone at arms length, even my family. I sleep a lot these days because I dont really want to face reality or life. I was thinking about medication but I dont want to be dependent, any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.

My main issues: Negative self thinking, loud inner dialogue, anxiety especially in social situations, explosive and irrational anger (sober and especially when drunk), inability to maintain relationships, self medication."
447,I feel as though my sense of independence will end up driving me away from everyone.,"There have been times in the past where I would distance myself greatly from anyone who made ""you should"" or ""you need to"" statements. I'm 27 but I feel like I'm acting like an emotionally distant teenager or something. My wife starts MANY sentences throughout the day with these ""trigger phrases"", and I'm worried my need for (seemingly) never-ending space will rip my family apart. I know she does it out of caring, but I think maybe I feel like I'm acting like a teenager because I feel like I'm still living with my mom. I can't communicate this without her becoming irate, which I'm not very good at dealing with. Any suggestions?"
448,-tw- self harm and intrusive thoughts.,"Hey guys. I hadn’t self harmed in 3 or so months and I just relapsed. I’ve been having horrible intrusive thoughts such as murder, suicide, and other things that just aren’t right. The only way I can cope with these thoughts is self harm and cutting myself. I see a therapist and she knows about what I’ve been doing. I’m also on Zoloft. I just want to put an end to myself and have these thoughts all be over. I want to be happy again."
449,i feel so invalid because i have the perfect life,"i shouldnt be mentlaly ill. my parents are still together and for the most part care abt me, i have a few friends who care about me, i love comfortably and go to a private school, never been bullied, abused, or otherwise traumatized. 

yet, for some fucking reason, ive ended up like this. i fixate on people and become suicidal + completely self harm my legs when they dont pay attention to me. i distance myself from everyone who might care because im paranoid they truly dont like me and im doing them a favor by leaving. im in a state of constant static, feeling nothing but solidly low and solidly high. i hide myself because im afraid of judgement. i dont even know who i am.

i just feel like im not allowed to feel this way and do things like cut myself, bevause i have no reaskn to. and i feel like im just using up care that could go to people who actually need it, who have been traumatized. 

is it possible to have a bad mental illness like i most likely do without a history of trauma or damaging events?"
450,Why do I question my sexuality if I'm never going to have sex?,"At this rate I'm going to live in my parents basement until I die. I'm 17 I dropped out of school, don't have any hobbies, don't have a job or a driving license, so what does it even matter if I'm straight or gay."
451,I am so done with feelings,"I am falling for this girl really fucking hard but I know that I can never have her, when we had a slow dance on Saturday night the whole world stood still, now all i can do is drink till I'm numb and try not to think about it. Back to my usual way to cope I guess..."
452,Need a place to vent.,"Howdy folks, I am a twenty five year old male from canada. I have always struggled with mental illness. But over the last several years I have noticed it start going down hill rapidly.

Growing up I was diagnosed with adhd and a learning disability(somthing to do with fine motorskills). I was relentlessly bullied and made to feel inferior by my peers throughout my tenure in school. I was called a spaz and re***d. As well as physically bullied. I remember in grade school  a group of kids stole one of my shoes and started playing monkey in the middle with it as I ran back and forth frantically trying to get it back. I ended up lashing out and was punished for it. In grade seven I went to a special private school for learning disabled kids where I thrived I made friends and became popular. Heck I even formed the student council which is still going on there. 

But after graduating grade eight I went back to public school and was once again bullied. One of the most noteable instances was where a guy set my beared on fire. I felt awkward and out of place and never really fit in. I would walk around on my breaks alone every day for the first three years.

In my senior year I started becoming severely depressed and could never seem to find anything to look forward too. Even when I had things to be excited about it didnt seem worth the effort. At seventeen near the end of my senior year I had fallen in with the wrong crowed in an attempt to have friends. I would hangout on the streets with the ""street kids"" and various other homeless people. One day I was hanging out with some of the kids from that group who werent street kids. 

They were my group of gay friends.. well at least I thought they were friends. We hung out in the dorm room at a local college of one of the guys boyfriends. Everyone but me had been either drinking or getting high. I decided to go out for a walk with one of them while he had a smoke. We chatted while he smoked then went back to the room. I sat down on the bed and everyone all of a sudden went quiet.

 Next thing I knew each of my arms was grabbed and I was pinned down laying face up on the bed while one of the boys started trying to undo my pants. While this was happening another of the boys started undoing his own pants. I kicked and struggled but they wouldnt let go. Luckily I was saved that day when a fire alarm went off and we were forced to evacuate the building. I have never been comfortable calling this sexual assault as they only managed to undo my pants and pull them down a bit. And to me it would be disrespectful to people who actually were violated.

I felt powerless at that moment. But for me the worst part happened the next day at school. When one of the guys involved started mocking me about it saying stuff like u/yaarimaspacepirate is gay hahahah!. I felt emberassed, humilisted and upset And cut ties with that group of ""friends"".

Moving forward a bit I had graduated highschool and fell into some more risky behaviours. Not wanting to feel weak and having a constant feeling of needing to prove somthing I got into security work and powerlifting.

I felt like I needed to toughen up and I went about it the only way I could think of. Now if you are wondering how powerlifting could be risky behavior. Its because I have a congenital heart defect infact I am going for heart surgery in the next couple months.

The security work wasnt so much risky behavior but some of the things I dealt with on the job over the years led to a substance abuse issue with alcohol and drugs.

Most of the issues from my job stemmed when I started at a hospital many calls I got sent on were high stress. Be it restraining a crack head. Or standing by while a mother and child flatlined during an emergency pregnancy incase the father went berserk. I saw and dealt with alot of things that drove me to the edge regularly. Then one day I had a call I went on where I came in contact with HIV and even though I was clean the incident that ensued around it traumatized me to the point where I didnt sleep for a month. 

Needless to say by the time I left the hospital I had started developing some unhealthy eating habits and gained alot if weight. As well as a drinking problem. I genuinely hate the taste of alcohol but the feeling of being drunk and forgetting seemed to solve all my problems at the time. I realize now I was wrong. After a year or so since I had left the hospital I began working as a bouncer. 

That was a stressful job as well and it was at that point my drug habit started. I began habitually using marijuana everyday all day. I would show up to work high and light up the second I left. This just got worse as time went on and stress built up. 

This particular year had been really hard on me as I had been struggling with coming out of the closet. It was also around this time I realized I was struggling with intimacy. Right after coming out I met a guy while I was working. He came over one day and we were snuggling on the couch watching familyguy on tv. 

All of a sudden as I was holding this guy in my arms he started laughing really hard. My body tensed up and for a moment I was back in the hospital emergency room restraining a crack head it scared me shitless and I panicked. I havent been able to be intimate since.

 Eventually I left my regular bar gig after my employer tried to have me break the law for them. I told him I wouldnt. I wasnt in the mood to put my saftey on the line for a place that I was getting assaulted at for minimum wage(two weeks in a row prior I had been assaulted on the job). It gave me a real perspective on my life as far as how I had fallen. After I left the bar I became even more depressed I started having suicidal thoughts and feeling worthless.  

I never admitted it to anyone because I was scared. I had experienced the mental health system while working in a hospital and didnt want to be like all the people I had to go on calls for over the years when I worked there. So I told myself to buck up and push onwards. My use of drugs and alcohol increased as this happened and I moved onto trying other substances. Things like tobacco for poppers and abusing adhd meds to get high when I had no weed(went through an entire bottle one day and could have died).

 For a while I had no job and lived in fear of becoming homeless. I had panic attacks everyday there were times I went hungry for three or four days at a time. But finally I landed another job in security and then worked everyday to get some money. I took as many shifts as I could and eventually it paid off I landed a regular overnight job(I ended up working seven days a week in the long run here due to staff shortages). And at this point my abuse of drugs and alcohol was in full swing. 

It started off slow I would smoke a vape pen on weekend shifts to get stoned. Then one night I was offered a one night personal contract for a bar job.
This was literally one of the worst nights of my life. A guy overdosed at a rave happening in the bar and I had to try and keep him alive until ems arrived. 

He was still breathing but it was incredibly shallow. 
So aside from moving him off the dance floor to lay him out safely, put him in recovery and administer narcan that the bar had on hand. And was trained to use. There wasnt much I could do. Sometimes I can still picture his face in my head. And the memories of that night randomly pop into my mind. When they do I get super quiet and distant. I was told he lived but it was genuinely one of the most harrowing experiences I ever dealt with. After this night my substance abuse really kicked off. I was drunk and stoned all day everyday even at work.

 It was also during this time that almost all if my friends dropped contact with me. I was incredibly hurt by them doing so and at the time felt betrayed.  After all I was struggling and suffering and I felt they abandond me. However I realize now they did it because they have to look after themselves first. My problems arent their problems and they did all they could.

I tried going to therapy during this time as well but it didnt help. I didnt want to help myself so how could I expect anyone to be able to help me. Not long after this I got a new job as supervisor closer to my family and moved. During my time in the place I moved to I started feeling increasingly more lonely. I was constantly worried I would be kicked out and lose my job.

Due to this I began drinking and popping one hundred mg edibles everynight. Id usually go through about three one hundred mg tablets and a bottle of wine a night. My life was spiraling out of control and I was giving up my will to live. I was a mess. 

Then it happened I was given notice to move out because I couldnt keep my shit together my room was a dump my life was a mess. I didnt want to be homeless and I was terrified. However thankfully I still had a job so I moved home.

From the get go since I got back it wasnt easy. I managed to stop the drugs for a bit but fell right back into using. As well as drinking. One night I came home from work and found all the empty liquor bottles I had gone through on the counter of the kitchen. I was forced to confront my drinking. That was almost six months ago. For months after I continued to smoke weed. But evantually That to stopped. It wasnt so hard when I was told I needed heart surgery.

It hasnt been easy. But since I moved home I have started saving in an investments account and have saved up for an ebike to get to work. I went back to school to finally finish somthing and I am excelling with online learning. I dropped out of college two times previously first was due to lack of motivation and the second was due to the substance abuse. And with the help of my dad whos a recovering alcoholic, my mom whos incredibly patient and my cat jag who comforts me by nuzzling my arm and head when I am anxious im getting through this. On top of this I have also lost a lot of weight I was two hundred and nintey lbs I am now down to two fourty six lbs(and dropping).

My job is going awsome and I am starting to feel some hope for the future. Mostly now I just worry about my upcoming aortic valve surgery and if I will somehow be the one-two percent exception who doesnt survive. None of the doctors are worried not my gp or my surgeon. But im still abit scared. However with the help of my friend at work. An older gentleman who had heart surgery last year I am learning to accept that I will most likely be okay.

Anyways sorry its a long post I just needed to vent and this seemed like a good place to unload."
453,A paradox,Right now I’m afraid to do something that in particular will better my life because of fear/discomfort and fear of panic surrounding the situation. How do I convince myself to tackle this scenario?
454,Night shifts ruining my mental health?,"Hey there, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but hey ho.

I'm going through a rough patch at the moment, a very tough patch. Without going into depth it's an old sexual assault case being resurfaced and doing through the courts.

I'm only young, 18 and wanting to push my career so am starting university in September. I decided to work at my local fuel station on the nightshifts for some good paying money.

I'm starting to see things in the corners of my eyes, things running past the windows at work, normal objects as figures, hearing strange noises that I am DEFINTE are at my night pay window but no one is there, voices, knocking on the window or cars pulling up.

I'm not a delusional person, always level headed and relatively calm. Even this whole situation hasn't broken me down too much.

Most of these could usually be put off, but I live in a tiny village where I would usually get possibly 10 customers a night in an 8 hour shift. I can easily go 5 hours without seeing someone and having only Netflix and cleaning to keep me occupied.

This is doubled with college so while I am tired most of the time, I wouldnt say this is out of the norm. I am used to going without sleep most nights from my younger years.

Im just really confused and wondering if anyone has any ideas, any experiences in the matter or advice. I dont want this to be a regular occurrence, it's really freaking me out."
455,"The bliss or ignorance, or the fear of the unknown.",
456,Help,My boyfriend has had a history with mental health and  cutting but he has told me that he tells me when he has cut.. I being the understanding one that used to cut but no longer does talks to him and not scolds him. I’m really afraid he is really going to hurt himself soon and I don’t know what to do. I’ve talked to him saying that I can’t “make him” go see a doctor or a professional to talk to.. he told me today that he has never been happy and the last time he was happy was 15 years ago. He has “highs” where he is happy in the moment and then nothing. What should I do?...
457,He left me.,My boyfriend left me. that's 8h ago now. i can't sleep. Everytime I close my eyes and dont have a distraction i start crying. I don't know how to handle this. I don't want to loose him. I want to hold him. Be with him. I don't know if I can handle this. We go to school together. Ill stay home the first week but what will happen after that. I don't know what to do. I miss him so much...
458,Identity Compromised &amp; Resuming Training,"Closing up here on this account, it's been compromised.  There are more conventional ways of contacting and interacting with people than metaphysically and psychopathically.  This has happened on a few different accounts online.  I do not understand why someone just can't approach someone with beer, tea or coffee.  I'm not all about the metaphysics in trying to communicate with people.  I haven't got much left to go on about, this account is compromised.  I was going on about the meta and paranormal stuff.  I'm not trying to make to many assumptions on religious matters.  There are scholars and diplomats about it and I was constantly scorned for sharing my visions and people kept calling blasphemy on me.  SO it wasn't only cultists, fanatics and Daemons that wanted to crucify and torch me, it was the pagans, atheists and conglomerate organizations of Mankind.  

So I have decided to relent on all that for the time being, maybe 20 years or so of studying and I'll be on level, these people were trying to make me look like a cunt.   Not all the politics about religion is there though, like separation of Church and State, the Nobility, Aristocracy and former caste system.  These are things I rarely see mentioned when people talk about religion. 

I am not a degenerate or paranoid schizophrenic.  I wasn't a real by the book or complete doctrine person. I have seen things in my mind and I share them, sometimes they turn out to be true, sometimes immediately.  I do not know how to explain the phenomenon, some just consider it coincidence.  The more deep and open I tried to get the more compromising and alienated I became.  I was completely unaware of the overwhelming stigma's that had come regarding paranormal and religious things.  So I looked like a bit of a loony to some folks.  I had mentioned slavery and forgot to mention organized marriage as well is still going on.

  Amid people out there trying to compromise me, I would bug out on occasion, then go back into my shell.  I get psyched out and ready to exploit myself or I back out.  Back and forth, I was trying to re-enlist for a time, compromising my identity and all this wasn't the biggest issue.  It was just a pain in the ass and all, these people were trying to make me look like a cunt.  You got these kids in the military now running around with their camera's, filming little documentaries about their 4 year enlistment. 
 I don't have an ego like that, nor did I know anyone like that.  There was none of these soldiers documenting nothing in my day, I barely have any pictures.  Anytime I even mention the service we got some crazed E8 coming out of the bushes.  I even get on the forum telling these kids like, opsec, you should clear that with the mods before posting, they tell me to stop because they want to make asses of these people and the military.  I do not understand how the military hasn't gone back to privatizing the organization.  

I was becoming more exhausted with people animosity in personal experiences.  People wanted to fight, some assees had been whipped besides mine. They wanted me to fight, I'm not entertaining these god damn animals.  Then they thought I was having an identity crisis, I thought I was John Cena.  I was joking about having an identity crisis, I'm not John Cena or John Wick.  But, I need at least 6 months of training and would gladly make me wrestlin debut being put in a wheel chair by John Cena, why wouldn't I take it up?  Just kidding, I don't think paralyses and more TBI's is worth entertaining these god damn animals - should I be propositioned for the Kumite.  I shall train in the mean time.  People wanted John to fight me, we could never be best friends.  I do not even watch these films or wrestling by the way.  However, they're amazing peoples in this nightmare world and do a lot of charities, they're really good people.  

I was out of the gym for a few months now, stress, injuries, sick - something.  I usually fast, east about 2000 calories a day, fast regularly.  I just did a light work out, 20 mins cardio, light full body workout, in pain today.  I figured I would be but I also went into a feeding frenzy.  That's what happened last time, so I'de been feasting like a King the last two days.  I crashed and went into a feeding frenzy last time.  I enjoy exercise, it makes me happy, I suggest diet and exercise to you all as it is therapeutic and the best medicine.

Some things I had to realize were I'm a great and good morally compassed person.  I'm not to worried about compensating.  But, there were some people out there, some fucked up people, soilin my rep.  I would hate to get stole and some bullshit story  spoiling my legacy transpired, which has happened to a lot of people throughout history.  Not that I'm anyone in this world, it's just a crime and injustice.  Conspiracy which I had also mentioned, erasing people, evidence and history.



I'll work on re-collecting myself and think of what to do.




Cheers"
459,Video games are my life,"I am dictated by my computer. No matter what activity I try, I am never fulfilled or entertained as much as I am after playing video games. This addiction is worse than any shitty trailer park drug you could find, I'd honestly rather be hooked on black tar heroin rather than video games. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that maybe one day I'll find something that fulfills me, like a good job or a family. However, growing up on video games has pretty obviously limited my charisma and social skills. Eventually, that hope is gonna run dry. Hopefully that day never comes, because I'd probably just neck myself. Don't let your kids play video games, because I will probably not live past my late twenties if I'm being honest."

Some background: I was diagnosed with PTSD and general depression in 2014 after being admitted for suicidal thoughts. The depression was from, as far as I can tell, losing my younger brother when I was 3 years old. Then it only got worse as I grew up, through nearly daily domestic violence between my mother and her husband. (parents never married, shared custody) 

The PTSD is a combination of two separate events, the first being a car accident when I was 10, was literal inches from being crushed by twisted metal. The accident lead my mother to become hooked on opioid pain killers, which lead to the second event: my mom's boyfriend in 2011 was physically abusing her, and I attempted to stop him, he nearly killed me that night. When I told my mom to get rid of the guy or lose me, she chose him for sex and drugs over me. 

I went on to do well in high school, but right before enrolling in college, she became sick from the drugs she kept taking after I left her to live with my dad (she made me constantly feel as though her decline was my fault) I tried to fight through the depression that sent me through, but it eventually lead to a suicide attempt.

I dropped out, and after a few months of nothing, I got help. From Summer 2014 - August 2015, I was making progress, got a job, counseling, and other support networks. But then I got the call, while I was at work, that my mom had died of an OD. I got sent into a spiral. By this time, I was living with a co-worker, my dad had moved 300 miles away. So I was alone.
 My cousin came in and had me live with him for the following 4 years, but we clashed a lot, too, due to my triggers. I had started thinking of ending it, because my job was screwing with my health, physically and mentally, and my cousin wasn't the best roommate, either. I quit my job, and then he and I got into another big fight. It became clear we could no longer live together.

My dad has allowed me to come back to him, and it's been a few months now, and I have kinda just stagnated. I guess, what I'm saying is, I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing now, and it becomes so daunting to even consider what I need to do. 


TL;DR: PTSD from domestic violence and the death of my mother are catching back up to me, and it's getting harder to fight without help from family and friends. Seeking moral support, if anything."
461,How do I persuade someone with depression to take action?,"Obviously with a mental illness like depression, one's brain doesn't work properly so simple logical reasoning is extremely difficult to use unless one's analysis level is at the level of a World Debate champion or something. For instance, someone might say that ""done so much wrong already"" and that it's ""too late to change"" so they'll just continue doing bad things because they believe that they're a bad person. Obviously that's not true because people always change (be it physically through growth or mentally through hormones or even in what you want to do). That should be common sense for most people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really just don't understand how to convince someone with depression that the assumptions they make about the world and the people around them aren't true. It's very frustrating for me and it leaves me feeling so damn powerless knowing that my words are cries on deaf ears. I can't understand them and they can't understand me. I want to help those around me but what I'm doing isn't working. How can I help?"

When it comes to doing something wrong behind my girlfriends back. It could be cheating or just simply messaging a girl. Both bad I know but both equally eat me up, keep me up at night. To the point of no sleep, no eating and admissions of guilt. This effects my mental health more than it probably should and causes me to be lower when I’m already at a low.

Looking for genuine advice on my health, not my relationship."
466,First day of partial program tomorrow,"I'm copying this post from r/anxiety to here to get more responses.


I didn't really know which subreddit to post this in, I just need to open up about this a little bit.

Tommorow, I'm going to attend my first day at a partial hospitalization Program that is 7/8 hours a day. I'm doing this because my therapist believes it will really help me, and I trust her judgement. This will last at least two weeks, or until I feel like I can improve how I feel.

I am diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), and ADHD-C (Hyperactive and Inattentive).

I know deep down that this is the right thing to do, it's just I'm a college student and I have always had high standards for myself regarding academic achievement and not giving up. Doing this program means I am probably withdrawing and costing my parents money for financial aid even though I've only done about a month this semester.

I really suffered through my first semester with panic attacks, constantly feeling depressed, worthless, self hating etc, daily intrusive thoughts and feelings that would stop me from doing basic things ( like I wouldn't go to the bathroom if someone else was in it), and I could never focus on my work and it really got to me. I secluded myself because I lived on campus and it really took a toll on me.

I also had a few instances of self harm during high school, and had a breakup over a year and a half ago that destroyed me. I lost my best friend who was also my gf at the time, along with the group of friends I saw every day for years that still chill with her. 

I recently relapsed with self harm, and the trigger was news that I got that my ex is dating someone who I know is deep into drugs, a bad student and other things. I feel as though I've gotten over her as a gf, but I still haven't gotten over the loss of a person who I've had the upmost respect for and who I've connected with in every way. I've have not felt this connection (romantically or in a friendship) since.

I keep losing track of my thoughts as I am writing this, so it may sound unorganized and frantic.

I've been on countless medications to try and help me with my anxiety, depression and ADHD, but apparently I'm one of a very low percentage of people who react adversely to medication. These meds have all taken their tolls on my mental health and my hope that things will get better. 

This program that I am going in is stopping me from completing this semester, and school was my only ""job"" and only large responsibility. I feel as though I'm failing myself and my family, and I just want to be like the people who can function and push past their problems. I had no trouble completing high school, and it was very easy for me to pass without much effort and basically no studying. This caused me to have no study skills and I was not prepared for the college workload, especially when I got worse during and after my senior year of high school directly after my breakup.

I again lost my train of thought even though I feel I have so much to write about.

Basically, I'm seeing a therapist weekly, tried tons of different medications, and I'm really trying to be better but I keep letting myself and my family down. 

Also, I smoke weed regularly because it is the only medication that has had long-term beneficial effects on me. Recently, I was caught with product and a piece and charged with two misdemeanors, and this is going to cost my family hundreds of dollars in court fees and I probably will have to complete some program for my sentence. I have stopped smoking because I am afraid of a drug test from the law, and this has caused me to have vivid dreams every night. I used to dream about my ex and times that we used to have, but now the dreams feel like times that haven't happened and I don't feel anything towards her in these dreams. They're just innocent and friendly interactions like when we were just friends. These are taking a toll on me because I remember everything when I wake up. 

I've also had another really good friend move away last year, and my current best friend was kicked out of his house and lived with us for a while, and just moved out of state two days ago. My other friend just had a child with someone at a young age, so I haven't been able to see him. I have nobody else.

My thoughts are racing again and I cannot focus on what I want to write so I'm going to end this here, I'm basically looking for validation that this program is what I need, and that it's ok that I'm stopping school to focus on myself and my mental health.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have good fortune and happiness."
467,I don’t want to commit suicide but I can’t stop fantasising over it in my head. I’m confused. (M/19/UK),"My father committed suicide when I was 8 years old and I found his body. Since then I have battled with PTSD and depression in varying levels of intensity. 

Things reached their worse when I broke up with my girlfriend around December 2018. I found myself in a downhill spiral where I was self harming, drinking, chain smoking and working 60 hours a week in a job that I hated and I attempted suicide around 6-7 times.

Eventually I was able to get my life in order a little bit, I got back with my girlfriend and moved 153 miles away from home with her and out of my family home for the first time. I have a job I love and me and my girlfriend almost never argue and I’ve started regularly going to the gym and creating music as an outlet for any emotions I may have and all m symptoms of depression and anxiety were non-existent.

This had all been going super well until about 2-3 weeks ago when I suddenly found myself only able to get 3-4 hours of sleep a night if I was lucky, whilst some days I would be awake all through the night and miss a whole nights worth of sleep. Now I find myself panicking around crowds and social interaction for the first time in forever. I’ve started using CBD oil on suggestion from some friends and relatives but I don’t know if it’s making a difference. 

I don’t think I want to kill myself but if I’m being really honest. I just don’t know. I guess I’m just confused and I just don’t really know what to do. I feel like I’m numb and the good and bad moments are almost impossible to tell apart these days."
468,I [25m] can't stop with their awful feelings.,"I am 25 years old and ive been drifting in my life since I was about 16. I dropped out of HS after the first year and not due to bad grades or lack of knowledge, I was a solid 85 student. I suffered from separation anxiety since I was around 6 years old and my mother got in a car accident the first day of kindergarten and didn't come to pick me up like she promised. My anxiety over it got so bad they had to keep me home until 1st grade started. I had a few therapist meetings as a kid after that incident to get me diagnosed with it but that all that was covered

&amp;#x200B;

I am now 25 and I haven't even held a job or went back to school. The thought of both scares me to death. I can't afford a therapist and I'm absolutely petrified of my future. I feel I could do something great but have no idea if I can get the courage to go and do it. I usually can be cheery and happy during the day but as the night creeps in and I'm left on my own I break down. I cry nearly every night and I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just so mentally tired and I don't know what to do. I only have one good friend in my life and shes been my absolute lifeline but I feel its so unfair to lay the burden if my metal well being on her. I feel like a failure and I know I am, I'd love for once to be truly happy and make my family proud of me. First time I've posted here and just didn't want to keep this in anymore.

470,Is there something wrong? Or is this common?,"     I have always felt this constant dull feeling. It's been a feeling that's been with me since I was a kid. The best way to describe it is a grey feeling, not happy and not overly upset. It had been around for such a long time, and I'm sick of it. When I watch other people laugh around me it makes me jealous because I can't remember the last time I laughed and it was genuine. My emotions don't feel real and i sometimes don't think they are. I can't ever find interest in anything, and I've tried everything like drawing, running, 5 different sports, singing, jobs, TV shows, reading, video games, trying hard in academics, going to parties, and every kind of friend group. And yet nothing has ever been able to make me interested. When I date, I date hoping that the person will be able to make me interested in something, and it works for about a week, but that's about it.
 I don't know if there's something wrong with me, or if I'm just feeling something that everyone else feels. I'm going to counseling right now, but I feel like openly expressing this to someone face to face  is a lot harder than anonymously posting on Reddit. And I don't want to sound spoiled because I really do have it easy, but I just can't get out of this constant boredom."
471,I deleted my Instagram account,"Hi, I'm 21 female. To day I deleted my Instagram account. I suffer from mild depression and anxiety. My therapist suggested that I should log off for a good while because it was giving me alot of anxiety but instead I did the opposite of permanently deleting my account until I'm ready to come back which wouldn't be for a really long while till I'm ready because right now I'm just not in the right mental state right now but I still have Facebook, snapchat and Twitter which doesn't bother me I really don't mind, it's just that Instagram was getting to me the most and ever since I deleted my Instagram account a weight has been lifted off my back and I just feel really good right now. I'm much happier with taking picture with my Polaroid than documenting my travels on Instagram. I use Facebook as away in keeping contact with family members who I don't have their number, and snapchat I rarely use but I do post  once in a blue moon but I  have a other group chat mainly to plan on hanging out or wanting to hangout. And reddit I use for memes to send to my to group chat."
472,Sometimes I wonder if the abuse was in my head,"Every single day, after class, I would sit on the bed in my dorm room and

attempt to do my homework. It was hard to focus. I would start to get anxious

because I knew that being alone in my room meant one of two things; that he would

be coming over soon or that he was mad at me. I don’t know which one terrified me

more. 

It was my first semester of college, and I was supposed to be having the

adventure of a lifetime. I was studying abroad, as a first semester freshman: a

challenge only about four percent of American college students take on. While I had

my whole life and endless possibilities in front of me, sometimes I struggled because

it felt like I lost everything. I grew up on the same street as my entire family. I went to

a high school that fostered the growth of community. My nearly three-year-long

relationship ended days before I hopped on the transatlantic flight to Europe.

No matter where you go to college, in America or abroad, the first few weeks

are all about meeting people. I introduced myself to many people and I befriended

my roommates, a couple of girls from orientation, and my neighbors. 

He lived in the apartment next door: room 104. We had some mutual friends

who introduced us, and from the moment I met him, I found him ignorant and

insulting. He told me that studying abroad for your first semester was a waste of time.

He talked about how he got exceptionally high SAT scores. He went on and on about

how he got into Cornell, but in spite of all of his bragging and criticism, the fact was

that we had ended up in the same place.

At the end of our conversation I figured I would never have to see him again,

but before I left, he asked, “hey, can I have your snapchat? You know, just in case

we never see each other again.”

Reluctantly I gave it to him. I mean, what was the harm in giving a neighbor

my snapchat? In fact, it made me feel wanted: a feeling I had been craving since my

break-up. 

He started snapchatting me constantly. I had never been one to keep up

snapchat streaks or even use snapchat as a primary method of communication, but

his messages were frequent. 

My first few weeks in Rome were filled with small adventures. I adjusted to the

culture, the food, my new surroundings, and my newfound freedoms.

On one particular alcohol-filled evening, I received a message from him saying

“are you drunk?” and I, oblivious, replied, “yeah”. Within seconds he responded, “can

I come over?” 

This was my very first red flag, and while his comment definitely sobered me

up and spooked me, I ignored it and decided to move on. My closest friends told me

to stay away from him. They had valid points, but I didn’t listen. Looking back, I

should have done something then. There was a thought in the back of my head

saying that I should report him or at least confront him, but I did nothing. 

The second red flag was when he started sending me pornographic videos

and sexual memes. This sign was much more vibrant.

I walked into my apartment asking, “What is the actual definition of sexual

harassment?” and of course, with this kind of question, my roommates begged for a

reason as to why I was pondering on this. My roommates, being much more

outspoken, talked to him and when confronted, he chalked it all off to be some sort of

joke that I was too immature to understand. This was the first time he belittled me

and humiliated me in front of my peers. Still, I did nothing.

Every day after my classes I would wait. He would either be sitting in my bed,

waiting for me to get home, or would walk into my room. I never argued with him

about being there, but I never invited him over. I was scared to tell him to leave

because I did not want to face rejection again. I appreciated the attention, and

although I never asked for it or implied that I wanted it, I didn’t push him away. 

Things escalated quickly. I can remember exactly where the physical part of

the relationship started. It began on the night the Red Sox won the World Series. I

stayed awake to watch the game even though my time zone was six hours ahead,

and he stayed up with me. I fell asleep on the couch, and even though I had told him

countless times I did not want a relationship or hookup, once I fell asleep, he kissed

me. 

I can see how he may have seen this as a romantic gesture, but the next day,

the boys from the room next door started asking me about it. 

“So, we heard that you guys kissed.”

I explained the situation, and when I told my friends, they found it as creepy as

I did. I knew it was wrong, but I just wanted to pretend it didn\&amp;#39;t happen. I had

expressed plenty of times that I still did not want a relationship, and I thought he

understood that. He should have understood that.

After the unconscious kiss, he started to physically take advantage of me

more and more. Seeing how I did nothing when he targeted me emotionally, and not

confronting him when he was doing something physically, as small as it was, he

encroached more and more into my comfort zone. 

He started kissing me more frequently, but only when I was drunk. At this point

in the semester, I was in the guilt phase of grief, and as a coping mechanism, I was

going out to the bars several times a week. Whenever I would go out to drink, I would

come home and he would be waiting there, in the apartment, either talking to my

roommates or waiting on my bed. He started to put them under a spell, and they

began encouraging us to be together. I can still remember them winking at me and

leaving the room, leaving him and I together. I remember trying to communicate the

dread with my eyes and hoping they would help me.

One time, I was lying in my bed, head spinning because I had pushed my

alcohol limits, and I remember him standing in my doorway. I slightly opened my

eyes and saw the shadow of the closing door. I didn’t realize he was actually in the

room until he started climbing on top of me. I was barely conscious, but he was

kissing me, grabbing me. He whispered in my ear, “we should do this again when

you’re sober.” 

Many times, I told him I wasn’t interested, and then when I was drunk, we

would make out again and things would get confusing. I tried giving the excuse that I

had not moved on from my last boyfriend, which was true, but he never seemed to

care. Multiple times I tried to end it, whatever IT was, but he would always come

back, sitting in my room, refusing to take no for an answer.

This should have been my warning sign, foreshadowing the things that were to

come if I didn’t put an end to it. This should have put me over the edge. I should have

seen how the word “no” did not register in his mind. If I could go back in time, I would

shake myself and scream, “Snap out of it!” 

Even though I knew that everything happening was wrong, and he was awful

for me, I still did not want to have those lonely feelings that come in the period of time

after a break-up, so I did nothing. In that moment, I figured that being loved by a

selfish, hateful, pathological liar was better than not being loved at all. I gave him that

consent: the consent to love me. 

I think that is the true danger of being in love. Once you fall in love once, you

are addicted. You crave the feeling of being held, sought, or wanted. You want

someone to want you. Even when you don’t want them back, it is hard to tell them

no, because you are grasping on to those old feelings of being in love and being

loved. 

Little did I know, that this feeling, the feeling of running from grief, was only

delaying my true pain for later.

Another big “red flag moment”, as I am now going to call them, was the first

time he ever made me touch him. He was lying in my bed, even after I had

repeatedly asked him not to. The thing about him, if you had not picked up on it

already, is that he is a pathological liar. He ropes you in, sharing something personal

or making you feel like your opinion mattered and would be accepted. Then, he

would either be a hypocrite and do the opposite of what you asked, or he would

manipulate your words. As many times as I had asked him to get out of my bed, he

would make me feel guilty about it. In the end, I didn’t want to fight, so I would just

give in and let him stay. Anyways, as I was leaving, and he jumped up and held me

back. 

“You can’t leave until you finish me.” 

At first, I thought he was joking, so I laughed and reached for the door handle,

but he pulled me back. 

“I’m not joking.”

I have loads of stories, many similar to the previous one, that send shivers up

my spine every time I tell them or think about them. But the one story that will always

stand out to me is when we went to Paris.

Because of recent political turmoil in France, my parents didn’t want me going

to Paris by myself, so I started looking for someone, anyone, to go with me. The only

person available on such short notice was him. So, we booked our trip and even

though I had expressed that this was not a romantic trip at all, we flew into the City of

Love. 

Things were going great up until dinner. I have not mentioned this yet, but he

doesn’t drink. I’m not saying this in a critical way, I’m just saying this to highlight my

feelings of surprise when he ordered us a bottle of nice Chardonnay at dinner. We

each had a glass and after he had finished his, he announced to me that he did not

like wine, and since the bottle couldn’t be taken to-go, I should drink as much of it as

I could. I did not finish the entire bottle, but for a lightweight, I did drink a large portion

of it, and started feeling the effects on the drive back to the hostel.

In my woozy state, he guided me into the elevator. I was certain he was taking

me back to our room that we were sharing with two other strangers, but suddenly we

were on the abandoned rooftop floor, and I was being pushed against the wall. He

was kissing me, grabbing me, hurting me, and I was confused. The room was dizzy,

and my eyes searched to find one thing to focus on. My brain was not processing

what was happening. I started moving my arms, waving, hoping someone could see. 

I am a strong girl, physically, and I would like to say emotionally- though after

reading this story you may not believe I am the latter- but in my drunk state, I could

not find the strength to fight, so my body shut down.

“No,” I said, but he kept going. He had me pinned. This was the moment that

the whole semester had accumulated into. Everything that had happened between

him and I before this had led to this moment, here, on the rooftop of the

hostel in Paris, France. I had done nothing to stop him previously, and now it was too

late. 

I had done nothing before. We always here the phrase, fight or flight. In reality,

we either fight, flight, or freeze. My body knew I couldn’t fight him off, I couldn’t run,

so I froze. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t see, I lacked all control. I felt nothing as his

body pushed on mine.

It feels like you’re nothing.

The next morning, I wouldn’t, I couldn’t, make eye contact with him. He asked

me if I remembered anything from the previous night.

“No, I had too much wine and blacked out.”

“That’s a shame; we had a really nice conversation.”

Months later, when we got back to Boston, we grew distant. There was one

final encounter where I yelled at him, but not for the reasons you might be thinking.

No, I did not yell at him for the sexual harassment messages and photos he had sent

me earlier last semester or taking advantage of my vulnerability when I was drunk. I

did not even yell at him for the incident in Paris.

I yelled at him because he had stopped being my friend. All along, this is what

I had wanted from him: to be someone to lean on. When he realized that this was all I

wanted, and that he couldn’t force his way onto me forever, he left. 

All of the fears I had been running from, the fear of rejection, of not being

loved, of being alone, were all rushing in on me. This was the moment I realized how

huge of a mistake I had made. I tried to dodge the grieving process by letting this

man take advantage of me in my vulnerable state, and now I was feeling all of the

natural emotions in an elevated platform.

Once we had separated, and I had actually distanced myself from him, that is

when the aftershock started to kick in. It began with the panic attacks. There were

always triggers. They would mostly happen while I was alone in my room, but

sometimes it would happen in the most inconvenient locations.

It happened in the silent section of the library, when I saw one of his friends

from home who also goes to our school. I had another episode when I was

refereeing a volleyball match and the player looked just like him. How embarrassing it

is to have a panic attack on my first day of my new refereeing job and have to lie to

my new coworkers, saying that my panic attack, which symptoms include sweating

and shortness of breath, was just an asthma attack. 

After the panic attacks started happening, I started getting nightmares. I kept

having dreams that I was back on that abandoned rooftop floor in Paris. In my

dreams, there was always a dizzy perspective and they always included me trying to

get eye contact with the video camera. In some dreams I was paralyzed, trying to

push back. Sometimes I would try to scream but have no voice. All of the dreams

varied, but one thing was always certain- I couldn’t break free. 

Another time I had a dream that I was lying on my old dorm room bed, and he

was on top of me. I would try to wrestle him off, but I was pinned. When I would wake

up, I always found myself in a sweat, tangled in my sheets.

I booked an appointment with the University Health and Counseling Services.

The closest appointment they had was in three weeks, so I scheduled it and waited

while my panic attacks and nightmares persisted. Hours before my appointment with

a counselor, they called me saying they would have to reschedule until next week, so

I waited again. 

When I finally did get to meet with a counselor, I was excited to finally be able

to have a full hour to talk with someone about everything. I was hopeful that I would

receive coping mechanisms to try on my own. I sat down in the comfy chair in the

counselor’s office and she handed me a clipboard. 

“Sign this please, to prove you were here.” 

I signed the paper, and then I began my story. As I told the woman about

everything that had been happening to me, the events, the panic attacks, the restless

nights, the terrifying dreams, she interrupted me. 

“But wouldn’t you say that all of this happened because you chose it?”

“No, I mean, I guess, but-”

“You’re looking at things from your point of view. You chose to engage

with him. You chose to go to Paris. You chose to let him into your life. You can’t

blame him.”

I was confused. I hadn’t even been in the room for ten minutes and I already

felt belittled. I was being put back into the box that he had put me in. I was being

blamed. In this counselor’s eyes, I was the villain of my own story. To her, I allowed

all of this to happen. To her, I was overreacting, and this was all my fault. To her, and

to the rest of the world, this all happened because I did nothing. 

Growing up, I always thought of myself as a strong woman, and even now,

after all of this, I still believe that. We are always told that sexual assaults happen to

girls who walk down dark alleys or wear revealing clothing. We are always taught that

sexual assaults are violent and are done by people we don’t know. 

The truth is, for a time I did care about him. After the breakup I went through

before I left for Italy, I actually thought that if I ever wanted to have someone love me

again, this was the price I was going to have to pay."

Add onto the fact that my fear of burdening others with my issues actually came true when I finally tried to talk with a person I saw as my friend and well...I'm not the biggest fan of it anymore.  


Trying to get a therapist worked once in the past but they didnt take my insurance so we only got 2-3 sessions in before that fell through. Now I'm attempting to get a new therapist but so far none have been able to take me in or they just haven't called back. So while I'd like professional help I think it'd benefit me to have some help over none until that can happen. So I joined this thread in the hopes that could happen."
475,The intense ball of hate!,Have any of you guys ever had a hatered toward an individual to the point you’ve had homicidal thoughts toward them?
476,My friend has scars on her wrist.,"This is a post I wish I didn’t have to write, but I’m so confused. So at the start of today I had drama (the subject) at school and in drama you obviously move around a lot and I noticed what resembles scars on my friends left arm.

I am not extremely close with this friend but we are friends nonetheless I’m just not friends enough with her to feel I can approach her about this. 

My mind of course instantly jumped to self harm, who wouldn’t but, but she seems just as happy as ever, and more strangely no one else seemed to notice. 

I would think this was self harm but she wasn’t covering it anything, no one noticed and she seemed happy. I also have never noticed it before and they look not that new. 

I suppose I’m just asking if I’m over thinking this and it’s simply self harm, or I’ve made a terrible mistake?"
477,A Poem about Loneliness,"What is Mine

I internalize my stress.
Lonely is the name of my enemy.
Myself I try to oppress.
This hole might be the end of me.
I must set out to encounter,
people likeminded so passionatley.
When i'm not around her,
the space between brings anxiety.


/*Just a vent post. Im no poet but this helped me derive some deeper emotions. Even though I am around my friends of many years, some from childhood, at college I still feel an empty loneliness at the end of the day. It might be the looming stress of getting into the real world. I don't understand why some aspects of my future are so unsettling. Im definitely not the best Electrical Engineering student and sometimes that weighs on me that I could/should be doing more. I fear the chance that I won't be able to fully send the relationship with my girlfriend after college because ill be limited in options as far as location us concerned. Its a long distance one at the moment but it had its roots planted well before college so thats not my worry. I don't think I could tell anyone these secret pains but her but i feel as though it is wrong to bring these to her and have her worry about affairs that she cannot help me in. I Love Her, it would be wrong to emotionally burden her with these as she has her own stresses to content with, we all do.

Tldr; Sometimes the people who shine the brightest or appear as though they are always enjoying life secretly internalize their problems to protect those they care about."
478,Passively killing yourself?,"Okay this might be a long shot here, but an interesting thought just popped into my head. 

I went through the onset of schizophrenia almost ten years ago. Since then I have been struggling with symptoms varying in intensity. 
Here comes the interesting part. 

So my body is wrecked. I'm fat, I drink, I eat like shit, I don't exercise. I have had my fair share of health scares before, but I usually don't bother to really get things checked out. Like, pain in the chest for example. I don't bother to get that checked even though I have two cases in my family of known heart problems. One uncle even died of it. I bleed from my anus occasionally. You know, lots of different shit, that might mean something, or perhaps don't. 

What I just now thought about is that maybe I am passively killing myself by letting my physical condition go to shit? 

I don't think I have a death wish and I don't want to actively kill myself. 

What if instead I just let my body go down the drain, so the choice is taken off my hands? 

This is pretty spooky stuff to think about. I am not even sure if that's the case here, but it might be something subconscious at play here. 

What are your thoughts?"
479,"One Step Forward, Three Steps Back","I’m not sure what to do anymore. I thought I had life sorted out, but for the last five years or so my mental health has been on a decline. My situation seems to be most of the problem. Every time I start to feel like things are going well or I’m finally poking my head above water, something usually comes out of nowhere to ruin things.

For example: I spent this winter working hard to make sure I had money to cover bills and still get out to do something once in a long while. Nothing extravagant, just something, anything other than sitting in the house watching YouTube because I’m too scared to spend money on a subscription service. I finally caught up and paid rent on time this month! That was a huge thing for me. Then I found out that I actually owe money on my taxes for the first time in my life and it’s like $500 between state and federal. Then, out of nowhere, I get a court summons today - likely for one of the bills I’ve been putting off because I haven’t had money to pay it.

All of it is more money than I could dream of having. If I worked all the hours I possibly could, ate a cup of ramen a day, and spent the rest of the time sleeping, I still wouldn’t have enough money to pay all of these people who want to bleed me dry. Yes I’ve made mistakes, yes I’m trying to fix them, but I need the basics under control before I can pay debts.

I’ve been under so much stress that my doctors (paid thankfully by Medicaid) have me on a cocktail of meds just to make it through the day. I took a look at my life today and was so ashamed at what I’ve become that I wanted to take my own life. I wanted it more than I’ve ever wanted it before. I just wanted everything to end so I could have those few seconds of relief before it would all be over. 

I didn’t do it, obviously, but I crave that feeling of not having to worry about anything anymore. I guess I’m just writing to get people’s opinions and see how other people are doing. Have you gotten out of a hole you dug for yourself? How did you do it? How much support did you need? Things like that.

And thanks for reading. It’s my first time on this sub, so I’m not sure what to expect."
480,Why won’t any doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist help me (Australia),"I was talking to people I know who have moderate anxiety and depression and they went through the whole process in 1-2 visits to a professional  and were diagnosed,prescribed meds and given the help they need

I have daily auditory hallucinations(occasional visual),paranoia, prior self harm, prior severe depression and severe anxiety,depersonalisation and derealisation but every single doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist just referred me to another one who does the same, this has been going on for 3-4 months and I’ve seen between 6-7 professionals over multiple visits with no progress being made while my symptoms are getting progressively worse 

Every appointment is the same, and I’ve not received any help and I’m at the point of the closest to suicide I’ve been since my last attempt

It feels as if I’m in a fucking pyramid scheme 
And Ive had to create my own coping mechanisms to be able to function, but even they have a limit

I just got referred from a psychiatrist today back to my GP who was told by the psychiatrist to refer me to another different psychiatrist.

This was my tipping point today after just going in fucking circles, it is just so draining and exhausting and is making me question if I should just give up trying to get help and just try and deal with it, even though inevitably its just going to keep getting worse like it has been and will lead to my eventual suicide

So my question is why were the people I know so easily and quickly able to go through the process is 1 doctor visit and 1 psychiatrist visit, but I’m just going back and forth for months?"

482,Once again my parents think i am faking.,"Once again my parents think i am faking, or at least overreacting.

They see my depression as a get-out-of-jail free card. It is not.

My depression is the constant fear that i am not good enough, that everyone secretly hates me, that my life and life in general does not matter.

I have to live with that, and it makes me physicaly ill often, but my parents cant seem to understand how much i dread doing even the smallest things.

If this gross kind of misunderstanding keeps happening, then i dont know if i can keep going."
483,What happens once I get help?,"I've been depressed for a few years now, and I have an appointment with an on base(army) mental health specialist on Wednesday. I'm terrified of being honest with them, because at times I suffer from suicidal ideation. But I know while I'm thinking it that it's not the answer, I have been on leave for the last two weeks and have been alone around loaded firearms every day, and it has been particularly bad lately and I didnt do anything, it's just that the thought was there. The best way I can explain the severity of the suicidal thoughts would be to relate it to cheating. If you're in a relationship, and you see an attractive person and they are coming on to you, part of you would want to go home with them, but you know the consequences of who would be affected, and arent willing to do that, but if you could do it without hiding it, and you were single or nobody would be hurt by it, you would do it in a heartbeat. I know that I'm loved by my adopted parents and my friends, so I dont do it. But the urge is still there. I'm terrified that if I'm open about this I will be sent to a psych ward, which would cause me to lose my firearm rights, I would likely be separated from the army, etc, and I'm afraid that it would just make things worse for me, because those are the only things that I can find fulfillment from when I'm not down. If anyone could give insight, it would be greatly appreciated."
484,Why I always feeling terrible about myself?,"Hello guys,
I am from India I work as remote consultant. I don't know why I always feel terrible about myself. I lost weight, changed my fashion sense, started going to meetups, uninstalled Instagram, enrolled on new courses but still I am not feeling good about myself. My mood always swinging. I literally want to cry somewhere. It seems like I am just killing myself everyday and right now I am not getting any kind of suicidal thoughts. I am not trying to gain any kind of sympathy here. I always thought depression and mental health is joke. After four fucking years I came to know I am suffering from depression.

Thank you in advance."
485,I’m (19F) in a girl’s college and I’m going through a breakup.,"The past one year has been the worst for me in a lot of ways. I had a very good relationship and now we broke up three weeks back which I’m still dealing with. And I have friends who were always good to me but I think that was mainly because I was the talkative one in the group with a good sense of humour and I used to help out my friends with everything. But after my breakup I kinda started distancing myself from everyone around. I prefer to be alone. I feel like I didn’t just lose a boyfriend but my best friend too. And my friends are upset about the fact that I’m moody and upset and they want me to be all cheerful like I was. I feel like they’re not helping in any way. I had a panic attack last month and I’m really doubtful about meeting a therapist. And the fact that I’m in a girls college with drama around me all the time doesn’t help at all. Now my only hope is going abroad for my further studies because I desperately need a break from this day to day boring routine I have. I need help to cope with college, friends and breakup.  And I don’t know how I’m gonna deal with this anymore."
486,Aggressive self-reflection but I need your help,"Hey guys, I'm in need of some direction.

As a 23 y/o American female with a college degree, there are 3 major categories that I attempt to spend most of my time on: my boyfriend &amp; loved ones, my job (web developer), and myself. 

*For context: I've been struggling with depression since adolescence. I am able to put on a facade that could be described as 'normal,' consequently, my mental illness has always been unbeknownst to most.* 

*Although I have never found it difficult to make friends in order to 'fit in,' making mutual, meaningful connections with others has only seemingly happened a handful of times in my life. The depression I experience has always been isolating regardless of my situation.*

Let's start with my boyfriend. Contrary to many love stories around me (as well as those in my past), I was the one who was interested first. As a matter of fact, I can tell you all about the first time I even looked at him -- employee orientation at new local bar. That's right...we were co-workers.

Our relationship started with me dating another and him not really noticing me. Then after a year or so, our acquaintance moved into a friendship. After awhile, that friendship transformed into our relationship today. I don't have to tell you the story...bartending can be a flirty profession.

Overall, my boyfriend and I have an awesome relationship. The best part is I actually feel something instead of the default numbness. I don't want to say he's my first love, but he's the first significant other that I'm undeniably attracted to, shares my beliefs and values, and works to make me feel loved. This dude checks all the boxes. Sometimes I can't even believe we're together and I've known this guy for years.

That being said, I can't imagine what I'd do if our relationship dissolved. However, I'm sick of being in fear of losing him. 

I am conventionally attractive, athletic, young, free-spirited, and smart; however, jealousy is now a plague that overcomes me. Everything now seems to be a competition in my head. I know I'll never be the most attractive, talented, or intellectual person in this world - but this relationship has put me at odds with my own mental peace. I now always feel like I have to be the best at everything. I feel like my boyfriend only took interest in me because I was the cool, down-to-earth, attractive blonde at our workplace; I feel like he is a privilege that could be taken away at any second. 

Despite the fact that my boyfriend has NEVER EVER made me feel inadequate, the people that surround us (past co-workers/friends?) seemingly never fail to tell me in/directly about how great of a guy my boyfriend is, how many 'options' are available to him, and/or that I don't deserve him.

I had self-confidence before dating this guy, but now I just feel like crap. On paper, I'm the much more desirable candidate: I have an 'outwardly pleasing' career (not-bartending, which he still does), a long-term plan, wellness goals, a retirement fund, and more...but he still just nonchalantly takes the cake. I don't understand. Sometimes I feel like I would be better off without him, but he is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

And if we're going down the list, my loved ones are always there for me but also never fail to make me feel as if I'm not meeting my goals or doing a good job.

Next, let's move to my job. It's rewarding during small intervals but most of the time my job makes me frequently consider suicide. Since starting my job at the beginning of 2018, I've started heavily abusing prescription medication and alcohol. I enjoy and am talented at my position, however, I feel as if the dynamics of the agency where I am employed will actually kill me. I don’t know why I hate it so much and, in case this matters, the hate I have for my current job has only gotten worse since I began my relationship.

I have had a job with a non-familial employer since I was 13 and have never experienced this caliber of despair towards a employment. I don't understand what's wrong with me. In theory, I've landed exactly what I've been working towards, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. This is the heaviest contributor to my depression.

Finally, myself. I know that I’m normal enough and, for the most part, can meet the goals I set. I don’t understand why self-hatred seems to follow me everywhere I go. Nothing I do is ever enough.

Can I ask, what am I doing wrong?

Are my negative feelings toward my relationships, my job, and myself all at the fault of my mental illness? Am I too insecure to be in a successful relationship? Do all ‘adult’ jobs make you want to die (and not in the comical way that everyone jokes about when I try to ask for advice)? Would talking to a therapist put me on a path to self-acceptance?

Basically, as the title states, I really need some direction or advice from from someone who can be objective. I know this is a lot of info but I’m desperate for a fresh perspective. Thanks to anyone who is able to provide some insight."
487,"Hardcore struggling, dont know if anyone else could relate to this","As I'm typing this out im supposed to be writing an essay for my AP english class. It's due in 3 days and the SAT is in 2 days. I feel like I have no hope of passing this class, let alone the SAT or AP test connected to this class.

I have this problem every time I have to write an essay, I can think of maybe one or two times ever that this wasn't the case for whatever reason. It doesn't matter if I understand the prompt, have plenty to write about and KNOW what I'm supposed to be doing, I just... can't write. 

I started this essay an hour ago, have an essay's worth of notes to refer to, yet I've written maybe 4 sentences total. It doesn't matter that I know the information and have it in my head, I just can't communicate the ideas to written words. I'll just sit there and stare at the paper or screen, or get distracted by some other thing. 

Communicating ideas verbally is even worse so I cant even explain what I know to anyone to describe what I WOULD write. I'm just sort of trapped in my head. 

I'm just exceptionally frustrated because I wanted to be done by now, I could be done by now, it just takes every ounce of energy to find the words I need."
488,Am i going through derealization?,"I smoke weed a lot and all the time i hear people who smoke talking about derealization and how everything seems fake. I’ve always really hated this description because it’s so vague. i thought it may be something i’m going through and it could easily be weed related and it could easily be not. i’ve always struggled with adhd, depression, and anxiety (the big 3, it seems) so something like this wouldn’t come as a shock. 

However I have no fucking clue whether or not it’s something i’m experiencing or not because what does “everything seems fake” even mean. like i don’t literally think the world we live in isn’t real. I don’t touch a rock and doubt what i’m feeling actually exists. however, i do feel like the foundation for people’s relationships, and just the reasons for why people do what they definitely seem incredibly fake and arbitrarily chosen. the world often seems like a place where people are just kind of prancing around and pretending like they know shit when in reality most 80 year olds have made the same amount of progress to realizing what’s really important and that nobody has an “accurate” culture or an “accurate” world view as a 6 year old. There is no right and wrong and everything we do is based on the assumption that there is and that’s why everything we do is just kind of pointless. It’s not like that i look at everything as fake, It’s that i just think all of our morals and values were so arbitrarily chosen that it really makes no point to follow them, so i follow my own values that i made based on nothing other than my personal experience. And they feel 100% real because there was an actual process to making them that i understand.

This got unnecessarily philosophical, but i think you understand what i’m asking. Am i going through derealization or do i just have a different world view?"

490,"Seeing a Therapist, but need some advice from you!","Hello, I am a 25f who suffers from depression and anxiety, along with a few other \[un-diagnosed\] mental disorders. I have recently started taking weekly 90MG fluoxetine and seeing a therapist. My therapist would like me to think of things I want to work on to help myself.

Now while I understand this is all up to me, I'd like to have some examples of goals to work on personally. For example: I need to work on my social anxiety; I want to work on building strong interpersonal relationship skills; and I want to rephrase any and all negative thoughts when they occur.

492,"My friend called me an alcoholic ""in the making""","This is a long rant, sorry! 

I was at a party last weekend that was BYOB (partially, there was some alcohol but not a lot). I got an extra bottle of vodka but didn't end up drinking it because not many people at the party were drinking the booze our host had brought so she poured most of it in my glass. Eventually I took the small bottle home with me after everything ended.

My friend was with me the whole time, we bought our own booze together and stuff. Since my parents were gone I didn't have a problem with keeping an extra bottle at home, but yesterday I said I should throw it out because they're coming home. She said ""How will you throw out so much alcohol? You can give it to *other friend which is planning a party*"" and since we were talking back and forth very fast I immediately blurted out ""It's empty!""

She gasped and said ""You're an alcoholic in the making! It's only been a week!""

It's true, I do have problems with substance abuse but I think I handle them pretty well usually. The last two weeks have been pretty rough so I felt really embarrassed when she said that, because I knew I wasn't handling myself as well as I do on other days. I constantly crave alcohol but as I know stuff like these can get out of hand due to my mental state I try my best to keep away from it, however having that one, small bottle of alcohol right there in my house was something I could easily reach for and I didn't recognise that until it was too late. 

Not to say I drank the whole thing immediately but every time something bad came across my mind the bottle was suddenly in my hands. And thought by thought, mouthful after mouthful it was empty.

When my friend said that I was taken aback and answered ""*Name*! You shouldn't say stuff like that!"" 
We didn't fight over it or anything, but right now I'm really embarrassed and can't stop thinking about it. I feel so stupid."
493,How much weight do you put in experience in choosing a psychotherapist?,"Hello, 

I just started researching potential therapists. I go in and out of funks like everyone else, but I wouldn’t consider myself depressed and I definitely don’t suffer from anxiety. I just want to work out some things in regards to some jaded perspectives, bad habits and indulgences, romance issues, etc. 

I was wondering how much weight do you put in a therapist’s experience. I’m using mywellbeing.com to help me “match” with a therapist. The one with the least amount of experience has specialties most closely related to what I’m looking for, while the other two generally have clients with slightly different focuses but have a decent amount more experience. 

This is my first post, I hope I’m not breaking any rules or etiquette. Thanks!"
494,Losing grip of progress in anexiety therapy and falling off.,"so basically whats been happening to me for the last months of therapy it that i often loose progress because i run out of power to keep up with myself. I also want to say that I dont know how strong my anexiety is because I do loose all train of thought in an attack and feel like I want to cry, but I dont, which im not sure about is either it not being that strong or just me being used to this feeling. I get constantly scared of anything that includes doing something I either have not done before or had any problems with before. I also cant leave my bubble for more then some hours at a time otherwise i shut down and get an anexiety attack. I honestly dont know where to go since im a 16yo student that really cant continue with school after this summer break ( i just suck, missed to much school and am not very bright when it comes to maths and stuff, theres luckily no monitary reason or something). as I said at the start I sometimes loose progress because I get an attack seemingly randomly and I just cant function after those and therefore it reinforces my anexiety and causes me to fall back. I cant really dodge situations that scare me tho cuz everything scares me, and i felt i can deal with some triggers. This is where the running out of energy part comes in. It takes a lot off of me to control a single Trigger but as i said, normally i can cope. I just run out of juice sometimes and then everything thats just the smallest trigger just completely shuts me down, and I feel like that alone is getting to me. I dealt with a depressive phase in 6-7 grade, and i feel like thats showing its ugly mug again. I get rather randomly sad and just dont really find enjoyment in much but drowning out the real world with shows and video games. Its escapeism and not good for me but sometimes I feel so cornered for days at a time that I feel like i need to run somewhere. All in all I feel like not being able to keep up even with the slightest bit of life and it makes me pretty sad most of the time, not uncommonly ending in me just crying at home because I was to scared to walk though my entrance today and leave for school. Its not fun and I really dont know what im suppost to do anymore since I feel like my fear is completely irrational and other then trying to make it shut up I cant touch it. I cant argue with it and it overwrites my thoughts. I just feel stuck. 

sorry for this wall of text bois"
495,Declining mental health?,"I started 20mg of fluoxetine about 10 years ago for anxiety. I went up to 40mg within the past year because I felt that I was disassociating and just feeling a bit off overall with my mental health. I have days where I feel really depressed and don’t want to do anything and feel like there isn’t a point of being in school or doing anything except for being there for my family and boyfriend.
I’ve cut off friendships accidentally because I just always want to be alone or with my boyfriend and never have the energy to talk to people. I’m about to graduate college and continue on more schooling and I do feel motivated sometimes but part of me just doesn’t think any of it is worth it. (I am not suicidal I just feel hopeless sometimes)
Side note: I also take 40?mg of atomexetine for add because I was having a really hard time concentrating.
I guess what I’m asking is if taking fluoxetine for that long a time period (over 10 years) will cause it to stop working? Should I try a different antidepressant? I go to a psychiatrist but I honestly don’t feel like he is all that helpful (part of it is that I also just don’t know how to properly express how I am feeling and don’t think he will understand how I’m feeling with my mental health)"

497,Lost my emotional support,"Three weeks ago I made the horrible decision to end my best friend's life. I got her when she was around 1 and she's been with me for almost 11 years. She was diagnosed with cancer and some kind of neological issue. Both would have required more tests, medications, likely surgery and chemo. My husband didn't want to pay for endless treatments and I felt like with our travel schedules for work and our upcoming move, I didn't have a choice. But I'm so lost without her. And I hate myself for not giving her more time. And I hate my husband for not wanting her. And I just keep crying and crying and can't stop. 

I don't know how to function without her. Which sounds insane, talking about a cat like that. But she was my constant, my home. She was always there, always cuddled me when I was sad or sick, always greeted me when I came home, always followed me around the house regardless of mealtimes. She made me feel loved. And I killed her. I don't know how to move past it. I don't know how to forgive myself. I keep thinking I could have done something different to keep her here. And I can't tell if it was the right thing for her or not. My husband keeps saying there was no right choice but I can't stop feeling like this was the wrong one.

I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow. I'm just so alone without her. My husband is tired of me crying all the time and I feel like I can't rely on him (bigger issues there). I don't know how to move past this. I know grief is normal. I'm sure the guilt is probably normal too. I just feel so buried. And so tired. And so lonely and awful."
498,I'm worried my close friend may be suffering a mental breakdown I'm not sure how to handle this situation (Texas),"Hello everyone, I'm not really sure if this is the most appropriate sub to pose this question in but I wasn't sure where else to go. I have a friend whom I have had as one of my closest if not my closest friend for nearly 5 years now. He's been there through my ups and downs and he's always been a good friend but something has changed within the past few weeks. He lives many states away at his university but me and him play games and stay in daily close contact and within the past few weeks he's cut himself for the first time on his bicep, began drinking in extreme excess almost daily and acting in a very erratic way. The issue is his self harming doesn't seem to be coming from a suicidal standpoint he has repeatedly stated that he enjoys the pain and he is talking about how many people he's wronged and that he needs to suffer for what he's done. (He grew up in wealth and has to my knowledge not really done anything terrible in his life) I a week and a half ago thought that I managed to bring him back to reality, got him to tell me he wasn't going to cut himself anymore and that I'm always gonna be here if he needs someone to talk to it seemed all ok. He promised to stop self harming but 2 days ago he called me drunk as all hell crying and talking to me about how everyone in the world is sheep and how he's fucked over so many good people in his life and how he needs me to cut him. He has since then over the past few days reiterated over and over again how I'm the only person in the world that he trusts and that I need to make him suffer. He's been drinking and driving and just the way that he talks he sounds like he's having a severe mental break. But during the day he acts normal, no tears just talks about everything very passively and goes about a normal day to day routine. I don't understand it, I've witnessed someone go through a psychosis but this seems different to that. I don't know how to handle this situation. I've told him I would do the whole cut thing on his back for him because I'm afraid if I didn't agree he would hurt himself further. He's seeming extremely detached from reality and I don't think his family is aware. I don't have any way of contacting his family, he has no social media and I'm not sure how to track down his parents. He lives in a different state, I don't have his address, I don't have much. I have an audio recording I took during a video chat session with him where he's literally in tears crying to me about how he needs me to cut him and to make him suffer so he will finally be even. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to handle this situation. I know this is a shit ton of information to unpack but I need any kind of recommendations that I can here. If there are any resources specifically in the Texas/Lubbock area that someone could point me in so I can try to get my friend help please do. I'm very much so worried and trying to figure out how to handle this situation without losing my friend."
499,Can someone shed some light,"Hi, it’s 2am here and although my eyes are tired I can’t sleep. 

I’m thinking about how, for the past 3 years since I entered university, I’ve been feeling depressed or have frequent panic attacks during exam weeks, presentations, deadlines, or when I am under pressure. 

And they would go away after that. Everytime. So I would always hesitate when I want to seek help. I’m not sure if this is valid mental health issue or not. 

But to give more context. I also get suicidal (I recently bought a utility knife)  and depressed sometimes even before university. I’m not sure why exams and deadlines give me so much anxiety, it seems like everyone has them. Presentations tho, I understand since I have no self confidence and always think of the worst things that would lead me to failing the class or my future being doomed because of an ugly grade. I’m afraid of socializing with people especially men so the thoughts of participating in class, giving reports, or even a simple job interview is very hard task to do. Most of the time, I feel stupid like I’m the least intelligent human. I also care about how people think of me like if I do or say something “stupid”, I would assume everyone thinks I’m stupid or everyone hates me.


Anyway, my thoughts are all over the place and I can’t even explain everything properly. 

Is this normal? I don’t know anymore... I just don’t. I don’t trust myself."
500,Student Wellness Survey,"Hi,

I am working on a school project on student health and wellness. If you have some time to spare, please help me out by taking this survey.

This survey will take a few minutes to complete and contains 10 questions. Thank you so much for your time. I truly appreciate it! 

[https://forms.gle/o5NnbGZfasdf8AQE7](https://forms.gle/o5NnbGZfasdf8AQE7)"
501,Mental Health Officer (brotality),"had serious suicidal thoughts, mental health officer talked me down and was super kind. Gave me these super cute 1 pal police stickers, and said he “sees a future for me and hopes I stay around to see it” had me in tears, and was able to get my voices to stop by talking and singing and calmed me down completely 😄"
502,Degrading emotional state,"Hi! I’ve been as of recently noticing a change in my behavior. It feels like I’m not feeling emotions as strong as I once was, and I’m finding it harder to even feel emotions at all.

For context, I recently got out of a mental health hospital Kahi Mohala, my main issue was bringing down my issues and dealing with others issues first. I always put people before myself. But I’ve noticed afterwards that I’m starting to care less about people as time goes and I’m not sure what’s happening to me. Any thoughts? Feel free to pm me if you want to go really into this. I appreciate the help."
503,[M16] I am obsessive and cant control my thoughts,"Hello all, for the past 3 years I have been struggling with my mental stability and health. 4 weeks ago one of my friends told me she didn't want to be friends anymore, at first it did not bother me until now. Everytime I hear her voice it makes me angry and I feel like leaving the classroom. Instead of letting it go I just obsess about it and become sad, she has moved on and is having fun seemingly. Randomly she will pop into my head and I will just sit their and think about things I cannot change. I wish to stop and move on in life !

Secondly, I cannot go a day without thinking about death and pain. I could be having a fun time and then I will think about death, mass extinction , disease, etc. I think abut death too much and it is making me sad.  I wish to stop !

Futhermore, I have two friends they are okay people, every 2 weeks I question my friendship with them and I dont wanna be friends with them. It is annoying to me because I can never follow through with a decision. I come home from school barely being able to function it took my about 5 hours to do a simple homework assignment. I ignore my friends online for long periods of time, I ignore thier phone calls I feel so guilty but at the same time is somehow better that being with them. It makes me angry that I cannot function outside if school, that makes me a slave to school were all I do is school. I live in ""South central"" los angles so their is not much to do outside, on the weekends I sit inside for two days and then I go to school repeating the same mundane tasks over and over. I feel as I am not alibe but just absently moving across the metaphorical game board and watch as the years go by. I think about suicide often, I don't want to die but I dont feel like i'm living anyway. I feel like crying but no tears come out. 

I just want to live life and vibe and have fun with people while achieving my goal to attend college.
Right now I can barely do the bate minimum and I feel that I am breaking down slowly and ever so slightly as the days go by 

What should I do ?"
504,"first time seeing a psychiatrist, what to expect?",hi so i’m seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow for the first time and i’m not sure what to expect. i have suicidal ideation and my school found out my plan and is sending me to get help. i have already been to the hospital and spoken to people from the crisis team as well as i had a appointment with someone to take a risk assessment/general wtf is going so i’m comfortable with what sort of questions i’ll be asked. during the assessment we talked a lot about my mood swings and my few symptoms of psychosis but i’m doubtful that they’ll have spent enough time with me to have a diagnosis yet but i’m unsure if i’ll be immediately put on medication? like what kind? whether it’s a mood stabilizer or a anti depressant or anti anxiety or if they’re the same thing? because i think medication will be really helpful for me but i also don’t want to ask for it if they don’t mention anything about because when i’m nervous i get really polite and don’t argue anything. if anyone can offer their experience or what i can expect all help will be appreciated!
505,I’m F(18) and am on the verge of just ending it.,"I feel like I was destined to have a shitty life since the day I was born.  Idk maybe that’s a dumb thing to say, but that’s just
how it feels.  I’ve never really ever felt loved in my life. Ever. I think about being told the words I love you no one has ever meant it because if they did why does everyone hurt me? 

My mom should have never had me. It’s clear she always wanted a son and that she doesn’t really love me. There’s a part of her that tries I guess, but I feel like she just wishes I wasn’t a girl. Especially hearing the fact she had a name picked out for me.... and it was a boy name :/. I’ve always shown the uppermost love for my mom. When I was younger I’d cry and cry all night while she was at work because I didn’t feel safe without my “mommy”. But that’s just how it was as a kid. You see your parents and you just feel protection and then you start seeing things how they really are when you’re older. Like how sleeping on a couch while your male cousins sleep in their nice beds and who are also in their 30s and want their own bedrooms refuse to move out so your mom thinks their well-being is better than yours. I sleep on a couch in the living room. Since I was 11. I put my clothes in a little bin in some corner in the house. I have 0 privacy, I can never make a phone call without someone in my family purposely trying to humiliate me or listening in. I’ve never really got to explore things sexually since... I sleep in the living room? I don’t know.  I’ve been “groomed” (is that the right word) into thinking this was normal until I turned 17 years old. 6 years I thought it was normal, but I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone. 


The emotional abuse I’ve endured for saying I get back pain from sleeping on a couch.  My cousin once called me a spoiled brat and a little princess for crying when I was told that I won’t be getting a bed or a room. He and my mom actually sat around joking about me reporting them for abuse. Said they’d let the officer strip me down and check if I had bruises and if I did, they could take me. Like that’s my fucking mom? Need I add how I have always had problems with my self esteem, but I was good at always telling myself positive things about myself until I became a teenager my mom never missed a moment to insult my appearance. Every time I’m upset she calls me ugly, fat, and countless of other things. Never the same with my cousins yet (this isn’t me being a stuck up bitch i’m not pretty at allll but it’s just bizarre to me) they’re 10x the size of me and nowhere near good looking, she wouldn’t dare call them a name.  My mom ruined my confidence (if i could ever have any) and every single time I look at myself I see a pathetic fat ugly girl. I cant go anywhere without having to sit in a way where I can spare people to look at my face. I cant even fucking do normal things anymore because I’m scared that people are calling me ugly or fat or just any insult. 


I have no friends other than online friends. The 2 girls I’ve befriended irl were 2 of the fakest people who never even cared for me at all. The guys I’ve dated both cheated on me. (one actually used me to take my virginity) So what is it thats wrong with me that no one actually loves me? Is it my personality? I don’t know what’s wrong with me! I’m an afterthought in people’s life. My feelings don’t matter ever. I was always try to tone down how I am, but I feel as if I am unfixable, unlovable, and just an ugly worthless piece of shit. Everyday is more miserable than the next. I don’t know why I bother trying anymore. 


TL;DR: my mothers abuse has pushed me too far and I’m seeing my quality of life diminish and seeing more reason to end it all."
506,[M16] I want to have fun,"Everyday I attend school and when I get home I can barely function, my 2 closest friend I continuously question why I am with them. I feel like cry ing but no tears come out. I obsess about death and pain, I can't have fun in my life for some reason. Video games, a media that once gave me joy now I barely play them. I get juelous of every small detail in a perosn. I hate people because I don't know how to communicate with them. I have a low humming anxiety most of the time and I can't shake it. I hate the fact that my family and I can't do fun stuff because we don't have any money to. I obsess and obsess and it never stops. When I am not at school I am at home it makes me depressed. I don't have a destist so my tooth has been hurting me since 9th grade and I can't do anything about it. My parents got divorce 10 years ago, since then my father has started a new life with 3 new children. My mom is having trouble finding a job and if she can't it will be bad news. I can never find joy in life because I obsess if I will be able to do it later in life. I sleep 10-15 hours on summer break while I watch my peers have the time of their lives. I cannot take it anymore what should I do ?"
507,I'm such a crybaby,I just had my second psychotherapy and all I did was cry for the first and second. I feel weak and it ruins my mood for the next few hours. I've practiced how to talk without crying but I always end up bawling. How do I deal with these tears?
508,Wanting To Be In A Dream/Fictional World,"Everyone here will probably think I'm some weirdo but, I've just rewatched ""Puella Magi Madoka Magica"" earlier and everytime the show ends, I breakdown crying because of how much I don't want it to end but where I'm going with this, is that after it ends I start wanting to just be in a world with the characters . I get so attached to the characters I can't stand to turn it off or anything . I get to the point I just hope that when I sleep I get to be with them and I want to stay in the dream forever just so I can be with them . I would always say to myself ""If it meant leaving this life behind for a another life, I would gladly take it"" . I just really need someone else's insight on what's going on with me ."
509,Near the end.,"My dog has been cuddling me hardcore and been more attentive towards me than normal. I have a plan and I'm days away.. Part of me wonders if she can tell my mental state has changed and I'm preparing for this. Ok just tired of holding on for no reason. Gonna say one last good bye to my friends and end it. I guess this is my confession of sorts. The guilt sometimes is overwhelming. But what I feel inside every day tears me apart, I cant do it anymore."
510,Online mental health chats don't help,I've used websites like beyond blue multiple times. But every time it just makes me feel worse and doesn't help at all. I never feel like I'm talking to a human. It always feels very robotic and forced. Is that just me? Does anyone have any better resources for Australia?
511,About to have a panic attack I need someone to help me.,His guys im 16 years old and im really freaking out right now. I have anxiety and depression and maybe some pure O but im not diagnosed. I'm really freaking out that someday i'm going to lose control of myself and go crazy or something. I keep having visions of myself in 30 years doing heroin and raping people. I dont want to do this but im scared thats my destiny. Im really scared right now i really believe someday im going to go insane or something and just not be myself anymore. Its 3 am and im about to fucking lose it over these thoughts.
512,The invasive thoughts are starting to seem like a voice of reason.,"A few short months ago, my life seemed like it was going to be perfect. I was happy, and emotionally supported. I had very few invasive thoughts, and when I did, it was the easiest thing in the world to ignore them and look forward to the future. You could even go as far as to say I was depression free.

Obviously, things have gone downhill, and there doesn’t really seem to be an end in sight for my situation at the moment. Every day I am progressively having more severe and an increase in volume of these thoughts.

What if I really am useless? What do I have left to live for? Does anybody care about me anymore? I should just kill myself. I don’t think I can handle this anymore.

Those and many variations are among the most common to pass my mind. I’m not even putting an effort to fight them at this point. My mind is starting to align with this way of thinking, leading to brainstorming of suicide methods, or idealizing a painless end to existence. I’ve never felt this one before, but I am definitely sympathizing with anyone who as ever felt like going to sleep and never coming back. 

Safe to say, I’ve come at least full circle from last year at exactly this time. I’m at an all time low, but this time with not nearly as much hope left to save me. I have no motivation whatsoever, and I’m honestly over it already. To this very day, I am only held here by the smallest sliver of hope that things will be better soon, that I will be happy again. 

Thank you for reading. I would love to tell my story to anyone willing to listen, but just the fact that you were able to make it through this post is very meaningful to me."
513,"Down day feeling shame, anxiety and rumination",I’m not so much looking for help and advice on here as I don’t think reddit is the best place for that lol. I would love to know that people care though and validation that my experience is valid and isn’t my fault. I sometimes struggle with that.
514,I get the urge to hit or kick something when I think about regrets.,"Anyway to cope with this? I can’t really control it at home, but with other people i just make a joke  out of it."
515,I’m struggling,"Currently I am being told I have to relocated where I live, this time has been very stressful and I feel as though the added stress of moving will only further my trauma and I just have no clue how to cope. I’m overwhelmed and want nothing more than the comfort of my usual space. I want to talk to a psychologist but would need a new one but with this situation I also feel like it’s too much to load on a new psychologist. 
I don’t know what to do."
516,How to declutter your mind,[removed]
517,Went to therapy today for the first time in 2 years.,"I feel so fucking overwhelmed and exhausted emotionally, i feel even more emotional and lethargic. Today i let everything out. The therapist was understanding and told me this is a first step and that she wants commitment, she said she wants me to attend 3 sessions to gain the trust, (i missed many appointments), so she said if i can succeed in this, she can send me for another re psychiatric assessment and CBT. I just, i jus don't know what to feel or fucking think. A part of me is proud and happy but a part of me also feels blackmailed, and it is nonsense to sit here and blame everyone else because matter of fact, my track record with every therapist has been bad so that is a sign that isn't just them. In saying that, i still feel blackmailed. i just feel disappointed and very fatigued, i don't know if this is from letting out all my emotions out today but i just feel hopeless now, i feel like i will never get better and i am just too difficult to treat, because of my personality disorder."
518,Can anyone what I mean?,"When you suffer from O.C.D you have intrusive thoughts(obsession) which leads you to have to do the compulsion. 

You're not over thinking it just happens just pops in your head it's not the same like anxiety and over thinking stuff so why do they always say stop thinking over thinking they always refer to people with ocd as they always over think they keep repeating thoughts in their head and that not true these toughts just pop up why cant they understand that it's so stigmatizing 

and even most OCD sufferef are being told that and the belive it when it just pops in your head or is this just me"
519,"Working to get a blog and podcast on mental health up and running. (Non-Profit, not advertising)",[removed]
520,I struggle to read people's emotions and reactions,"I can never connect with people very well and have been an outcast for most of my life because I say the wrong things and am generally awkward to be around. I embarrass myself constantly and can't seem to express myself well. 
Anyone else or am I just a bit socially broken lol"
521,I deleted all my social media for 4 days just to see if anyone was concerned,"So most of my friends contact me through social media, like instagram and twitter, so I deleted the apps just to see if they would be concerned that I never replied back. 

And nobody cared so. Yeah this just selfish of me to WANT ppl to care that I'm MIA but ya know whatever"
522,Innovations around BURNOUT,"Hi everyone,

Does anyone know creative (and preferably effective) ways businesses have been trying to relieve stress / prevent burnout for their employees?

For instance I know of businesses which let their employees bring their pets to work to relieve stress and businesses who have made relaxing spaces in their office.

Any ideas are very welcome!"
523,How much does creative writing help mental health?,So I used to write a bit when I was in college and found it helped me in feeling better but i haven't written in about 4/5 years. I've been becoming more and more depressed lately and despite joining the gym (as I heard that exercise can help) I haven't been feeling happier at all. So my question is would it be worth starting to write again?
524,Sexual Sadism?,"So apparently when I think about stabbing people to death, I get aroused. So I tried doing that in Red Dead Redemption 2 in first person view and when I stabbed the woman's throat I suddenly got hard. Does anyone else here have this?"
525,fear of commitment. HELP,"im suffering the fear of commitment, i cant find the root of that fear, i cant afford going to a psychologist and my relationship is on the edge of breaking up. so anyone who has experienced this, is there any way to overcome it by yourself?"
526,How to get your shit together without leaving the house lol,"-go to bed at a reasonable time like before 12
-wake up as early as 5 if needed but if i can get away with it stay in bed till about 7 or 8
-eat 3 meals

-clean up after yourself 
-go the extra mile 

If y’all got more ways to master the basics of survival, throw them at me. I know this list may seem like some really simple stuff but when I was super down some of these things were fucken mountains to overcome."
527,i can feel myself slipping into a void [again].,"I think the trigger could be the fact that my ex was back in town? Maybe I'm just shifting the blame. I want to hibernate for a week, even though I got back from a vacation 6 weeks ago. I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I try to live in the moment and keep myself busy, but this feeling is creeping in. I feel like I'm not allowing myself to feel it because it's busy season at work. I can't let my work suffer and it's going alright for me. I am just so fucking exhausted."
528,Just finished writing my autobiography.,[removed]
529,"I accidentally killed one of my cats cats, it's the second in one week and I can't handle it","I'm crying so much, I tried this time to take them away from my car, I took all of them, looked more since last week there was one under the wheel and I didn't notice him (my garage is very narrow). As I placed my car in front of my house in order to go to work, I saw my little kitty shaking and having spasms in its own pool of blood with his little corpse... Busted. My God, I feel so bad. My head hurts, the image won't go away. I loved themso much, they were the good part about me, and just killed them, I hate myself so much for destroying everything in my fucking life."
530,Malpractice,"I need to get this into the world so that hopefully something can be learned&amp;none of you leave your loved ones alone with any police or medical professionals while seeking wellness checks. The issue began with four cuts on my leg and a panic attack, and what they themselves documented as ""non-violent behavior"" from someone who is 5'2 and 20 years old. I agreed to go to the hospital voluntarily so they wouldn't admit me involuntary and so they wouldn't grab me. Upon getting ready to roll me down into the ambulance,  I tried to look back at the apartment door and the people behind me, only for them to respond with injecting me with ketamine causing an even worse panic attack than I was having before. Within minutes I was hallucinating and out of control of my facilities, and ended up going unconscious from a severe allergic reaction. I woke up strapped to a bed vomiting all over myself connected to an EKG, an oxygen monitor, with an IV in my arm. My few glimpses of consciousness granted me with experiences of people dropping pills in my mouth for illnesses I dont have despite having a full list of my mental history and knowing I only suffer from generalized anxiety and chronic depressive disorder. I was unable to give any kind of consent or communicate what was happening despite them treating me for what they told me was a severe allergic reaction to ketamine. When I finally was regaining consciousness,  all I can remember was begging them repeatedly to stop drugging me so I could be lucid. I woke up with bruises on my arms from injection sites despite the initial injection of ketamine being on the other arm&amp; me having been unconscious,  strapped down, and had made no attempts to fight back. Do not leave your family alone. A 20 minute panic attack turned into lifelong trauma and a medical emergency that could have killed me."
531,"Coping with the ""what if"" of an accident","My boyfriend is a mechanic and last week he asked me to jump into the Agricultural vehicle and move it forward ever so slightly.

I jumped in and when I started the vehicle it took off at full throttle, the throttle was jumped open. My boyfriend on a dolly underneath the vehicle getting dragged along.

I panicked and couldn't work out how to stop it, I collided with the garage door, damaging it and finally finding my rational brain to come to a stop. My boyfriend came out with a scare, as did I, he also had some minor cuts and bruises but all in all okay. We didn't argue, he apologised for asking me knowing fine well it wasn't the safest vehicle. 

It wasn't my fault, it was just ill practice of procedures and we both learnt from the stupid mistake. But I'm just struggling since, I feel pressure constantly like I'm going to cry. It's affecting my mental health as I have anxiety anyway and I just can't shake the image out of my head and how terrible it could have been. I've never liked moving big machinery and now even less. How do I process it? How do I stop reliving it and blaming myself? If I'm this bad over this how on earth do people process seriously hard traumas? I just feel so silly. I've never had to deal with anything like this. What would you do?"
532,Apparently asking for help is “ridiculous” and I’m manipulating people by telling people I’m suicidal when I go to get help,"Over the past 4 years I’ve been seen on and off by the children’s mental health team, over summer my mental health got really bad and after my 7th failed suicide attempt over the past 4 years they decided to admit me to a peads psych unit for assessment, there I was diagnosed with BPD and autism, I really though I could get better at this hospital but very suddenly I was moved to another hospital against my will, in the hospital I didn’t get any support, I have a physical disability aswell and they didn’t provide for that leaving me stuck in my wheelchair sat in my own piss for the 2 days I was admitted there before I discharge myself, I wasn’t given any discharge plan and had a really severe suicidal episode because of the way I was treated in the second hospital. I called up my friend who called the police to do a welfare check, they knocked my door down restrained me and took me to the hospital against my will, the hospital sent me home 2 hours later after seeing me for 10 minutes, they said that I would be under the intensive treatment service at home from now on, they would contact me for an assessment, and they would see me daily, after a week I still had not heard from the intensive treatment service, I went back to the hospital who told me that I wouldn’t be seen by anyone as I hadn’t engaged with the intensive treatment service, they sent me away and I felt so suicidal I took an overdose in the hospital car park. I woke up 2 days later in an intensive care unit who told me to contact my community mental health team as I had just turned 18 aswell, they’ve not helped me in any way they’re supposed to come see me weekly but they don’t and after everything that has happened I am so much worse than I was before I was in hospital, I feel like I’m never going to get better and feel so suicidal and I constantly have flashbacks to what happened in hospital and can’t make it stop... I went to my doctor today to see if there is anymore help I can get and told her that I was feeling so suicidal and I was scared I was going to hurt myself, I don’t want to die but I can’t live like this anymore, how bad does it have to be to properly get help"
533,Effects of exercise on mental health,"Hello, I am conducting a survey for a research paper I am writing for college on the effects of exercise on battling depression and anxiety. It has been a struggle at times for me, and I have found that running has helped immensely. There have been studies done on this before but the results have been inconclusive. I would greatly appreciate if you could take two minutes to complete the survey. The link is https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5V89RWN Thank you for your time"

535,Will You Be Willing To Share Me Your Story?,"Hey Everyone,

I'm currently searching for anyone who is willing to share their story to me. I recently started a Channel that is focused on sharing Real-Life stories of peoples backgrounds of dealing with depression, anxiety, or any Mental Health disorders etc. These stories are intended to help and educate others who watch these videos so they too can cope and find peace within themselves.

Would any of you be willing to share your story to me? I would love to offer you the opportunity to share the worst of what you've been through, so others can relate to you and we can all break the stigma of remaining silent to our problems.

I've dealt with Depression, Anxiety, and Homicidal thoughts throughout my life, and this has driven me to want to create a platform that can save lives, and help others through those dark times like when I needed them. I want to be that voice for others so more people can relate, and in return feel less alone about their struggles.

Thank you for your time and consideration."
536,I have a question about exercising,I heard that exercising is really good and helps with mental health. Does exercising temporarily or permanently help/boost mental health?
537,I (36 M) am worried about my behavior.," 

I haven't really talked about this with anyone. I've been single for a little over 6 years now. My ex was a long distance relationship and the distance thing just didn't work out. About a year ago, I saw on facebook that she was in another relationship. I didn't think it would bother me at first but it did and I became angry.

I ended up blowing up her phone with texts asking why, asking if we could try again even though I didn't really want to...She's the only gf I've had pretty much my last relationship before her was 10 years prior. Anyway she wasn't having it.

I became more angry with the situation and started saying hurtful things to her. Told her I would beat her up had she been here. I think I told her I wanted to kill her new boyfriend. The more upset I got the more hurtful stuff I would say. I told her I would ""go find a dumber fatter bitch somewhere else"" things like that.

She blocked my number, understandably. I didn't mean any of the hurtful things. I thought at the time that if I made her feel bad, it would make me feel good. It did not. I felt extremely upset and guilty. I ended up sending her a fb message apologizing and never heard anything back which I did not expect to.

A few months later I started talking to another girl at a bar that I frequented. I thought things were going pretty well after hanging out for drinks a few times a week. When I made a move and asked her out she gave me the whole ""I like you but just not like that"" which I did not handle very well and basically told her ""Well then what good are you to me?!"" I made a bit of a scene about it. The bartender (a buddy of mine) called me over and told me that I had been cut off and needed to leave. I was pretty embarrassed and this girl stopped talking to me. Understandably.

These events happened a little over two years ago and I haven't talked to a woman since. I have NEVER acted like this before. I've recently stopped drinking but I don't really feel any better.

I'm worried that I'm going to become an abusive person and hurt somebody. I'm also starting to get really lonely and I don't know what to do. I'm worried I will become one of those incel guys. I've been keeping pretty much to myself and I feel like if I start drinking again I can be happy alone but I know I shouldn't.

Has anyone gone through anything like this? Any advice would be helpful. Again I have no idea why I started acting like this out of no where and I'm wondering if it's possible to go back to being normal"
538,Where can I go,"So I've struggled with things like anxiety and depression, but I never liked self diagnosing because it makes me feel like I'm lying so I got myself diagnosed before saying anything, during this I was told I also have psychosis due to hearing a voice in my head.

Now before I continue I find the mind fascinating and live knowing as much as I can about mental disorders, I enjoy helping people and letting them know that just because they think differently to others doesn't make them strange or weird, no one thinks the same, it also comforts me because then I feel ""normal"" too, knowing that everyone is different not just in looks.

Anyway recently I took a lot of interest in a YouTuber channel called DissociaDID, they have Disociative Identity Disorder/DID (just putting that there in case someone doesn't know what it is), anyway I really enjoy watching this channel and getting to understand more but recently I've been comparing myself to it and noticed similarities, now before I noticed I had a voice in my head I couldn't distinguish the voice from my own until it named itself, then later on it showed itself to me in a dream/nightmare.

The more I think about it the more I see connections but as I said I don't like self diagnosing myself and I don't know where would be best for me to go to get a professional diagnosis and it's freaking me out, not because I might have it, whether I have DID or not I'm still the same me, what's freaking me out is not knowing, if I know I can learn to deal with my own emotions better but by not knowing I don't know what's best for myself so if anyone knows where is the best place for me to find out whether I have DID or not please let me know.

I live in the UK just so no one tells me any places that aren't in the UK which I can't use.

Finally thank you."
539,"Is ""How Are You/Is There Anything I Can Do to Support"" Enough?","TL;DR: When someone is upset/depressed/anxious/etc., is it enough/appropriate for the main response to that being ""how can I support you"" without attempting solutions or pressing if they say ""no""?


For context, I am someone that wants to help and be a friend to others but has genuine difficulty with determining the most appropriate social behavior, especially when it comes to emotional interactions. I can pick up easily enough when someone is upset or off, but I am at a loss for how to address that and how to help, to the point where this is honestly a big source of distress and self-doubt/self-loathing for me.


I try telling myself that the best I can do is explicitly ask how I can support the other person when something is going wrong, since I really don't think fast enough or have enough social-emotional skills to determine what else is best whenever these moments happen. 


But it still feels wrong. Part of this is definitely self-loathing, being this aware of lacking the knowledge/skills necessary for daily healthy interactions. But another part is knowing that people may still reject help or not know how they can be helped, when they could still definitely use something. 

For example, I have a friend that suffers from depressive and anxious tendencies but rarely admits to it, instead normally saying that they are fine and there is nothing I can do. I don't want to push, especially since I can't tell what is helpful and what isn't. But with that, during those rare times in which they do say they spent the day in bed feeling awful despite saying before they were fine, I don't know how to respond to that aside from again asking if there is anything I can do to support. They reply that there is nothing, I don't think fast enough or am not sure/confident enough to do anything despite their distress, and the conversation stops. I've now even gotten paranoid that they purposefully do not share anything with me because they know how inept I am at this kind of thing. But I want to be normal and try to be a normal friend; I just don't know how.


So am I just hyper-fixating on this, that asking how I can support is all I should do and is aligned with normal healthy interactions? Or is there more I should be doing to try to help others when they are not doing well? And if so, what?"
540,Has anyone else experienced this?,"  

Hi, 

So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years but have only recently plucked up the courage to try and get some help.

I was reluctant to turn to medication straight away as the thought of taking medication made me anxious. However, I have been seeing a psychologist for counseling (mixed results so far). I have made an appointment with my doctor to discuss medication options further 8 but still not 100% sure it's the course i want to take)

I guess my main problem is the persistent self-doubt and fear that I am not good enough. I worry about not being good enough and I am depressed when I think I am not good enough.

Following an emotional chat with my wife last night, I am currently feeling really guilt and ashamed of myself as it was made clear to me how difficult I am to live with and how horrible it is living with someone who ' never smiles anymore'.

One of the worst behaviors I exhibit is getting irritated and angry with people. This behavior is at its most extreme toward my wife's sister and family. .... I act like such a d@#k head to them most of the time. Being hostile, withdrawn, aloof and uninterested to them and their kids.... They are very rich and everything seems to go well for them all the time... It looks like I am jealous of them but I am not usually a jealous person ( it seems reserved just for them) Within the wider family it's as if the world revolves around them ""they have such good high paid jobs"","" they have such big house.."".blah blah 

I guess my feeling of hostility /anger towards them come from fear of not being good enough and feeling bad because when I compare myself to them it looks like I actually am not good enough....

I need to stop being like this... I REALLY want to stop being like this but it seems impossible....

I am finding it hard to attribute this simply to anxiety/depression what if I am just a 'jerk' a horrible person? Such feelings make me even more anxious and depressed, as it is as if I am not even good enough at being a normal person...

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or is it just me?"
541,Just trying to get it out,"Looking back now, I realize that I never felt safe growing up. Mom did a piss poor job of taking care of us. Sure, we had everything we needed, food shelter, that sort of thing. But we weren't protected by her. Until recently, I never even thought it affected me, seeing my father drunkenly beat the hell out of my mom and older brother. I now see that it did, how could it not? We weren't safe. He never hit me, but I was so little at the time, it would have started eventually. But she kept us there, maybe she felt like if she took most of the beatings, it would be easier for the kids. It wasn't. I had no idea what was going on with my sister. And what did mom do when she found out? Had a stern talk with my father where she told him not to do it again. We moved out to the country, maybe mom thought the country air would stifle his abusive behavior. It didn't. It all happened again. After the second time (or the second time she found out, who knows how many times it actually happened) , she finally got us out of there and away from him. But the damage was already done.

Fast forward to present me. If I were to describe myself in one word, Anxiety. I have social anxiety, trust issues, self esteem problems. I'm scared. All the time. And most of the time, I couldn't even tell you exactly why. Have been for as long as I can remember. I'm short, 5'3"" when wearing my big boy shoes lol. I graduated from high school weighing around 90 pounds. I've always been so anxious, my stomach literally hurts nonstop. Food has never been something I enjoy because I can never get enough to make myself feel not hungry. The pain was usually too much for me. I would eat just enough to make it another day. 


In spite of everything wrong with me, I found someone who was, I thought, perfect. She was broken in her own way, aren't we all? We fixed each others broken parts, and for the first time ever, I felt whole. Like everything would be ok. My anxiety symptoms, while they never truly went away, I felt were mostly under control. I felt like a person for probably the first time ever. She was amazing. Kind and caring, comforting when I needed a shoulder. And OMG such an amazing cook. Hell, last summer I hit my highest weight ever! I got up to 145! I looked good. I felt good. Married for a while now, kids, good job, house, dog. I was living the American dream. I thought everything was great. 

It all came crashing down last summer, though. She said she wasn't happy, hadn't been for a long time. She said that she had found someone else, and spent the night with him. World as I knew it destroyed, felt betrayed and unwanted. You know the drill. Turns out that she's been in a relationship with this other guy for a while, and it's not going away. Shows no signs of remorse. Unwilling to take steps to fix our marriage. I don't sleep much, and I haven't weighed myself in months, but I can clearly see that I'm losing a dangerous amount of weight. My anxiety symptoms have gotten worse. Obviously, it's time for me to move on. 


Why tell you all this? Because now, I find myself repeating a cycle that started with my mother. There is no physical or sexual abuse. But emotionally, the situation is not safe. I know this, but I'm so scared to take the steps necessary to get out of a bad situation. Financially, I'm not ready. Emotionally, I will likely never be ready. But I know that I need to go. If I don't, I'm going to end up... Well, I try not to think too much about where that would be.

543,what options do i have for help as a minor,"hi im 15 years old and im rlly tired of my mom not caring about my mental health. she treats me like a baby when she suspects im sad (she’ll say things like “are you sad todayy? :(((“ even though she knows i am depressed and have been for years... but anyway) and cares for 1 second when she catches me crying, then its like she forgot about it. i was sexually abused as a child, i KNOW i suffer from depression, disassociation, ptsd, suicidal thoughts, fits of appetite problems (months of starving myself a few days at a time and months of stress eating, and i always feel guilty after eating) and im not sure if i suffer from bpd or c-ptsd, but its definitely one of the two. i know people say you cant self diagnose, but there’s absolutely no other way to understand myself when i have no access to a psychiatrist/therapist. i spend a lot of my time searching for answers about what my symptoms are and what theyre rooted in (most of it stems from trauma as i’ve found) im really at the last straw at this point and i feel like im losing my mind. what sort of options do i have when my parents dont care? thanks

sorry this is very unorganized i just wanted to write this quickly"
544,I don't believe my doctors...,"A few years back a lost some weight, googled my symptoms and HIV came up. I took 10 tests over the course of 14ish months and every one came back non-reactive/negative. 

I was fine, but still not feeling like myself...this past summer I found out biotin COULD interfere with certain assays. So I personally call the lab and talk to two different directors about my tests, they both said the tests I took don't have biotin interference. I then called the lab itself and spoke to a tech who told me he was working there for years and they've used the same test (that doesn't have biotin interfere) but I always wonder if they messed up/maybe were using a test that wasn't FDA approved etc and were
Lying about it.

The only reason why Im questioning it is 1) I don't feel like myself 2) something in my gut is telling me something is wrong...(which could be I just convinced myself something is wrong?) thought?"

547,"WHAT IS GOING ON, PLZ HELP. POSSIBLE PTSD, BURNOUT","I am a senior in college. I am about to graduate in 8 weeks but feel like my body is completely giving out. Since I was 17 it has been nonstop stress. I was in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship when I was 17. He pressured me into sex and I ended up getting pregnant. I was so devastated because I was only in high school. I told one of my closest friends about the pregnancy at the time and he told EVERYONE. The whole time was talking about me and my parents found out about it through the whole town knowing. Everyone knew what I was going through before I got to process it myself. Fast forward, I graduated high school and a month after my son is born I go to college full time while taking care of him. My sons dad still is not involved at all is quite abusive still to me. I am terrified to leave him but end up doing it anyways. I am going through terrible post partum depression. I manage through the whole first year of college whole at a community college. The following school year I transfer to IU while still taking care of my son. During this time, I have been sexually assaulted a couple times and was with someone for a year who was emotionally manipulative and very controlling. He would blame me and make me apologize for things I didn’t do and ignore me for days if he was mad at me. AND my grandparents died in a house fire on my birthday while in school. That was truly traumatic. We had to search through the house to find items afterwards. I never got to deal with and process any of these things that have happened. I have terribly suppressed all of these things. I am scared to trust anyone. I have dealt with such terrible stress and anxiety that I think my body and mind are finally giving out. I think I have PTSD from all of this. I can’t sleep anymore. I think all of these problems manifest subconsciously that I haven’t dealt with and are now coming out because my body knows I am about to be safe. I put my son first because I love him more than anything and want to make sure he is healthy and safe even if that means that I put my issues on hold. I have been doing this for so long that I just feel too burnout. I am having a hard time remembering or processing anything. All the years of so many traumatic things, I don’t know what to do. I also feel shame for the things that have happened to me. I have never openly admitted or talked to anyone about it."
548,burn out+ failure anxiety+ low self esteem= failing education,"Last schoolyear I \[F20\] already was struggling with my anxiety and low self esteem, but somehow made it. Over the summer it found help by a psych. She helped me a lot with al lot of personal issues but is retired now. In the mean time PT-school started again and I am doing worse. They expect more from me as expected but I feel like I can't keep up. During the lessons I am doing fine. Even the practical bits and intership are going way better but when I have my performance assessments my brain shuts down. I make the most illogical decisions, question everything I know and my performance is chaotic and shaky. Even my teachers and fellow students don't understand why I am failing, given the fact that my performances during classes and extra practise are great.  
I don't know what to do anymore. I do NOT want to fail this year.  
I am recognising signs of a burn out since this isn't the first time, but it is the first time it is caused primary by school.  
I know I am not the only one so maybe more can learn from this post.

550,Unable to sleep properly as memories of traumatic incidents keep popping up in mind,"Hi everyone. I could do with some help here. In 2019, I faced a lot of disturbing events and trauma that has caused me to slump into depression and feeling hopeless. I am trying a bit daily to get out of this slump and be hale and hearty and happy. Sometimes the flashbacks of those traumatic and shocking incidents pop up in my mind as I sleep. Sometimes I wake up and cannot sleep again. Sleep is a really important thing for mental well being, and I really need quality sleep as I cannot afford to break down as my family depends on me. I have constant headaches. One trick I have tried is to focus on my breath when I wake up. I dont know how to get over this trauma. Will time repair me? Thank you."
551,"I wrote these notes in preparation for a counselling session, and I thought it would be good/insightful to share them here.","I’m basically wondering if anyone else has had experience with these kinds of things, and if so, if you had any advice? I’m not quite sure how to convey this properly as I’m in a bit of an anxiety state of mind where I can’t really think at my normal level - I’m sure some of you can relate. Anyway, here are the notes:

“Feeling alone:
    - Have a fair few close friends but none doing my course anymore
    - Have always felt disconnected from my parents
    - No matter how much time i spend with friends I feel like I’m drifting away from them
    - Getting closer to my brother but not quite

Feeling like the world isn’t real:
    - Maybe a symptom of anxiety?
    - Derealisation?
    - Less emotion, worrying that even though i’m often more outgoing and energetic than i used to be, that i’m missing social cues and being mean or insensitive

Anxiety:
    - Struggle sleeping at night
    - Fluctuate from outgoing to very socially anxious
    - Have had another panic attack, not quite as bad
    - Felt quite awful the week after last therapy sesh
    - Feeling better about uni because of positive self talk, main worry is whether i can maintain this mental state or level of motivation
    - Health anxiety still in effect, worry about heart sometimes while working out

- Also unsure how normal these things are, often think I’m being dramatic or ‘spiralling’ on purpose to feel special
- Used to (and sometimes still do) get low sleep every night, worried that it’s affected my brain”"

555,How can I cope with losing the one I love,"Hello! I wanted to start this post off by saying that for the longest time ever I was always so sad, I couldn’t feel empathy or any other emotion except for anger and annoyance towards almost every little thing. It had been going on for so long that I even forgot if I could feel emotions at some point before it all started or not. Obviously I didn’t talk about it with anyone because no one around me cared enough to notice anything except for this one guy who sensed something was wrong and would ask me if I was really ok on multiple occasions.

Fast forward to about a month ago, I fell in love with him. He’s a straight male and I’m a straight male and I didn’t notice I was falling in love until I couldn’t stop thinking about him. The thing about this love though is that it wasn’t like any other I’ve experienced, it felt pure and genuine and it really brought light into my world. Starting from then on I started feeling again: happiness, sadness, everything really and I feel like I owe it all to him. (From this I concluded that I might’ve been depressed but I can’t tell for sure as I’m no therapist). 

Anyway, here comes the core of the problem. In less than 3 months, we’re both going our separate ways and we’ll be separated. Whenever I think about that I just get extremely sad because I’m not sure I could stay in the light without him. I’ve only ever said I love you to two people in my life because I only say it when I truly mean it, and he’s one of the people I’ve told. I know it’s going to be hard so I try and make the best of the time we have left by going out with him as much as I can but I feel like that’s just going to make it harder on me when the time comes.

 Should I try and start distancing myself from him or try making him hate me so it’s easier when we’re separated?"
556,"After Stepfathers suicide, I cannot remember what is real."," I love my stepdad. I hate him. He made sure the family was well taken care of and loved so deeply. He was also an alcoholic with anger issues as well as a lot of internal problems he couldn't cope with and took it out on us. 

He always had to make a point. His final words were him making a point and we are almost certain it would have been murder suicide if my mom would have called 911. He said ""I bet you will call 911 for this"" and shot himself just moments after holding a gun to my mothers head, and did so right in front of her. 

She almost certainly has ptsd but while trying to recall memories of the good and the bad, i started to realize I cannot remember what is real. It is causing loads of anxiety. 

I know some of the bad is real. I remember my mother giving me a pistol at 10 years old and asking me to stay up late and watch over the family. I remember him abusing my brother and mother. 

As i rememeber these things I don't know if my brain is victimizing me and making these scenarios up, or if I am vividly remembering them for what they truly are. What can i do? Is this a coping mechanism?


TL;DR: Abusive stepfather died by killing himself in front of my mother. I cannot remember if my memories are real or if I am making some of it up to cope with his death by victimizing myself."
557,I don't know how to live with myself,"I recently embarrassed myself so hard when my ex broke up with me and I keep replaying my actions and words in my head.

The next couple days I texted her trying to get her to talk to me and I further embarrassed myself. I acted like such a pussy and told her I was going to see a psychiatrist to get help over her breaking up with me, and see didn't reply. I just feel so ashamed and humiliated because I know she has told her family and friends (who I met). I think I am at the lowest I've ever been in my life right now."
558,Is My Life Worth Living?,"Right, ok, stupid title, I know 99.9% of respondents will reply “of course your life is worth living” but please, hear me out. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health for about 7 years now, and it’s been severe for about the last 4. I am on medications to help with the issues and I have undertook a course of counselling also, albeit that was about 3 years ago. 

The reason I ask whether life is worth living is because, despite actually having help, I find myself still sliding down the slope - even if the decline has been slowed. I feel like I am going to hit rock bottom regardless, no matter what treatments I am on, and I seriously see no end to the torment that is my life. 

I am gradually becoming unable to do things I once love - for example, attending college has become quite the task, and I am finding myself becoming more and more reluctant to go to work. Eventually, I can see myself ending up homeless as a result of an inability to do things that mean I am economically active and/or in some form of approved, funded education. 

I’m a pretty unsociable person - not by choice. If I could, I would surround myself with a million people, but my brain has always forced up barriers between myself and the rest of the world. I have a few friends, some of them were great friends at one point, but I fear the friendship has fizzled down. I do also have a tendency to push people away the minute a slight issue arises, rather than being able to resolve the issue via communication. 

Then we come onto my selfish, abusive family. The ones who are the root of my depression, heaven forbid I actually tell them that though, they’d never admit that it was the truth. They say my issues aren’t real, that everyone is depressed and fearful of things, that most people just continue to chug along. They berate me, bully me and degrade me for not being able to live a normal life. I have to conceal who I truly am to them (I’m bisexual) due to my father’s frequent casual homophobia. 

What’s triggered these wave of thoughts, you might ask? Well, today my dad told me that he will kick me out by the end of the week if I don’t start acting like a normal person and get over my issues. My family will stick by him out of fear, even if they disagree with his decision. I don’t have any *close* friends who can help me. Emergency housing in my city is an absolute shambles. 

So, yeah, by Saturday, I could be homeless. I’m crying right now. Things have never seemed so bleak and dark. I am really thinking about suicide. All this pain and all these issues could be over in an instant. Easy. 

Is my life worth living? Probably not."
559,"Can anyone relate, or give me some closure.","So recently I've been having a really weird feeling.

560,Do I have some mental problems or is it okay?,"Hello guys, I just want your opinion if it is possible for me to have some mental illnes or is it okay.
Sorry for my bad english, but hopefully you will understand everything what i am going to write over here. 
So,  I [19] am student on high school in Europe. I have a girlfriend of 3 years, I am pretty social type, going somewhere out like every 1 or 2 days. I used to smoke weed every day for about a year, but recently I just smoke on weekends. I don't like drinking heavily because I don't like the effects of alcohol.
So, my problem is not when I am in work, school or with my friends or girlfriend. The problem will come when I am alone, mostly at home, just me and my thoughts. Often when I am home I feel a feeling of emptiness and need to go out somewhere, or feeling the need to smoke some weed, but I got used to live with that and I don't take it as a major problem. 
But sometimes, prolly 1 time in a week when I am alone, me and my thoughts watching some tv series or something I start to have some really bad mood combined with feeling of emptiness. My thought are going back to the time, when my gf cheated on me, but mostly my thoughts are going 4 years back, to the time when my parents did something that I won't ever forgive them(but in front of them I am just trying to live a normal life). It is a feeling of hatred towards them, seeking of some kind of revenge combined with feeling of emptiness and desire to just get high(weed or xans), but I can control that desire because I know how harmful xans can get
 Yea, as i wrote it, it sounds like I have some major mental health problems, but for real, it only happens when I am alone with my thoughts, and that doesn't happen often so that's why I didn't go to some psychiatrist or something and decided to write it over here. 
Could you guys write me your opinion, if it's normal or it's not? And if not, what kind of mental health problems could I have? 
Once again,sorry for my english and thank you for your responds."

And for whatever context is worth, I’m a male high school senior.

Many thanks to anyone who will take the time to read the book that I realize I’ve written lol. Pretty much my life story now that I think of it.

As far as I can tell, I don’t have any good reason to feel bad about my life. My parents and the rest of my family are kind people and have solid relationships with each other (and myself). I have a wonderful girlfriend who is currently a freshman in college. I have a few close friends at school. I’ve always gotten A’s in my classes (with the exception of calculus this year) and have always been a somewhat above average athlete in school sports. I have a good job. I also have a few hobbies that I spend time on when I can. I’ve always been sort of naturally determined to do well in life.

However, the past few months I’ve started to get feelings that I can’t do anything. My grades have still been pretty good, but most of the time when I get home after practice I just don’t want to do anything but sit and veg out. I just feel exhausted, especially during the swim season. I just feel too mentally tired to do homework and, as a result, don’t do it until the last minute. And during this whole process I feel anxious about all the homework that I have but I feel dysfunctional because I don’t do it until last minute and can’t seem to figure it out. I also find myself becoming anxious over larger things like research papers and procrastinate until the absolute last minute. I also tend to shut down, even though I know that the amount of homework that I have is doable. As a result, I often find that I’m up later than I need to be and lose sleep because I don’t like the thought of just not doing my work. I guess this really boils down to me being disappointed with myself because I always procrastinate.
To add to this feeling, calculus has been extremely challenging for me. There’re only four students taking the course, and it’s very clear that I have the least understanding of the material. Math and science have always been the classes that I do the best in and enjoy the most, so this has been quite the blow for me. This has also caused me to pretty much rethink all of my future plans because I had always planned to go to a good college for mechanical engineering, which relies heavily on math and science (especially calc).
My girlfriend knows I’ve been struggling a bit and I really appreciate her efforts to help me, but I feel like sometimes she puts me before herself and that just makes me feel like I’m being selfish. I hate taking away from the positivity that she almost always has.

I’m not struggling with suicide or self harm or anything else severe, like some of the things I’ve read here. This combined with my otherwise perfectly fine life only further makes me question the validity of my feelings. Is this really a big deal? Is this just part of figuring out life? If I’m not having thoughts of self-harm, is it really that big of a deal? It seems like I’m pretty well off compared to a lot of the people on this thread.

Any thoughts are appreciated."
563,Is there a name for this phenomenon?,"Hello, I have a question about something I tend to experience.

So I had a bit of a depressive bout a while back, and one of the symptoms that I had (and has been coming back) is this feeling that I can't breathe. Not like, hyperventilating, but I suddenly become very, very conscious of how hard it is to breathe, and that I have to think about breathing in order to breathe normally. It gets worse when I am with friends or with other people in general, and has been enough at times for me to refuse going out, or coming late to outings. 
I am able to cover it up generally well though; I pretty much had it a few times a week and no one noticed. 

Is there a name for this???? I would like to know, especially as it has been coming back. Thank you!"

565,Help with my Diagnosis!,"Hi! I got diagnosed with ""Major Depressive Disorder on top of Persistent Depressive Disorder"" That's what the doctor said. 

What does it mean? Is it like 2 depressive disorders rolled up into one? How does it work? I was searching about it and can't seem to find anything about it. 

Any clarifications about it would do! Thanks."
566,Need some help helping a friend in need,"Hi everyone,


My best friend of many years has always had pretty severe mental issues, and has been in and out of mental hospitals, on various antimanic meds, antidepressant meds, antianxiety meds, you name it. He is Bipolar Depressive, and will have spurts of extreme sadness and despair, and spurts of extreme happiness and energy. 

Recently, he had been in a pretty good place mentally after moving states to live much closer to me. However, he has been experimenting with his sexuality because he felt like he was missing something by being straight, and has since decided he is bisexual.

Well, the other night he was raped (not full on restrained sex, but uncomfortable actions where ""no"" did not resonate) by a man (similar age) in his own apartment. Before this man left, after a physical struggle, he decided to drug my friend by placing DMT (or so my friend thinks) underneath a layer of marijuana, so that it looked like a normal bowl. He hit it when the guy left, and started tripping out, says everything looked like teeth and like an alternate dimension.

For those of you that dont know, DMT is the chemical released in your brain during death in humans. Not something you really want to experience until that time comes.

Anyways, he is extremely shaken up by the whole thing, and has only gotten worse since the incident. He hasnt been sleeping much and has been regularly hallucinating because of it, drinking too much, and having people over constantly for sex to i guess try to cope and regain his sexual empowerment. Im not sure. But i am having a very hard time getting through to him, hes just not very responsive to my words, and if he does seem to get a bit better, hes back at square 1 the next morning. This is getting exhausting for me, as he is also my business partner and i greatly rely on him to produce work. Our jobs are not interchangeable ao I cant just pick up slack when he struggles like this, but im depending on him to produce so we can make money.

I just dont know what to do in this situation, and need help navigating the options I have. 

I have reached out to his parents (in another state) to have them give him a call as I think talking to his loved ones might be able to help level him out, so he knows there are others besides me that care about him. Im his only real friend.

Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide"
567,too close to suicide,Not a minute goes by where I don't think about jumping off a biulding. I'm close to the end I can feel it. does anyone have any positive words to keep us all going?
568,How to overcome trauma caused by the person you loved and trusted the most?,"About 4 months ago i was in a situation where i was traumatized by the person dearest to me, a person i cared for the most. It was really unexpected and happened out of the blue. On top of that the person made remarks about my body that shattered my self esteem and ego. No need to say this experience destroyed our relationship. The person who hurt me moved on like nothing happened and i am still reliving that particular moment everyday 4 months later. Ive been depressed, ive been suicidal, ive  tried proffesional help, unfortunetly nothing seem help. Please give me some advice on how to cope with this."
569,I feel nothing or everything,"Sometimes I just get this wave of bad thoughts and this feeling of almost emptiness.
But then I'll be there laying bed, thinking about all the shit I've done and what a waste of space I am, I'll feel very alone and unwanted in the moments. And then it's like someone flips a switch in my head and I go from feeling like nothing to hating myself so much that I slam my head or fists repeatedly into the wall or I'll just bite myself and I won't even realize I'm doing it until I feel the pain. 
There's just something wrong with me"
570,I think I'm ready,"I don't know how many people are going to see this but I wanna get it off my chest. After retaining my self-hatred feelings and depressing thoughts from sixth grade to current 19 y/o me, I think I'm finally ready to try therapy. I've been hesitant to, mostly because I'm afraid of being looked at/treated differently and just the unknown part of therapy in general. It's probably not a super big step for some, but a giant one for me :). I'm just so mentally exhausted from masking what's going on in my head and not letting anything out. I went through so many years of crying, hurting myself, coping wrong, and worse, that it's just really taken a toll on me. I really hope things go well, because I just wanna have a normal working head instead of one convincing me to hate myself. Thank you for anyone that reads this, I just wanted to let somebody know."
571,Why is self-care so exhausting ?,...
572,Just wanted to share,"Just to preface this post, I'm not suicidal, nor have I experienced any suicidal ideations. I'm just down in the dumps a lot, which I'll explain.

I'm in the military. My wife was unable to move with me on my last PCS for reasons not relevant to the story. Our marriage is in tact, it's nothing along that line.

I have a son. He's 18 months. My first, and likely only child (she has kids from a previous marriage). I've seen him for a total of 27 days (I counted) since I moved (it's been 8 months since I moved). Visits are hard on us both, because it's a matter of who it's more convenient for to do the traveling. It's a long way from where I am to where my family is, the burden of travel is both in time in finances. It's a pain, but I can't not see my family. 

Anyway. Since I've been away, I find myself... well, just sad an awful lot. Sometimes I don't want to leave my house. I have some friends in the area, but I'm not interested in going anywhere. I just want to sit around, play video games, watch Netflix, stuff like that. I have a dog, but she only goes so far in keeping me company. I've tried picking up other hobbies to keep busy, but at the end of the day I find myself wanting to share my hobbies and experiences with my wife and son rather than doing it alone. That usually sends me right back into a funk.

The aspect of deteriorating mental health is new to me. I've never felt like this. We get all sorts of training in the military on how to deal with it, but it's new territory and I'm just scared for myself. 

To the point. The other night, my wife sent me a video of my son. God, I miss him so much. I was happy to see him walking around, but I was overwhelmed with sadness, like usual. I need to see these pictures and videos of my son, but at the same time it fucking hurts, you know? Watching him grow from afar is not how I imagined I'd be experiencing fatherhood. (My wife understands the pain, as she's been through something similar with her own kids before we got married.) I saved some screenshots of the video and sent a few to my friend, and we got to talking about when I'd be able to go home and visit again. We started chatting about some other random stuff, then after about a 10 minute break in the conversation, she tells me something to the effect of ""you're an incredible person and I wouldn't be where I am today without you."" I can't tell you how much that helped. I just sat there and cried for a few minutes. My self worth has never really been so fragile, and for someone to remind me of the impact I've had on their life was just what I needed. So I confessed to her that I've been struggling with my mental health lately and her message really lifted my spirits.

I've been feeling pretty good since then, and I'm going to see my family in a few weeks. Hopefully I can keep riding this wave of positivity until I get home.

Thanks for reading. It felt good to share.

TL;DR - been struggling with happiness lately, miss my son; my friend randomly praised me for being such a presence in her life, snapped out of funk and feel good for now."
573,Out of touch with reality,I am a 16 year old girl. I have a wonderful boyfriend of almost a year now. I no longer have suicidal thoughts and do not self harm. He has taught me to love myself and how to love. Everything is going amazing. This summer he is getting me out of my house because it is a hellhole. I need to get out. I have a place to go and everything so that is not an issue anymore. But I feel so out of touch with reality. I feel like everyone is fake and like it’s all a dream. I forget things super easily from my childhood and entire past and time goes by either super fast or super slow. I just got off of Fluoxetine because it made me even more depressed. I don’t know what’s going on but I want to stop it because I want what’s best for me and my amazing boyfriend. Sorry if this seemed kinda shitty but I do not have more time to type so I did it super super quick. If anyone has any questions or can help please let me know!
574,My worst bully got suspended,"As the title says ""my bully got suspended""

It is the happiest day of my life!
No one would want to bully me now bc they are too scared.

I suffered of depression and anxiety since primary school bc of bullying. Now they can't bring me down anymore!"
575,My Psychiatrist is taking me off Ritalin and I don’t want that,"To keep it short, I take Ritalin and Prozac since for 5 months, I’m 22 and I’m well mentally but actually living better than ever but I don’t like change and that actually is just not wanting to top the boat while it’s smooth. Anyway, I have always been thin it runs in my blood everyone is thin with my family, and she has not weighed me and I am certain the record on file is not correct also but regardless yeh I love being skinny and Ritalin can have this effector make it worse but Im also not skin and bone without presenting big headed I’m very cut, and was cut before as I train and work out not wanting to be “Big” I want to look lean I also eat all day all night, not always healthy and not always proper meals but I love food and I eat if I want the thought of feeling negative around food has never once entered my mind’ but my mum who I don’t even communicate much called my doctor saying she is concerned I’m not coping I’m not well and I have lost alt if weight and now my doctor is begging a reduce schedule for me to come off. 
I hate her like hate hate already and I know what she is playing, never been there for me once and if I spit bars on it she will then pretend she is a good mother by saying how “worried she feels” when actually I will never hear from the lass she is doing it because she feels guilty not for never caring but because she doesn’t like the idea of people hearing about it, the other is that what happens? This non stimulant med is meant to resemble a tic tac with improvement for adhd between stimulant so I don’t want that I don’t even have the free up to wait over a month for it to work only to monitor how well I works i am pretty much worthless to the company I’m staff for because of the type of role if mans head is not in the game but also is weight loss that serious to risk mental health and work etc? Like I could bet I am a low scale bmi but not even near like where I look unwell? Can they even do this without me saying I’m comfortable? I wouldn’t even fight it without seeming like I’m addicted or something?"
576,I really don't want to be diagnoised,"I've posted around a couple of times about my mental health. I am undiagnosed but I have a couple of friends who have mental illnesses like depression and other things. We got talking about their journey and they started to point out that I reminded them of when they were undiagnosed going through the same behavior ""problems"" I guess. My lack of emotion. My avoidance of most people including family. My irritability even though nothing should have gotten me so vexed. My lack of empathy for really anything. They though maybe I was going through something as well and said ""It might do you some good to get evaluated. If there is nothing we are just worrying. If there is, it's better to find out now before something bad happens"". I can understand that because they have had a couple family members not get treated and it didn't end well for anyone. But I don't really want to. I don't talk to anyone about how I feel really. Not even family. i wouldn't be able to do that with a doctor and next thing I know I have like 7 diagnosis. I know I'm not ""normal"" like everyone usually is (lol I'm not like other girls), but I don't want to be the ""abnormal"" girl in the family. If that makes sense."
577,My bf may have an Eating Disorder,"I'm really worried about him. He's been obsessed with having a flat stomach for the past year. He starves himself all day then has a small meal at night. Before he eats, he goes on 2 hour jogs. His small meals are never over 300 calories. He was already very skinny before he adopted this diet and exercise routine.

He's lost over 20 lbs and is borderline underweight. He claims he looks better with lean muscle instead of bulky muscle. To me, he looks like his body is eating itself. He's got no muscle mass. His hair is falling out because he's not getting any nutrients from his meals. His face looks hollow and he Never has energy for anything else other than this daily routine.

His mom isn't helping either. She is continously telling him to eat less if he wants to lose weight. She's a dance instructor for ballet and tap. The diet and exercise routine mentioned above is what she survives on when she's getting ready for a show. This isn't her regular diet but, he's been following it for just about a year now. I'm really worried he's going to end up dead. He weighs less than 120 lbs at 5'5"". 

Unfortunately, I no longer live with him due to family emergency so we're long distance at the moment. At least when I lived with him, I could convince him to eat more but, now that I'm not there he's getting worse. I don't know what to do. I'm honestly really scared."

579,I feel so worthless and insecure out of nowhere,"I get really bad bouts of it. It's been happening for years. The first time I remember it being awful I was seeing this guy who was a complete dick. He was rude, would leave me on read for days if not weeks at a time, didn't reply if he didn't feel like it, was basically just using me for sex. I was naive and inexperienced and went along with it until I couldn't handle it anymore and I ghosted him. But for *months* afterwards I missed him, and have only now been able to accept he wasn't a nice person to me. I thought it had to be something I'd done. 

Then I met another guy, and he was so sweet. He made me feel so safe and secure and I thought I was well on my way to falling in love. About 4 months in my insecurities started again, it's like my gut could tell something was coming. 3 weeks ago he told me he was in love with someone else and couldn't be with me anymore. I fell to pieces. I've self-harmed on and off for about a year, but after he told me this I cut myself more than I ever have before. I bruised my knuckles punching the walls. I couldn't eat, I drank all day, I was just a mess for about a week. I was miserable. 

I started to feel better, and I was glad of that. But I think I was just keeping myself busy so I didn't have to think about it all. I was going out a lot, seeing my friends, I slept with this random guy off Tinder (I was trying the whole get over someone by getting under someone new). The last few days are the first times I've had nothing to do and no one to see and I keep having these clouds settle over me. I just sit and cry, I want to hurt myself sometimes. I'm just so sick of feeling like this and I don't know what the fuck to do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried everything to handle it healthily - exercise, meditate, eat well, talk to someone, hang out with friends, think positive thoughts and mantras - but it always comes back. Now I'm even sending myself under because this boy from Tinder has started taking longer to reply -- I signed up to a casual thing, and now that it's too casual I'm taking it as another sign nobody wants me. I just don't know why tf I'm like this"
580,"I don’t want to seek help, but feel like I might need it.","I’m using a throwaway account as this is private and I don’t want this to be connected to my main account.

My mother is clinically depressed, and has suffered with it since I was born. 

I 19 (M), have been caring for my younger brother for the past few months, as well as cooking, cleaning, shopping, and generally running the house.

She’s had a few relapses in the past but this time it’s lasted longer than ever. 

I’ve been coping quite well, but it feels like the situation is taking its toll on me now; I’m constantly worrying about her and my brother. I’m starting a new job soon because I need the money, but that’ll mean I won’t be around to help, and I don’t want to leave my brother with my mother.

Aside from the problems I’ve got at home, my personal life feels lacking and dreary. I’ve lost most of my friends over the past few years and haven’t had a relationship in a long time, so I have no one to confide in, talk to about my emotions, or even to hug (aside from my little bro). 

I’ve always been a worrier and quite a pessimist person. Lately I’ve been feeling anxious, and for the past two years I’ve had no motivation and have been feeling apathetic. 

I hope I’m not having mental health issues too. Should I talk to a doctor about these feelings? I really don’t want to, but if I am having problems with mental health I’d like to do something before it gets worse."
581,My mum won't let me take medication,"I have pretty bad anxiety, which makes it quite hard for me to sleep most days. I'm also under a lot of stress which worsens my anxiety and its so bad it's to the point where I hallucinate sometimes.
My therapist wants me to take sleeping pills and/or some pills to just calm me down, but im only 16 so I can't legally take them on my own, I have to have my parents permission and well my mum doesn't want me to take pills, ever.

So guess imma kill myself cause I can't keep doing this anymore"
582,I don't want to be strong anymore,"I'm 21 M, I'm ready to die and I don't want to be here. My trauma has taken my life hostage. I was abused for most of my childhood, I was held hostage at gunpoint when I was 15, my best friend took his life when I was 17, my dad unexpectedly passed away a month before I turned 18, and in December of 2019, my little brother took his life and I found his body. I never got to say goodbye. Everybody seems to praise me for being strong through all of my personal trauma, but I don't want to be strong anymore. I have to be the one to take care of everybody's emotions. No one takes care of mine. I'm tired."

584,I am confused why I do this,"I don't understand why but when I meet someone or sometimes just see them I have the urge to find everything about them. Most times I know their full name, address, hobbies, friends/family connections, and workplace before they even introduce themselves to me. I never did anything malicious with this info and just forget it when once I learn them. I never stalked them physically or harassed/blackmailed for this information, I usually sweet talk them or their friends into spilling it or use social media. I found that I never discriminated or target anyone type of person. Why do I do this?"
585,Intrusive thoughts or voices?,"I have two different “people” in my mind that  have conversations about me in an abusive way and tell me terrible things about myself. One is distinctly male, and one is distinctly female. They address me as “you”, and I don’t control them. I can’t make them stop, and I have no control over what they say what they say. However, they do not have the same quality of “sound” as people I actually talk to, and I can always tell that no one else can hear them. They are almost thought-like, and when I’m distracted or heavily concentrating on something, they often go away. I don’t hear them in the same way that I hear people talking to me. I’m trying to figure out where they really come from and why they’re in my mind, but I’m actually unsure whether they would count as intrusive thoughts or voices. Recently they’ve become far “louder” and more unpleasant. I’m 19 and have been “hearing” them occasionally for about two years. Does anyone have experience with this? Is it worthwhile to categorize them, and does it suggest anything about my mental health?"
586,Up and down,Who else is diagnosed with depression and finds themselves going in and out of depressive episodes and happy motivated and sometimes hyperactive moods throughout the year?
587,How do you deal with imposter syndrome?,"I’m currently looking to complete my bachelors in mental health and it’s really the best decision I’ve made. I’ve written about a lot of interesting topics and I think those who suffer from various conditions can make really good mental health professionals because they understand how it feels to go through something like that. 

But I can’t help but feel like I’m not good enough to do this. But I also suffer a lot from self doubt and its because I’ve often been told or had it implied to me that I can’t accomplish something. It hurt for a while but I’ve been trying to believe in myself and take more risks. Lately I’m having waves of feeling really confident and then feeling inadequate all of a sudden. 

Today I got a really good result on one of my undergraduate papers and the professor even told me I hit the mark. But immediately after I was thinking to myself, “Am I smart enough to ask for a recommendation?” “I’ve been doing really well but did he only say that to me because I’m average compared to everyone else but performed well?”

How do you cope feelings of imposter syndrome and believing in yourself? Are there any exercises anyone can recommend to me? I’m just now starting to address it after having a fight with my family about being implied as inadequate lol."
588,hospitalization experiences,"

I was hospitalized for five days in an inpatient unit in the military three years ago for suicidal ideation and it was hell on earth for me. But in the past week or so I’ve been extremely depressed and suicidal, worse than I was then, and I don’t know what to do. The inpatient units around me have terrible reviews and I’m scared of asking my parents for help. I don’t know if I should go to the ER or what to do anymore."
589,"I feel like I am changing, and it's not feeling good, has anybody ever felt the same?","It's been a weird couple of days
I've been feeling kind of disconnected from reality, only slightly but definitely noticeable and worrying, for about 2 days. It felt a bit like I was high, but without the fun part only the weird feeling (I don't do weed anymore). I also felt demotivated and also stressed cause I knew something is happening to me and I was scared.

Then I had some kind of paranoia attack or smth on the night of the third day of feeling weird, it was cause I read abt someone having a dream within a dream and for the rest of the night I felt like I have never felt before, I've never felt that much paranoia and fear like then, I just calmed down and tried to sleep after an hour.

The feeling of life being less real than before, the one from the first 2 days, became less over the next week, but still now I feel stressed and discomfort mixed with demotivation and a bit of sadness every evening about 3 hours before going to sleep. The stressed feeling is followed by slight stomach pain that feels just like that you get when you're really really nervous. But school is going well atm, family is drama free and loving, I'm healthy, nothing to be stressed about.

Now some days I wake up in the morning with absolutely no stomach pain and feeling normal, that lasts til like 7pm. Other days I wake up with stomach pain and completely demotivated and unhappy. 

I am writing this because until about two weeks ago I was happy, every day, I am generally a really happy person, avoid drama and live a great life. People said I was smiling every time they saw me, and thats probably cause I das purely happy. Now that I don't feel like that, I am worried because this has never happened to me before. 

I'll probably be feeling good again in a month max., I decided on posting this just so I had everything written once, and maybe somebody actually has this happen to himself/herself too. Rn I'm just worried but living, god still helps me daily and I'm thankful.

This happened over the course of about two weeks. I'm a student in 10th grade if that's of importance.

If you read this, thanks so much it means a lot.

I'll probably be adding an update to this in like a month

Have a good one to the person reading this :)

TL:DR Life feels less real than usual, I feel stressed every evening/night for no reason, has anybody ever felt the same, if so what helped?"

593,Love is all there is (Self-love &amp; Forgiveness),"**The opening of the heart chakra is the sudden realization that love is all there is and that no matter what happens we can never be separated from it.**

This is the knowingness that you are always loved and that there is nothing that you need to forgive cause you’re already free by nature.

Our perceptions will play tricks to us by making us believe that “separation” is real, this will create in the mind the need of love because we now believe that is missing

Other times we feel an inability to forgive, this happens because we’re attached to the past experiences, we don’t want to let go of them cause they “define” us

The solution here is always Awareness, cause this is indeed the ultimate medicine

Try to bring Awareness in the bodily sensation of tension and dive deep in the emotional pain, here we’re simply exploring while resting more and more into Awareness, which is never affected by any emotions or thoughts

Thanks to this process you’ll discover more of your innate freedom think that will support the opening of the heart chakra through which it will be clear and experiential that love is all there is

594,Please i need help,"I dont even know where to start. I just really need your responses. i have written this post so many times, and got few of them.

First of all, i just want to mention that this post is going to include questions about mental health, and if your response is going to be to see a therapist just dont even bother replying. Its not about money, there are some other reasons and also i dont think that this problem is to an extend where i need one. I would really appreciate each and every respond of yours, since it can help a lot.

Basically. I developed a thought that theres something wrong with me. I think that its on an unconscious level, like even if im not thinking about it, my actions still can be affected by this mindset. It doesnt make me depressed or anything like that, it could be just me being paranoid, or just a teen. But around couple of months ago, the thought came back. It used to come and go but didnt use to bother me that much, maybe for a day max.

But couple of months ago i started considering that i might be on the spectrum. The thing is that if being logical, it doesnt make sense at all, since i got no symptoms of it at all. But for example, hours ago i literally believed that it was true, regardless the logic.

Okay as i said it started months ago, i even remember the day. The next day i had uni, basically it bothered me for that day and after that it went away. Being around people definitely helps, because i dont feel any different, i even tend to think that im above others and even seperate myself from them.

Basically, yea it hasnt bothered me for probabily months, and then the one month break came. I, for particular reasons, ended up with no close friends (it happened probably 2 years ago, when i fell out with my school friends). Even tho at uni i literally got to know to everyone, became the most popular, cuz i definitely dont struggle socially, cuz of different factors i did not manage to make close friends. I mean we still talk to each other, but not outside uni, we only went out couple of times, thats it. But yea, the point is that i ended up alone.

Have Been alone the whole month, and obviously it doesn't help my paranoia. I havent felt completely peacful ever since. This thought kills me. Its not that im depressed, but i question myself a lot, and as i said i even sometimes believe that i have the condition.

I dont even know what to do anymore. My only hope now, is the break to end, tho it happens in 2 weeks. But what should i do till then? My mind keeps clinging on my negative memories, and tries to somehow connect it to the condition, and no matter how ridiculous it is i have moments as i said where i totally start believeing it. Well, its not that im at home all the time. I go to gym everyday, but obviously it doesnt help much.

I don't know what it is. Am i psychotic cuz of loneliness? I haven't felt like a part of group in a while as i said? Or is it just my age? I just turned 18. No matter how many times i tell myself that this thought doesnt make any sense, i just cant help but believe it sometimes.

Being around peope, hopefully will solve this problem, because it is making me insane. As i said the first time i considered it was months ago, and after being around people, feeling that im no different, the thought dissapeared.

Obviously, the fact that i even developed this thought is not healthy. I even used to think that there was something wrong with me and my parents and everyone were hiding it from me, tho obviously it doesnt make sense too, because of how im treated. Is it a part of being 18? Like i have not felt normal, in so long. Its like ""theres got to be something wrong with me."" What do i do? Im tired of going thru this cycle, i obviously dont have it. But i know that maybe even tomorrow i might feel otherwise. I really need your help."
595,I'm afraid that I might be getting evil thoughts,"So over the weekend my roommate went out with his friends and got hit by a car that got him sent to the ER with two skull fractures and a concussion. Naturally, after I found out, a couple of our mutual friends and I went to visit him at the hospital. If I'm going to be completely honest I was almost HOPING deep down in my mind that he was going to be in a much worse condition than he happened to be, and felt kind of let down when I saw him in a much better state than I expected. I was obviously aware of the fact that this thought was very wrong and malicious, but I just couldn't help to think it. In the past I have had apathetic reactions to the deaths and injuries of people who I've known personally. The only people I would really care about losing is my immediate family, and very close friends, no one else. Could this be indicative of underlying personally traits or conditions? I feel like these feelings that I get are almost sociopathic in nature."
596,Am I wierd if I don’t like exercise?,I don’t like exercise. I know I need it but I don’t like it. Is this normal?
597,Would claiming suicide ideation get me treatment?,"I have crippling symptoms of social anxiety and major depression. 

A few times throughout my life I have worked up the strength to force myself to go a doctor or a specialist for help. 

The first couple visits are absolute torture to me and it’s always a situation where it’s going to be countless visits before any actual treatment will be discussed or the topic of medication can be broached. I seldom go back for even the second appointment. Is is absolute torture. 

I want to believe medication would help me balance out to something closer to neurotypical, and then maybe talk therapy or CBT might be an option, but from where I am now, it is nothing but psychological cruelty. 

My question here is, if I tell them up front that I am in a suicidal crisis, will they be forced to initiate pharmaceutical treatment without the months and months of psychological torture before they administer it?"
598,How is it fair,"How is it fair that so many people just do not face consequences for their actions? Especially when I suffer mine. I accept my faults, my shortcomings, and am going through immense pain everyday because of my past actions. But why do people who lie, throw others under the bus and then act like the victim suffer no consequences? Literally looking at these people everyday makes me sick. My heart sinks and I cannot breath anymore. When you give everything to someone, consider them one of your closest friends and they get away with everything because they put on a good show. It hurts."
599,"I'm crying one minute, and overly confident the next","Not quite sure whats wrong with me, but I'm sick and tired of it. I know I have been depressed since I was a very young child. Divorce, abuse, addiction, poverty will do that to a kid... Im the oldest of 8 kids, which has been the cause of most of my stress

But my mental health has severely declined in the past 6 months. Im either calling off work, and crying in my bed, or walking around thinking Im hot-shit. Im either depressed, or overly confident. There is no in-between.
Trying to afford college (yet failing to do so) has been my biggest problem. 

Its like my emotional state changes on a dime. I experience both ends of the spectrum, sometimes within 20 minutes. Im getting tired of it. I have never been to a therapist or a psychologist, mainly due to financial reasons.

What could be wrong with me?"
600,really really struggling,"i have no control of my mood at all anymore it changes so frequently 

all my friendships have spiralled into really deep ones and literally my friends are 5 people i have super intense conversation with and then  everyone else is sort of just there for me and i feel so bad about it

i get too fucking angry sometimes and that’s probably cuz i have like no impulse control anymore i just do things"
601,Job advice ?,"Hello all! 

It’s my first time posting here so please let me know if I violate any rules!

I recently started as a temp for a tv show I really enjoy, and I’ve been wanting this kind of job for the longest time! The only problem is it’s 60 hours per week, 12 hours per day Monday through Friday. It often goes past 12 hours as well, depending on the needs of the office. 

I’m only on my 3rd day and I feel so so drained mentally and physically. The work itself isn’t hard but the commute is over an hour every morning (LA traffic). Plus the 12 hours, I feel like it might be too much. 

I heard from another assistant they might offer me a full time position, which would have been my dream job had it not been for the hours. 

Additionally, I meet with my therapist once a week in the middle of the day (that’s the only time he’s available), and if I take the job I wouldn’t be able to meet with him and I have to stay in therapy in my current situation. 

I don’t know what to do. This could jump start my career but it would mean 60 hours per week for 9 months. 

Any advice and help would be appreciated, if you need more information about my situation please ask! 

TLDR: job that could jumpstart my career requires 60 hour weeks and I don’t know if I can do that in my current mental health situation."
602,Mood swings,"Ive had depression for most of my life or at least been at some state of it, it is not always bad,there really are days when I don't feel it.  I (25 F) realized that my emotions mostly depend on the emotions of other people I truly care about and how they feel and depend on the environment.

I have days when I feel okay,  not super happy, not depressed, just okay. Then I have days when I feel great for no specific reason, I feel ""high"" in energy, I sleep less, I feel motivated, active, have great confidence, high sex drive, I am social, I like to talk, I feel like I can do anything, be at the top of the world etc. I do not have delusions or something like that. These days kick in for no specific reason, at the same day I can feel pretty low and then all of the sudden I entry into that ""life is great  I am great,"" stare of mind. Also, I can fall out of it into the ""depressed"" state for some reason :
(pretty small one) or for no reason at all. 

I sleep longer, feel tired, i am less active,  have really low sex drive, I am unmotivated, lot of procrastinating, I am easily irritated, less social, I cry sometimes, stop doing hobbies that I usually love, feel pretty down etc. I want to say I do NOT have suicid thoughts in this state most of the time, I did before but It was while I was in a big depression, I am not anymore. 

What could it be? I am tired of feeling great for few days or weeks so that just a second after all of the sudden I just want to lay in my bad and sleep and be alone. I want to help myself but I cant. I like my ""happy"" period though, I wish it could be a constant one. Because of this I sometimes feel like I have two personalities, not because I feel like two different people, I have a sense of my identity but because I am both just at the different times."
603,I get worse as the months go by.,"Hi all!

My name is Gwen, and I'm 17! I have come to this sub to get all this off my chest. 

For the past year, I have been unusually bitter, angry, explosive, and often switch between emotions. I used to have a normal rate of getting upset and having it pass within a few hours, but this time? It's different. 

I became so explosive I began to abuse my boyfriend. While talking to him, I would be absolutely the most pleasant and lovable person, flooding him with sweet compliments and telling him I loved him... and then I'd just start screaming and crying and accusing him of horrible things, I'd threaten both him and myself, and I'd even throw things. This was a matter of *minutes* now, not even hours. Some days he wasn't even doing anything. I'd insult him and verbally degrade him, and then a wave of pity and remorse would flood my system and I'd become so soft again. And then it started to follow me to school and work. I used to be so friendly, and now I get so irritated for the tiniest things. I blurted out ""bitch!"" to a girl who was in my way when I was walking. I talk back to my coworkers now. I am more prone to punching/cutting/kicking/breaking whatever I can find in my room, valuable or not. I have been known to forget after intense arguments or high pressure situations, as told my my boyfriend, which is worrying. 

Some days I feel like there is nothing in life that could possibly help me. I am tired, I am lost, and I don't want to keep waking up every day. I don't know what to do."
604,Major Depression and Adjustment disorder diagnosis?,I was diagnosed with major depression a few years ago. I also just got diagnosed with adjustment disorder due to a loved one dying. I’m just confused about this diagnosis because I thought major depressive disorder rules out adjustment disorder. Was I wrongly diagnosed?
605,Am I disabled?,"Hello, I been wondering if I'm disabled. I have schizophrenia, OCD, BPD and high functioning depression. 

The thing is, I assist to school normally as any other student, but I have to take breaks in the middle of the classes, and I have to wear earplugs on breaks because loud sounds hurts my ears and my brain.

Also, my parents are doing paperwork to give me a  disability certificate so they don't have to pay for my psychologist, but they say it's only a formality.

Anyway, thank you for reading!! And hope you are doing well 

Sorry for my bad English."
606,Is it okay to give up some times?,"I am tired. All of my life people have told me to never give up. To be subborn and never give up. So I did and I achieved many things I wanted to achieve. However I wonder, isn't it okay to give up for once? Even if a great opportunity slips through my fingers. Can I not just give up for once? It might be a life changing opportunity indeed. While I really want to take this opportunity, I am tired. Tired of being stubborn and doing my best. I just want to rest for a while."
607,bipolar and depression,"hi, my boyfriend has bipolar disorder and depression what can i do to help him? i am trying to be patient but i need more advice"
608,Starving but no appetite recently...feel constantly nauseous,"I’ve only had this problem one other time and it was freshman year of college at 18. I was stressed to the point of having no appetite.

Now I’m 23 years old and it’s happening again. I had a period of time where I was having issues in my relationship with fighting and violence. After that ceased, this started. I’m constantly sleeping too. The sleeping has improved a bit but the eating issue remains.

I want to eat really badly and I’m genuinely very hungry but I have a pit in my stomach...anyone else? Any remedies? I’m nervous to go to a therapist"
609,what do I do,"hey. 

i have been feeling like a waste a space. sometimes i can't cope well and I honestly feel like im failing the 2 subjects im taking in school. i cant do the presentations needed for some of the units or even practise presentations. It's given me so much anxiety that I don't turn up to lesson anymore that i know will be involving presentations for that lesson in fear of getting upset. my teachers hate my guts over it. 

i have this one support teacher but she is also busy with other students. ive emailed her quite a few times just to ask when i can speak to her (over another issue) but she hadn't had time to get back to me and i honestly feel ignored and alone. she sees everyone else within a day or two but with me i never see her and can't have the chance to talk to her. it makes me feel like shit and that she hates me. i havent got anyone else to talk to either. 

if i dare say that i feel like shit she says she might have to call my parents cus shes worried about me and its my worst fear as my parents don't support my mental health. they think i shouldnt have mental health issues as my sisters are fine. 

i don't want to exist anymore but i don't want to die. i just want to be normal like everyone else in my class. everyone else can do presentations without missing lessons or being sick. everyone else can talk in group activities. 

my friend hates how i get upset over the things I cant change. tho most of my mental health i could change, theres something i cant unfortunately and it was about that. i think that the thing has rocked me over and that's why im like this. i was having an alright day up until that moment and then i felt sick after it happened. 

i feel like i should email her because there's no way im going to her session tomorrow (just goes over news for the week at school) but im too much of a waste of space to even be cared about so why should I?"
610,Getting out of a funk,I don't know why but I just feel really down today. Last couple of days have been good but all I want to do today is sleep and eat. I have heaps of uni work to do but I am struggling to make myself do it. Don't know how to get out of this funk.
611,"I have a problem with thinking the worst possible thoughts during any situation, horrible thoughts, if I try to ignore them they get louder.",
612,I think I have a social disorder,"I’m extremely shy to go and talk about people cause I think they will feel like I’m boring, stupid, cheeky or Annoying.
When someone talks to me and asks a little complicated question I often gets nervous, stressed, anxious and sweaty.
I’m afraid to talk in public and I’m very unsure about everything I think of.
I’m very nervous when I’m called out to answer a question in front of a crowd and I get really stressed.
Is this a social disorder or a normal thing
PS: I’m in my teens"
613,Im terrified,"Im scared about what im gonna do after school, i dont have any friends, no girlfriend, no idea at a job, everyone i know is gonna say ""i was like you too"" or whatever and end it with some ""now i have this and that"" but i just cant see myself in any way like that ever. Im not suicidal but there is quite literally no reason ever in anyway  for me to keep living, there is nothing ive ever wanted more than to have friends or people around me that care."
614,"How do you know if you're faking the whole derealization/depersonalization thing? Bc I honestly can't tell, please help","Like it could be one of those existential crises right? Idk, all I know for sure is my body feels a little numb(like I can feel things if I hit hard enough but it's like that very top layer of skin that doesn't feel pain has tripled in thickness?), And that my mind refuses to accept my memories as actually being me(like I know it happened in this body but there's no way it was me that did those things, this happens for both childhood memories and things that happened mere hours before), sometimes my family will feel foreign to me, and sometimes I'll stop recognizing my voice in the middle of my sentences.

 I can't tell if I'm bringing on the feeling of being having a mind and body that are separate/not knowing where my consciousness is, if I'm the mind, the body, or neither, it's so hard to explain but I'll just stop knowing who I am, and I'll feel like I'm someone that's a different ethnicity than me? And different age? But not in a DID sort of way.

I can't tell if I'm faking or not because it wouldn't make sense for this to suddenly start happening a month ago without anything triggering it, also I'm able to distract myself from it/forget about it then my heart starts its palpitations when I come to be aware of it again, it's so on and off and I don't feel like I'm watching myself from above though I do feel like I'm an animated character/in a game? Idk! Please help me out, I haven't been able to comfortably think about myself without experiencing this for over a month now, and maybe I've just made it up and have conditioned myself to feel this way?

Also something that really doesn't make sense is how my right arm especially doesn't feel like my own and if I'm moving it too fast I start feeling this again which sounds like absolute bullshit right?"
615,"The Suicidal Thoughts are climbing back in, I am in disbelief and dismay, but it's becoming a reality.","The odds of any of us ever being born are 1 to 400 trillion. 

The odds that I missed 25-30 basketball shots in a row, on May 18, 2010. at the age of 14, it's probably about the same misfortune. 

Just Imagine rolling Snake Eyes with a pair of dice 25 to 30 times in a row (consecutively). 

After this mentally deteriorating event, I began practicing and playing basketball more than I normally would have cared to do to the negative criticism I had received circa the fall 2011 in Grade 11. 

I did not know how to even shoot a ball properly, nor with properly taught how to dribble. 

I was a terrible basketball player in September of 2011.I would often get into fights and arguments with people when they were just trying to tell me the truth. 

Now, fast forward to Grade 12 in the 2012-2013 season. 

I was never a real good dribbler and never will be. 

But I sure as hell could fucking shoot, when I practice every single fucking day in the fall of 2011 winner of 2012 and spring of 2012. 

They don't say practice makes perfect for fucking nothing.

I love scoring threes, my favourite spot to shoot from would be the three-point line. 

I practiced very frequently. 

I wasn't quite Kobe (RIP), but my performance had improved exponentially where I was exceptionally better than what it would have been just 14 to 16 months prior. 

I also enjoy just playing scrimmage or with a group of friends (8-12 of us) and we would always just play at the courts over the summer of 2013, and it was a very enjoyable time."
616,My hands shake when I talk for more than 5-10 minutes.,"I first noticed my hands shake when I was in the middle of a pretty stressful conversation. I am pretty awkward socially and have very little social skills meaning as soon as the discussion starts getting serious I freak out. I don't really feel anxious, though, I'm just trying to escape the interaction.

Anyway since that 'accident', it started happening more and more often. I've seen a neurologist and they told me to see a therapist because it's likely caused by anxiety. My therapist says I am completely okay.

Well, my hands still shake and I don't even know what to do. Anyone else had a problem like this?"
617,Could I be developing schizophrenia?,"Recently I've been feeling very sad and angry about stuff in my personal life such as being verbally harassed and hurt by some people, as well as the death of my friend, I had a bit of a breakdown yesterday where I just felt very angry inside and wanting to cry. Today I've been feeling very emotionally flat and apathetic, however I was still able to laugh really hard at some funny jokes with my friends, as well as crying from an emotional story. I also sometimes have been having trouble concentrating on things and lose my train of thought while explaining things. Other than that, I have not had any other symptoms. I am very afraid of getting this disease.

Please leave any suggestions you may have.

Thank you for your time."
618,I think I just had my first panic attack today,"Okay so this might be very long so I’ll just give a brief list of my symptoms and then maybe the story that triggered it later on for those interested. 

Basically I was crying a lot, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, I had my hands on my chest and around my neck cause I felt like there was something restricting my breathing, and my chest kept involuntarily kind of taking short sharp breathes and every time I tried to say words they would get cut out halfway.


So all of this was triggered by a teacher (bear in mind I’m an 18 year old straight A student, not some 12 year old troublemaker)  who admitted afterwards to me that she felt like she was having a breakdown and that she has a lot of things in her personal life at the moment like her child has the flu etc. But basically I asked the teacher a question in class, something I already had some tension towards doing and she completely flipped on me. Called me out in front of the whole class, made me cry, then when that wasn’t enough she took me outside the door and proceeded to shout at me for a solid ten minutes. After this point I could not breathe she was still in my personal space giving out to me for crying basically diminishing my problems and she had to go back into the class to get a friend to help me as I genuinely felt the walls were closing in on me. This whole situation was about an hour in total including the teacher then bursting into tears and trying to act extremely nice clearly realising what she had just done was crazy.

It’s been like 12 hours and my throat still has a lump in it and I feel extremely on edge etc, and I just don’t know what to do. I have an appointment with my parents in the school tomorrow but I’m very anxious"
619,Can you help me ?,"So I know i have some mental problems but, i don't know what is it. I sometimes get panic attack. I stress and there is some voice tells me that I am not good enough and some Bad thoughts.

Currently at a rehab. My old councilor left. He was amazing but my new one sucks. So here I come to reddit for advice
Before I came here I was depressed and fatigued, socially anxious as hell. Always stuck in my brain. I’m quiet as heck but eventually warmed up to everyone which I never thought I’d ever do. 
Everyone loved me. I loved the person I always wanted to. My dad visited and he said he could tell I wasn’t stuck in my head. 
Now I’m back in the knot. Social anxiety enraging. I don’t know how to get out of this cloudiness. 
Any tips?"
621,Is It Normal to Keep Seeing a Psychotherapist Twice a Week after 2.5 Years, I have been seeing a therapist twice a week for 2.5 years with a small  amount of missed days. I began seeing this psychiatrist for reasons of  already diagnosed chronic depression and an addiction. Through this  period I feel like I definitely changed for the better but my depression  and addiction problems are still solid. Is it normal that I can only  observe minor changes relative to my main problems after such a long  time? Or should I start looking for other options?

623,"How many of you keep journals, and is it weird that I don’t feel comfortable going anywhere without it?","I was curious about how many of you kept journals where you can vent. For those of you who are struggling with your mental health, maybe you should try it! It helped me a lot when I was at my worst.

Nowadays though, I’m that person at school who carries their notebook everywhere they go in fear that I’ll get a panic attack. Is that weird? If you see someone carrying a journal around are you prone to judge them? 

Thank you for your time. :)"
624,Getting over religious anxiety,"I have anxiety attacks over going to hell that keep me up at night. If every religion says that they are the way to escape damnation, how can I make the right choice? So in my mind I am already eternally doomed. What if I am in hell already?

626,Getting a Psychiatrist appointment,"Why the hell is it so hard to get a pyschiatrist appointment? I chose this place because I was told by my doctor that I'd get an appointment in a couple of weeks as they have a large team, but it took a week and a half to hear back and my appointment is in 6 more weeks. I'm really struggling, and I hate how hard it is to get help, and then I dont even know if they'll be good and I know itll take multiple appointments to get diagnosed, and if each appointment is a 6 week gap that means 4 and a half months probably before I'm diagnosed. This has just got me so down, I just want to be better"
627,Are there psychiatrists here? Or even just people knowledgeable about mental health? Please i need help,"I grew up in a very toxic environment. Even now that im 20 yrs old i still get abused emotionally by my own father. 

I just want to ask a person with enough knowledge about mental health. I think something's wrong with me but i cant afford to go to a hospital. If there's someone here i could talk to it would be a big help."
628,Sos relationship,"My ""boyfriend"" completely stamped on my heart. Yelling me that he didn't love me or anything at all. The only guy I've been with for ,6 months. I fell in love with him. I planned s future with him in it and he destroyed me completely. I don't think I can finish my degree in this small town. It's so painful for me . I've never loved anyone this much.  RI went to the emergency and I don't know anyone in this tiny town. I can't live with this. I want to quit everything and go home. I spent all my time with this man and  I can't explain how broken everything including me feels. I feel like dropping out of universiti and going back to India (I'm in a small town in France) I feel like I don't want to continue my life . I have almost severe depression and I can't handle this. On top of that I have to go to s new place for my Erasmus which is mandatory. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. At all"
629,Is there a way to get a free therapist online?,"I know it sounds dumb, but I just want someone that i can talk to online who I can talk to about my problems with and get advice from on some stuff"
630,Worried about my roommates reaction,"Over the last few months my mental health has been slipping. Overwhelmed and burnt out from work, I quit and thankfully was able to live off savings for a few months, since employment insurance wasn't really an option for me. I hoped some time off would be enough to get me back on my feet and back into the work force, but I realize I really need to see a professional and finally get a much overdue diagnosis.

About six months ago (two months before I had to quit) I also started renting a house with one of my friends, and to celebrate the house he got some cats. Our initial lease was only six months and now we're on month to month payments, thankfully, but I've ran out of money and don't have any other option than to move back with my parents for a few months, who live hours away from here. They want to see me get better and will help me get a diagnosis, so I have that going for me at least.

The problem is, I haven't told my roommate yet and will have to tell him tonight that I'll most likely be moving out by the end of the month. He also suffers from poor mental health which in his case can lead to angry violent outbursts. Part of it for sure is on me for not being super up front with him about my finances and mental health, but he knows I've been running out of money too.

I'm just worried when I tell him he may take it really poorly, either hitting me or destroying my property in a rage. He'll wake up in 3-4 hours and that's when I have to break the bad news to him. I'm worried for him too, that he might not be able to find another roommate to fill my shoes, and he might not be able to find a pet friendly apartment in that time. And it's a few days less than a months notice too, which I know isn't kosher at all. As much as I wanted to help him out when I moved here initially, it just didn't work out on my end and I feel really bad for adding this much more stress to his already full plate.

Wish both of us luck, I want to get healthy as soon as possible, I want to be able to move safely with all of my stuff in tact, and I really don't want him to hurt himself as a result. I hope I'm just overthinking this, but I know it's also a pretty big deal."
631,Feeling like I'm destined to die the same way as my favourite singer.,So my most favourite singer Chester Bennington from the band Linkin Park passed away from suicide from hanging in 2017. And since I absolutely love his music I have listened to it a lot. And I can relate with some of his lyrics. And for some reason my brain has come up with the idea that I am also going to commit suicide at 41 just like he did. Even tho I dont actually want die?? Can someone help me figure out why this is happening?
632,What helps you get up in the morning when you feel like you don’t have a good reason to?,"For almost two years I have had very little to motivate me to get up out of bed, despite being in an amazing relationship, seeking therapy, emotional support animals and medication and having a (now) healthy home life. Being too emotionally &amp; mentally exhausted to push myself to try anymore has resulted in me dropping out of college and disappointing a lot of family and friends.

For those of you who have felt or currently feel this way; what helps?"
633,Mental Health Resources/ Needs,"Hi,

I'm doing a business project for one of my university courses. For this project I need to create a product/ service that people as the public would be interested in. For my service I am thinking about doing a cafe that is better suited for those suffering from mental illness or an item or product that can create a safer environment in places where socializing may occur.

I would be very grateful if people would be wiling to comment things that they don't like about cafes, how people cope while being in social situations, or even your opinions on this idea. I am open to any comments surrounding this topic. Feel free to reach out to me through messages if you feel uncomfortable posting in the comments.

Thanks A lot!!!!"
634,I just..don’t like myself.,"I do. I really do. My friends sometimes joke around with me. They say things as jokes. You know, just some joking “insults”. You might be thinking that they are bad friends but the truth is I’m kind of close with them. Well, I don’t mean close as in I share my feelings with them on hard subjects (such as this one), but we care about each other.

The thing is though, I don’t take the jokes as jokes. When they say things, they are things I already believe about myself. It just reinforces that negative thought and makes it harder for me to not believe it. It’s not like I just can’t take a joke. Heck, most conversations with me consist of at least a little humor. Kind of sucks sometimes. Like right now I just want to have a serious conversation (in person) with someone. I want to get things off of my chest. I also don’t want to burden someone. As much as I can be told I’m not a burden, I won’t believe it.

For some reason I come on here to share this. As if it will actually make me happy. I don’t mean that to be rude or offensive. The truth is, if I want to get better I do need to seek help. In order to do that though, I’d need to actually care about myself enough to face my fears and reach out. I’m not strong enough to do that though. So I come here to you all. Instead of doing the right, and brave thing for myself, I come here."
635,Something weird is going on (mood swings????),"Something really weirds happening with my mood, and its happened before, a year ago.

So, starting in about mid-December, my mental wellbeing started a pretty clear decline, and my mood just got worse and worse. It eventually became more like a spiral, and into February, shit got really bad. Its so hazy, but I remember being completely hopeless, definitely thought of suicide more than once, if not constantly, and it felt like I was going completely insane. I felt so hopeless.

Until this morning. Everything completely changed. I felt full of life, like I could do anything, and my day? A complete fucking breeze. It was like I could look at everything with searing optimism. 

But why? Why does everything feel so different? I can't even remember what I was going through that well. I know that it happened, I texted friends about wanting to die, wrote notes in random places about how shitty I felt, but the memories feel so... vague. 

This isn't the first time it's happened, either. Last year, I think, I had a similar low. I don't know if it was as extreme as this year, but I was definitely suicidal at one point, but then it just faded away.

I feel so strange, this doesn't feel normal at all, I want to welcome this burning happiness, but I feel like I'm going crazy.

Can anyone here make sense of what the fuck is going on?"
636,I feel super weird and bad for two years,"So let me start from the beginning about two years ago I had a thought(insecurity) and I googled it and ever since then I have been googling every insecurity that comes to my head which became something really bad for me because I became a self-help guru but depressed almost every day and in my head all the time even did nofap which I found out was a toxic mindset lol. I have stopped doing all those things but I don’t know I feel like I have lost myself and I don’t know myself for all the time lost in that also I have become shy, introverted and with not very good social skills. What can I do to feel better? Any tips or anything would help"
637,Estrangement and pressure,"Who had taught that when a child is not given the love, care, and safety by one's own parents and family that it would roam around in life constantly looking restlessly for connectivity with strangers but never actually feeling truly accepted and comforted but it rather continuously feels as if being assessed for approval just like during the toughest kinds of job interviews around the world. Also it seems as if when you are a person that is introverted, doesn't like to rush things, likes to go deep in life, the chance on social rejection and alienation is even higher. In a world so demanding, impatient, lacking of empathy, it takes too much of an individual already crushed in one's development to keep up with the pace."
638,Does Your Therapist Like You?,"Is it kind of weird that I’m wondering what my therapist thinks of me? Like if she hates our sessions? I know it’s silly and childish. But is there anyone out there who thinks this too. Does anyone have a therapist that loves you and you know it, or hates you and you know it?"
639,Loosing time,"I find myself loosing time a lot trying to remember what happens in the time I’ve lost is like a haze and it’s infuriating to remember things in said time , 
My day has been very scrambled in the morning I was optimistic to an almost unusual extent about the day for almost no reason but soon after my day had been going for a while I became euphorically happy 
I don’t like when I’m in this state because I self harm 
Not out of sadness but put of an almost manic spasm 
I’ll just harm myself because I can 
I stabbed my leg and hit myself until I bruised repeatedly , in the moment I didn’t feel the pain but eventually I came back too and it fucking hurts ,
I used to hit my head into brick walls before but I’ve been able to stop that . 
I was pretty calm and ok I’d like to think around lunch but I’ve found myself having an almost obsession with what it would be like to kill someone and eat them , 
I will never do this I hope but it’s been welling in my mind more than I’d like and I can’t shake it .
My school is making me see a counsiler , it’s been quite good but I struggle to really speak my mind to him I feel as if I was to really talk about my thoughts I would be In trouble ,
I’ve been carrying around a metal pair of scissors because they could be easily used as a stabbing weapon but at the same time I’m allowed to as there not seen as a weapon but I have been thinking about using them as one against certain people I hate 
I’m equally compelled to use them as I am aware of the consequences that will occur if I did ,
So I guess I won’t but I can’t bring myself to leave them . 
In the afternoon I was in a much more neutral state of mind and was happy in a way until the end of the day when I found myself incredibly mad at litteraly nothing , I used to think about killing myself but I don’t anymore not in the way I used to so I guess that’s an improvement . 
I’ve been overwhelmed with work at the moment , 
It’s 12 at night and I’ve left my house without my parents knowing to walk , I like it at night 
I prefer the thought that people can’t see who I am in the dark . As well as the silence 
I’ve had a headache that has been getting worse . It’s probally because I need to wear my glasses but don’t .
I’m going to get my bike again so I can travel further in the night . 
Maby start graffiting around places ,
Idk where I would though since I live in the middle of nowhere it’s mainly fields around me .

I’m sorry if this is sparatic or hard to follow its more me just trying to dump thoughts the internet is a good place to speak because of its anonymous nature .

I’m not really sure what I should be doing . I’m going to just take tommorow as it happens I guess but that’s what I’ve been doing at its not really making anything better ."
640,Can you be bipolar if you are not in denial of it/are aware you exhibit symptoms?,"I just feel like when things are great is life, life is beautiful and amazing. But when things go south, I get into a really dark state of mind that manifests itself. Yesterday, I got into an arguement with my boyfriend. I had very depressing thoughts after and slapped myself in the face a few times because idk I felt like a deserved it. Like, I know I’m depressed and get anxious, but is that it? I feel like there’s more wrong with me."
641,I think my parents seen my writing," Rant sorry
Also possible trigger warning idk how to post flairs on r/mentalhealth

I’m at my dads house my mom won’t let me go back for a bit they packed my stuff and brought it here long story. 
I left stuff on my floor in a folder kind of hidden kind of not because I thought I was just at my dads for the weekend it has tones of notes suicide notes stuff like hearing and seeing things there was weed, condoms, and razors in my in my drawers they probably opened all. They have never shown interest in me ,but now everyone is saying there that there worried they have never believed me now they keep hinting about me being happy again. They never did when I said I want to not do nothing with life, and die a slow painful death on the streets or the fact that I haven’t been to school in over a year. So why now? They seem scared though that’s the annoying thing. I haven’t grown up in the best home. I have lots a trauma, and they don’t really care, but I just those were private my thoughts I can’t go back to see if there moved I’m stuck here for a bit. I don’t want anyone ever to read those thoughts not even if I got help there mine. I feel so invaded. I just really hope they haven’t seen the notes there mine and honestly really cringy, but there mine. Not only that I have been not going to school because of “anxiety” I do have anxiety buts that’s not the reason. Ive talked to a therapist about my anxiety only she said that we would do a psych test in a couple weeks but now it’s moved up I wonder why. I need to be in my room with my cat with those notes I don’t feel safe anywhere else and I’m not allowed. I don’t trust anyone I can’t eat or sleep. I can’t be open with my family I don’t trust them and there not good people. I can hear my dad whispering to my step mom right now too. I’m curled up on my floor in this room I am in terrified. Parents aren’t aloud to just go threw your stuff like that right? My mom has been ignoring my hundreds of texts and calls too now."
642,Anyone find individual therapy unhelpful?,"Hey guys, just picking your brains for thoughts, challenge, or a similar experience.

I have long-term and developmental trauma and I'm about 2 years into what I consider to be my official recovery. I've had interactions with the mental health system before that, but no one ever correctly identified my issue and I felt like it was all so off-base that I don't consider it part of the work.

I've seen a few individual therapists over the years, most recently an EMDR specialist. I also attend DBT group (I'm about 3/4 of the way through and plan to join the skills group afterwards for another 6 months) and I am lucky to have a local community center for trauma survivors where I go to various events (book clubs, meditations, etc).

I've recently dropped my individual therapist, partly because I felt she was projecting too much of herself onto my path, and partly because she admitted to me she wasn't sure how to perform EMDR on someone with so much repetitive trauma that most of my flashbacks are purely amygdala/emotion-based. It is clear she is less experienced in chronic trauma than in episodic or military trauma.

But as I made that decision, I realized I have generally found individual therapy unhelpful. I find DBT and my community center helpful, and also my regular social network outside of the mental health world. But I have always kind of felt like individual therapy is a constant struggle against how I'm expected to think and recover, and what actually works for me and my personality.

I have also found I have been able to develop a method of trauma processing on my own, reasonably safely and effectively. At this point I also feel like I have people I could call if I wanted support, and the level of social re-integration necessary to actually make the call.

Through my recovery process, I feel individual therapy is the least helpful tool I've used so far. It's so internal and pathology focused, while I have found the most effective and enduring ways to making progress for me are outward- and bonding-focused. I also don't want to be a lifer in therapy. I know people do recover from trauma, I've seen it, but it seems like so many therapists believe (or perhaps just say) that you're basically stuck like this to some degree, in and out of mental health services for the rest of your life. I don't believe that, and the further I get in recovery the more I feel like I have very good reason to not believe that.

Am I missing something about individual therapy? Is there something here I just don't get, or somehow I've been picking the wrong therapists? Has anyone else had this sort of experience and dropped this form of treatment from their path?"
643,I don’t know what to do with my “friend” anymore,"My friend has been blowing me off for some time now. At first she would plan to hang out and then say that she forgot while I waited her to message me like she said she would. No big deal. Then she made plans and we both agreed on it but she called it off an hour after we were supposed to meet up at my house and she said it was because she was tired. Okay, things happen. I was only a little disappointed because I was excited. Yesterday she said she wanted to drive somewhere and get sushi and I was pretty excited. Once again she doesn’t answer my texts for hours and then when she does respond at 7:00, she says her head is killing her and she’s tired. I call it off bc she doesn’t feel good and then she starts messaging me saying “wyd” and other stuff. I basically give her short responses and ignore her. Then today I see how she had posted stuff on insta and snap of her fully dressed and getting ready to do something.  I think she treats me as an alternative and if someone better comes along she hangs out with them. She’s always trash talking my buddy, who we will call Kevin, who is really nice. Pretty awkward but so am I. He talked about giving her the extra iPhone that came with his but that never ended up happening. She called him all sorts of names for that and calls him boring bc he works 70 hours a week and goes to college. Obviously that’s all he’s gonna have to talk about. Kevin filled her gas tank up completely twice when she ran out and bought her food on several occasions. I don’t like the way she acts like people owe her stuff. 

I don’t know what to do because we are both in high school and if I tell her I don’t want to be her friend anymore she’ll talk bad about me and spread rumors and be rude."
644,If I went to a psychiatrist to be checked for one thing could they find something else?,"I’m in the uk and I’m going to see a psychiatrist because I have anger issues sometimes I loose time when angry and I hate myself so much. Along with obsessive intrusive thoughts and a history of mood disorders I decided to see a psychiatrist for OCD and adhd. 

I’ve never done anything like this and want to know if when I get there is it possible they could diagnose me with something else or will it be a yes/no you have/haven’t got it or will they diagnose me with something else if they think it fits more? 

Any info would be much appreciated, thanks"
645,"Some days it's really, really hard","Hey guys. I (40M) had a nervous breakdown 2.5 years ago. I was living in Singapore with my then-wife. We had been going through some difficulties in our marriage. I had previously worked as a freelancer and she didn't like it, so I got a job that didn't really suit me. After a few months the stress from the job and stress from the marriage going south I just hit my breaking point.

Weeks I could do nothing but lie on the sofa. Or if I was feeling too bad I would lie on the floor because getting on the sofa was too much effort. I started medication and therapy but I could see it was breaking the only person I cared for so I left. She's doing pretty good now, so I think that at least was the right choice.

I couldn't work for six months but eventually I got to the stage where I could get up in the morning and go to the office. I made some new friends, later on started dating.

And now since January I've just been drowning. Slowly, slowly. Every day just drowning. I've got a decent job. I've got a therapist. I've got some friends. I've got hobbies. But it just feels like there's no reason to carry on.  I go to work, I come home. If I'm not doing anything that evening all I want to do is drink or take sleep meds so it's the next day.  

This week I'm on holiday, finally had to take all my accrued days off. I'm hating it. All I can do now is play this song on repeat because I don't know what else to do.

646,I'm very confused and nervous,"I don't know what to do. For a few months I haven't been myself. I haven't been doing schoolwork or participating, I've started sleeping in class and so on. My teachers have obviously noticed. I have talked to two of my teachers because we are fairly close and I open up to them more then anyone. Behind close doors I cry, hurt myself, weed a few times, and other stuff. I don't know what is wronge with me. I constantly feel like crap. My teachers will ask what is wrong but I don't know what to tell them because I don't truly know myself. I feel like I'm blaming the deaths of family members but even when I'm not thinking of them I feel like this. My teachers have become very worried and I don't know what to say or do. They have told my sibling some stuff and I'm scared my parents will find out. I don't know anything right now."
647,How long does a psychiatrist need to diagnose a disorder?(approximately ),a  week?

650,I feel like i might be falling down the slippery slope of self harm,"ive always kind of hurt myself, even when i was younger. mostly when i get frustrated or angry. its always been small things though, like hitting my forehead, or slamming my hand against a table.

but lately ive been a lot more stressed. im fairly certain i dont have any diagnosable mental disorders or anything, but i just get frustrated and impulsively take it out on myself. ive noticed the things i do are becoming more severe (ei, starting to leave actual lasting marks or drawing blood) and more frequent, and im worried that its becoming a habit to hurt myself as a way to manage even minor frustration.

does anyone have any tips on stopping themselves from making a habit out of stuff like this."
651,Anyone Want a Chat/Text Buddy to Talk About Our Life Story and Mental Health Issues... Just Helps Me to Relate with People,"

Maybe this is a weird request I don't know lol I just feel like I'm burning out my family"
652,I don’t feel like a human being.,"I think people think I say this as a metaphor, but I really truly do not feel human. I can’t tell you exactly what I do feel like; it’s not like I feel like a specific animal or anything. The closest thing is just... a thing.

Sometimes it gets so bad that I feel like my insides are wrong. Like my organs aren’t the ones I’m supposed to have, aren’t made of blood and tissue, or are in the wrong place. Most days I feel numb, but not in the way that I simply feel nothing; like I feel nothing but it’s wrong. Those are the really bad days. For the last couple of years, though, every day, I have not felt like a human being, and yet desperately longing to be one.

I have a long, extensive history of trauma and abuse so it’s safe to say that if this is an actual mental thing, that’s probably where it comes from. I do dissociate but I’m not aware of dissociation coming out like this. Am I delusional? If I were delusional, would I even be questioning if I were delusional?

I’ve talked to my therapist about this thousands of times but again, I think she just assumes I’m speaking in metaphors. I don’t know how to explain these thoughts and feelings. If I really sit down and say it, I can say that I’m biologically human but it feels like a lie coming out of my mouth. Like logically I know the truth, but my brain tells me it’s a lie. I really just feel wrong all of the time and I don’t know how to make it stop."
653,First Therapy Session On Friday. Need some advice,"Hello,

I'm 26, male, and for the for the first time ever I have set an appointment to talk to a therapist this Friday.

The person who will see me is a psychotherapist. Do you guys have any experiences with talking to a psychotherapist?

I know I have a lot to say, and I tend to forget when I keep talking and talking. I just don't know if the therapist will understand me or just pretend to listen.

Do you guys think I'm doing myself a favor here?"
654,Mental Illness from cannabis?,"I had multiple bad trips over the course of a few years from smoking marijuana, so bad that I can’t even express the fear and sense of doom that came along with it. 

I haven’t smoked weed in over 6 months but yet I find myself getting into a similar mindset I was during the bad trips. 

Derealization, intrusive thoughts about death/time/the universe, and this very heavy sense of impending doom causing me to feel extremely panicked and uneasy. 

I feel this way about once a week and usually at night time. It’s very unsettling and I don’t know how long these thoughts will last. Does anyone have similar experience to this?"
655,"It's not the depression, it's me","I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever."
656,What’s going on with me?,For quite a while it’s been feeling like I’ve been living in a fog. I get really lost in my thoughts and it’s like it distracts me from the “external” world. This fog feels worst in the morning as I feel practically useless. Anytime I’m anywhere socially I often panic and overthink which sorta makes the fog even worse because I’m thinking about it and it feels like I can’t stop thinking about it which puts all my attention and awareness on it. I get a lot of panic because I feel as though it makes me look foolish to other people as I have a hard time concentrating or focusing on anything external. I’ve become aware of my inner voice and it’s almost like I can hear it in my head. I’m aware of how my head feels. Almost like electrical zaps in my head. I have a big problem with talking to myself I find. I’m very aware of my own thinking and mental processes. It really feels like I’m in a “dream” like state. It makes it very hard to be social as Im often on edge and get paranoid. My memory is horrible and I have a hard time remembering what I did earlier in the day. I’m always googling my symptoms trying to find an answer to try and relieve some of the stress but I just don’t know what’s happening.
657,Medications,"So in late 2018 I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and Bipolar and have since been on numerous medications to try and find the right mix.

Now what seems to be the problem is that any medication I seem to take for longer than 4-5 days just completely stops working, in saying that I still stuck out the recommended time in which they say the medication will start working properly. I told my psych numerous times about this and his conclusion was that I had some kind of liver condition where the medications are processed by my liver so quickly that they don’t have time to work properly.

Is this actually a thing? And if so what are some things I could try or read up on as having a medication work great the first few days and then nothing afterwards really kills what hope I had of feeling somewhat better."
658,My therapist cut my session short.,"I was diagnosed with CPTSD, OCD and an anxiety disorder three years ago. Starting therapy was a huge step for me. Today was my second session and right before my session started something happened that got me irrationally upset. During the session I couldn't say anything, I felt so many things but I couldn't process my emotions. My therapist kept asking what I wanted to talk about and I kept saying I don't know. I told him I was physically and mentally exhausted. He asked if I was in distress or suicidal and I said no.
He taught me some breathing exercises then ended my session after only 15min. After I hung up (it was a video session) I started freaking out and I burst out crying. I felt abandoned by my therapist. I'm a mess right now and I feel that I'm too much to handle even for my therapist and I'm not worthy. I just feel empty right now and a wave of apathy is taking over me. Is this normal for a therapist to do? Am I overreacting?"
659,Ask me anything,"Hi. 
Ask me anything about therapy, meds, and what I’ve found helpful, shitty, or neutral about the mental health system. I am American."
660,Don't know if I have depression,"Hi I don't really want to say much information but I'll only say the information that's important, for starters I really think I have depression but I don't know if I have it, if I say anything about it to my family they'll just call me an attention seeker and tell me not to think about it and my family right now are the Iast people I want to talk to, so I need help. from what I gathered I don't really seem to have the emotional aspect of depression I only have the symptoms of it such as low energy and lack of motivation I think I don't feel the emotional aspect because I  also believe I have sociopathy I really don't know if that's how that works. If I only feel the physical symptoms not the mental symptoms of depression. As for the sociopathy I don't really have a lot of empathy for anything or anyone and I rarely feel happy or excited about something but often I do feel emotions like like embarrassment anger regret, 

As I was writing this down I've just remember something that might have kicked started my depression or sociopathy about a year ago I I got assaulted when they punched me  in the head and I blacked out and before then everything was normal. I don't think if this is strong enough evidence to prove sociopathy maybe I fell the wrong side of my head, but just worth mentioning.
I really can't just go see a psychologist or psychiatrist because no one would take me and no one would take me seriously so I just need help here any input would be really appreciated."
661,I’m utterly exhausted,"I don’t even know where to begin. I’m tired, I sleep like crap, I work my ass off and don’t feel like I’m getting ahead, and I feel like my wife is ungrateful for everything I do and I just want to take a nap, I feel like I’m slipping into a depression just because of hearing symptoms but I also feel like it could stem from a. Car accident I was in because I hurt 80% of the time. I am evicting a tenant and can’t afford the mortgage because they didn’t pay and I’m just sick of carrying The whole burden of finances and being the soul provider with a stay at home wife with 3 kids. I don’t want to hang out with my kids. The wife and I fight about finances because she just wants to spend It all. It all makes me tired and angry and wanting to run away. 

I don’t know why I’m posting this other than I don’t feel I can tell anyone this."
662,What is it I'm feeling?,"TW: SH talk

I've always had these periods of depression and then high elation and euphoria. I was on and off depressed for a solid part of my middle school years and I assumed I had something like bipolar or whatnot but dismissed it as it's not my place to decide that and even if I did, it's not like I would be telling any adult that. I guess that wasn't it because I went a full year without feeling super depressed. Recently though, my anxiety and depression have skyrocketed and I just went on a full three weeks of wanting to die and doing SH. At school today, I kept scratching my arm to a near scarring point because my anxiety was so unusually high (it actually felt like I was going to die because of how bad my anxiety was) and I was planning to properly SH when I got home. Now that I'm home, I feel really happy and just like life is going well (although I have way too many tests and overdue assignments and my grades are dropping a lot) and I feel so content I just want to dance around and chill. I feel so weird, knowing how much I wanted to die just hours ago. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and I was wondering if this is something from ADHD or possible something else. The one thing is that these moods of happiness don't tend to last very long (not long periods as described in bipolar disorder) and usually disappear within 3 days. However, the weird thing about this is that there is no reason for me to be happy rn. All my friends and family are angry with me, I'm falling behind in school, I can't do anything right, I hate my appearance and I'm averaging 3 hours of sleep per night, yet I feel so happy (doesn't have to do with my ADHD meds, actually I should be feeling more depressed considering they wore off a few hours ago). It's also strange because I was contemplating (TW) suicide just hours ago.   


As I'm writing this post, I feel so dumb for ever feeling depressed of doing SH. That's how I'm feeling rn but I know it won't last for long (it never does). Why am I so mentally fucked up..."
663,Supporting my boyfriend who has bipolar,"I'm a 36 yo F and I've been dating my 35 yo M boyfriend for 5 months and he let me know early on that he has bipolar. He takes his medication and sees a psychiatrist regularly, as well as has access to telehealth support through an app. He's had one other depressive episode that lasted a day, which scared and worried me, prior to tonight. He slept poorly Sunday night, struggled to get through work Monday, and called out today. He came over to my place and I've tried to be supportive, yet not pushy when asking if he wants to talk about things. He mentioned a couple things that have gotten him down, and has made comments like it feels like a struggle just to maintain himself. I don't know his history of suicidal ideation. I've suggested remembering what his therapist has taught him when he gets this way. 

tl;dr: What can I do to help support my boyfriend while not worrying myself to death about whether he'll be ok? I love him very much, so what should I know to better be there for him when he has a depressive episode?"

I feel like I don't deserve anything I have and I'm worthless. I think no one actually likes me, and they all despise every second they spend with me, even when my friends invite me to do stuff I think they don't actually want to see me. I give up too easily because of that, I don't think what I'm doing js worth it or I think I suck at everything so I don't even want to try anymore. I don't think I deserve to live and I want to die. I feel like the world would be the same without me, or maybe it'd be better, so why should I even live?"
666,"not much of a sharer, so I’m starting small (tw: suicide attempt/ideation)","One thing I’m always confronted about, whether that be in therapy or friendships, is that I don’t actually share much about myself or my past. I’ve heard multiple times from people that while I know a lot about them, they know nothing about me. So anyway, I’m starting small by sharing on an anonymous platform like reddit.

June 2018, I tried to take my life. At that point of my life, I honestly felt I was already dead. I was so lifeless and hopeless I can only describe myself as a premature ghost, haunting my college campus and avoiding any type of intimacy and love that I had access to. Since then, I lost nearly all of my friends (my fault, my depression &amp; planning for my own death lead to me isolating myself from anyone who cared about me. I hurt a lot of people this way and it’s my biggest regret. This is the part of my past I have the most trouble talking about) but was given the chance to start over. 3 colleges, 2 therapists, 2 psychiatrist, 3 antidepressants, 1 phone/social media phobia, and almost 2 years later im still alive and finally happy about it. I’m finally looking forward to the future even though I’m still healing and probably will be for many many years. 

I know my experiences seem small and insignificant compared to others, but the affect they had on my well-being was profound. This is the most I’ve shared about this stuff since my last therapist, I hope I can share more in the future &lt;3"
667,Constant panic attack,I have been having panic attacks 1-2 times a day for about the past year and a half and it is really getting in the way of my daily life and I don't know what to do. I have tried to pinpoint a cause but they happen so randomly from when I'm drying my hair to when I'm in class and I just don't know what to do so I'm venting here
668,I’m stuck in my mind with thousands of voices all telling me to listen to them with their moral compass. It’s terrible and tearing me apart. I just want to scream and cry. I’ve cut myself in the past and I can’t go a day without wanting to cut again and again.,I’m so scared of life. I’m so scared of my feelings and my desperation for love and self love. I’m so lonely. I’m just a emotional mess and I don’t know what to do.
669,I don't know what my thoughts or emotions are?,"I knew I had an issue with not feeling emotions but I don't even really have thoughts? My doctor asked me why I'm anxious in certain situations and what my anxious thoughts are. I don't have anxious thoughts. I don't know why I'm anxious. I don't really have many thoughts at all? I'm worried because she got a bit frusterated and said that if I don't reflect on this and tell her what I'm anxious about she can't help me. I feel like she doesn't believe me because it sounds like I'm lying or avoiding talking about it but I really don't know how I feel or what I'm thinking about. 

The same goes for other symptoms and timelines. I don't know when this started. I don't know what other symptoms I have. I don't know if this is impacting my life. Most of the time I don't know the day's date or what my schedule is. My memory is horrible, I don't remember not being mentally ill so I have no baseline, and I don't know how to recognize my own thoughts apparently. How the hell am I supposed to get diagnosed or treated?"
670,Are there any other options besides hospital if you have a plan?,I can’t make my parents pay that right now and I can’t face the conflict of trying to go. Please help
671,Is there something wrong with me?,"Sometimes, for no reason I get super angry over small things like in fighting games, if my oppenent gets a good combo, I get really angry and I start throwing things. Over the smallest shit, and it's affecting my relationship with family members."
672,Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (Wellbutrin XL generic) - any information would be greatly appreciated!,"I just was prescribed wellbutrin (first time) by my psychiatrist and the pharmacy gave me a generic made by a company called Lupin. I've been unable to find any reviews on this particular generic, all I've learned is that the FDA approved it in 2017 which I guess makes it one of, if not the newest form of generic wellbutrin out there. Does anybody have any experience or information about the effectiveness of this one? From what I've seen so far, a lot of people seem to agree that ""the generic"" isn't nearly as good as the brand name when it comes to wellbutrin, but none of them seem to have been talking about THIS generic in particular, and I know there are a few companies that make them; one of which was taken off the market for how ineffective it was?"
673,I still feel guilty for being a bully as a child,"I was a pretty bad bully from the ages of 11-14. I'm not sure why I bullied others but I did. I've talked about it with my therapist and she says I'm not the same person I was when I was a child but sometimes I'm afraid that what if I am. My fear of being a bully gave me a ocd ""false memory"" but more than that I just feel guilty for my actions. I've been forgiven but I just wish I could take it all back. My therapist says I don't have to like it but I need to acknowledge it but I'm not really sure what that means to be honest. Acknowledge you were a shit kid and are not a shit adult. Okay done, now what?"
674,How to cope with DID?,"Does anyone know how to cope with multiple personalities? I know I have 3 (including myself) but I could have more. One is super angry all the time and always complains to me about what’s going on and threatening to take over but never does. The other is a girl (I’m a boy) who plays music in my head and calms me down by giving me advice. I’m kind of worried though. I’ve never had an outburst, and I don’t plan on having one. I’ve tried preventing one for as long as I could,  it it’s getting harder with my toxic life full of toxic people. I’m worried my angry personality is going to take over unexpectedly and I’m going to do something I’m going to regret. If anyone knows how to cope with this, without seeing a therapist, then I would love to hear your method of preventing an outburst."
675,How do I cope with hating everyone around me?,"Long story short, I have a burning hatred for literally every single American. I strongly dislike everyone around me and spend 99% of my time indoors because I don't enjoy being around them.

I'm sick of this and want it to stop. I can't go to a therapist because I don't want to alarm them."
676,"Make your bed, or take a shower, or brush your hair, or eat some fruit, or get up and do a couple pushups, or go to the bathroom, or just walk up and down the stairs, or change your clothes.

677,Videogames as a Bad Coping Mechanism,"Hello everyone. Fellow severe OCD and mild depression sufferer. As the title suggests, the only real attempt at escaping and coping are through videogames. The catch is however, is that through a mix of OCD perfectionism and immense self hatred, I also give myself nonstop shit when I do badly. It includes me telling myself I'm good for nothing and I should kill myself. I expect myself to be virtually perfect, which I'm not, and when I fail, It's nonstop self hatred. 

I should also mention I' m on 80mg of Prozac and take ERP for the OCD. So far I've improved in the contamination OCD aspect. Not really anything else. Part of me wants to drop videogames for a bit, but I don't have really anything else to distract myself.

Any suggestions?"
678,Can anyone chat with me?,"Female, lots of shit happening, need help"
679,Do you guys think this is social anxiety? What should I do to seek help?,"For a long time I haven’t been able to grasp how to act around others. Being around my friends and my friends alone is completely fine, but whenever someone like a friend of my friends I don’t know real well is there I am extremely uncomfortable (note that this is the case even when my friends are still there). I quite literally can’t act like myself. I am uncomfortable, awkward, and really just annoying. Do you guys think this is social anxiety? What do you think I could do to fix this?"
680,Anyone else experiences this feeling?,"Idk what I’m actually dealing with until now. I just noticed whenever I go out of the house (I commute btw), I can’t stop overthinking. My eyes wander a lot, I can’t stay in the same position for more that 2 minutes, I talk a lot in my mind. It’s like I drank 2 liters of coffee. Almost like having palpitations. I can’t even focus on one thing. For example, throughout the drive I put my headphones on cause I was trying to listen to a new album when I realized I finished the entire album without remembering a single line from a song because my mind was wandering the entire time."

682,Vent/Xpost - losing hope,"Hitting the lowest low ever

I’ve worked really hard to manage my depression. I work out regularly, own a dog, go to therapy, take my meds, check in with my psychiatrist, change my sleep habits, no alcohol, no pot, and the list goes on. 

I’ve been unemployed for months now. I’m behind on my rent. My electric gets shut off this week. I haven’t had oil all winter for gear hence the electric. I make just too much for food stamps and food pantry food has been getting me by but it’s all boxed and canned so hasn’t been sitting well. 

Last night, I got a flat cause I hit a pothole and come to find out my lock key for my locking lug nut was stripped so I had to call a tow cause neither me or the tow truck guy could get that last nut off. I spent my last $20 on the tow cause it was just outside of my tow coverage for roadside assistance. 

Every day, I make it a point to apply to at least 5+ jobs. Try to leave the house at least for the dog. 

I just have no more hope and feel dead inside in a new way. I actually had to call the suicide hotline last week. 

Sigh."
683,I feel so lost right now,"I was blindsided by my SO a little over a week ago and dumped out of the blue. She said she just wasn’t feeling it anymore, and felt that it couldn’t be reconciled. I have taken it pretty badly because I was planning a future with her. We talked marriage, adopting dogs, buying a house, traveling the world, ect. I had everything lined up for how my life was going to go and then she dumped me out of the blue.

I’ve been working on moving forward with acceptance that it’s over, but it’s really hard to rewrite your future after feeling like you had something so solid. Right now I am at a point where I feel incredibly lost and confused. I feel directionless.

I want to uproot my life and move to another state. I’ve been thinking about it on a daily basis. I’ve been tired of this town that I am living in for some time now, but opted to stay because I fell in live with someone who was planning on staying here. I feel completely alone and like I have no one to guide me. I have to depend completely on myself to clean this mess up and rewrite my future.

What do you do when you feel so lost? How do you find direction?"
684,My boyfriend and I have been having heightened anxiety for 2 days straight and not sure “what to do”.,"I don’t know if this belongs here, but...

We have both had our ups and downs with anxiety and depression over the years (separately, as single people) but we’ve both been very happy for months. 

Out of nowhere we both started getting extreme anxiety and a weird darkness come over us. We explained the way it feels to each other and it’s kind of bizarre - like we’re going through it together, and it’s freaking me out. 

I’ve had two small panic attacks since Sunday and I usually don’t get them at all. 

I’m not sure what I’m asking.

Maybe just some advice?"
685,Constant anxiety that things will go wrong.,"Hello guys, I am 24 year old Male. My problem is I feel like in my life something will always go wrong when everything seems to be going good. This feeling started 15 years back when I unexpectedly lost my father to heart attack. Everything was going so perfect in my family, but this sudden event changed a lot of things including a constant fear of anxiety that something bad will happen when everything seems to going perfect. This is just one case.

Last year I was laid off from my first ever full time job. This left me with shock and so many unans questions, like why a few of us were only laid off, what could I have had done to save my job etc. 

This year I bought my first vehicle and it feels like I am gonna crash it. I been very excited driving and having fear as well.

These are just few of the cases in which I feel this way. I believe this has something to do with hereditary. My father and grandmother also used to get scared with small issues.

This feeling of constant fear needs to go before it gets me. Thoughts?"
686,I [18F] have felt dissociated from my life for as long as I can remember?,"I’m honestly not sure where to begin. I lived a very ordinary childhood up until I was 5, when my mom was diagnosed with cancer and she began to get very sick, very fast. She passed when I was 8, and while I understood what happened, I think I internally processed most of that grief when I was a bit older, like the start of middle school (~11?). It was then when I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, which I received therapy and medication for. It was also then when I started having these weird thoughts. It was almost like my life wasn’t my own anymore; I was an actress starring in someone else’s movie and I was trapped inside it. Everything I do, everything I work for just seems like it’s outside of me. It’s like a constant, internal monologue within myself but I feel like I’m entirely separated from it. I have a lot of friends, and a very supportive family, but I truly feel like I lack a true connection with anyone, albeit a few people. Basically, I just feel so separate from myself and other people, and I’m not sure what’s “wrong with me” or if this is something I should even be concerned about."
687,Any advice for telling my family about my mental health problems? How should I bring it up?,"My issue in particular is really stigmatized. And I just don’t want them to hate me for it. But I’m a bad lier, and I think they know somethings up, but I don’t think they know what. 

I just really don’t want to fuck up my relationships with them."
688,Obsessive love disorder,"I’ve been attracted to this girl since Junior year of high school. I’m a sophomore in college now, I thought my “crush” for her would go away after I graduated, it didn’t. I spent my entire freshman year master bating to photos she would post, I’m not exaggerating when I say I check her Twitter/Facebook at least 5 times a day to see if she’s posted any new photos, my obsession with her is so bad that even when she post a photo that’s not even revealing I completely lose control. It’s a cycle I jerk off to her photos then the moment after I lose absolute interest in her actually it’s more than that i start to hate her a little bit, but the interest comes back. I thought her rejecting my friend request would kill my drive to pursue her but it only made it stronger, I’ve spent countless hours trying to figure out how to get a peak at her private Instagram account. She’s literally ruining my life I need help/advice before I end up doing something drastic that I will regret. I’ve had very malicious thoughts relative to her."
689,"Tomorrow, I’m getting out of bed.","That’s right. I’ve been on a terrible decline for the past 2 weeks. I haven’t gone to class, I’ve showered once, I’ve hardly eaten, and I’ve done a lot of crying. I have no idea why I’ve been having a terrible depressive episode, I have no idea why I’m crying and think about dying. But tomorrow, I’m forcing myself to get up, take a shower, get dressed, and go to class. It’s a 5 hour class so I will most likely only actually be there for an hour, but at least I’m getting out of the house. Yay me!"
690,Self Worth,"I often lie awake at night feeling guilty over every mistake in my life even when most is out of my control. The only way for me to seek refuge is to make jokes for my small friend group. If I can get the to be happy, then I can bare me never being a happy a day in my life for about 3 straight years. Pressure, Anxiety, Insomnia, and Depression have really sucked even though nothing is wrong with my surroundings for the most part but the guilt won’t go."
691,Really struggling to keep it together,"Things were going really great until February of this year. I was excited about my job search, my friendships were going really well, but I think I was harboring a lot of feelings I wasn’t dealing with and now I’m at my breaking point. 

In late December, my aunt passed away from cancer. I saw her in October (she lives in another country) and I was hopeful she would recover but she was stage 4. I saw her the summer prior and it was heartbreaking to see how much she deteriorated. She was only 70 and in a year she looked as old as my 96 year old grandma. I thought I had processed and said my goodbyes but I’m still very sad. I lost my grandma a year prior to the day and I feel like I’m losing my roots in my country. We only have 2 surviving family members living there.

I’m struggling a lot at my job. My former boss was my career mentor and he left in August, shortly after my analyst. Both left because of controversial new leadership which has been the root of the problem. My former boss taught me everything he knew because he intended for me to take his job when he was promoted to director. When he left, both his and the analyst positions were open for months and during this time, I was picking up the slack. The president decided to bring in a “forecaster” from our Mexico office who struggles with English and doesn’t have the proper experience. Training him takes a lot longer than it should. The president doesn’t have a lot of visibility to everything I was managing to keep us afloat, and started to get the impression that I wasn’t working hard enough. I never got a pay raise for the extra work but I also never spoke up. She chose to promote someone on another team to manage our team, but this person does not have the correct experience to take the place of my former boss, so I continue to do a lot of the analytics without pay. I’ve started to get reprimanded for missing my own deadlines and the impression is that I can’t manage my time, but in reality I am being pulled too many directions. I’ve spoken up finally and to no avail. The company has an unspoken expectation for me to work long hours and take my work home, and I want a balance, so the company is a poor fit. I’m job searching, but I’m literally always at work and it’s made it difficult. We’ve been told we can’t take vacations until one of our May deadlines are completed... pretty sure that’s illegal, but I need time off to interview so I just kinda gave up. 

I moved into an apartment in September that’s a huge upgrade from what I had before. Met my roommate on a Facebook group and thought we’d get along. We do surface level, but as I got to know her, I realized she’s very selfish and takes advantage of me wherever she can, mostly financially. It’s made me want to avoid being at home. 

To top it all off, I went to a work conference in early February that I tried to get out of because I had walking pneumonia. I was so sick and we were working very long hours... basically setting up the conference center from 6 am to midnight. I started getting bit by what I thought was mosquitos but realized too late was bed bugs. The bite reactions were pretty delayed and most got bad after I left. I ended up bringing bed bugs into our apartment. I can’t sleep without feeling like bugs are crawling all over me. I haven’t slept more than 4 hours a night since the 20th so I’m kinda losing my mind.

Things came to a head today when my roommate “billed” me for her “bed bug expenses”. Her cat boarding (&amp; bath which I feel was unnecessary), mattress and box spring protector, dry cleaning and laundry. I already paid $2000 for treatment. I felt it was really petty and insensitive the way she went about it and I’ve been sick of her complaining because I didn’t do this on purpose, and she’s treating me like I did. Her response was “I feel like I could have complained a lot more and anyways you owe me $300” I couldn’t articulate myself and honestly just hate myself right now. Personally I don’t feel like I owe her money for a lot of those things because shit happens and life doesn’t always hand you a paycheck. She’s very stingy and has taken advantage before (I’m the only one who buys detergent that she uses because I “use her butter” even though I only did like once, told her she could have some of my chocolates my parents bought as a gift and she ate the whole box in 2 days when I wasn’t home and accused me of fat shaming her when I was like wtf dude, idk it’s been hell and I feel like she’s constantly gaslighting me). I’m now stuck with almost $3000 in expenses and this experience has made me paranoid and unable to sleep. Hotel denies having bed bugs and has a clean pest report for the room. I constantly check for bugs, and feel uncomfortable seeing friends in fear of spreading them.  A lot of my relationships have already been strained because I’ve isolated myself so much these past couple months, and none of my friends wanna hear me have a meltdown about bed bugs. My parents are even over it. 

I took a break from dating because I needed to take things less personally. Went through an awful breakup in September with a guy I was seeing pretty seriously and not yet exclusively. We wanted to, but decided to delay being exclusive until after our trips (I was going to Europe). When we returned he strung me along for a month then dumped me for some girl he met in Boston and theyre still together. That broke me and left me questioning what was wrong with me that he would leave a relationship that was going well for 4 months for someone he knew for 48 hours... he was one of few guys I’ve come clean to about my sexual assault in college. That is still something I’m dealing with and affects my emotional relationships. 

Tried to get back into it by shooting my shot with a guy I know in my city through mutual friends. He agreed but never set a date and that left me really fucking sad today. 

TLDR; I feel like I’m repressing a lot and am really depressed due to a lack of strong positives in my life. I operate from day to day grumpy, annoyed, irritated and angry at the world. I have road rage, I’m irritated and impatient with strangers, I yell at my roommate, and I constantly judge and talk shit about others. I never used to be like this and I know it’s coming from how sad I am. I’ve tried therapy, but after years of it I still feel like I haven’t developed the tools to deal with this. Sorry for the rant, thank you for reading. I’m just so tired and in tears late at night trying to get out what I’m going through."
692,"Trying to reach the top for air, but something keeps pulling me further into the bottomless pit of depression.",It’s 1:50am on a Wednesday morning. As I lay here in my bed. I can’t help but to let my mind wander to many places.
693,Friend lost her battle to cancer this morning; feeling depressed,"I'm sorry if this brings your day down too :(

But I haven't felt this low ever in my life and almost everyone in my social circle is going through something similar - anxious, foggy and unable to put mind to work. 

I woke up this morning to the worst news that my friend, who lives across the street, had passed away in her fight to blood cancer - a battle she had been fighting since last 6 months. She was just 19, taking her medical degree and wanted to devote her life helping the poor and needy across India. She would have made an excellent doctor.

We grew up together in the neighbourhood and I'm still unable to believe this has happened. Initially I didn't felt anything when I heard this news but I'm feeling more and more depressed as time is passing. Unable to focus on work at all, tried multiple things to distract myself but I can't get over this it seems.

I have a deadline to work with and that's making me even more tensed."
694,Can I get some advice?,"I don't know if I'm here to vent or to seek advice, I just don't know what to do. Bassicly from 8th-10th grade I went to a small character school (my class was about 50 males and 1 female). For 11th grade I so badly wanted to go to my local public school and ""branch out"" if you will. I'll admit it wasn't as good as I was originally hoping, I definitely struggled socially to say the least. After some time I started to settle in, I got to know some people, some of the best people I've meant even. In particular I became great friends with this girl who was also new. For the first time in a long time, I felt I was enjoying life. Around this time I was looking for a part time job to get some extra cash, much to my surprise I got a part time job as a kitchen member. However, I quickly found myself working from 10 hour weeks to 40 on top of school. Very quickly I started to lose my mind. On a week day I'd get two half meals a day (I was just too busy to even have time to eat). I'd wake up go to school, get home, change and leave for work, then get home around 12-12:30. After doing this for about three weeks I quickly realised it wasn't healthy, my patients grew thin, I'd even occasionally just flat out forget my school id number or what block schedule the day was. Anyways, one day this girl that sat behind me in one of my classes was annoying me, I snapped and yelled her, (I threatened to kill her) it wasn't like I went into detail or anything I just lost my temper and snapped, I know it was my fault and I'm not making excuses. She ended up reporting me to the school admin where I was interrogated for 7 hours over the course of about two days. They ended up searching everything on me under ""probable cause"" I quickly realised they were using loop holes to get around my 5th amendment, they would seach me, then rely that information over to the police so the cops didn't need a warrant. Next thing I knew I was being interrogated by the police, turns out they found ""suspicious text messages"" I sent over 6 years ago. They said I showed ""sociopathic traits"" and that they were concerned for public safety. They also brought all of my friends into questioning then the school contacted my friend's parents explaining the situation. I don't know exactly what the school said to them but now non of them are allowed to hang out with me. After all of this happened I told the police I was getting a lawyer. The school freaked out and we ended up making a deal where I'd pass all of my semester classes if I didn't show up to school again. After the semester ended I switched to online school, and it is literal hell, I hate online school. I've been doing online for about 9 weeks now, and I haven't gone outside much since everything happened. I feel like I lost all of my friends and everything I enjoyed in about 3 days over some stupid mistake I made. I really haven't been doing well since. I've attempted to reconnect with my old friends from my old school but it has been difficult since it's been so long since I spoke to them. Does anyone have any suggestions for getting to know new people? Most people at my work are in their mid 40's so there is just too much of an age difference."
695,I’m Slipping,"I have anxiety and depression. I’ve had a long history of abuse and neglect in my family. I’m really sensitive and can hold up a facade pretty well until recently. In December, I was stressed due to complications with school and my foster family at the time. I was also taking pills and drinking. I let it get the best of me and decided to attempt an overdose. I failed to do so but as a result of the attempt and other things occurring at the moment my foster family left me. On Sunday, I tried to gang myself but the noose broke. Yesterday, I was down in the dumps. Today, it’s gotten worse. I keep thinking about my past and my failures. I want to run away from it all. I have enough money to do so but I don’t want to feel guilty fore leaving what I have left behind (family and friends). I want to kill off the part of me that hurts. I am heartbroken and distraught. I’ve been holding it together for the past 2 months trying to act like it’s alright. People ask me how I am and I say I’m okay. It’s a big lie. I want to kill myself. I want to get rid of the pain I feel permanently."
696,How do I stop making up stories?,"Am a 30 year old guy, living with my mum since dad died recently. I had been diagnosed with anxiety, adhd, OCD and depression in 2018. 

But much before all of this, when I was about 16, I started making up stories just to get people to listen to me. 

As years passed by, I continued to make up stories when the people around me were silent.

And now I make up stories just so that I can entertain people and I feel good while doing it. But later, am just guilty of having made it up. 

Are my stories based on real life events? Yes. But extrapolated by quite a lot.

How long are my stories? I take a good 20+ mins with friends and over an hour when I narrate them to my mum. Because, I've to establish the characters, the timeline so as to make them feel it. 

How often do I narrate these stories? I've consciously kept a check on myself when I am with my friends. I've not faked a story in over a year now. 

With my mum, it's almost once in every 15 days. I try not to do it. But I start with it and keep going on till I've tried my best to make it feel real, so that she doesn't realise that I've lost my mental stability. 

I stopped seeing my psychiatrist ever since he discussed his political views with me. I didn't feel comfortable with his very conservative views. 

And I can't afford a psychiatrist now. 

Where and how can I start to help myself? 

How do I stop day dreaming (in which I spend hours on almost everyday) and how do I stop making up stories? 

Any help is much appreciated. Thanks for your time and advise. 

Best,"
697,Keep the cat or lose my mind,"I had a lovely cat for about 3 years. He was my little homie, we took naps together all the time. I named him Angel. I was obsessed with him, he was rotten spoiled I didn’t care how expensive he was even though I couldn’t afford it. I wanted him so badly I risked getting kicked out from my apt by having him while having a no pet agreement. I didn’t mind the smell, the fur everywhere. I didn’t mind him being and doing what a cat does. But I slowly started disliking him. I felt bad because I knew it wasn’t him it was me. I tried to ignore the those feelings and still treat him like I always have. It went on for months I tried to get over it but one day I just couldn’t pretend anymore. I felt like everybody hated me for trying to find him a new home but I couldn’t help it I had so much happening, my mind was all over the place,I barely slept. I hated how I felt.  I was working full time, I took care of my baby, I did all the cleaning and on top of that I had to pick up after the cat. At first I was okay with it but I slowly started going insane in my head because no matter how much I cleaned I was never finished. I still feel bad for giving him up but I knew in my heart he deserved someone better. My life changed and things got way to complicated for me emotionally as well as physically. I don’t know how people do it with multiple pets and kids because I was going insane. Props for those people! It was nice while it lasted but no more cats for me."
698,The pen knife is sitting in front of me because i was using it to cut something earlier on.

The only thing holding me back would be the presence of wound and scars.

699,My local crisis team is making me feel worse.,"For two weeks now, I have been under the crisis team’s care due to suicidal thoughts and tendencies including self harm. 

I was supposed to see someone on Saturday, but no one showed up or called. Apparently there was a miscommunication during shift change. 

I was supposed to see someone this past Monday. No one showed up or called, apparently there was miscommunication and 2 people called in sick, one left early, one didn’t show up. 

When it was rearranged for someone to come see me yesterday (specifically for dropping off food, medication, and a chat), it’s just clear to me they don’t really care. No one showed up or called. When I called two hours after, they said miscommunication during shift change and that they will send someone right away. The woman came, dropped my stuff off, and left. I stood there just watching her leave and yelled out “excuse me, could you please come in for a chat?” To which she said, “no, I’m sorry. I have four other patients to get to.” 

I called the crisis line and complained, told the woman how these visits (or lack thereof) are causing me to feel suicidal again, worthless, etc. I started crying on the phone with this woman and she told me “I have time. I will stay on the phone and talk with you.” After I went into more detail of how I’ve been feeling (such as self harming again, making plans), then asked if I could schedule a talk with a manager for tomorrow (today), she said “Okay, I’ll do that for you. Have a great night, bye.” And hung up. 

I just need some kind of guidance, help, whatever. What do I do now, when even the crisis team is falling part?


Extra things about yesterday:

The woman who dropped off my food and meds said that there was a miscommunication and that someone TRIED to call me the day before yesterday. When I said, no. I spoke to someone about this the day before AND today and was told “I am going to make this very obvious on the board to come see you”, all she did was chuckle and mention something about the food. 

When I called the 24/7 crisis line to talk about it, while I was talking about how I feel, the woman on the phone kept interrupting to tell me how she would feel. I had to yell at her to stop and to let me talk. 

And I’m only covering the past 4 days. What do you do when even the crisis team isn’t helping? I feel fucked."
700,Please help ASAP: Medication that can cause aggression?,"My dad has mentioned being on medication that can make him agressive and irrational.

As far as I know he’s had concerns with blood pressure, heart, maybe liver?? But he’s very healthy, he works out and eats well (used to do a lot of weightlifting). One of his more recent blood tests had the doctor say “your blood pressure is that of a highschool boy” my dad is almost 50. He got laid off recently, and as far as I know he’s unemployed currently, my parents spare the details.

703,"At what point do we call my friend’s parents? He suffers from depression and anxiety, and we’re all freshmen in college [US]","Hi everyone. I’m looking for other people’s opinions (especially those who have had depression, anxiety, or are college students) on whether this is past the point at which we should call my friend’s parents. I apologize for the extremely long post, but if anyone has any insight, it would be much appreciated.

Let’s call my friend Pete. He suffers from depression and anxiety and only started seeing a therapist last semester. We are second semester freshmen. This January, around 5-6 weeks ago, he started Zoloft (sertraline).

One night 4 weeks ago, he was acting extremely manic, engaging in horseplay with his roommate, just things that he usually doesn’t do. We (me, my roommate, and Pete’s roommate) knew he was struggling, but he told us that day that he had searched up the Catholic church’s position on suicide. He is a staunch Catholic, and this really concerned us especially since he was so nonchalant about it. Pete also took a pen and was following along to a tracheotomy video on YouTube, tracing it on his skin to the point his neck was red and bruised and wouldn’t stop even when we tried to take the pen and his phone away from him. When he was gone from the room, we decided that if he wasn’t better in a few days, we would call his parents.

The manic symptoms mostly stopped, but since then Pete has been going into spirals where he repeatedly texts variations of how worthless he is, how much of a burden he is on everyone, how we would be better off without him, etc which are set off by the most innocuous things. He went into a spiral that lasted for hours when his roommate didn’t wait for him before going to class despite them going to entire opposite points on campus.

2 weeks ago, we found out Pete cut for the first time. He told us that it was a one-time thing, that he only did it to see what it felt like. The cuts were done by a scissor blade and didn’t draw blood. Again, we met up without him and decided to take his word at face value (a mistake!) and decided that if he didn’t cut again, we wouldn’t tell his parents.

Again, his spirals have been happening around once every 3-4 days.

Yesterday, Pete’s roommate found out that a friend (not close, but still) committed suicide. Today, Pete was set off into a spiral because of something his roommate did (Pete has an unhealthy obsession with him) and cut again. This time, it was honestly horrific and went all the way up his forearm from his wrist. He didn’t draw blood because he used a jagged plastic part he ripped from a food container.

Both Pete’s roommate and I want to call his parents, but my roommate who is his closest friend by a long shot says that she honestly believes college is a better place for him than where he lives. Pete texted her nonstop today after he sent her a picture of his cuts, begging her not to call his parents, guilt-tripping her immensely. He said his parents would make him take a leave of absence. This situation is unsustainable and unhealthy for everyone involved, but my roommate believes home would be worse.

Pete has been seeing a therapist through all of this and told us that he was telling his therapist everything.

My sense of normalcy is gone. I don’t know what’s the limit. Is this enough to call his parents? I’m completely lost. Sorry for the long post."
704,How do you feel about anti-depression and anti-anxiety drugs?,"I have been seeing a therapist on-and-off. I'm an anxious person in general, but I was felt very depressed about two years ago and that's when I decided to get professional help.

While therapy did help me a lot, due to external triggers I've started feeling recently that I'm sleeping into my old ugly patterns and just won't be able to have any control over my emotions any more.

The last time the topic came up, I asked my doctor to let me continue with the therapy instead of trying out anti-depression and anti-anxiety drugs for a while. Now I'm reconsidering drugs and if that would help me. I have never tried the drugs so I'm not sure what kind of impact they can have, or any side effects. I'll certainly discuss this with my doctor, but I wanted to get an idea in general of how you folks feel about it."

706,Body Dysmorphia Due to Parent's Resemblance?,"I don't really know how to overcome this. It seems the older I get, the more I seem to resemble my father, at least the way he looked when he was most present in my life (and the most abusive). At first I just grew to hate looking at myself in the mirror, but now I'm genuinely starting to feel an underlying self-loathing because of it. I genuinely try to exhibit personality traits at complete odds with his; an empathetic, selfless, reliable person to those in need, kind to animals, and level-headed during times of stress, but there's a voice in my head constantly berating my actions for not being enough. 

I'm starting to think it's the main reason I have issues with courting romantic prospects as well, he was always a cheating misogynistic womanizer, and I just try to avoid anything other than polite conversation with women in public these days for fear they'll think any kind of flirting or showing interest romantically would be rude or make them feel objectified. It's been over 2 years since the last time I've gone on a date.

Anyone else have this issue? Any advice?"
707,All about Anxiety Disorders and Depression among the Elderly," It  is normal to feel anxious when faced with gruesome situations once in a  while. However, anxiety disorders involve frequent episodes of extreme  anxiety with increasing intensity in everyday situations. It often  results in panic attacks that include shortness of breath but doesn’t  engage any danger and usually lasts for prolonged periods resulting in  clinical depression.

Why am I mad about that someone I cared about is ok now and at piece I hate the stigma that suicide is selfish no it isn’t you don’t know what they may have been through let them do their thing and be ok with it just remember the good and maybe pour some out for your homie but don’t be mad at them it may be something you will never understand and just because you don’t doesn’t mean be sad or mad just love them and accept they may honestly be ok now mentall illness is a preoblem that many might not understand but we deserve to feel ok and if you don’t agree that is not my problem or anyone’s with the disorder just accept it and know they aren’t trying to hurt you they just wanted to feel comfortable if I’m gone tomorrow or a long time from now just know it’s not your fault or anyone else’s it’s just the cards I was dealt it could be so much worse than what I have but maybe I am weak and can’t handle what I have I don’t know if it’s my mental health or what but it’s more than I might be able to handle maybe I’m having an episode and I’ll wake up tomorrow and won’t do what I want to but just know that comparing someone’s situation to another’s is fucked one person might handle depression might be just as bad as you even though you weren’t dealt the same cards life is a trip just enjoy what you had or have but if someone passes from suicide done be mad at them maybe they are ok now and it’s something you may not understand but be at piece with it and move the fuck on I’m rambling at this point maybe someone will relate I’m not sure anyways I don’t know anymore but I want to just feel ok I just want to feel nothing it’s better than what I know now I doubt anyone will read this far but I’m not even depressed I have a new job on the way in a few days and my life will be ok but I know my depression will kick in or something else and all will go to shit again like it always has and maybe it’s ok if I am just at free it will all be ok for you and me anyone suffering I don’t know how long I have but maybe I will make it if I don’t ohh well it’s not that scary"
711,Zoning out for long periods of time?,"I'm really interested to see what kind of feedback I can get on this issue. Cause honestly, this is something that I haven't been able to figure out and it's definitely getting worse. 

I frequently ""zone out"" a lot. And what I mean by zone out is, I basically get lost in my own thoughts. I would describe it as a form of hardcore daydreaming. A form of daydreaming that seems almost impossible to pull myself out of. I feel like my mind just wanders and there's nothing I can do about it. It's like being in a heavy duty trance, where the world around me sort of disappears and my thoughts completely take over. Don't get me wrong, I don't hear and see things that aren't there. Like I said, ""hardcore daydreaming"". 

This started when I was a child. I used to daydream in school all the time. But eventually, teachers began noticing that my level of daydreaming was abnormal. A teacher could literally be talking to me and giving me eye contact, and still...I would be daydreaming (incapable of paying attention). For a while, there was some speculation that I might have ADD. But I was never officially diagnosed or put on medication. 

And outside of school, this was still a problem. I remember going to a family gathering as a child, and I wandered off into a quiet room somewhere, sat in a chair, and my mind literally just zoned out into more daydreaming. One of my family members found me and was like, ""Are you okay? What's wrong with you?"" And this used to happen all the time when I was hanging out with my friends. 

This problem sort of seemed to go away (or slightly lessen) when I was a teenager. But then, sometime around 2015, being in my early 20's, it started happening again. In fact, now this problem seems way more intense than before. I can literally sit in a room, in utter silence, or anywhere for that matter, without looking at my phone or doing anything, and just zone out. Completely get lost in my thoughts. And this can go on for hours. This problem has definitely interfered with my work. 

So what's going on? Can someone explain why this happens, or what type of condition this is?"
712,Been having this weird phenomenon lately...,"I’ve been unsure about revealing this to anyone close to me, at the cost of sounding insane. But for quite some time now i have had very frequent deja vu. Perhaps even increasingly frequent.

I get the sensation that i’ve lived through moments before. But it happens so much these days that it almost feels like a sense of time travel or looking into the future.

At some points it feels a bit difficult to distinguish whether i have a memory of something or one of my “premonitions” into the future.

At the same time, my thoughts of questioning whether my memories are just that or fabricated means i’m starting to feel a bit unsure of which memories are real and how much i’m forgetting or making up.

I realize this probably doesn’t make much sense, and sounds crazy. But i just wanted to talk about it to someone other than myself."

715,I feel terribly trapped,"To be fair, I don’t even know why I am posting this, but at this point nothing really matters to me anymore.

Long story short, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life.
I grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father. Countless days of being beaten and verbally abused, going to school while not even being able to sit down due to the belt marks on my body. Would go to school just to be bullied that I was not as wealthy as most kids in my class, fat, and ugly.
Bullying went on during most of my school years until close to graduating, but scars were already made: i was became anorexic due to starving myself. My confidence was 0.

My only refuge was music and performing and my parents decided to force me to quit because they never agreed with the idea of following an art path compared to a “stable and secure” one. I started contemplating suicide more and more.

Years passed, I moved out for uni. I got my first full time job and got into streaming. I hated the uni i went to so I dropped it in my last year. First year of college was summed up in being a straight up alcoholic. 

I never had any stable relationships for longer than 6 months and I would always be the one getting dumped, to the point where my parents would start mocking me for having mental issues, hence me deciding not even trying to open up to them.

Last year I was living a very monotone life: going to work, getting home, stream, sleep, repeat. I have decided to make a change in my life and moved in a different country to start from scratch.

Things didn’t go as planned, ended up unable to find a job for 8 months, period of time in which streaming was my only income and i could barely make the rent money but nothing else for myself, barely something to eat. I had a couple of miserable factory jobs but I was too weak physically to keep up. I wanted to kill myself so badly but for some reason I didn’t.

After those 8 months I finally got a stable job, can’t say I love it, but it’s a stable income. I’m still not happy. I hate myself, I hate my body.

During this time I met a guy for which I have fallen like I never did before. He gave me a reason to go keep going, although there is a distance between us. I went to his country for New Years. Was supposed to be there for 5 days. Out of 5 days I only got to spend like 12 hours with him cause out of nowhere he decides to ghost me. So I spent my holiday sitting alone in my airbnb in a foreign country. 

At this point I feel beyond salvation. I don’t see the point of seeking therapy. Knowing all my past and current traumas I will most definitely end up on pills and I will only feel beyond tempted to overdose and put everything to an end.

I can’t focus on my work for more than few minutes anymore, my will to do anything productive is 0. I am just a walking dead.

That’s about it (although there are way more fucked up details in the background which I chose not to mention)."
716,Advice for you all,"Hi All

Rather than thinking of negatives of the problems you are experiencing, think of what you have achieved that day or that week with the symptoms you have. 

Then, think hang on x y z person doesn’t have these symptoms but is in the same situation as me also consider how your symptoms affect your life in general. 
Does the tiredness and fatigue make it difficult to function at work, uni?
Are you experiencing challenging feelings that just everyday tasks a struggle?

If you are unable to work due your condition, what you do improve your situation if you are unable to work. There’s no point in dwelling on being unable to work.

By the way, we were not living in the same cities, so it was not possible to establish an emotional relationship, we just had a good time. I would understand if we thought of an emotional relationship and she didn't like me. It's just so thoughtless to treat someone you chat with just because of its appearance.

I pay attention in class but still don't understand and when I try teaching myself at home I just get so stressed out from the fact that I'm having breakdowns trying to learn stuff everyone else learned at the beginning of the year. I just can't learn math without scratching my arms up and sobbing and punching myself and pulling my hair. Is there any way to remain calm when I'm doing math??

I had a good childhood for the most part, but when I was 10 my parents relationship got really bad, because of money problems in the 2008 recession  and my mental health declined ever since then.
My parents divorced in 2015 after 7 years of basically just verbally abusing each other.
I first lived with my mom for about 3 years but because she has some health problems (diabetes and multiple correlated illnesses) she couldn't take care of me anymore so she kicked me out and since then I live with my father.
But I just can't talk to him, I've been struggling  with depression, agoraphobia  and social anxiety for almost a decade now. I am not able to talk to anyone seriously  about my problems and every other week my depression becomes so bad that I can't get up/ can't go to work because my anxiety gets unbearable  when the depression becomes worse. 
On the days that I can't go to work/ get out of the house I have a friend park my car on the other side of town and I hide in my room because I am scared of seeing my dad and talking to him.
Can anyone help me/ give me advice?"

723,Hallucinations,"I'm kind of freaking out right now and wanted to get someone else's opinion of the matter. 

A few minutes ago I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. When I got up, I noticed my cat sitting on the dresser. It was dark so I could only sort of make him out (mostly the lighter parts of his fur). I walked over to pet him but he was moving around and the first time I tried he moved too far away. When I did get to where I could reach him, my hand passed right through him. He then faded away while I moved my hand back and forth through him like a ghost. 

I'd be less freaked out, thinking I was just tired or something, but this has happened before. Probably a month ago I walked into the bathroom. To get to the bathroom you have to walk through the laundry room. The bathroom also has a window right by the toilet. Because of my social anxiety, I get anxious my neighbors will be able to see me while I'm in there with the lights on when it's dark outside. So I always just turn the laundry room light on and then mostly close the bathroom door so there's just enough light that I can see. 

Anyway, I was in the bathroom one evening and when I went to wash my hands there was this giant spider sitting on the faucet. It looked a little weird though. Like the lighting was off, it seemed too dark and then almost staticky? I was freaked out and quickly backed up towards the light switch. I looked behind me quickly to find the light switch. I turned it on and looked back and the spider was gone. 

Not sure if this is related, but also when I see an object out of the corner of my eye I often think it's something else. Like if I walk past a bag, I'll think it's my cat until I actually look at it. This never bothered me because everyone has done that. But I do seem to do it far more often than anyone I know. 

I have had auditory hallucinations before but they were spaced years apart. Like, in college I thought I heard someone say my name in an empty hallway. I think this had happened to lots of people right? And one time I was hiking and I went to go touch a branch. Just before I touched it I heard someone shout in an angry tone and quickly jerked my hand back. I couldn't tell what he said but he sounded close. But when I asked my boyfriend, he said he hadn't heard anything. 

Information about me: I'm 28, living in the US. I see a therapist monthly and have been diagnosed with social anxiety, adhd, and avoidant personality disorder. I'll talk to her in a week but I wanted to get someone else's thoughts on all this before that. 

Sorry for the wall of the text. Thank you if you read all the way through."
724,What's wrong with me?,"So recently I discovered that when I think about stabbing people to death, I get aroused. So I tried doing that in Red Dead Redemption 2 in first person view and when I stabbed the woman's throat I suddenly got hard. I also fantasize  about stabbimg and hurting people, I get kinda aroused.. I started masturbating to images of decapitated/amputated women's corpses. Does anyone else here have this? Is this ok?"
725,no one likes me no matter what I try,"so all go fuck yourself, feeling like killing someone."
726,I'm not sure what to do anymore,"I've had this issue that really worsened around about the 9th grade, where I would lose focus, not be able to study or concentrate and get frustrated at the prospect of studying for exams or doing assignments. Well now im in my first year of university, second semester and its the worst it's ever been.

There are multiple assignments i completely didn't do, which I've never done before, and I'd walk up mere hours before a class to skim read the notes for a test. I have an art class where we have to submit 2 courseworks every week and every week we delay it we lose a letter grade, and it's been 5 weeks and I've only done one coursework from the first week and didn't do the others. I also have this language course where we have to write a paragraph long diary entry every week and i haven't done any of them. Among other assignments i just can't bring myself to do. Everytime i sit down and tell myself to work i just feel frustrated and angry and cry almost everytime. I've also always worked so slowly that something that i predict should take me an hour at most takes me the whole day and i might not even finish it.

This doesn't only happen with studying, but also with starting things i actually want to do, like drawing or reading, i just can't get myself to start them because it always feels like the time in a day passes by super quickly and im lagging behind.

I tried to go to a counseller at uni before but it either didn't help, i had bad experiences with either the booking or they cancel, or the counsellers were just kinda rude or standoffish.

I made another post on why i can't tell my mom about this either, but the gist of it is that she doesn't believe me and waves it off, as things like this make her worry and she doesn't like getting stressed.

At this moment in time im on a two week break, and i still want to start on my overdue assignments, as well as an english assignment that was supposed to be due 3 days ago and i didnt realise with today being the last day, but again everytime i try to type or even think abouy doing research i get frustrated and angry and anxious and cry. I don't know what to do, i don't wanna fail because my family will get mad at me but i just can't do it at all.

I try opening articles, I've opened so many of ""How to start studying"" or ""How to do things you don't want to do"" or otherwise, I've asked on here before and I've looked at other people's advice on websites but none of it works. I don't know what to do."
727,So why does my brain want to focus on something to get paranoid about?,"So usually I’m chilling. But my brain likes to be paranoid and have anxiety over shit that my rational side of my brain is saying “ it why” and it replies “lol why not” for example when COVID-19 was mentioned I had a huge panic attack. Now it doesn’t affect me as much. Except for some reason my brain wants to focus on it as if it’s the end of civilization, I’m 18 so I have a 0.2% of mortality if I even get it. But then I worry if my dad whose older gets it or my mom whose a diabetic gets it. Then my brother just left to Hawaii. So it spooks me yet it’s a small chance and it’s just a longer flu with pneumonia. Then before this it was North Korea’s threats and shit. I have an anxiety problem but it’s like once or twice a month but that’s due to me bottling it all up. When I had a huge panic attack my mom noticed and she’s never seen it and they got worried and want to get me some meds. But I’d rather not take anti depressants type medicines for an issue I get once or twice a month. And I know weed would probably help in this situation but since they’re older and grew up in a different period they believe it to be super harmful and addictive. But I feel like in this situation it’ll help more since it’s a stimulant rather than an anti depressant. 

Anyways why does my brain like to focus on shit like this?"
728,Ripping my toenails off,"I'm not sure if this is the place to post this, but I'm thinking this might be a mental health issue.  


Toenails - I've always had the disgusting habit of picking at my toenails while lying in bed. I don't cut them like a normal person, when they get long enough I kind of just peel the excess off with my finger nails. From what I can tell, this is somewhat common.  


That said - I've recently started to go much further. I will obsess over one toe nail, and pick at it until I eventually peel the entire toe nail off. It doesn't hurt a lot, but it does cause discomfort for like a week. 4 of the 5 toes on my left foot are currently scabby, uncomfortable and without nails. I've started on my right foot last night. At the time, it just feels so satisfying to do. But the next day I regret it, as it's incredibly uncomfortable to put shoes one.. But I keep doing it.  


I'm wondering, is this the result of some kind of mental health issues? I do have pretty serious anxiety, which I take Celexa for, which helps tremendously. Or is this just me taking a disgusting habit too far?  


Thoughts?  
Thanks for reading."
729,"Walking in circles, A short rap I wrote after having a panic attack","i'm walking in circles, 

repeating words that mean nothing 

pacing to chase my thoughts

As they loop and descend into towards an end that renders my goals unobtainable

I need to be perfect flawless rought from gold molded to be sold but nobody's buying it

they look and they see my madness my addiction not my conviction to a dream that escapes me a dream of perfection, a dream without insecurities 

an inscrutible indisputible dream of who I could be

and all they see is my addiction 

and I see it too, I'm not hooked on high or excited to try I am a slave to my hubris to my delusion to my brains intentional confusion

to my self belief

I believe in my dreams uncontainable as they soar above my mind and I fall hooked on the delusion that I have grown to love

and the world screams the truth but their outcry only serves to further cleave my mind 

they scream of how I'm falling failing disabling the functions I was once proud of

730,Believing my own bullshit? Is this normal?,"I'll summarize this as much as I can, but it's going to have to be a long one to get enough context.

Me and my long-term girlfriend broke up a few months back, but we've kept in touch a bit. Things are fine between us, we just don't want to be together any more. She started seeing a new guy over a month ago, but I haven't even had a date since we broke up... nothing. Just been dealing with my own things.

She phoned me last night, asking for some computer help. It was the first time we'd spoken in about 3 weeks. In passing, she asked how Ive been recently.

I don't know why, but I decided to lie and say I've started dating someone. I didn't want to make her think I'd locked myself in my flat since she left... I don't know why. ""Well it's about time! Glad you're getting back out there. So, how long have you been dating?""  ""Ohh... it's only been a couple of weeks."" ""Nice. So... a few dates? ...Come on, spill it!""

The conversation went on for probably 10 minutes and I managed to invent a realistic imaginary woman and the 4 imaginary but believable dates we'd been on, on-the-fly. I also slipped in something about not being sure if it was going to last, so that I could drop the whole thing easily (I could almost see myself being pulled into a ridiculous sitcom-style farce if I wasn't careful).

So I have no idea why I did it, but I did, and I think she believed it all. I really felt weird about it afterwards, like I'd done something that wasn't normal. Like I'd gone a bit insane. I'd been so worried about what my ex would think, that I just lied non-stop for 10 minutes without really pausing. I was a bit shocked at how easy it was.

But here's the thing that worries me more. I woke up this morning feeling great. In fact, I specifically felt like I was looking forward to something... perhaps my date on Friday, that wasn't actually going to happen, because I'd made up the entire thing last night. I feel different in myself, as if it was true.

I'm not saying I've fallen into my own fantasy. I don't actually believe she exists. But I have that feeling inside, that you get when you first start dating somebody. I feel better today than I have for a long time. It's as if talking about dating somebody and pretending it's real, flipped some switches in my brain and put me into honeymoon-period mode.

I've been a bit worried about my mental health for a while now, but this is new. Do you think it's unhealthy behavior? I'm not sure what I should do."
731,I'm becoming mentally and emotionally abusive and i don't know how to stop,"Before I say anything i want to apologise if I have upset anyone who reads this, i feel i have to say this because while I don't go into great detail I talk about some sensitive topics, again I'm so sorry if i upset anyone who reads this i just don't know what to do.

For a while now i have noticed i have these thoughts of hurting and mentally abusing the people around me and I don't know what to do.

For some backstory (this is going to be very basic as theres alot) I'm a 18 year old girl who came from a really rough background, my mother was (and still is but better) really mentally unstable and up to the age of 11, she used me as a psychologist up to the age of 15. I was the victim of mental and verbal abuse, severe neglect and at one point almost physical abuse just before i ran away to live with my father. Basically up to I started living with my dad i was the real life version of Steven Kings Carrie, with the naivety to periods and all.

Because of what i went through i have PTSD, OCD traits relating to my body hair, memory issues (probably due to trying to cope with PTSD by forgetting the truama) and anger problems. I also have dyslexia but the only because I missed out on so education that i fall under the diagnosis.

While i have been handling my mental problems and education quite well I have noticed that I have been fantasizing and thinking of different ways to gain control over peoples lives.

I constantly think of different ways i can break someone either physically or emotionally, I have learnt to see peoples weak points and exploit them so i can get them to do what i want, how to gain peoples trust so they confind their problems and secrets, i know how to gas light people and I can convince anyone of anything if i wanted to.

I know that this is wrong and I feel that it's wrong to do these, i can't help but think about being a dictator or a cult leader and having people fear me and bend to my every will with no say in what they want.

I feel horrible because up to this year I have never acted on these feelings to a point of causing true damage, the worst i have ever done is cause manipulate people into thinking the sunshines out of my ass. I have recently mentally fucked my ex to the point that i think they may of tried to commit suicide and the only reason they didn't do it is because I messaged their mother telling her that her daughter is threatening suicide.

I feel like a fucking disgrace because even though at the time I was genuinely terrified that she was going to take her life, theres a small part of me who wants to continue the mental fuckery on her so i can see if she actually does it. According to many of her friends who we used to share she had threatened suicide in the past for attention many times and this time was probably no exception.

I am terrified of what i am capable of when given the power and validation from others, i want to speak out and get help but I fear if i tell anyone I know they will turn their back on me until i have no one to turn to.

I don't want to be an abuser and manipulator, i don't want to put people though the mental torture I went through as a child, i don't want this to be me! All I have ever wanted was to protect the people i love because no one was there for me when I was young, but I don't know what to do I don't know who to turn to anymore, i have been trying to see my old psychologist who helped me learn to cope with my truama but it has been a long and grueling process and I don't know how long i can handle these thoughts anymore. 

Please does anyone have or had these same feelings? How did you cope without therapy? What can i do to handle this so i don't have an anger episode where I manipulate people?"
732,I opened up to my school nurse about my depression and trauma.,"And I think its only getting better for the next few days.
Last week I visited our school clinic for a stuffy nose relief. Unfortunately, medicines for that weren't available so I went with a Vicks instead. 
She suggested i'd sit down for a little while. I sat on the chair while applying some Vicks below my nose and thought i'd chat with her.
I had been holding my emotions for the past few months. I was struggling. Flashbacks about what happened were going back more often than it usually does, and it's bugging me a lot. I have been having problems with my friends too. We've been having trust issues and I don't think they're actually here for me, which makes me feel more alone. And it just adds up to my heavy thoughts.
I wanted to open it all up to our school nurse, because at this point, I don't think any of my friends would listen to me and try to help. Maybe they'll try to help, sure, but they can only do so much. I felt like I needed actual help. After what happened, my parents refused the government's suggesiton to take us to therapy (which was also because they had issues with them) and I didn't open up to them about the whole thing because when I tried, they say that's it was just some other emotion I was feeling, and I shouldn't think about it. I feel like they'll think i'm just overreacting.

I was kind of comfortable to open up to her, she is really nice and I know a few people who actually come up and talk to her. I started by asking her if anxiety was a mental illness (although I already knew it was). She was nice and she answered. Eventually our conversation led to what I was holding up and my trauma. It was a different kind of comfort that I felt when she closed the door, sat next to me, and listened eagerly when my voice started to crack talking about my past. She was really nice and even shared stories abiut her experiences with depression last year and her relationships with her friends. It felt nice to have someone actually listen to your problems and somehow relate them to their experiences and share their thoughts about yours. It just says that they were really listening to you and really cared about you. After that, she asked me if it was okay for me to take a BDI test, which determines if you have depression or not, or at what level your depression is. I said yes. The next few days I took the test and scored 39. That afternoon I was excused from class and went to the counselor's office. He was kinda surprised at first, and said that whatever I was going through wasn't obvious to him. At first I wasn't feeling comfortable with him (his face looked like he was gonna crack up anytime or something) but then he started to talk about things and his insights. He also said that out of all the students in our class, I was the kindest and most dependable one. Of course at first I didn't believe him (and I still doubt it up to this day). ""That's impossible, that can't be it, none of my teachers would even give me a task, they probably know i'll do it late,"" I thought to myself. He said even the other teachers observed the same thing, and my teacher's son, who was my classmate, would even say the same thing. I don't really know.
Since we were talking about my paranoia, depression, and trauma, he said he finally understood why I was kinda shy.
Finally he said that we could make me better together and help erase the thoughts, but it's up to me to decide for that. Of course I agreed.
Now, I'm going to go to the counselor's or the nurse's office everyday around afternoon to talk about stuff. We still have 2 weeks left before class ends. We only have a little time left, but a little help wouldn't hurt. It would really help me to continue improving myself this summer and finally come back to school as a better person.
This was an amazing thing to happen to me because I had never talked to anyone in authority about what I was going through in almost 2 years.
Yesterday I gave the school nurse a chocolate bar to thank her. If it wasn't for her, I probably would still have to hold up my emotions for a little longer alone. The world needs more people like her; who'll eagerly listen and care for anyone in need.
Also, if you're going through the same thing as me, go to a psychologist/psychiatrist. I've only talked to our school nurse and counselor, but the feeling of someone actually sympathizing and helping you is really good to help me get through. What more if I actually talked to someone who specializes in helping people like me?
I'm still trying to find a way to get my parents take me to a doctor, but i'm still afraid to open up to them. Our family is still going through stuff and I don't want to add up to their problems. Also, I'm still hesitating to take medication because i'm afraid of the side effects, but if that is what has to be done, I guess i'll think about it. But I'm really thinking if seeing a doctor soon.

P.S. If you think what my counselor said was a mind trick or something, please tell me. I wouldn't get angry or sad or anything, I just simply not believe him. In my point of view, it's just unlikely haha. It kept bugging me because what if it was just an effort to make me feel better? Sure, but it would really make me not trust his compliments anymore lol."
733,Better,"It’s taken 6 years, but it dawned on me recently that my depression may have ‘passed’. Even the bad days aren’t so bad anymore.

Still a lot of work to do, but I just feel this massive sense of relief that I haven’t felt I’m trying to hold back the tide for some time now.

Grateful to be one of the lucky ones where it does ‘get better with time’.

Have a good day, everyone."
734,The never ending cycle of being lonely.. Good read,[the Cycle of Loneliness ](https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/04/how-to-break-the-dangerous-cycle-of-loneliness/522180/)
735,need help please," I dont even know where to start. I just really need your responses. i have written this post so many times, and got few of them.

First of all, i just want to mention that this post is going to include questions about mental health, and if your response is going to be to see a therapist just dont even bother replying. Its not about money, there are some other reasons and also i dont think that this problem is to an extend where i need one. I would really appreciate each and every respond of yours, since it can help a lot.

Basically. I developed a thought that theres something wrong with me. I think that its on an unconscious level, like even if im not thinking about it, my actions still can be affected by this mindset. It doesnt make me depressed or anything like that, it could be just me being paranoid, or just a teen. But around couple of months ago, the thought came back. It used to come and go but didnt use to bother me that much, maybe for a day max.

But couple of months ago i started considering that i might be on the spectrum. The thing is that if being logical, it doesnt make sense at all, since i got no symptoms of it at all. But for example, hours ago i literally believed that it was true, regardless the logic.

Okay as i said it started months ago, i even remember the day. The next day i had uni, basically it bothered me for that day and after that it went away. Being around people definitely helps, because i dont feel any different, i even tend to think that im above others and even seperate myself from them.

Basically, yea it hasnt bothered me for probabily months, and then the one month break came. I, for particular reasons, ended up with no close friends (it happened probably 2 years ago, when i fell out with my school friends). Even tho at uni i literally got to know to everyone, became the most popular, cuz i definitely dont struggle socially, cuz of different factors i did not manage to make close friends. I mean we still talk to each other, but not outside uni, we only went out couple of times, thats it. But yea, the point is that i ended up alone.

Have Been alone the whole month, and obviously it doesn't help my paranoia. I havent felt completely peacful ever since. This thought kills me. Its not that im depressed, but i question myself a lot, and as i said i even sometimes believe that i have the condition.

I dont even know what to do anymore. My only hope now, is the break to end, tho it happens in 2 weeks. But what should i do till then? My mind keeps clinging on my negative memories, and tries to somehow connect it to the condition, and no matter how ridiculous it is i have moments as i said where i totally start believeing it. Well, its not that im at home all the time. I go to gym everyday, but obviously it doesnt help much.

I don't know what it is. Am i psychotic cuz of loneliness? I haven't felt like a part of group in a while as i said? Or is it just my age? I just turned 18. No matter how many times i tell myself that this thought doesnt make any sense, i just cant help but believe it sometimes.

Being around peope, hopefully will solve this problem, because it is making me insane. As i said the first time i considered it was months ago, and after being around people, feeling that im no different, the thought dissapeared.

Obviously, the fact that i even developed this thought is not healthy. I even used to think that there was something wrong with me and my parents and everyone were hiding it from me, tho obviously it doesnt make sense too, because of how im treated. Is it a part of being 18? Like i have not felt normal, in so long. Its like ""theres got to be something wrong with me."" What do i do? Im tired of going thru this cycle, i obviously dont have it. But i know that maybe even tomorrow i might feel otherwise. I really need your help."
736,Overwhelming feeling that I'm not doing enough,"Recently I've been experiencing horrible anxiety and bordering depression as a result of seeing other people in my field doing really well, getting amazing opportunities, achievements etc. Things that I feel like I should be doing. I'm in music (a performer) and considered myself to be doing pretty well and steadily progressing, and I've even had others asking me for advice which is a great sign that I'm able to help others through my experience. Now seeing those people doing well and getting amazing gigs and working with big names makes me feel like I'm being overtaken and getting 'forgotten' almost.

Social media is obviously a big culprit here, watching Instagram stories and so on and feeling bad about myself and my work as a result. It's gotten to the point where I'm experiencing horrible anxiety attacks, unhelpful thoughts and beating myself up about how much I'm working and how much more I should be. It's keeping me up at night and the stress of it is becoming unbearable. I've started to resent people in my field who are doing better than me, which is a horrible feeling and I don't want that. I want to feel happy for people and want to support them!

I've struggled with mental health all my life and as those who have suffered similarly will know all too well, this results in extreme tiredness all the time. I know I'm not doing enough - I have a good amount of time and I just find it difficult to work, and consistently too. I know I should be working harder and I know I could achieve so much more but I'm just so exhausted all the time. And these thoughts make me feel worse, therefore more exhausted, therefore less able to work, and it turns into a cycle.

I guess my question is, how should I go about tackling these thought processes/anxiety/resentment, and how can I deal with this exhaustion and make sure I am working consistently to the point where I will see results and feel like I am making progress and getting closer to where I want to be? Has anyone here experienced similar feelings?"

738,need help please,"so i was watching new netflix movie “All the bright places” and when Violet found out Flinch was gone /dead/, i started crying so hard that i couldnt breathe, i had to stop the movie and soon it became kinda out of control to the point where i found myself cutting my wrist, then i kinda calmed down. is this considered panic attack?"
739,Am I repressing a sexually abusive memory OR am I making it all up?,"Hey all, I’m posting here because my confusion and avoidance of these thoughts has led me down a deep depressive state for the last week. My appointment with my therapist isn’t until next week.

Recently, while high, I absentmindedly rubbed my nipple (I’m 23M, don’t think it matters though). While it sounds kind of silly, this action immediately filled me up with an uncomfortable feeling and a lot of hot shame. I felt the blood rush up to my face. I then thought about a vivid memory that I’ve thought about often, but never dwelled on - I used to get that exact same feeling when I was 6-7 years old and I’d see our church’s pastor walking down the aisle. I remember telling my mother one time that when I rub my “chee-chee” (my kid word for nipple) I get the same feeling as when I see the pastor. She seemed concerned and inquired further, but I don’t remember anything she said beyond that. In addition, I genuinely cannot remember any actual sexual abuse from this pastor. There are gaps in my memory at this point in my childhood, and this is one of my only vivid memories from that church. 

Now this church was very small and everyone knew everyone. My parents had been going since they were kids. My grandma’s ex husband’s son-in-law’s dad was the pastor. My mom claims they left because they were so judgy and always in everyone’s business. She said the pastor shamed her in a service when she got pregnant with me out of wedlock.. but if that was the reason for leaving, then why do I remember going to that church until I was nearly 7 yrs old? I also only have one clear memory of being without my parents in front of the pastor, and this was during the recitals for the church play. However, I don’t recall any abuse.

Now, I’ve never once considered the idea that I may have repressed a sexually abusive memory. However I just decided to read up on symptoms of sexual abuse... and holy shit, I’ve been dealing with all of the symptoms that come along with it my whole life. In nasty ways. 

At 16, for seemingly no reason (my life was made: lots of friends in school, athlete, and bright student) I became seriously depressed. I began smoking a ton of weed to cope, and I never let me parents in to my mental struggles (they were young &amp; inexperienced, and not very good at allowing me to be sad... usually they’d say I was whining). When my dad found weed in the house, he beat the shit out of me. He had never been abusive like that before, I’d only ever received spankings. At 16, he beat me to a pulp (had to get stitches and had black eye) and kicked me out of the house. I lived with a friend for 5-6 months &amp; moved back in after family therapy. Then they caught me smoking weed again. I was still manically depressed. This time he simply said he was disappointed. I attempted to kill myself that night, but was saved by angel cops on the bridge. 

I’m 23 now, and it’s been a constant battle with anxiety and depression. Somehow I’ve been holding it down, and I’m on my last year of college. I’ve tried killing myself another time, after I was raped 2 years ago. I’m heterosexual, but I decided to seek validation at a gay bar because I  am incredibly insecure and I knew I’d get attention there. I went during a weekend that my GF was out of town (I know, it’s fucked). I got way too drunk, way too quick. My belief is that I was drugged. Either way, I blacked out. Next thing I remember, I’m in some tranny’s dark dirty room and feel a cock trying to be shoved in my ass. I don’t know why I didn’t try to stop it. I was barely cognizant. That fucker somehow had even taken the keys to my car and driven us both to their house. I woke up the next morning and dipped... got tested for HIV and dealt with the shame for weeks. 

For years now (even before the rape), I’ve been addicted to sex &amp; porn. I crave it 24/7. When I was single I went out every weekend and felt like shit if I didn’t bring a girl home and fuck. I had girls on rotation throughout the week. Even in a relationship, I’d buy hookers when my gf was on her period or when she was mad at me. I even got head from a crackhead off the street in exchange for Taco Bell. And I didn’t even give her the fucking Taco Bell cause she was so cracked out. 

Now as of 6 months ago, I’ve started having incredibly invasive and obsessive thoughts about forcing myself upon women. I walk around a campus full of beautiful girls, and I can’t stop imagining myself pinning them down in a bush at night... I’ve gone so far a couple nights as to follow a random girl around and just play the fantasy in my head. One night the fantasy became too real and I began chatting up a cute girl as she walked home. She felt comfortable with me as I look like a regular student, and I’m decently handsome. We hit he juul and chatted. Then I began groping her ass under her skirt &amp; she slapped my hand away looking disgusted. I then hugged her forcefully and tried grabbing her boob. She pushed me off and ran. I ran the other way as I snapped back into my head. Listen, I’m not this fucking person. I’m not even some incel. I’m a very charismatic and charming person (6’5, good bod, good smile), I’m intelligent (engineering degree), I’m good at communicating, I even have a beautiful fucking girlfriend. On the surface, I’ve got it all. Everyone tells me this. People are incapable of seeing my struggles because of this. My life seems perfect. Internally though, I’ve got this vicious fucking demon that manifests itself in cruel &amp; disgusting ways. I feel sick describing this experience.

I’ve gone to a therapist about these rapey thoughts, and I’ve been able to dull them to a murmur. They haven’t gone away, but they aren’t so strong that I act on them. Kind of like my suicidal thoughts. To be honest, I’ve been self medicating again &amp; just staying high 24/7 on weed. I masturbate like twice before I even leave the house. I’m afraid if I’m sober too long or if I don’t masturbate enough, I’ll do something I regret again. 

All of these things: shame about feeling my nipples rubbed, depression &amp; anxiety for seemingly no reason, extreme promiscuity, enjoying rapey thoughts, seeking male validation ...... 

do ya’ll think I’m repressing some sort of sexual abuse? Or did my high mind just come up with that idea as a convenient way to explain &amp; compartmentalize all of this neurotic behavior I’ve had? How does one figure out?

If you’ve read this far, thank you so much. I don’t care what you think of me, I’ve already thought it myself tenfold. Please, just give your experience &amp; advice. I need it so badly &amp; I’m very confused."
740,"After spending the last 10 years of my life thinking I hated my life, i realized I actually don’t.","I’m 22F, and my depression started when I was about 12. After a million break downs, my boyfriend said he doesn’t understand how I can hate my life when he tries so hard. It made me realize I don’t hate my life. On paper my life is pretty good. I have a close family that loves me, I have an easy job that pays well, I have my dream vehicle, I have a beautiful home, and an awesome boyfriend. I realized what I hate is being me. I hate my brain for making me who I am, and I hate my body. I hate every single thing. Up until recently I used to be able to find a few things about myself that I still liked. Not anymore though. There’s no pills, or therapy that could fix that or give me a new brain and body. I cry all the time because I feel so much self hatred and it’s becoming over whelming. I feel like I’m going crazy and one of these days my brain is just gonna snap. I don’t want to be me anymore. I could never kill myself, because I saw first hand how my dads suicide effects my immediate family. I could never put them thru that too. These days I just pray to get taken out In a car accident or something. Anything that makes it not my fault so they could still heal."
741,Why do I have no appetite?,"No idea if this is the right thread or not but I literally have no appetite and can’t figure out why. I work outside from 6:30 am to like 4:30, wake up at 5:15 am and get home at usually like 5:15 pm. The last two days while at work I had a small protein drink and a banana and then the other day just the protein drink. When I got home my mom asked me how hungry I was and said very, cause I was, but when she put a big plate of food in front of me I probably only ate half and definitely wasn’t full-but I also wasn’t hungry. The next day for dinner (the day without the banana) I ate half of my leftovers-so not much. It started a little while ago when I lost my appetite for meat. I would make chicken and sides or whatever, eat the sides, and maybe take a bite of the meat before being like “I have absolutely no desire to eat this” and either put it in the fridge with anticipation of eating it later (which I never did) or just getting rid of it. It wasn’t for any moral reason or anything- I just had no appetite for it. Now, I just don’t want anything. And I’m usually the kind of person that is constantly eating. 

I’m very happy with my life. Yes, my hours are tough but I graduated in December and am working with great people in the exact field I wanted to be in and I enjoy my job. I am not depressed or feeling anxious/stressed and I am not upset with my body so I’m not trying to starve myself to loose weight. 

Has anyone ever had anything like this happen? Is it possible there is some sort of mental thing going on her I’m not aware about???"
742,Can the gloominess that comes after a happy even comes to an end make you ill?,"My days have been very dull for a few years now. We had a huge get together with all my relatives for the past few days. Now that everyone has left, I felt extremely gloomy, and now I feel sick and very tired and dizzy."
743,"So, What To Do","So, just coming off a failed CBT referral they suggested that counselling might be more appropriate, however they couldn't refer me as my scores were too low, so this leaves me stuck fending for myself, i've looked at private counselling but the costs for that are far and above what a part timer at national minimum wage can ever afford

Ideally i don't want to end up dipping to the low that resulted in my initial referral but at this point that seems like the only real way to get some actual help, i'm waiting to hear back from the ""mental health navigators"" but from reading their site they don't seem to really offer much more than a friendly meeting in a public place which obviously isn't really going to help much when it comes to actually dealing with stuff

Just feels like i've been dumped in the middle of nowhere without so much as a paddle to steer by"
744,Why is it so difficult to find a therapist who accepts health insurance?,"I’ve received yet another rejection letter from a therapist who doesn’t accept my health insurance. I work for the government at the State level and have what I would consider to be the best health insurance I’ve ever had for physical healthcare but possibly the worst for mental healthcare. SO MANY  mental health providers do not accept any health insurance whatsoever and charge over $200 per session. That’s $800 per month for a weekly therapist, out of pocket. I have a psychiatrist who is hesitant to prescribe me the medication I need since I’m not seeing a weekly therapist to talk through these very serious issues I’ve been experiencing for quite some time. Most people can’t afford to pay out of pocket for a weekly therapist and I am one of them. Just my two cents as someone who is desperate to find a solution to what seems like an everlasting problem. I’ll remember how I’m feeling at this exact moment when I’m voting in November."
745,trans and depressed,"[rant that makes no sense, but i do feel better after writing it and im curious if y'all have some thoughts about it]

today was the 4th time to see my psychologist, and this is the first time i got super upset after.
she didn't word it, but the way she spoke made me feel like she doesn't believe i'm trans (born female, transitioning to male). i haven't felt bad about my identity for the last few weeks, but now i feel insecure again. i know, for some people the reason they believe they're trans and have dysphoria is because they survived some kind of trauma, let it be sexual assault or parenting problems. none of those happened to me. im almost trying to convince myself that im ok the way i am, im ok living as a girl, even tho it did not work out for the first 13-14 years (im 17 now, out and people know im a trans guy). i was always pretty flat but i still felt bad about having a female chest, and like a 14 year old teenage girl i tried to make them look bigger which made me feel even worse. 
i just want to be one of the guys and most people treat me that way, and i never felt so comfortable being in public.
this really was the least of my problems - im trying to wait out 18 and be happy, and be even happier with hormones and some surgeries, and i wouldn't even have worried about it until now.
why is it so hard to believe you don't know who you are when you're like...5? how was i supposed to know? i know some people do but i did not,, why is that so wrong?"
746,I need some advice,"I don't really know how to start this so im just gonna get straight to the point.

Im 18 and in a pretty bad shape mentally. I used to self harm when i was around 14 and recently did it again, but only just once. For about a year now im basically losing all hope, motivation. Sometimes i don't want to get up from bed, I have suicidal thoughts and im just tired of it all. Im also starting to fail my classes, which is just fantastic.

I went to therapy about 2 years ago but it didn't really help. The woman just told me to change the way I look and im gonna be happy again, which was a load of bs.

I feel like I really need to tell my mom, I need her help. But I have no idea how to tell her all of this and not offend her. When raising me she and my grandma always told me im not allowed to be sad, because I have everything- loving family, money, roof above my head. Yet i can't help but feel this way."
747,Anyone in the uk been diagnosed with Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) ?,If so Was it done through the nhs?
748,Cleaned my flat,"So I have spent 2 days cleaning, did the bathroom spotless last week, the living room yesterday with 10 bags to the tip. Today I did the bedroom, threw out most my clothes as I never wear them, have 13 bags to take the tip tomorrow. Feel so much better mentally, have been putting it off for years and it just builds and builds. Place was a mess so never want people round, wouldnt open the blinds either. I feel like a weight has been lifted. Now just the dreaded kitchen."
749,Should I seek therapy?,"Hi there, im a generally happy person and Ive never really sought mental therapy before. A few years ago, I had a violent fallout with a friend. It was pretty much my fault, and it cancelled a recurring activity we had with a few others. The person in question sent me a furious message, and I apologized profusely. Some time later, he messaged me with a very brief forgiveness email. The group got together one last time to hang out but no one really addressed what had happened.

Fast forward a couple years, I still think about the whole incident. Neither the person or that group is involved in my life, but I still cant seem to shake the feeling of shame. You know when your brain keeps you up at night with the embarrassing things youve done? This is the big one for me. Ive tried messaging the person, but i only had an old email address and im not sure theyll read it. I guess it feels like I never got closure on the fallout. But at the same time, i dont think I should be thinking about this as obsessively every day. I dont really miss that person or the group, however the thought of the incident bums me out and makes me feel ashamed.

I know this is really small compared to the serious issues others face, bit I think about it basically every day and am kind of tired of beating myself up. Does it sound like I should speak to a professional? Or am I doing something wrong with my thought process? Id appreciate your input!"
750,Bipolar but with no ups?,"Is that a thing? I’m kind of self diagnosing but basically if my mood is a line on a graph it’s like it’s stays average and then I have large dips downwards, but there aren’t much peaks upwards. It’s like I’ve got a limiter on my positive emotion but the negative emotion can be fucking intense.
So most of the time I’m either stable or low, there’s not much ups.

Anyone experienced that?"
751,"Honestly lost guys , just posting because I’m having rough morning . I know I have bad PTSD . Any good advice would help . Thanks","Long story short, About two years ago I picked up my brother in the AM to hang out with me for the day. Then I dropped him off at my house and went to work on a business project that took all day unexpectedly. We never got to hang out and he had left my house that day just walking because he had no ride or cell phone . He was a drinker so I think he walked to a bar or taco spot and chilled for some hours. He walked back to my house that night and knocked on the door and wanted to talk. Me being tired , I asked him “are you good” he said “yea”. I think he wanted to talk or just hang out. But I wouldn’t and I assumed he had a ride because it was 1am and he was at my door. He went on to walk home and I went back to my room. The next morning he was found stabbed to death. 
They investigated and it was gang related. But He didn’t gang bang , wasn’t even hanging with the wrong dudes. He was just trying to get home by himself , and some guys got out of a car and stabbed him. Probably because of his skin color..

It’s been two years and my guilt hasn’t subsided at all. If I would have just let him in the house that night or actually hung out with him like I was supposed to be . Then He’d be here . Instead I was so distracted....

It feels like it’s my fault , my fault my family is hurting. I see my mom changing , no one or anything is the same . Including me , the fact that every moment that day was affected by my decisions HAUNTS me . Literally, like fuck man"
752,Question,"I have a really bad habit of zoning out often. However, yesterday something weird happened and I don’t know what to make of it so I figured I would post here to see if anyone has ever had a similar experience. My friend was talking to me and I kind of zoned out on her face, and when I regained my focus, for a second my friend looked and sounded exactly like my old step-mom. Her face and voice didn’t change or alter in any way (since this moment I have realized that they do look kind of alike and the way my friend said what she did at the time really did sound like my old stepmoms voice), it was just that for a second I felt like she was her. 

I don’t know what to think of this or why it would happen. I literally haven’t thought about that woman in years. I’ve been going to therapy and a lot of memories I didn’t know I had have randomly been resurfacing so I don’t know if maybe it’s related to all of these things coming back or what, but there was no memory attached or anything. It was just a really bizarre thing."

755,I need help,Hello. I got sexually abused last night and I need to talk to someone before it gets traumatic.
756,I need help,Hello. I got sexually abused last night and I need to talk to someone before it gets traumatic.
757,Checking in.,"I left this subreddit because seeing to many post like mine left me numb.
But I'd like to check in if that's ok.

I have been doing great, I've never been late or missed a day at my new job. I have saved quite a bit of money and all my Bill's are cought up. 

Recently I went to a bar with my friend Luis. I had a great time,  but I realized that I have not left my house in about 8 weeks. Work, gym, sleep, repeat

Work and then the gym then home. I've have left my comfort zone and I still can't connect to a single person. 

I'm scared sometimes of how low I get and how these suicidal thoughts go from seeking attention to actual fear I might be losing it.

I know it's not something new or original, but I just have a hard time connecting to people because I know I'm not worth the waste of time. 

I hope one day I'll be ok and I can apologize in person but right now I just can't. 

I have money saved up, I will be moving away soon. 

It really sucks not trusting someone unless you're getting high or drinking. 

I realized I have not focused on anything other than getting rid of my debt.

I have spent 4 months growing stronger, and paying off my debt. Only to realize no one cares, no one single person cares
 
I still can't understand what I want and what is wrong with me, but I know I want to be left alone."
758,How do i become less self-conscious and become more confident?,I also mumble alittle and my heart races in presentations
759,very bad meth comedown and i need some tips!,i smoked a total of 3 points of meth today its been 6 hours and i feel like I'm being attacked and watched in a sinister devil like way. i have horrible anxiety shadow figures. I know this is what happens and it goes away but i need someone to help me please.
760,So I self-hate?,"I don’t know what’s going on with me. I’m so emotional, I take everything personal, I don’t know. I think I might hate myself. That’s not healthy I guess. I don’t think I deserve what I have. I don’t feel like I’m doing something. I constantly feel so stupid and ugly and akward and weird. I just want to be happy. I feel like shit. What’s my problem????!"
761,My first time singing,"I took singing and playing the guitar as form of recovery from depression. Singing and plalying the guitar has been a dream of mine... so I finally did it! I am singing, playing the guitar and writing about. 
Singing is kind of a metaphor for me about finding my voice. 
Here it is me singing, probably the worst impression of kurt Cobain cover but I have never felt so alive in my life: https://youtu.be/Z-O7-pPsDGE"
762,"I went to a therapy interview today, hated it.","The intake woman was asking me a ton of questions, I guess that’s standard (only assuming because I’ve never been to therapy before.) 

But when the questions started to get more.... personal, the woman told my mom to stay. She was asking me things like “are you suicidal?” “Have you attempted?” So instead of verbally answering, I answered by just nodding or shaking my head no. I thought she caught on, but no. Since I said yes, she said out loud “okay so how many times did you attempt?” 

She asked questions about suicide, self harm, homicide, drugs and alcohol... the basics, but yet my mom was there to listen to ALL OF IT, making me not want to answer anything. Now my mom is making comments here and there about what I told the woman. She was even making comments to the woman about what I was saying, trying to change it. 

This just makes me not want to go through with therapy anymore."
763,I need some advice,Here recently I’ve been feeling extremely anxious to the point where I got so overwhelmed in class that I was crying despite the fact “nothing” was going on to warrant tears. I’ve been wanting to go to the doctor to see if I could get out on anxiety medication to see if it helps but I’m anxious about that too. What if they don’t believe me? Do I need to go to my family doctor or a specialist? Should I tell my family or do this on my own? I’ve been putting this off to the point I feel like it’s impacting my life. I don’t feel like myself anymore because I live in this weird fear to the unknown.
764,What is this reaction?,"I don’t know how to counter it “challenge” the thought. 

Basically, I’m gay, came out to my parents as a teenager and it slowly flowed out to the rest of my family. It didn’t cause problems in friendships. And as far as my parents, I’d say soft rejection or just refused to accept but didn’t disown me either. my dad didn’t acknowledge it directly or even respond. He mentioned something about gay men being disgusting andand had just moved across the country. So I canceled my visits. Upon returning he has a new mindset. And my mom, tried to push me into being with my guy friends, tried to ban me from seeing a gf, this all created distance. But the fact that this was all during my teen years when I kinda wanted to get away from them anyways probably made it easier to manage. She slowly came around on her own after encounter other gay people I think and people with gay kids. 

So the problem is after a small incident I started realize I need to check in with my sister not knowing where she stood on some things. After initial fear I brought it up, and the things I was anxious about being true like she wouldn’t accept was true. Came out that she believed my being gay was all a phase, and if I was bothered  by her stance on the LGBT community I should also distance myself from niece and nephew. 

My reaction has been this overwhelming heavy feeling in my chest. Where talking or writing or whatever brought me to tears every time. I’ve avoided my family and friends, because of this. It’s a bit pass that with my family. Because the kids were the real reason I started becoming close with my family again. I tied going to my mothers house but couldn’t bring myself to talk to her or answer her calls.  Being my mother, at the most I responded was that I wasn’t angry at her since as kids I was more like lot to respond in silence instead of throwing tantrums. But I know it’s also bothering my friend and other sister and dad. 

I was just beginning preparing to restart therapy before all this happens.  But now feels even worse trying to check out new therapist while I’m bordering crisis mode. 

So far I just saw my psychiatrist and struggled quite a bit before I could explain why it was so difficult to send them a simple text. And how it’s feels like I’m a catch 22 even though I’m not."
765,How do I tell my parents i need a therapist?," I have been through some bad stuff a year ago, and as far as they know i'm fine now.  
I am hesitating to tell them because my uncle is going trough heavy depression right now.  
I feel that if I will tell them I need help, I am putting a load on their shoulders of another close relative who can't be okay on his own.  
What should i do? If i don't tell them, what can I do to help myself? And if I do tell them, how?"
766,"Isolation (panic, vent)","I'm not sure how to start this. Sorry for broken english.
I'm writing this while feeling pressure on my chest and loneliness, swety hands and panicing mind.
I haven't felt this lonely for a long time.
Trying to do things like play a game but then putting it away imidietly after getting it up.
Looking at all the ways I could just have fun and chat with people and feeling so stupid.
I could just join a random chat in so many places but I dont know what would i say or how the people would react.
As a child I never really had contact with my parents. They were around, but often doing their own things and if me and my sis started to play around or near them they would ask us to go away. So, most of my child hood i spent with my sis or alone in my room, mostly playing games or drawing or chatting with people on the internet.
It probably was not ideal, cause in my loneliness i ended up chating with men and you can probably ques what happend there. That started slowly happening when i was like 8 years old. 
Now at age 24, i feel so very anxious about contacting people 'cause I used to wait that somebody needed my attension for some reason. Here I sit in a room with my cat, trying to figure out what I should do so I would feel better."
767,When there’s no one to call,"F(20)

My mom had a heart attack about 2 weeks ago and I’m the only family member actually helping and I’m so stressed and tired of going to hospitals and groceries stores and going over to cook in between my job and taking care of my self. I live an hour away from my mother witch makes this whole thing very strenuous. 

My boyfriend doesn’t care to comfort me. I’ve been so stressed with my mom and my mental health isn’t helping my case. (Depression, anxiety). I’ve been having panic attacks and there’s no one here for me. No one to make my days brighter. He complained to me right before I go to bed and first thing when I get up in the morning and it’s just not a positive atmosphere. 

My job is cutting my work week by a shift and I’m stressed out about that too. 

I’m just so tired of life."
768,I need advice,"I've been taking effexor for the past 4-5 months. And I started feeling better, but now I feel like I'm regressing to my old self again I'm getting extremely depressed to the point of crying in the middle of work and getting really angry at everyone for no reason. And i'm starting to really hate interacting with other people. I getting tired of continuing like this. This is the third medication I've been on and nothing seems to work. What should I do? My medication has already been increased twice."
769,Mother,"Hey guys, I just need to get something off my chest this isn't really about me but more towards my mom because I'm really worried about her. So my mom is a really good person right, very hard working, kind and independent women;  but she's a very sensitive person, Recently I've noticed that she hasn't really been herself lately, she's become very quiet, emotional and seems like she hasn't been getting enough sleep, she's on medication but I dont know if it's helping her, that plus she's been working 12hour shifts. I know this feels like nothing to worry about but I just want my mom to be happy again because I care alot about her, but i just dont know how. What can I do?"
770,"The less sleep I get, the less anxious I am...","I'm (20M) am pretty new to reddit but I thought this would be a good place to hear others opinions. I am looking to see if anyone has had the same experience as I have with sleep and anxiety, and maybe what causes it. 

I'll start by saying Ive had social anxiety for about 5 years now, the first 3 being the worst and I've gradually been getting better the past 2 years. I have also never done any therapy or anything like it (although I should), and I'd say I'm more self conscious than I care to admit.

But anyways, something that I realized a long time ago was that there are days I find myself going to class (highschool/college) and instead of sitting alone quietly hoping no one would notice me, I was actually talking to people. It was strange becuase I wouldn't even notice it until during or after the fact, where as usually there is a period of building up courage and overcoming fear before engaging with people. It made me feel really good about myself obviously, and like I can do this every day and I'm getting better. Then the next day would come and it would be back to hiding in the shadows. 

Recently I've been losing a lot of sleep over studying and other personal things keeping me up late, while still having morning classes in college. I am usually quite tired and a little hazy, but I'm not only actually talking to my classmates, I am talking to them comfortably and with confidence. Something that is very rare for me and I only usually experience with the poeple Im very close with. 

I have tested this theory and given it a lot of thought and I have come to the conclusion that, the less sleep I get (usually ~5 hours rather than my normal ~8 hours), the less anxious I am. I am curious to know if anyone else has had this experience or seen such a trend in their anxiety. 

The only reason for this that I could think of is maybe it's possible that the part of my brain that causes me to be so anxious and worry when I'm in social situations is simply not well rested enough to work as hard as it normally does, and my rational side takes over? This sounds like a stretch, obviously I'm no expert and I don't know how brain functions work in the least but feel like there could be a slight truth to this idea. Maybe it's all in my head now and there's actually no correlation what so ever, I honestly don't know. 

If anyone has any information about this idea or has had similar experiences I would love to hear more about it."
771,"Is what I feel valid, I’m so lost, am I being silly?","I had an operation on Sunday, the second within 4 weeks of the same surgery on my butt. I just can’t deal with it, they put a band or something in, and I feel it, and I’m constantly on defence of myself, I like I’m being violated over and over by this thing I feel. I couldn’t deal with each surgery before and after, giving my body up, being unconscious letting people do whatever (even though I know it’s for the best to help me get better), but I feel it and I can’t stop crying, I can’t stop being on high alert of my own body. I don’t know what to do, I can’t make it stop or my condition will progress and get worse. I’ve had past history of verbal/emotional &amp; physical abuse, with two instances of spousal rape. And I feel so silly feeling like this. Am I being a sensitive fucking idiot? My GP isn’t taking what I said seriously, so maybe I’m over-reacting. But I’ve finally been able to put what I feel into words. And this is how I feel. And I have to have this band thing in for 10 weeks or more. After each surgery I cried and they told me my hormones would be raised from anaesthetic, I don’t know what is real. Is what I’m feeling real?"

I do get some of these jokes, but this had made it extremely hard for me to explain my feelings to anyone and i always feel the need to tell them that i know that i sound like ""this"" or ""that"", but that these are my actual feelings so please listen to me.

I was smoking hash a lot back and it helped me. I work and follow an education at my job now and it’s been going better with me ever since. Problem is I still really love to smoke my hash since it’s really helping with my mood, but my mom hates it. She thinks it’s a gateway to other drugs.

But I have to hope and believe that he will be fine so I washed my face and once I exited he was there telling me to stay. I was like hey I'm never leaving tell me what's wrong?  and then he started talking about people stealing our money and sex trafficking and then started crying, so I hugged him while he was crying I wanted to to SCREAM and cry he is GONE but I just smiled a.d told him everything is fine I still have no idea how I did it..

782,Need help to cope with stress,"I'm not sure if I'll get anything out of posting here but I'm willing to try.

I'll try to keep it short since I'm on mobile. My backstory is: I'm 26 and I had depression for the last 6-7 years. I've been in therapy for the last 5, a couple of different psychologists. Found my current doctor (who helped me the most) about 4 years ago. I've also had a psychiatrist that worked together, and was on medication for majority of these years. I was diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety disorder and panic attacks. Things have been getting better, I'm off the meds for 2 years now, my therapy sessions are at least 6 months apart because I can manage my mental health now. No anxiety attacks, no panic attacks, just normal amount of sad as I'd like to call it. The source of my issues was university. I failed some classes, put a lot of pressure on myself, turns out didn't quite like what I was studying, and couldn't come clean to my parents in fear of disappointing them. I distanced myself, easily since I was away from home, in every way possible, lied about school, barely left home without an attack, pressure built up, the hole I was in got deeper, and it get impossible to get out of. I got suicidal, self harmed, etc. I came clean before I even attempted suicide, got help, started therapy, family was supportive if not damaged.

For the last 1.5 years, I study something I really love. Something I wanna build on. Something that gives me hope to dream about a future, that makes me happy. I also live with my parents and go to university in my hometown, a familiar place. It's been so much better, so much safer. 

And right now, I'm in an exchange student program. I'm in a different country for this semester. Which is where I need help. I'm overwhelmed with about everything. I feel like I'm lost. Cracking under stress. Feeling trapped and anxious and.. Like I can't breathe. It's not that I don't wanna be here. there's a lot of new things, school related. Some issues with classes and administration. Fair to mention not everyone speaks English so there's a language barrier. I'm so stressed. I'm losing it. and I dont know how to pull myself out of it. I've been feeling too good, too safe for some time and now I'm faced with stress and my old friend depression and i dont know how to cope, how to manage. i still don't know what i expect from writing here. i just. don't know what to do"
783,Where to get diagnosed for asperges/anxiety? (UK),"I’m a 19 year old from the UK and I’m almost certain I have asperges, as my family think so too. 

I have a lot of the traits that are common with asperges, but my main problem is that I can’t follow instructions unless they’re written down. If someone says something, it has no credibility until it’s on paper - this is how I got fired today lmao 

So you see it’s affecting my life, and I want to solve this issue before it plagues me. 

Anyway, what is my best route to get diagnosed? It would certainly help to get an answer, but I’m sure I have it. Please can someone help, thank you."

785,Is there a way to get help with passing out with health related issues?,"Ever since I was a kid, I have passed out when getting blood drawn, sometimes with shots, etc.

Today I was at the barber and this person next to me was talking about blood and guts and other medical issues for an extended period of time. I started sweating and feeling dizzy and excused myself to the bathroom for a few minutes. I then came back and let them finish up the sides of my hair so it was presentable, and then left. I felt quite embarrassed but told them I was feeling nauseous and that's why I was sweating.

Last week I sprained my ankle and had to lay on my back for a few minutes as I started to feel dizzy / squeamish. It really bothers me because it makes me feel weak and I would like to be able to have blood drawn without passing out. How can I best address this?"
786,Panic attacks from stories.," 

I don't know what sub reddit to put this on so I'm doing a couple.

I’ve been having troubles with depression since I was fourteen, and since then it’s gotten better for the most part at least but I’m still extremely anxious and obsessive as a result of my past experiences. You see my father lost his job three times while my older sister was going through childhood cancer so I grew up seeing my parents constantly emotionally destroyed over things I had no control over. As a result I always need to replay things in my head until they make sense and resolve them if I can or else I feel as though they’ll come back to bite me later. I just need to fix things if I can. This has resulted in me not being able to stop thinking about very upsetting things: the very things I’m writing this about. Sorry, but later in this post i’m gonna write all of these nagging thoughts down; i hope it’s useful or something you could relate to. You see I like to listen to audios, watch movies and all the other things to calm down but sometimes those things have the opposite effect and put me in a massive panic for days. I’ll be writing about two particular instances of this: one that was especially horrible in the past and one that's i’m going through right now.

The first one came from an audio where a person’s wife was cheating on her husband (you heard form his prospective) with her friend right after having a baby (just so you know, it was my stupid obsessives that convinced me that i’d be week willed if I couldn’t stomach it so I listened to it).

In the end I was crushed and couldn’t sleep for days the nagging thoughts from the characters' point view and mine couldn’t leave my mind: how could you be so easily forgotten and betrayed by someone you love like you were nothing even after having a child, how can I believe that this won’t happen to me, could this be fixed or mended someway. I’m constantly switching perspectives and can’t isolate myself from the character. (I hope that would help)

I know the story isn’t real but it still represents a potential possibility and if it’s not that then I’ve still put myself in the place of the character and I feel like I can’t escape or do anything.

The fact that the stories aren’t real makes it so that I can always wonder whether it can be fixed or not because there’s nothing saying it can’t be fixed and there also is nothing saying it can be fixed; it doesn't progress any further either way. So I'm stuck in my head unable to end it either way.

I still feel a little sick to my stomach when I think about relationships sometimes because of this.

The second one can't possibly happen in real life unlike the other but it still bothers me for reasons I've partially already explained above. It was a fantasy audio about a person who was taken to another world saved that world returned to our world with P.T.S.D, regrets about not being able to save some people and self worth issues., then the hero’s fairy lover from the other world comes to our world to help him through his troubles after his traumatic experiences but if he doubts for a moment that she is real she will disappear. Well, as you could probably guess that despite the audio being labeled \[comfort\] it ends with the fairy lover disappearing leaving the poor sad hero alone now with the guilt of destroying his love with his doubt. That hit way too close to home for me and I don't know what to do. it's has been hurting me for days. I see myself way too much in him and I can’t get out of his shoes. Real or unreal I feel the need to resolve it but I can’t. It just teases me by being a story. I just want to fix one thing for once in my life but I can’t.

Well, sorry for the length.

I would be very grateful if you have anything to say."
787,Sleeping on the floor,"For the past five or so days I’ve been sleeping on the floor of my bedroom because I don’t have the energy to make my bed.

789,Does anyone else who has recovered from depression find themselves reminiscing about their sadness and feel like they sometimes miss it?,"*throwaway because my family know my main account*

Around a year and a half ago I was severely depressed. I felt extremely lonely, I had no motivation to be productive and was filled with this overwhelming sense of self loathing and sadness. As soon as I started feeling better, someone who I had looked up to and had helped me feel comforted for years was murdered. For months I sat at home in pieces, crying all day. The feeling I had was indescribable. The day I found out I regretfully tried to end my life, something that will hang over me for the rest of my life. 

Since then uncontrollable changes have happened in my life and I am currently in a situation where I feel better than I have ever felt in the past 4 years. 

However, sometimes when I go over photos and videos I have of the person I looked up at so dearly, I feel a huge feeling of nostalgia. When they died I felt so comforted, like the sadness I felt was so immense that I no longer cared about anything else. Like I could focus on one source of sadness instead of it coming from 30 different angles, for once I didn’t care at all  (I must say that in no way am I saying their death was on balance a good thing - their death will affect me for the rest of my life) 

I just find it so strange because, although I would never wish how I was feeling upon any human being, I miss the feeling of not having to care about what anyone thought, what my future would hold etc, I was just able to ball my eyes out and not tell myself that I had to hold anything back.

Does anyone else feel the same way?

Thanks for reading and I hope like me you’ll be able to pull through stronger than you’ve ever been."

791,"Just learned of Complex PTSD, I feel like I finally understand but I don’t want to self diagnose. Anyone know about CPTSD?","Hi, first time posting here about myself. So I recently learned about complex PTSD. 
After looking over a lot of medical journals about trauma &amp; the little bits of information I’ve found about CPTS, I feel this explains a lot of why I am, the way I am. But I’m curious to know if anyone else has found information on CPTSD. Or if they’ve actually been diagnosed? If so, what are some of the symptoms, what were your experiences? I can’t find many reliable sources about it. 
I don’t want to self diagnose myself because I have a bad track record of “trying” to find out what my symptoms might be related to and reading horrifically unreliable websites. I just want to see what others have to say. 

My symptoms starting around the age of 12-current: 
1.) Intense general anxiety
2.) frequent nightmares
3.) occasional loss of control over emotions
4.) irritability 
5.) feeling that I deserve nothing 
6.) lack of motivation 
7.) lack of expressing certain emotions especially happiness, love or appreciation (find it hard to express this naturally so I just act how I think people want me to act.) 
8.) lashing out (not frequently but enough where it’s noticeable.) 
9.) occasional times of derealization (more or less just feeling disconnected or like something isn’t real)
10.) never trusting anyone and avoiding people at all costs 
11.) awful time sleeping, can’t stay asleep
12.) negative emotional responses to any stimulus associated with bad memories/events 
13.) constantly feeling like I have to be on high alert 
14.) afraid of people touching me 
15.) completely convincing every part of me that thinks I was abused, that I wasn’t 
16.) either completely avoiding talking about my feelings and my past, or I go on tangent talks 
17.) basic depression 
18.) multiple suicide attempts (haven’t had one in about 5 years, woooo!) 
19.) reacting easily to anything anyone has to say about me, doesn’t even need to be about me.. I just start getting sad or mad if someone says I did something wrong in a stern tone 
20.) frequently day dream and try and find escape routes 
21.) confusion and indecisive 
22.) issues with drugs and alcohol in the past 
23.) obsession with a long term abusive “perpetrator” ex boyfriend 
24.) thinking this boyfriend is constantly watching me because he used to stalk me 
25.) constantly questioning people’s intentions 
26.) my perceptions, feelings or ideas about a lot of things change often but I don’t remember what I felt before (people just remind me that I had a different opinion 2 weeks ago.) 
27.) pretty much don’t have memories of my life up until the age of about 17 (only remember the bad ones.) 
28.) confusion about certain traumatic events, I can’t tell what was real or what wasn’t anymore 

And those are the basic ones that are noticeable :) 

Here’s the backstory: (don’t need to read, just thought someone might help me get some better information or see if my experiences are similar) 

During childhood from about ages 7-12, I was sexually assaulted by an older friend, I was bullied endlessly at school. I moved 3 times after my dad lost everything during stock market crash in 2007. Became homeless for a short period. My parents fought, threw things, threatened to leave often. My older brother had intense anger issues and beat me, threw me down stairs, would frequent kicking me in the stomach until I puked etc. And around this time period my mother started exhibited symptoms of bipolar, or borderline? We’re still unsure but lots of damaging behavior, abuse, negative emotions and suicidal thoughts. 

During teen years, 12-18ish. I was raped 3 times by 3 different people. I was bullied even worse (digital harassment, in the hallways in school, plastered all over social media, people calling my parents home phone and pretending to be me.) I tried to commit suicide or made a plan maybe 20 times. I was in a psych ward. I Self harmed. I drank, smoked, did drugs. Purposely did dumb things for attention. My moms symptoms became worse over this period: she threaten to kill me, choked me, often broke my personal belongings, swore at me, yelled at me, blamed me for everything, called me a slut, said I was worthless, she should have never had me, said I would never amount to anything, told me I was ugly, told me I was never going to get married and told me I deserved to be raped, ripped my award winning art pieces, posted publicly about my issues, talked badly about me to family, cheated on my dad, left us 3-4 times, slapped me a few times, caused bruising a few times from grabbing me.... and the list goes on. Also during this time I started dating an older guy. I was 12, and he was 16. ( we dated in and off since I was a child until I turned 20.) He was controlling, manipulative, cheated on me, stalked me, gas lit me, swore, would sneak me around, lie, forced me to do things, told me what I could and couldn’t wear, made me do and like only what he liked, I could only talk to certain people, only listen to certain music, only eat certain food, and he completely cut me off from family and friends, would build me up, leave and come back, keep tabs on me even when we were broken up, needed to constantly know what I was doing. Etc. I moved out at 16 and in with him. I was severely depressed, and he convinced me i was so mentally messed up and made me believe I deserved nothing, blamed everything on me and turned me into a completely obliterated mess. Told me I needed to go in and get help or he was leaving. So I went in and lied to doctors and told them I had bipolar the day I turned 18 to prove to him I was trying to change. He dumped me, kicked me out on the street and stole all the presents I had just bought for him, except he continued to stalk me. (And now I have a false diagnosis of bipolar!!! Yay!) 

From about 18-20: I entered a new relationship with a heroin addict who hit me, threw things at my face, tossed a chair on top of me, punched the wall, broke my stuff, lied and cheated and stole a lot of money from me. So then I got sucked back into my ex, because he always played hero throughout my entire life. Decided to get back together with him. He goes on a business trip and comes back with a new girlfriend, doesn’t tell me but continues to date me for 3 months. Then he manipulates me into being a part of this psychologically damaging dominance fetish. I get back together with the heroin addict while being stalked and threatened into a dominant relationship with said ex boyfriend. 

And now I’m 24, married to someone who isn’t a piece of crap, away from my abusive brother, mom and ex boyfriend and I’m fine, just have terrible symptoms.. and I want to find some solace in understanding myself. I eventually want to go back and get therapy or treatment but can’t afford it right now."

794,Im afraid.,"Hello guys,im seriously confused and kinda concerned aswell.
Im fighting with...something i highly suspect that its aspergers and borderline,but i cant bring myself to look for help because im afraid im wrong.
Now you might ask : what? Why is not being diagnosed with those things is a bad thing?
And youre right,it isnt a bad thing,but the thing is :
I always felt ""different"" always felt ""peculiar"".
I forget A LOT of things regularly,i have an tendency to simply close myself in my ""imaginary world"" and when i do that,i lose my ability to pay attention at all,especially when people try to commumicate with me.
Im almost 20,but i act like a child,and simply cant catch up with a lot of things that people do,making me feel like i am the ""retarded friend of the group"".
I always had poor social abilities until i started mimicking other people,my entire adolescence was spent improving that,and i must say,it wasnt easy.

Since i was young,thanks to my poor social abilities,i wanted a friend,just that,a friend that i could count with.
Now i do have those friends,and i do know they Care about me,but sometimes i feel like they dont?
It dont know how to express it but,everybody says : ""wow,op is amazing,i love op,you can count on me anytime op"" and i do my best to earn that love,i always make sacrifices for my friends,im always there for them,but i feel like they arent here for me?
One example with that is my best friend,i love him as a brother,i am always,literally always there for him,but i feel like it isnt the same?
I mean,i do know that he cares about me but,he's also kinda distant,he lives 30 minutes from here,and he is unsociable,so he uses that as a excuse to not see me,i mean,i havent seen him for four months,and i kinda need him,but he just makes excuses (?).
My other friends are cool,but i always feel like there's always someone they'll preffer over me,always someone that's closer,everybody seems to love me,but just not enough.
I know that im an egoist,and i shouldnt feel like that,but i just cant stop.
Thats why i want to be diagnosed with those things,if i am,people will understand me better,i will understand myself better.
But what if im normal? What if everything is coming from my mind and im just a perfectly healthy guy?
If i am healthy,why am i so dumb? Why do i need to be needed?(quoting steven universe,because i identify myself with him A LOT,especially now).
Im just afraid.
Sorry about format and bad english,english is not my first language,and im on mobile."
795,i dont know if im mentally unstable or not,"i've never been able to admit that i could possibly have a problem. i've self-harmed for 9 years but i always tell myself im just doing it to prove to myself that i am crazy, like i have something to prove. i also think i do it because if im crazy, then nothing can be blamed on me ever. 

I watched midsommar last night with my boyfriend. i found myself connecting way too closely with dani who i can clearly see is traumatized and very mentally unstable. it made me worried because it made me think that maybe i actually am pretty crazy, and that i wasn't just trying to convince myself of that but that its actually true. i mean, most of the time i don't even have things to be mentally unstable about. my life is okay, i have support, i dont struggle very much with money. but i still find myself really low to the point of thinking about suicide all day every day - or am i doing that to convince myself im crazy? - for weeks; and then really high for weeks. or maybe the high is just my normal self and i don't feel the need to convince myself im crazy during that time. 

should i seek help? I've been to a therapist briefly and am on a few psychiatric drugs. if i seek help, what exactly would i do? like, step by step, what would i do? i dont know how to navigate health insurance or therapists or psychiatrists or even doctors. we never had health insurance growing up and ive been too scared to do it as an adult. i live in boston. i don't have much extra money to be paying a million copays for services. i feel myself getting lower and lower everyday and its giving me panick attacks. i just want to stay in my high."
796,how do i cure my anxiety?,"I’ve been an anxious person my entire life. I’m not diagnosed with anything, and i don’t take meds. (I’m not diagnosing myself with Anxiety Disorder, i just struggle with anxiety, like stress) It used to just be school that stressed me out but as i near the end of my senior year it is ... literally everything. Pair that with a lovely case of terrible chronic tinnitus i developed last year.... not doing so hot! Whenever my family leaves the house or goes to sleep without saying i love you i think they’re going to die, this year i applied for a working visa for a summer job and was SO FUCKING STRESSED throughout the entire process i genuinely think it took a few years off my life. Recently I’ve also developed a thing where I’ll get random twitches in my arm, leg, neck. I think all my friends hate me. I’m a burden on literally everyone who love(d) me because i can’t get it under control. It starts as like a mere agitation, today for example the WiFi in my house didn’t work and i couldn’t get online to open my textbook. So i start getting angry, then heavy breathing, slam the computer shut... cut to maybe 4 minutes later I’m sobbing on the floor. 
I’ve been seeing a therapist for 5 years, fat load of good that did me. Taking mindfulness meditation classes, also not doing much. My family tries to give me advice, practice the meditation at home, ride your bike, do breathing exercises. The problem isn’t that these things don’t work it’s that i just won’t fucking do them! In theory it’d be easy to recognize that I’m getting upset and pull away for a bit but i always try to power through and it never ever works. I can’t get it through my own head. I don’t know how to help myself. I need to get my life in check and i don’t know how. 
This summer I’m going to be starting a job I’ve wanted for a long time, then college. I can’t live like this anymore. I don’t know what to do. Not to mention my parents are really actually starting to hate me. 
TLDR; slightly crippling anxiety. Help."

798,Have you ever thought about how absurd being alive is?,"I find myself often thinking about how litterally improbable it is to alive and experiencing what I am, from a logical perspective this world is absolutely surreal. Humans have learnt so much about everything in their respective fields whether it be medicine, architecture or sciences and everything in between.

To imagine something like this planet and it’s population working and living the way we do is unfathomable, the deeper I try to understand the more dumbfounded I am, everything makes sense from a literal stand point but when you take a step back I still believe it’s all so impossible. 

The way our minds work is so elusive, some how we have thoughts that come and go. 

thinking about how our minds can process and reason, create and project is all so... far fetched it seems that we literally hit the jack pot. 

Yet 

So many of us are unhappy and unfulfilled. 

Life is beautiful there’s no doubt about that, but it’s dependant on the perspective from which you see, I’ve seen both sides the good the bad and even the inbetween. Dealing with anxiety and existential nihilism. Life is tough, I didn’t ask for it. But we are here now, so why not make the most of it.

I’ve learnt recently that you and I are not alone everyone goes through hard times, no matter how happy or how successful no matter how fulfilled or well endowed everyone goes through similar circumstance all be it there are exceptions, the fact of the matter is that we are and should always be here for each other. Life it’s self is miserable but with the right people and the right outlook it can reshape your perspective and transform your mentality. 

Reach out to someone and make sure to pass along help when you can...

For anyone that reads this, I’m not sure why I decided to post this, it was therapeutic to type out and I feel some people may think the same way as me, this pushes me out of my comfort zone as it is not something I would normally share.. I hope you enjoyed the read let me know what you think

800,Uncomfortable having a body,"I’m not talking about the identity sense although I also feel uncomfortable existing at all but I feel like that’s a separate feeling, I’m just uncomfortable with being aware of the processes of my body. I’m also really into medical stuff, just on other people, so I’m hyperaware of my own body too and I hate it. I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting, which causes OCD about avoiding it) and that definitely probably manifested this. Cardiac stuff freaks me out the most though, I have no problem looking at injuries or blood but thinking about my own cardiac system really freaks me out, if I think about my veins too much I start to get nauseous. I just hate how my body is a tangle of scary things that could easily betray me and I’m tired of feeling anxious about it all the time."

I work, but don't have any money of my own, and the house is in their name. My parents never wanted kids, and that is reflected in the upbringing of my sister and I. I don't know if anyone in my life, besides my dog and my therapist, actually care if I get out of bed. I just feel so alone. I'm afraid to start new relationships because I have the worst judgment of character. I'm too trusting, and put way too much stock in others. And I can't let go of all the toxic people in my life because then I will truly will be alone..."
804,Anger outbursts,"Hello So I will get right into it, I don’t know why, but for the past couple of months I get this anger outburst like I would go from 1 to 100 really quick and I can’t calm myself down. I used to be the calmest person ever and in control of my emotions .
For example I’m talking to my sister and we start arguing and she gets mad I will get twice as mad and I can’t seem to help calm myself down or walk away from the situation. the worst thing to me is how calm I used to be and in control of my emotions. Has this ever happened to you and how did you deal with it ??"
805,Is anyone else afraid of growing up?,"Most of my childhood was ruined due to my many mental illnesses getting in the way and distracting me from living my life. Now that I’m in my early twenties and finally starting college and getting help for my mental health I’ve developed a phobia of growing up. I feel like my mental development was put in hold and even though I’m 23 now I feel like I did when I was a teenager. It’s nice for the most part except that with this comes my fear of finishing college. And as stupid as it sounds (because it is stupid) it’s also what kept me from voting in elections and stuff. I just remember being pretty interested in voting and politics as a kid and associated with being one of the major signs that you’re all grown up. It’s stupid but I have the fear that if I do too many grown up things like finishing college AND voting for instance, I will have grown up and have let my childhood go by without really experiencing it."
806,How do I deal with my roommate who is having a psychotic episode?,"A close friend of mine from high school became my roommate at college a couple of months ago. Within this time he hasn’t demonstrated any sure signs of schizophrenia or psychosis. Last night after smoking weed with my roommates (something he does daily and usually handles well) he decided he was going to bed very suddenly. After a few minutes he came out of his room claiming that he knows me and another roommate have cameras in his room and are monitoring him. He didn’t seem angry or confused, just casually explaining that he knows what we are doing. Obviously we are not monitoring him. My other roommate let him search his phone and he didn’t find any evidence of his delusion. Me and my other roommate figured that he was just extremely high and paranoid and he would be better after he had a night of sleep. This morning I go into the common area to talk to my other roommate. He knows that my friend is still acting strange. While discussing what actually happened the night before, my friend come out of his room and continues casually accusing us. He went as far as to say that when he finds the camera he will beat the shit out of us. 

If anyone has any experience dealing with psychotic episodes please give me any advice. I am worried about his own health as he is acting very unpredictably and irrational."
807,Mental disorder Diagnosis/Language aspect,"Hi. My mental health has been challenged a lot during the last 4-5 years and I feel like I’ve reached a point where I need to seek medical help. 

Without going into much detail (that would be quite a long story), I suspect having social anxiety, depression, problems with distinguishing reality from the dream, a few other things(disorders). I am aware though that I’m not a doctor and my understanding of those diseases is based purely on online resources and observations. 

However, I do feel an urgent need for help. As a foreign student, I have access to free medical care, but it’s rather limited and doctors tend to be quite impatient. Unfortunately, I cannot afford private treatments at this point. 
 
So, it would help me a lot if you could advise me on these questions:
1) Which doctor do you recommend visiting for diagnostic purposes? (Psychologist, psychiatrist (free))?
2) Do you think that language aspect can have a negative impact on diagnosis/treatment? Due to my social anxiety, I don’t communicate with locals much, so even though my knowledge of language is quite decent, I never had a chance to practice speaking. Should I seek online medical help in my home country? Thank you in advance. Stay healthy 🤛🏻"
808,Have my second appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow- what should I be prepared to talk about?,"As the title says, I have my second appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow after being put on Ritalin (it's been a month). Obviously he's going to ask about how the medication has been working, but how do I bring up my other symptoms?

In the past week, I've had a manic episode, the crash the follows, and anxiety through the roof about schoolwork to the point where I missed my first class today (which I NEVER miss) because of how long and intense it was. Any advice?"
809,What's the best way to calm down in public without it being noticeable?,"I have the imaginary world thing but it's sometimes hard to focus on that when kids at school are always slingshotting pencils and throwing shit at me, so how do I calm down? Thx &lt;3"

811,Are Psychopaths able of being insucure or depressed?,"Are they capable of falling in love?

I recently heard some theories that Psychopaths could acctually be the ""Alphas"" of humans.

And the thought of people being born, And literally not being able to feeling insucre or depressed makes me feel weird."
812,I try my hardest to be a good person and life still such me over,I hate myself I hate everything about me. Of course life fucks me over. I just want to die. Why can’t I just die.
813,If you're having a panic attack:,"I discovered this YouTuber last year and he followed the techniques of a Dr that he was influenced by. 

He does a really good job of explaining and has an incredibly soothing voice. Sadly he passed away in 2017 but his videos still help me when I'm in a bad way. 

I highly recommend watching if you need the help. Follow the techniques; it will be hard at first (it still is for me sometimes) but if you persist you will see change. I promise you. I'll link my favourite video he has made but there are lots relating to specific anxiety issues (anxiety and insomnia/ agoraphobia, etc) that he talks about.
It might not help everyone, but it is still helping me. 

Drop me a message if anyone does need someone to talk too!

814,SO has trust and insecurity issues.,"My SO grew up in a bad neighborhood in a big city and then moved to a judgemental hick town. His dad drank a lot and openly stole from work. His mom was bad with money and was super involved in her kids lives as well as having an enmeshed relationship with her mother. His oldest sister dies traumatically and his beloved grandmother died soon after. His parents ended up divorcing due to his fathers cheating. His ex cheated on him and financially abused him. 

All of this has severely affected his ability to communicate properly during arguments. It took an incredibly long time and a break up for him to finally commit. He can be controlling and distrustful. He says things that are just mean and have nothing to do with the current argument, brings things up from 12 years ago that hurt him. He just always seems to be angry and takes certain things way too seriously. 

There’s more, but I’m not going to list everything here. I know he needs therapy, but refuses to go. Is therapy the only Hope here or are there other tools he could benefit from?"
815,Can You Get Severe Insomnia from Antidepressant Withdrawal?,"Under my psychiatrists guide, I've tapered off Remeron (ssri) completely and Pristiq from 100 to 25mg, in about 6 weeks. It has been surprisingly not as a bad as  thought it'd be anxiety/depression wise. But the past 2 weeks I'm having next level insomnia. Like as in 5 hours of sleep in the past 3 days for example. I called my psychiatrist this morning and he's going to call me in some Ambien til I see him again. But is this normal? I just get kind of scared when sleep deprivation gets this bad. I start feeling a little nutzo and it freaks me out 😕

Anyone have any experiences with this or hopefulness as far as did your sleep eventually get better."
816,Any artists here(probably lol)? Please help me draw again,"Art is the love of my life and not being able to create because of my mental health is the worst pain ever. I have chronic migraines, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and mood issues. I’m constantly exhausted and on the brink of a mental break down, if I’m being honest. I’m a graphic design student in college and an aspiring cartoonist. My work has been so half-assed because I’m exhausted it’s embarrassing.

How can I make my mind calm down and let me draw? It’s not like I have art block because I know what I want to draw. I want to draw comics and have a story and all that but when I’m ready to draw I sort of freeze up. I get anxious and depressed and feel like a failure before I even start so I give up. It’s driving me crazy and I just want to create without these horrible thoughts and emotions. Idk if it’s my ADHD giving me a hard time or what... like I can’t get comfortable or something is distracting me from drawing(thoughts or what’s going on around me) Any advice is welcome...

Antidepressants seem to not work on me and vyvanse is very helpful but gives me migraines and burns me out afterwards. I’m seeing doctors about my issues but I need to figure something out in the mean time..."

818,Having breakup problems,"So basically I got into a relationship with a girl early December 2019. We had it great together and it felt like a perfect match. However (long story short) later in January she had to move away for the next 12 months which sucked. 
We decided to try long distance since we were so great together. She came home for a weekend early February, and it was one of the greatest weekend of my life.
About 15 days went by, and she told me she could hardly ever visit in the future, and she suggested to breakup. I agreed because I thought it would be hard not seeing her for a while, and that I would eventually lose interest anyways. 
At first I thought the next week would be hard (which it was) and I would then move on. But it's been a month now, and I still think about her all the time, even though we only dated for about 2.5 months.
I have great friends to talk about it with. I love em to death, but I get so annoyed every time they say ""you'll find someone else, life moves on"", even though I say it to myself all the time. They're probably right, but I feel like I won't find anyone like her, at least not before she comes home. 
I desperately want to move on, but at the same time I don't want to forget her. The despair is eating me up, and because it was the circumstances (not our relationship) that broke us up, I can't find closure. I need some advice. Can you help me?"
819,I wanna be alone cause I feel like people can hear my thoughts,"Hey don’t really know where to post this but just feel like ranting. 

I sometimes get this feeling like people can hear my thoughts. And I don’t even get why they’d wanna listen kuz it’s all disorganized trash anyways but still it’s my personal thoughts and would rather keep them to myself. And I know it’s just a feeling but sometimes I swear people will say what I’m thinking. And I feel like theyre using it against me and talking about it.

Like today at work this guys came up and told me said “you know all those faces you make? I think they’re hilarious!” And I’m like what no I don’t and he’s like “oh you know!” Which didn’t make me mad or anything but just stressed out I wish I could just be normal. Idk I just wanna be alone live alone and talk to myself all day.

Anyone else feel the same?"
820,Today was tough so I wore flowers in my hair,"I woke up feeling really empty and despondent.

Last night I had a conversation with a good friend over text but I was feeling isolated and really strange. When I went to bed I had the feeling I wouldn't wake up the next morning. I was strangely okay with that. I was sad but also aware of the fact that most likely I was just paranoid and anxious. 

When I woke up I felt disgusting. I laid on my bed after breakfast for twenty minutes.

I finally forced myself up, took a shower, made my bed, got some work done. Halfway through working I got up and brushed out my-air-drying hair. I braided it and took some flowers from my bedside vase, and I put them in the plaits. 

I did this two years ago while on a vacation with my family I felt guilty for taking while suffering from a severe depressive episode. I remember how happy I usually feel to have life around me, closer to me, so I picked a yellow flower and put it behind my ear. I did that today too with baby's breath and felt suddenly a little better. I still don't feel great but tomorrow I will wake up and start over, and if the day goes downhill, then I'll wear flowers all day tomorrow, and the next day, and for the rest of my life if I must."
821,I don't know how to help my partner,"My partner has sensory issues and a history of anxiety, depression and at one point an eating disorder.

Last year while pregnant she started getting really bad hallucinations associated to her panic attacks. She was told she isn't psychotic by the MH team and until recently has been ok, but in the last few weeks has been getting worse again.

We've been trying to eat more healthily, exercise and lose weight but it's been really teiggering for her and today was refusing to eat because she felt fat. Later this evening she had a really bad panic attack that she said was similar to the ones she had while pregnant.

I don't know what to do for her - we don't have money for private therapy, her GP will probably insist on referring her for CBT which in the past has been as much use as a chocolate teapot. She refuses to try medication due to fear of the side effects.

I'm really worried about her declining to a point like she was at last year, especially now with a baby to look after. Can anyone help? I've not admitted this as she's already really insecure about whether I want to be with her (I do) but i'm really struggling to cope myself now."
822,I feel like I jinxed 2020,"(I already posted this on r/confession, but I need someone to talk to and just hear me out.)

December 2019 began as a great month. Christmas was great too.

Then on Boxing Day, I got blackout drunk for the first time, and threw up in my mother’s car. I was forgiven quickly, and everything was normal, but the guilt and the embarrassment changed the happy mood I’d been in all month.

New Year’s Eve came, and I said “2020’s going to be a good year.”


And it DID start off good. But since then it’s done nothing but go downhill. World War 3 threats, the Coronavirus..
My depression and anxiety have gotten worse too, both as a result of what’s been going on and as their own separate issues.

We’re in March and I feel like there’s no point in living anymore. I feel like my carelessness in December and my optimistic statement about the upcoming year ended up jinxing everything.

I want to die, but not like this. I want to kill myself. I don’t want to leave my house anymore, both because of my depression and because of the stupid fucking virus. There’s already been confirmed cases in the area I live.

I want to stop existing. I’m trying to be happy but really what’s the point if I’m going to die anyway?"
823,"I was happy for a few weeks and then the depression came back again, I’m tired, this has been going on for 2 years, the severity is different every time but this one is the worst.","I’m starting to think this is never going away, I have a strong relationship with my boyfriend but there is only so much we can do sense we can’t be with each other all the time, he helps me but my moods change so quickly that it’s annoying him, he doesn’t want to admit it but I know it is. I feel like if we do break up I’ll be the reason why. My parents are divorcing and I apparently have limes disease I constantly need help and I I’m getting to the point where I lost the motivation to take a shower and a part of it is because I’m always in pain. I’m not book smart and I have bad study habits that don’t think I’ll ever be able to fix, I wish I could just reset or just clean my brain from all of this but it’s just consuming me. 

If I messed and should post somewhere else guess just tell me"
824,I don't really get how people exist,"I mean I know I do and I know everyone else does, but do they really? Everyone seems to have their own opinions and shit, but I just really don't care. I'm not a sociopath, but I really don't care about sports teams. I don't care whether trump or bernie wins. I don't care about what you put on my sandwich. I don't care about whether I'm alive or not. I don't care if you tear up my essay I spent three weeks writing. I don't care that my grandma died. I don't care about anything. My 4th grade teacher once asked me why I stole from my classmates, I told him, ""I don't know"". He thought I just was deflecting. But I truly did not no. I just did it. And I don't really care what I do. I just do things and live with the consequences. I destroyed my friendship because I wanted to test how he would react to something. I threw away 200 bucks to buy something I knew was worth 20 just to see how he would react to seeing his plan had worked. When I put my hands up to my face or look in the mirror I feel uneasy. All day I feel like a floating conscience without form or shape. I can't understand how someone would see me any other way. Life is a video game, I do what I want and I do it with the caring of a person playing gta. And slowly I'm starting to do weirder and weirder things. People ask me why, truly I still don't know. But I know it's getting worse. I want to do more, I want to try more. someday I'll be nothing more than that guy on the news running down the street naked and babbling. Ask him why, I doubt he knows either. I could be crazy enough to tear my own eyes out someday. I get urges to hurt myself to see what'll happen, I haven't yet. But one day..."
825,I'm scared of myself...What to do?,"Its hard to explain but it feels like I've been awoken (by myself) from a 'braindead zombie' state. Colors are brighter, my perception of music, my thoughts are so different. It's scary because I don't know what is happening, why am I so out of control of myself? It's like in a constant dream and I'M a robot. Its so scary, I'm aware of it and i can't do anything because I'm restricted by biology and life like there is no free will for example. Sorry its kinda vague I just feel like I'm going insane... What to do?"

Me tho, I have had difficulty finding my way. Finding it hard to breathe. I don’t know what to do, or where to go. All I know how to do is run, run so far that no one knows who I am. 

I don’t know why I am so obsessed with being a different person. But the moment I get into my car and get on the road, I feel a sense of peace."
828,Not sure where else to post this,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons

I’m seriously debating killing myself tonight. I’m exhausted with life and I get nothing but sadness and heartache from it. I’ve got severe mental illness, no treatments have worked, yada yada yada, if you want more details you can look at previous posts. 

I’ve been researching the easiest ways to kill myself and honestly I think I could do it. I’m miserable enough that I could do it. The only things holding me back is that if I survive, my life will be even worse than before. I’ll possibly have brain damage, and I’d be stuck in a psych ward until my parents could find a long term facility they could ship me off to. Ive already had to deal with living in a psych ward for a month a little while back, and it was hell. I never want to go back. 

Please don’t say things like “your family would be so devastated and disappointed”, I know, and I hate myself for it, but I’m still in enough pain that I could do it. 

What triggered this again was that I got dumped a few weeks ago. The only thing I ever looked forward to was hanging out with them, and now I have nothing to live for. The only other reason I have to live other than you know, fucking up my suicide and being worse off than before, is the thought of a relationship and being with someone again. It’s the only thing that brought me joy and I crave it all the time. I know it’s not healthy and I shouldn’t put my happiness in other people, but it’s not like I chose to get so depressed the only thing I enjoyed was a relationship. 

Idek what this post was, other than a complete ramble. I can’t get my thoughts straight and I’m very scattered. I guess comment so I know at least someone saw this."

831,is it normal to feel zoloft the same day,"i am on a starting dose but taking wellbutrin as well, both times i have taken this i feel extremely sedated.
i dont think its placebo i wasnt really expecting anything of it.
it is about 2 hours in when it does this.
i felt the wellbutrin On the first dose as well."
832,My controlling issues,"SORRY THAT IT'S SO LONG BUT I JUST WANT HELP  


Alright. So, to start this, I have a mixture of mental health problems that create my controlling issues. I was never diagnosed with anything because I never went to a psychologist, but my symptoms are crazy similar to OCD and such. And even if I don't have OCD, there's definitely something weird happening in my mind. So basically, the main problem with me is that I want to control the whole world. I want to control everything and everybody. And I also wanna say that I don't want to control the whole world, but my mind wants to do it. It's telling me to feel like that, so I feel like I want to control the whole world. I want to get rid of that feeling. The worst part is that all these controlling thoughts are linked with perfection, great attention to details, orderliness, checking things out and such (OCD). Plus with all these things there are thoughts telling me to do something or I'll die, I also think that's the OCD. Basically, when I do something, a lot of times there are thoughts like ""do that two more times or you'll die"". I have these type of thoughts since 2016, 2017 and just recently they got a little worse. That's the reason why I'm writing this post. BTW, I'm only 14 and it's very hard for me to process all this stuff. It's haunting me everyday and I just feel like there is no escaping. It's a mental prison. I just want these bad thoughts to stop. I also think all this might be linked to the fact that my life has not been the most easiest, because my dad left me and my mom when I was just 3 years old, and he left us with no money, which made us (me and my mom) a working class family, and we were broke since then. And I think all that lead to me having trust issues. You know, I never trusted nobody. I'm emotionally more connected to animals than I am to people, and if you wanna have my trust, you need to gain it. Also, the financial situation is getting a little better, and this year might be a year where things might change for me, at least a little bit. There might be things I didn't mention, but whatever, it's enough. So, anybody, please, can you give me any tips for overcoming my problems? Thanks to everybody."
833,Not sure what I’m feeling,So my day has been interesting.. yesterday I was basically called ugly and a lot of other things by someone I considered a friend. She blamed me for saying things I didn’t . She also brought up my boyfriend (who died in November due to suicide) well she basically insulted him and said she didn’t care at all. That hurt a lot to be honest seeing that she and a couple others knew I have been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts the past few months. I’ve been happy then I feel literally dead. I don’t want to end it because I don’t want to hurt anyone and cause pain I to anyone. But I don’t know what to do at this point. My life isn’t all that bad and wanting to kill myself makes me feel selfish and just bad about myself in general. I feel like Im wrong for feeling this way and don’t know how to stop it even after therapy and counseling the thoughts never seem to stop..
834,What I learned from almost losing my father,"*Pardon me if I made any sort of typos, grammar errors or missed any words. As I was typing this, I couldn't hold back the tears. Each time I tell the tale, I get really emotional, which is good because I never really felt emotional before like this and it helps release some stress. Crying does help. Never hold your emotions in, no matter how strong you are.*

  All my life, I always isolated myself away from my family, despite their numerous attempts to try to connect with me and my world. Some things they don't understand and some things they do. But, I always loved them no matter what. They supported me my entire life and I always supported them right back. My parents are my heroes. They sacrificed everything to move here to America to start a new life, a family and to achieve their dreams. Needless to say, they did just that and I cannot thank them enough for pushing themselves to reach this point in their lives.

  One day my sister told me that my dad had cancer, I was frozen in place. I walked up to my dad afterwards, I hugged him and told him how much he meant the world to me and my family and how much I loved him. He kept a brave smile on his face and told me everything was gonna be fine. I knew that after the announcement that Christmas wasn't gonna be the same. Immediately after opening the presents, I just went to my room and just slept, hoping to wake up and realize that it was all just a bad dream. When New Year's Eve came, nobody was in the living room. Normally, we would all be huddled around the TV with a glass of champagne (ECH) and a cup of grapes to celebrate it, but everyone was too emotional to celebrate it. It was a bad time too because around this time, I was supposed to go back to college and my car was having problems to the point where I was going to be car-less. I had to drop out because I just couldn't stop thinking about everything that's been happening.

 Come January 13th, my dad's surgery had begun. I was very sick that day. Had a very bad flu, so I had to stay home. My mom wanted me to go, but she knew that I wasn't feeling my best, so she let me rest. A few hours later, they came home with a smile on their faces to say that he's now in recovery mode and is now cancer free. Everything went back to normal, but I noticed a change in my behavior.

 My head felt heavy every day and each time I tried to eat some food, it wouldn't go down sometimes. The sensation was so bad that at work, I honestly thought I was having a heart-attack. Why was I feeling like this? My dad is okay now and is back working like he wanted to. What the hell is wrong with me? Then, it hit me. One day at work, I wasn't feeling good to the point where I had to sit down in the middle of the shift to relax. I wasn't feeling ill, weak or anything physical. My head just felt... heavy. When my supervisor asked me what I was going through, then that's when I began to break down into tears in front of him and another few co-workers. I didn't feel embarrassed, ashamed or anything. I felt more... relieved. I knew that I was holding up these emotions for so long and I didn't find the courage to talk to anyone about it because the saying goes: men don't cry. Stupid stigma.

 I spoke with a doctor about a week after the surgery and she basically said that I was going through an tough episode of anxiety. She asked if I ever experienced something like this before and I told her no. The doctor said that it's normal going through something like this and that these feelings will take a while to get accustomed to. But, she did recommend that I do some physical exercise and to change my diet up a bit, maybe even do some yoga.

 One day, I just walked up to my parents and I hugged them both and told them how much I loved them, how they were my heroes and how I was so grateful to each and every one of them for what they have done for our family. I have never done this. I did the same thing to my sisters, my friends, my girlfriend.... just to everyone who has been a part of my life and have shown their undying support towards me.

As the days go by, I am slowly but surely managing to get back to my normal self. Not my old self, but a normal self, where I can feel comfortable being around the people I love. I have my days where I just lock myself in my room to cry to let it all out. It's been tough and my job hasn't really helped much (retail, amirite?) If you are someone who has went through something like this before or is going through something like this, just remember that **you're not alone**. Reach out to someone, talk to them about your problems. Never not seek help.

 If your mother and father are still around, tell them how much you love them. If it's not a mom or dad, maybe an aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa. Anyone who has helped shape you to the person that you are today for the better, tell them how grateful you are of them. Hold them close and just spend time with them, even if it's just having a simple conversation.

 ***Thank you for taking the time reading this. I love you and I believe in you.***"
835,What’s wrong with me?,"I know that my mental heath hasn’t always been in a great place, I’ve experienced pretty severe suicidal thoughts before but I always just pushed through it until I was in a less miserable state. I’ve never considered my struggles to be anything worthy of being diagnosed with a mental illness, but I did try to speak to a therapist for a bit which lead to nowhere. 

Recently I went to a lecture for a class and from the minute I sat down I was experiencing this really uncomfortable feeling where I was just nervous for no reason and had cold sweats. There was no test or other possible stressor that could have caused me to act this way. At the end of the class I had to speak to the professor for all of 20 seconds to schedule a meeting for her office hours and it made me so uncomfortable it nearly put me in tears. What is happening to me? It’s not at all common for this to happen to me although I do avoid things like speaking in class because I’m afraid of people looking at me or thinking I’m dumb. 

I feel like a freak and anytime I consider something might be wrong I feel like I’m just self-diagnosing myself to make excuses. I don’t know what to do, does anyone have advice?"
836,i don’t know what i’m feeling,"i’m feeling weird and i don’t know why, but i feel numb and weak and bored and just... weird. i can’t tell if anything’s wrong. i’ve given up on homework and i’ve stopped paying attention in class. my life is just a big boring circle and i can’t do anything about it. i feel weird and i can’t descirbe it. probably just angst."
837,Question: depression and panic attacks,"Question: how many of you suffer from them and what do you do to help? 

I’m 30 male, new father and have fought with my issues my whole life. Also feeling numb or very saddened by nothing or little things.

I also have panic attacks from people screaming and hitting things because of a ex girlfriend. Yes she was extremely abusive both mental and physical. 

Lately my depression has been extremely high (higher then ever) but nothing’s happened to cause it. Never been medicated and I no longer drink or smoke pot. 

I wanna know what helps you. 

Thanks"
838,I think I have PPD and I’m not sure what to do,"I think I have  paranoid personality disorder, majority of the signs fit me, I’m overly paranoid about my trust in others etc 
My good friend is staying with me for a week and I am scared that he will hurt my dogs or do something bad (completely unwarranted) I keep “reading” hostile facial movements, I keep finding borderline insulting (I don’t think they are) words in his language, like I’m just a mess here and I’m scared I’m going to become hostile towards my friend and potential ruin a friendship, I don’t know what to do, i need to work and I’m scared to leave him and everything, I don’t know what to do, what should I do? (It’s just one week I need to get though then Im back to being alone ) does anyone know any techniques or something to settle my thoughts?"
839,Jeckyl and hyde?,"I have an almost friend who sometimes scares me.
I think it's almost a form of psychic vampirism but not quite the same thing.
Imagine a person who insults and harms others for pleasure but not the pleasure of knowing the victim was hurt. A person who is just plain wicked and evil for no reason other than that it comes natural to them. Everything about him is evil. I should probably say he simply does not feel. At least that makes sense. You have to experience it I guess to understand.

About my friend

I guess I could describe it as ""indiscriminate chaotic evil justicar""?

His sense of morale is brick hard old testament biblical. No sex, no lies, no fun, no nothing. Work, home. That's his life. On occasion he entertains guests but udually only for business.

He is touched by the devil. I've never known a human so cold and void of emotion. Everything is a systematic sequence to him. He treats all people and things the same, like nothing means anything to him. He says he must rely on logic to ""navigate this world because he does not belong here"". I've tried to figure out what that means but I cant. Hes a locked box to me. 

I know his past a bit, having grown up friends with his sister. They were both traded as sex for drugs in their early life and a lot of other terrible things. 
I imagine some kind of trauma related issues maybe but he never talks about the past.  In fact you cant get him to talk about yesterday. He'll tell you time is an illusion and that yesterday is just a delusion of things once wanted. ""The only time that exists is now"" is what hed say and if you listen you'll get a thorough explanation of how man began to count time and why man will die. (If you're a bible reader youd love that speech)

I've spent the night at his home while in town visiting his sister. His life is unlivable. I cant understand what's wrong with him. I want to help him if I can but he says there is nothing I have to offer that will ""assist his plight"".  I've volunteered to shoulder whatever burden he carries and he basically recited the bible and told me God deems him worthless in this time space. This is where you'll see that he us a seed of evil. The tyrannical rant that comes when anyone tries to get close is nothing short of shit your pants fear. He'll hurt you physically. Theres complete rejection of physical touch, won't accept a compliment, wont let anyone do anything for him. Its heartbreaking because I genuinely care for him but he is evil in flesh. 
He routinely does things like take homeless people to fancy restaurants, randomly pays for peoples dinner in restaurants, donates to charities,  how could such a generous person be evil? 
Because he doesnt feel any of it. It's all impulse according to him. He equally picks fights with random strangers. 
Oh god dont ever see him around kids! This fucker pours out so much money to kids it makes me sick to see. Icecream, candy, shoes, clothes, he just ups and buys tons of stuff and gives it away to kids but he wont even talk to them or say you're welcome!
He never smiles, never directly talks to people and is always a snide mean hateful piece of shit to everybody. If he learns you're a Christian he'll totally piss in your face. Ok I take it back. I saw him smile once.
He smiled when his mom died. I can at least say that. 1 smile in all the time I've known him. I guess I'm worried why hes seemingly kind to me like he is to children. In general he seems to ignore me completely but dies nice things for me indirectly. Hes paid bills , bought me food when I was fucked, sheltered me when I was out in the street, I can ask for anything and hell throw it on the floor at my feet, but will rarely talk to me. Hes said before that he has no desire to harm me or anyone and that it's best if I keep distance but hes really an amazing person despite being totally inclined toward evil. I have seen him nurture life in such a tender way but still systematically and with precise knowledge. It's like he feels nothing and cares about nothing. I know behind those eyes hes thinking terrible things about me and its frightening but he really is an amazing person even if he cant feel it. I wish I  could be more than a friend to him if he even sees me as that.

 ""One day you and the world will cease to exist and will have no importance. It is only logic to assume you and the world have no importance now"" Thats what he said when I asked him out. 

And then I've seen him systematically destroy life and hurt people without so much as a facial twitch but the eyes and body movement are different. Almost like a liquid viper. Theres excitement in his eyes when he is destroying. 

What could possibly be wrong with him?"
840,What is the point of life?,"I don't even know where to begin as I have a very difficult time expressing myself properly, but I am going to try my best. I will be turning 30 years old in the next few months. I have been engaged to my fiance for a few years and we've been together for 12. We live in a small apartment. I work as a manager at a retail company. Seems pretty normal right? Wrong.

Waking up and getting ready for work is an incredibly difficult task for me. Most days, when I wake up, suicide is the first thought that comes to mind. I have to really force myself to get out of bed, which results in me being late to work almost everyday. Sometimes it gets so rough that I will call in sick and not go to work at all. Most days I do not take a shower or take care of my personal hygiene whatsoever. 

I am a very shy person. I have been this way since I could remember. I've always hated having interactions with other human beings. When I am away from people, I feel much more at peace. I don't have the ability to form a human connection with others, and quite frankly, I don't even WANT to form human connections with others. I avoid all social events, and I even isolate myself from my friends and family. I miss my family every day but I don't even have the strength to text/call them back when they contact me. I don't know what they truly think of me but they must think I am this stuck-up person who hates them. Truth is, I think about them everyday, and knowing the fact that I'll never be able consistently connect with my family makes me very sad. Isolating myself from people makes me feel much more at ease. 

At work, I pretend to be a completely different person. At work, I act like I have my shit together, I act like this amazing leader, and I basically fake my way through this job. I believe. I have done a pretty good job in fooling people, even my boss, into thinking I am this really great manager.

But lately I feel as if I cannot keep the facade up any longer. A lot of times I will disappear (into random rooms where I will unlikely be found, usually the bathroom) where I will end up uncontrollably crying because my thoughts are spiralling downwards again. I sometimes look around for possible methods of suicide. Many times I am undeservingly cold to employees and customers. 

What I feel is that I simply just exist. I feel I am stationed in one spot, just waiting there, just empty. 

I should have been married by now. I should be planning to have children in the very near future. But yet I let the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years pass by. 

About a year ago, my mom learned of my suicidal thoughts and brought me to the hospital to get checked. I waited for hours to talk to a few doctors who asked me a bunch of questions. They booked a specialist appointment for a future date to which I never showed up to. I do this all the time; I will either cancel plans or not show up to something I've previously agreed to.

2 weeks ago, I swallowed a couple handfuls of tylonel, hoping to kill myself. It obviously was not enough. I want to try again on my 30th birthday, but this time I will swallow a lot more than a couple of handfuls.

I know I should see a doctor but I have zero motivation to do that.

So I will continue to silently suffer, until my next attempt."
841,I lie unnecessarily,"Below are three small instances when I lied but all three could have been avoided easily. For some reason i lie when i am ..underpressure? Flustered? I am not sure what about these situations that make me panic so much as to lie when honestly I don't need to. Either way, how do I stop lying so often and so unnecessarily?
Let me give examples: 
The other day I took up someone's device without asking and took pictures. That someone, is a person I don't usually borrow things from because they hate when people use their things even if they don't use it. I have had bad experiences with that person because of taking something up that belonged to them. I forgot to delete the photos from their device and only remembered when they returned. I took up the device and hid and deleted the photos so they didn't know I used it. When they asked where their device was I lied and said I didn't know. The crazy thing is that I felt bad afterwards for lying. So I went out and told them that I had it. They were mad understandable. However, they were mad because I lied and not because I used it. I felt dumb because I had built up fear due to past hurtful experiences with that person. 

Today some guy asked me if I ever spoke to him before and I said no. We did but I was trying to cut the conversation short since I didn't like how he was speaking to me. He started by saying ""Yo"" in this really rude way. I can't explain it. 

A few weeks ago I sat in another class in the back. I finished what I needed to do and the class was boring so I decided to leave. It started a little chain reaction since two other followed behind. When we were leaving the teacher asked me if I had another class and I said yes (lie). I guess I was hoping that would be the end of it. She asked what class and my mind went blank. I didn't want to lie again. The class laughed and I used that as a gate way to leave while they were distracted. I really didn't need to lie."
842,Financial Issues Receiving Mental Health,"I went to an intake session today because things have reached a tipping point for me. I started breaking down crying just at the basic questions today. I left feeling like maybe it's possible to get better. Now I feel completely empty because help was dangled in my face and ripped away. 

I dont have insurance. Well didnt about 8 hours ago. I lost my job last year and had no way to pay for insurance during the open enrollment. They are saying I dont qualify for special enrollment. Also the clinic I went to wont do sliding scale or anything.

I called today to set up insurance for myself but they only provide benefits for inpatient help. The agent made it sound like I would be able to make therapy/psychiatric appointments.

How do you guys afford to get help with poor/no mental health coverage. This really makes me feel like it will be impossible. After taxes and child support I have $1,400 for housing/health insurance/food/transportation/therapy/medication.

Do I need to get credit cards and max them out and file bankruptcy later? Get fired and work at mcdonalds so I make less money? I know this is a immature way to think about it but I dont know how I could possibly pay without becoming homeless. I have a psychiatric appointment next Wednesday and therapy session scheduled for Friday. I really dont want to cancel them and keep sinking. I'm 27. I cant take advantage of inpatient because I'd lose my job.

I really need to hear that it's possible. I dont have any friends. I've been looking for a roommate but I cant force anyone to share a home/cost with me.

Apologies that this comes off as me being stupid/immature/weak and thank you for any advise."
843,I ugly cried at work today— anyone else?,"First off, I think work is a huge part of mental health. I’m not saying all jobs cause mental illnesses (although some do), I am saying that your 40+ a week environment has a large affect on your mental and physical health. Let me explain my week so far. 

I started a job back in October. I have experience so I caught on quick, although different industry so there is a learning curve. Was doing very well until I was given a new project, a whole new workload on top of my others. I have been so overwhelmingly busy and stressed that I’ve been physically in pain when I leave work, I cry on my way home. Not out of sadness but just pure exhaustion. I ask for help, and my supervisor doesn’t send any. So I get to a point I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown just out of pure mental and physical exhaustion. I’m having to work OT to even make progress. 

Today my supervisor wants to bring up unapproved overtime and that she is so disappointed etc, etc. I just start ugly crying. There is no way I can perform my responsibilities in 8 hours. I’m so fucking exhausted, the stress is unbelievable. She’s mad that people are on their phones when mine is running on the same charge from three days ago. She says I don’t need to be crying, that I have no reason to be upset. 

I’m just saying that you would think employers would understand human limits.. because they are human. And when you give an employee a workload that literally brings them to tears, maybe you should offer a hand. 

I know I’m not alone here, I’ve seen many posts about work place anxiety and depression. Please feel free to comment your workplace scenario and we can talk about it together. 

Also, I did not apologize one bit for falling apart in the conference room. I said what I had to say and left. I have every right to my feelings."
844,"If you suffer from Boderline Personality Disorder, what are some ways to cope?",
845,Would regularly posting pictures of yourself and talking about your daily life be a sign of narcissim?,Just curious. Obviously this is something a lot lf people do lol.
846,"I dont ""suffer"" from a mental health problem, but do you think I have ""something""?","I have what is, in my opinion, moderate anxiety. I dont have actual panic attacks. But I had issues talking freely to classmates, I work as a teacher and dont engage the same as everyone else with others. I dont think I have issues understanding social cues like in autism at all. But I block myself easily when we are in a big group of people. Im a lot more relaxed talking one on one to something, personally I think others may think Im a different person there. Important information, I stutter somewhat regularly, I have controlled it quite well since kid/teenage years, but is still something I have to bear with daily. Sometimes is a struggle to start a sentence but then I talk quite well IMO.

What made me do this post honestly is that I have a weird ""reflect"" of, when talking trough something or getting nervous in a conversation, if there's a table with objects I nearly unconsciously take one and put it in another place. Like ordering it. My friend and my gf find it quite weird. And this made me think if maybe there's some info out there about why I do it. It may be just nothing, just wanted to talk about myself here a bit."
847,Emotional Invalidation,"How do you deal with emotional invalidation? Being sensitive often comes with disagreement and disrespect at times when expressing your emotions to others. Having your feelings dismissed is very difficult and I am curious how others deal with this, especially if it’s from someone you care about. 

Remember: your feelings are valid!"
848,How does a Canadian get a diagnosis?," 
I'm hoping to get a diagnosis. I have a counsellor, a family Doctor, and a naturopath and they help, but I’m still not well and I would like to change medications. Currently, I am taking Pristiq and I feel like it's not very effective (almost 3 years of it) and I don't want to go to my doctor for a new medication without some sort of official diagnosis. I've been looking at psychologists but they dont seem to return my calls. What do I say on the voicemail? Mental health issues run in my family. My emotions shift very quickly, and I often experience extreme sadness, anger, and anxiety.  I’m constantly afraid that the people I care about will abandon me/leave me/don’t care about me. Sometimes the way I feel about the people in my life can dramatically change from one moment to the next—and I don’t always understand why, or the reason why doesn’t line up with my reactions. My previous romantic relationships have been intense, but unstable.  My current relationship of 3 years is super stable and not intense, but I when I’m feeling insecure in my relationship, I tend to lash out or make impulsive gestures to keep him close. He’s patient and seems to weather it well… In the past, I would often do things that I know are dangerous or unhealthy, such as having unsafe sex, binge drinking, or using drugs. Now I tend to go on spending sprees or binge eat. I’ve engaged in self-harm behaviours such as cutting (not recent, the last incident was over a year ago) but I think about suicide a lot (and my life really isn’t that bad). Fortunately, I haven’t made any solid plans to kill myself, just day dreams about it. I work full time and dont want to go to the psych ward but... I'm feeling like I'm losing it"
849,I get overwhelmed so easily,"Today I had quite a chill day, I work up late and then went to craft society for a few hours and then had a group meeting for one of my modules and it wasn't even bad, but after that I felt so stressed and overwhelmed like I'd had a full packed day of work even though I hadn't, and only exercising helped that a bit...

But literally whenever I do any little bit of work I normally go into full stress mode and then I'm there remembering all the good times e.g. with family and friends where I didn't feel like this. It just seems so dramatic, it's like my brain switches from 'you're fine' to 'omg this is so stressful' even if it's not, and then sometimes I feel guilty when I'm not doing work and having fun because I didn't even need that much of a break because I haven't done much anyway.

I can work harder than what I've said in this post, however I need a break and I feel like it's more than others and I still feel burnt out from A levels I did nearly 4 years ago lol. But some people have to work overtime everyday, I feel I wouldn't ever be able to cope with working the really long hours some people do. Sometimes I even think about having to work the majority of the time and it stresses me out so much and then I remember the reality isn't as bad as what I make up in my head.

It's 1:45am and I'm laying here, I can't sleep and my brain is just awake, I wish it would just calm the fuck down."
850,How do I get someone involuntary committed to a psychiatric hospital in the state of GA?,"My mother is showing signs of manic bipolar depression. She has not been diagnosed. This is something that has happened on/off for at least the last 10 years, but she doesn’t really believe in therapy/counseling/mental illness. She has been having an episode — or what seems like it — since Saturday. She hasn’t eaten or slept and is crying hysterically one minute and then laughing the next. She called out of work the last 3 days and has been drinking alcohol nonstop. She hasn’t eating since the weekend. 

She just tried to do something to harm herself and I am afraid for my own safety and hers too. How do I go about getting her committed to a mental institution?"
851,"Moralities , idk",I’ve been suffering from extremely heavy panic attacks lately . I have insomnia and I’m up rn just laying in the bed feeling awful .ive been going to the hospital and have even been hospitalized but have yet to see any real help with my sleep panic attacks are now keeping me up too and I really just want Xans idk how to get them from my psychiatrist who I think already sees me “at risk” which I mean they aren’t wrong but this is just torturous I feel like too though if I need them I can just get them myself but at the same time why have health insurance if they can’t give you you’re medications also I don’t want to prove my psych right she never said anything directly but I got the feeling that she judged me because I smoke weed. Which is a sin in South Carolina
852,What helped you stop being Hypervigilant in public?,"I’m struggling to make going outside less stressful and mentally draining.
What helped you?"
853,Don't know what's wrong with me...,"I've always been someone who really needs a lot of personal space, so much so, that I once had to end a friendship because my personal space was not respected at all (he was also kind of manipulative but that's a whole other story) but recently I've discovered that I crave physical contact so much, I find it hard to function properly anymore. Like I've literally trained people around me to high-five me constantly (they don't know why, just think I like high-fives a lot I guess) cause I need the contact but I don't want to be too creepy. Other people don't have to endure stuff just cause I need it but I really don't know what to do (I know I'm probably not making much sense...sorry). And since I don't have many friends (or any friends to be percise) or people to talk to, I'm kinda dumbfounded over here... if anyone has an idea as to what might be happening, I'd really appreciate the opinions. :)"
854,The permanence of loss is fucking with my head,"I was dumped out of the blue by the woman I wanted to marry a little over a week ago. I cried it out and started to feel better about things. I was ready to take steps to move forward.

A few days ago, one of my clients died by suicide and it’s sent me into a downward spiral. All I can think about is the permanence of loss. How I’ll never see that client again. How I could potentially never see my ex again. I’ve been freaking out, inconsolable, and crying for hours everyday. I’m grieving two losses right now.

I reached out to my ex and we talked about this whole thing. She apologized for being an asshole and dragging me down by dumping me. I told her that these things happen and I just want to move forward with friendship because I am so fucking scared of losing her permanently. She was really sweet to me about it and we hung out for a bit and looked at memes and stuff and it made me feel somewhat better at the time.

But I’m still stuck in this hole of despair around the grief. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t work, I cant do my homework. I’m so torn up about everything I don’t know what to do.

I know that grief is a process. I know it can trigger you to mourn other things. I don’t know if I made the right choice by crying to my ex. I’ve been having a really rough couple of weeks. I guess I’m just writing this to get these words out of my head."
855,How do I fix the damage I've done?,"I've struggled with depression for most of my life, but for about the past 3 years specifically I've really struggled. During this time several things happened -- I had to put my childhood pet to sleep due to illness; my mom almost died several times from health complications; I got married without my mom present because she was in the hospital; while hopped up on opiates in the hospital, my mom told me I was a total failure, among other terrible things; my family pushed me away; etc. For a while I tried to keep going and keep doing work (I'm a freelance contractor). But I reached a point at which I couldn't bring myself to do work, to email anyone, or even to get dressed or do the dishes. I ended up ghosting several clients, and I feel very ashamed about it and concerned about the impact this probably had on my career. 

Thankfully for the last 4-5 months I have been doing a lot better. I'm taking care of myself, working, socializing, exercising, eating properly, working on cognitive behavioral therapy, etc. Is there an appropriate way to apologize to the clients I ghosted and repair some of the damage I did to my career as a result? Eg, would it be appropriate for me to send each person an email that says something along the lines of ""I apologize that I did not get back to you, I was struggling with some personal issues and I did not handle the situation professionally. I want to genuinely apologize for the inconvenience I caused, etc."" or is there a better way to approach that? Or should I cut my losses? Also, it's been almost 2 years since my wedding and I haven't sent out thank you cards yet. Is it too late? Should I apologize to people for not sending them?"
856,What to Disclose to HR or Your Boss When You Struggle With Mental Health Stuff,"I work at a call center(again) as I have a plethora of physical problems but my mental health takes a beating with it. I've been talking with HR and they said as long as I have a doctors note, I can take extra days off for mental health days, i.e if my agoraphobia or anxiety is too much, I don't have to worry about losing my job as well. 

We're trying out new meds and different doses to see if anything helps but I'm curious as to what do I actually disclose to HR?  I don't want to be known as the person who needed special treatment and this is one of the better places I've worked at. So far, all I've told them is that I'm working with my doctors to find a better alternative and might need to work 32 hours than the 40( but only sometimes. Most weeks, I can go in and make it up).

Anyone dealt with this before?"
857,I think I have a mental illness- but my family thinks it’s just teenage hormones.,"So to preface, I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety, agoraphobia and depression since I was roughly 12 (Currently 17).  I have always been an antisocial individual, but I’ve never really considered that something I wanted to fix necessarily?  The only issue I really have is anger.  I am for the most part a really easygoing person, but there are always times when EVERYTHING and I mean everything pisses me off.  I get super overwhelmed and just lash out at everyone and just start crying, screaming, the whole deal.   It usually stems from not understanding someone or not doing something in a specific way.  I was tested for ADHD and Aspergers six months ago, but the doctor said if I had it, it would likely be high-functioning and I would have to go to another doctor.  
Anyways, my parents believed I shouldn’t get that secondary test because it’s likely just teenage hormones.  I’ve voiced that I don’t believe it’s simply that, as I’ve always dealt with worse than average anger issues and overwhelming “episodes” (basically just a complete shutdown).  I have coped with my anxiety for quite some time, and feel comfortable where I am on that healing journey, but I hate feeling out of control when it comes to fixing this.   I am so frustrated with myself, and I just want to have some type of help with this.  I want to seek a doctor, I want someone to listen.  I just don’t know how to convince my parents.  


TLDR; I think I have ADHD or Aspergers because of my anger outbursts and episodes where I get overwhelmed and shut down, but my parents believe it’s just me being a moody teen.  How to get them to take me seriously?"
858,Hello outer world. Today I was told by Doctor. S. that I judge all you not-me people very bad and this attitude doesn't allow me to have fun and interact,"Let me introduce my self, I'm OP's unconscious. OP is rather sleepy right now and I'm just waiting for him to reach Morpheus' hugs and confuse his conscious mind with some Freudian experience he will forget with a brush of his teeth. During his wake time though, I like to take a step back. I never sleep, don't dare you think it. I still work on my machinations, but  in absolute silence. OP doesn't even notice I exist, so sweet!

Well sometimes he does notice me. Sometimes, you know, Doctor S. stops talking to OP's overationalized invectives, he changes his interlocutor, and through the hole of the pupils I can hear Doctor's accusations directed towards me. So gross. This time he touched a sensitive point. I blow my chest and try my voice. So many days since last time I spoke. The shout in response comes out angry, and flebile. Cuts the air almost unnoticed. But Doctor S. is ready.

""Finally you told it""
""Told what?""
""That you pass 90% of your time judging people""
""Yeah that's what I do indeed. Is this bad?""

Of course is not, my dear loved OP.

""Yeah know I see the picture. I can't relate with others because I feel like they are only good at hurting and facestepping."" 

Exactly! You are different from them. You are better than them. You have a moral framework my dear. You'd like to live in a world where love and respect rule upon any action people do. Some sort of a Christian paradise without a God but only good smiling spirits. For sure I can tell you, you'd be the King of that word! 

Sad truth is, this world doesn't exists. Those people around you, yeah your friends. Not only them, your parents and relatives. Ow and that guy who asked you infos on the street. And that other girl who tried with you. And that bearded man -do you remember him? Probably not, he's just one of the many- who was dancing beside you in the club. All those people, all the people, they are bad. Yeah bad like a villain in a movie. 

""It is possible. Some of them maybe. "" 

Some of them are so good at being bad that they actually seem good. Just to trick people. I almost admire their skill. Stay away from them please. And never trust them. They want to be trusted by the people that they lie to, so when you turn your back, they can put the stab in. Even when they are smiling, they are showing their theeths. 

""Agree."" 

Some others are just violent. I'm referring to men mostly, they could beat you in a blink of the eye. That's funny cause it's literal. Watch them in the eyes if you want your orbit broken. Love the drunk ones expecially. Not that I discriminate the junkies. They are so innocuous, and can be so good at putting themselves on a car, and a cradle on a tree. 

""That's sad!"" 

 And than the other type, the aggressive authoritaristic ones. Those are the type of people who would explain you something you already know just to boss you. I guess that it makes them dick hard, or pussy wet whatever. Girls call it mansplaining, they should create a genderless term for it tho. 

""Don't get distracted, focus on the test."" 

Give yourself just a moment, you already answered all the questions after all. Did you see them? Yeah those three girls who are taking the exam as a group work over there on the last desks? God they are so loud. They aren't even good at cheating. I guess their parents will be proud of their 30/30. I can see their mums reporting it to their coworkers. Subtly, in the middle of a chat about auburgines, they'll say how good their daughters were in the Contemporary Philosophy class. In case that bitch of a know nothing thinks his dislexic son is better than Sonia. 

""I need to sleep, please!"" 

Wait! Wait! Just a second. Want to forget that sweet girl? You know who I'm referring to. Yeah she went out with you only to make your best friend jealous. It's OK to be used when the person you love is doing it after all. It happens sometimes, in love. I mean, maybe always. Yeah actually is always like this. It's not a problem by the way, your friend knows that you like her. You talked about it with him."" She's yours"" he said ""I don't like her"". When they broke one year later and he called her bitch, you cried for her for the second time. 

""I must stop surfing reddit now."" 

No you won't. Here is full of redditors who want to give a real help to you. They maybe can't help themselves, and they are just proiecting their problems on you, and they are using you as a catharsis. But they want... ok never mind they don't want to help you they are just desperate individuals. 

""OK!"" 

Last type before I make you dream a tree producing potatoes. The ""be egoistic"" ""YOLO"" type. They are cute aren't they? Each one of them thinks and acts like he is the only mortal soul walking on the earthly ground. Like he he is the only one with feelings. Like he is the only one with some sort of privileges that come from the revelation that he is going to die in 50 years. The sort of privilege that allows you to molest a girl and get her drunk to fuck her without protections, make a tape of the act and post it on any Whatsapp group. And tell you ""relax man, it was fun."" 

""They aren't all like this. I like people, I'm in love with nice people. "" 

There aren't nice people beside you. Some of them are innocuous. They are losers so big they couldn't even hurt a fly. They are just egoistic people like all the others, and they are so overcharged with frustrations about their shortcomings that when they become skilled in something, their tongue curls in pleasure at the idea of hurting you with their renewed self confidence. 

""So you telling me everybody is a egoistic piece of shit?"" 

Yes and that's why you don't want to have anything to do with them. You are scared, and you are right to be so. They will hurt you, with their multiple ways. Watch them from the distance like a birdwatcher and laugh on how much miserable their lives are. You are not of that blood, you are good in any sense. When you offer a hand, you are really offering it. When you swear something, you do it. When you love someone, you really love him. You don't care about yourself, you are selfless. And most of all you won't ever do anything that could possibly hurt anyone. Therefore, just don't move, stay there on the side. Don't talk with her. You don't want to ruin her night at the party. Just stay there and wait, wait till this violence of a party ends."
859,Fixated on a particular event...,"This occurred years ago during my first deployment to Afghanistan. It was during my first convoy delivering supplies and other knick knacks to our FOBs scattered throughout the Kunar province, I was riding shotgun in the PLS when I suddenly heard what sounded like a freaking fire cracker going off right in front of me. The MRAP behind our truck radioed us saying what may be have been an RPG or recoiless round impacted right behind our truck. The entire convoy came to a halt at that point and our MRAPs lit up a hill on the opposite side of the river with 50 cal and Mk19 fire. 

It wasn't until we got to our destination that we got to our destination that we got a chance to inspect the truck, the rear area of our truck took some shrapnel damage including a fairly large piece that pierced one of our rear wheels (we had to replace the tire, thank god we made it to the FOB with that thing inside the tire). That's when a thought came to me, if that \*\*\*hole on the hill had been a little bit more accurate or faster with his RPG or whatever, there was a very good chance he would have hit the cab of our PLS and I would not be here typing this up today. This random thought has bothered me for years, it's not like I constantly think about this event. It just pops up randomly, I could be at work or on the john and this thought for some inexplicable reason just pops back into my mind out of nowhere and I'm suddenly reliving that convoy all over again. 

I've never talked to anyone about this much less the VA, I figure their resources are far better spent on someone with far more severe mental issues than mine. Just wanted to vent since this happened again while I was listening to some random music on YouTube."
860,I quit taking my antidepressant,"I was on escitalopram for a couple of months. It slowly started to affect me more and more. I began hiding inside of the video game Stardew Valley. Today is my second day off of it and I seem to be coming back to reality a bit. I'm admittedly a bit impatient with doctors, but I just couldn't wait another six weeks to tell my psychiatrist that I think I want to stop. I think she said I should quit if I wanted to anyway. I took an SSRI in college that had a similar negative effect. I just felt catatonic on it."
861,"Is talking about mental health, insecurities, ect embarrassing?",I really have trouble with this I feel weird when I tell people about things I don't like about myself or things I'm struggling with. And I don't know if it's because I'm afraid they'll use them aganist me or see me as week or if I'll end up talking to them about everything If they let me confied without judgement. It's made it really hard for me to open up or talk to people in everyday life. If it's not embarrassing I just want to know why and how to be okay with it
862,I don’t know what to do anymore,
863,How did know you needed help with your mental health?,"Over the last 4 years I have slowly deteriorated my mental health. My physical, mental, and emotional health are all in the gutter, and have only become worse due to events I have dealt with. At this moment in life I have no motivation for anything. I’m supposed to be going to college next fall, but honestly I don’t care where I end up, or where I go. I don’t study for anything for my classes, I don’t have motivation to go to the gym, and I don’t care to work on my social life. I have dug up a hole and just keep digging myself deeper into it, making it harder and harder to get out. What do I do?"
864,Just another vet,"There is a lot going on in my head and in my life that has brought me here to vent. Broadly, I have been diagnosed with non-combat service connected depression and anxiety in addition to PTSD from childhood abuse. I have been evaluated several times by the VA and I’ve been essentially told the same thing again and again ... “you should seek therapy” but I still can’t afford that kind of treatment so here I am fucked up, but trying! I have a list of other service connected disabilities which further complicate life, including limited mobility in one of my legs, chronic back pain, and syncope (and related memory loss)... all of which prevent me from having a normal sleep cycle. The days sort of blend together and I have a hard time keeping track of the dates so I end up just sort of winging it one day at a time. 



Well after I left the navy, I went to college. I worked 3 jobs to ensure I wouldn’t go into debt paying bills, even though I was using the GI bill and part of VocRehab benefits to finish the last part of my bachelors degree. My grades were never great, I focused on the experiences that would bring me the opportunities I needed in my career of choice after I graduated. Now the only thing that is stopping me from graduating, is one class of Organic chemistry. I’ve taken it 3 times, the final is coming up and I’m sure to fail it again. I can rationally work through the problems with all of my notes, but the tests you have to reproduce full reactions and I just ... can’t. The second I begin to try I start crying and it blooms into full panic until I can’t breathe. I’m actually crying now as I type this out. I have tried to force myself through it day after day, trying to absorb and cram the information in there but I can never reproduce the information properly. No matter how I practice. I’ve tried reaching out to the professor for help but he just asked me to “stick to it”. So here I am failing the class with the final in a few weeks, utterly unable to prepare myself. I’ve been prescribed some different medication, so far they have little or no impact on my ability to control my response to the situation. 



The kicker? I already have a full time permanent job that I love in a community that I love. It’s not perfect, but it works for me, it’s interesting and I get by. I’m even trying to buy my first home! But everyone I know is under the impression I already have my degree... organic chemistry is in no way related to field that I currently work in! Not even close! But I still feel like shit because I can’t get through this notoriously difficult course. I am good at my job, really and it’s probably because I enjoy it so much and yet when I’m recognized for it even in the slightest way I cringe inside. Must my degree depend on my ability to memorize complicated and lengthy reactions? 



I feel helpless because there’s no other option but to take the final and fail again, like really there’s no amount of studying no amount of time or repetition that can fix my brain. I’m sorry but I don’t have the capacity. And part of me is like fuck it, it’s organic chemistry? Who is really going to fire you because you didn’t pass one class? Who is really going to notice or care? And the other part is like yea... you reaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy fucked up here, why can’t you just push through and pass like everyone else? Just read more! Study harder!.... .... I feel so dumb for being stuck with these issues in my head, I just want to be done with it but it has driven me so far into the ground it’s hard to pull myself out alone. 



There are many other things that swirl around my mind but I had to get this part out tonight. Maybe I’lol have energy for the rest another day."
865,Issues with random nausea on Wellbutrin,"27f, on 150 of bupropion. I have very minimal food aversions, BUT every now and again I’ll eat something and will feel gross and nauseous after. These are foods I’ve eaten plenty before and I love. Anyone else experience weird food related issues on their antidepressants?"
866,Closure Does Not Exist,"Closure does not exist. Life is not fair. The further you can put the concepts of closure and fairness away from your life, the happier you will be. I like these sorts of statements, even though they aren't the happiest to admit. They are true, though. Sometimes we expect reality to follow a narrative, like a movie or a song might. But, life is a constantly growing bubble of information that never forgets that time in elementary school when that thing happened, or your first big rejection, or that career failure. The only thing you can control is what you put into that bubble, and how much you put into it. You can fill your life with more things, and effectively ""move on"", but you will never have closure. And things will never become fair. Just for my own sanity, I need to admit this. Because it's a good goal to have more things in your life. It's a good goal to say I want to do ""this"" by ""this date"" and to do your best to meet that goal. But it's no help to anyone to seek closure, happiness, or fairness. Or even health in general. We can add pieces to our lives, bit by bit, and increase the positive turns that the story takes. But there will always be dark paths that we go down until we find the light again."
867,I’m done eating for as long as I need to feel alive again,
868,How to stop expressing yourself to those who don’t understand?,"Have any of you ever had the issue of wanting to tell someone about something from your life that you want to let off your chest, but they underplay your situation and don’t see it as a big deal? I suffer with a lot, but whenever I try to tell a friend who I think will understand, they start saying how I’m making excuses for stuff or “it’s not that serious“, which gets me extremely upset and causes me to distance myself from others. Any of you have advice?

I know some of you might just say to stop telling other people, but it’s much easier said than done and I end up just speaking about it over and over trying to find someone who will actually get it."
869,I'm losing my shit in this house,"So I'm currently unemployed, live alone with my fiance and our 3 pets. He works and I stay home and take care of things here. Lately I've been having the absolute hardest time trying to get myself to just do basic chores, get out of bed/off the couch, eat, etc. Sometimes I cant even make myself get up to use the restroom until I cant hold it anymore. I dont really drink water unless I feel super dehydrated. 

I cant leave the house without my fiance or my family members because I live in a bad area and I cant drive, so walking is out of the question. 

This house feels like prison but every time I go out i feel immediately exhausted. I feel so beyond guilty for not cleaning up or being able to take my dog outside. The want to do things is there but my body just doesnt have the energy or motivation. The messier my house gets the more I dont wanna move but I still cant make myself get up to organize and clean. I wanna shower but if my floors even slightly dirty i wont because i wont walk on dirt with clean feet. I sound insane and I feel insane."
870,Commitment issues,"Hey guys,

So I'm not looking for any kind words. I'm 26 have done the whole university thing and dropped out with 2 years left on a 4 year degree. I work and currently doing a pre-apprenticeship in electrotechnology with hopes of becoming an electrician. But I've started to put a few things together about my self stemming from childhood from now I've always had issues committing to something and seeing it through til the end. Now not the case with relationships, I love my gf and am very committed to her but I'm at a stage in my life where I want to get something done and have something behind me, but I just dont commit, I've missed a few days already and its only a 2 day a week course for 6 months. I've had my bouts with depression in the past and suicide attempts but after that I was actually doing very good for my self got a job as a trade assistant and detailer working 6 days a week but i fell off again. If anyone has been through these issues and has found a way to get some structure and motivation in their lives Im all ears! I also have hyperprolactinemia which is suppressing dopamine and serotonin levels in my brain which is the happy hormones its absolutely killed my sex drive, I've also got a fsirly addictive personality I used to smoke weed ALOT like a half ounce a week. Yeah im not too sure what im trying to say anymore..ive got an opportunity in my hands right now and i dont trust my self to take it. I want to be a man I can be proud of and raise kids that grow to be happy and loving and all that but I'm not sure if I am good enough or if im just meant to be shit at life."
871,It's really hard dating and living with someone who is suicidal and incredibly depressed but won't do anything about it.,"I've been dating my partner for three years and today they turned the big 3-0. They kept talking about how hard today is and how they weren't supposed to be alive this long and it's just really hard to live with this lately. 

I've been feeling neglected and they don't actually talk to me about a lot of their problems and then act like I'm stupid for being really concerned and wanting them to go to therapy when they casually mention suicide like that. It's not always like this but when it's bad it's pretty bad and it's hard to live with and love someone with this disease."
872,The cycle of narcissistic inaction,"I'm convinced that I'm at the point in my life where I need to grit my teeth and work hard until I reach where I want to be. But every time I think about it, my mind immediately thinks ""it's pointless"" ""it won't matter in 50 years"" ""that industry probably won't even exist"" ""you won't make a difference"" and the like. 

I really don't want to keep floating through life, letting the current take me where ever and not taking control and steering myself where I want to go, but I also can't seem to convince myself to get started. I usually give up on things after trying for a short while, or give up before I even start. I've developed a system of forgetting in order to make day to day life bearable, I try to live in the moment to escape the existential dread but end up letting myself stagnate by not moving forward.

I can't even say I want help anymore - I tried a bunch of stuff and it didn't work and I just can't be arsed trying because it seems pointless. I feel the necessity to let everyone I tell know that I'm not at risk, I'd never hurt or endanger myself, I just exist. 

But I want to do the things I feel like will make a change, or that I'm passionate about. It just seems that I'm passionate about every single thing for a few days or weeks and then it's onto the next thing, endlessly."
873,Anxiety about the corona virus,Since I found out about the corona virus I have had beef bad anxiety about getting it. It doesn’t help that when I get anxious I start to feel like I can’t breathe which makes me even more anxious about think that I already have it. Thankfully I am in a state with no confirmed cases but I was wondering if anyone else has had anxiety about this issue and had and any ways that might help control it.
874,What’s wrong with me :(,"I was originally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD last year. I started Prozac at the end of last year, but it ended up inducing a hypomanic episode in February of this year. Upon revisiting my Psychiatrist I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and taken off of Prozac and put on Latuda. I’ve been on Latuda for roughly two weeks and I’m no longer hypomanic, but I’ve been having extremely awful mood swings. Just this past hour I went from feeling motivated, to manic and impulsive and inspired, to depressed and suicidal, to so angry that I want to scream or punch something. I’m having high highs and low lows all in the span of a day and I don’t know what’s wrong. It’s really upsetting. I’m not sure if it’s just me or if maybe the Latuda is having weird side effects. Any and all help/advice would be appreciated. (P.S. I’m seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow so hopefully we’ll find a solution.)"
875,Medication Help Needed: Valproic Acid vs SemiSodium Valproate,"I am prescribed SemiSodium Valproate (Depakote) and in my blister pack the pharmacy has given 250mg tablets of Depakote (which is right) but rhe 500mg tablets are 'Valproic Acid'. I went to the doctors who wrote the script and they reprinted one to show me - both 250mg and 500mg were 'Depakote' and they said the pharmacy had dispensed it wrong when giving Valproic Acid. My Nurse told me the same as even though they are extremely similar I still need what is prescribed exactly.

The pharmacy have sent Valproic Acid twice now. How can I explain it is incorrect if it is?"
876,I don’t remember taking my meds,"So I just took them for what feels the first time, except when I drank my water it felt “familiar” if that makes sense. like i was just forgetting that i had already taken my meds but i vaguely remembered drinking my water.

I have been diagnosed with complex pstd (dv, sexual trauma), low self-esteem, bulimia, anxiety and major depression. I have been seeing my psychologist who specializes in depression, trauma and ptsd for about 4years now, which we have been slowly getting there. However, my GP refereed me to a knew psychologist who specializes in eating disorders and body image. They both know that I am seeing both as they don't cover what the other does, but I am really anxious about seeing both as I don't know if it is too much or what to do. Really appreciate advice (please be kind)"
879,COVID-19 and Losing Marbles,"CW/TW: PTSD, Death, Medical Fears.

I have C-PTSD. Seven years next month. One of the hardest symptoms I’ve dealt with is the sense of foreshortened future. I feel like I’m living on borrowed time. I feel like I don’t deserve to be here. It’s not always bad. I have a lot of good days. But I haven’t planned for the future in seven years. I can’t. I don’t know how. For me, the future just...isn’t there.

My doctors tell me that I need to relax. It’s stupid advice for a person who is hyper-vigilant and gets little sleep, right? Ha. They say my body is physically manifesting my stress. My hair is going grey. I’ve developed arthritis. My immune system is shot. I’m now classified as immunocompromised.

My screwy immune system is why I’m writing this post. I have tried *so hard* to keep calm about COVID-19. I know I catastrophize things. I’ve kept up with the updates and I’m washing my hands a zillion times a day, sure, but I haven’t lost my marbles and I’m proud of that. I’m doing really well, considering. But fuck, I feel that creeping sense of doom again. I feel it like I felt it immediately after The Event. It’s so heavy. I’m so tired. I almost passed out from exhaustion on the job today. I’m scared. I’m so, so scared. And I feel like I’ll be laughed out of the room if I voice any of this, so I’m keeping my head down and my mouth shut and I’m scrambling to shove all my marbles into my pockets before I lose them again.

Thank you for letting me vent."

881,No spark,"Life has seem to lost its spark. I didn’t expect to be living some fantasy adventure like out of a book, and was quite content living the average students life. But ever since entering year 2 of uni, there’s no spark. I don’t look forewArd to anything. It’s not like I dread the day or waking up. But there’s nothing I’m excited about. My grades have been continuously declining. I can’t find any sort of meaning to what i do with my days. I can’t describe my feelings as depressed, I don’t think I’m depressed at least. I’m just unhappy. And I need to know how to break out of this self-repeating rut of boredom and unhappiness."
882,My stress is so much better now that one thing has changed,"MY BOYFRIEND CAN FALL ASLEEP. He’s been having the hardest time sleeping all year. taking hours to fall asleep and sometimes just never even doing it. he’s tried medication but it didn’t work and for months and months he’s been getting 3 hours or less sleep. one time he didn’t sleep for more than 48 hours. I told myself not to worry but i did so much it impacted everything i did. My grades suffered, I’ve been mean and unmotivated. But today he told me he’s tried new meds for the past week and they’re working and he can usually fall asleep in about 45 minutes. I cried my eyes out and i feel like life has hope again. He’s happier and can focus more. Which makes me happier. I don’t care if no one reads this but i just needed to say how happy i am right now."
883,Life can be horrific but keep going for the things that matter.,"I currently engage in a lot of self destructive behaviour like smoking, drinking, not sleeping and drug use. They are what i use as a distraction from the pain and depression of day to day  existance.

Im seeking professional help for myself to hopefully allow me to have a brighter future.

It would be nice if my family understood what im going through but first i think i need to understand what im going through.

I really dont enjoy being alive but the people around me who care about me are the reason i still am. Surround yourself with people that genuinly care about you, life can be utterly horrific at times but the thought of them can be that boost that keeps me going.

Be good to yourself. You only get one body and one life, treat it better than i have and try and enjoy it while you have the chance."

886,Obsessively ruminating over and over about something that bothered you,"Does anyone else do this? I seem to get stuck on thinking back to an uncomfortable experience or sensation and my mind tells me if I ever want to be free of the thoughts the only solution is to off myself. This isn't the first time this has happened and likely won't be the last, but every time it happens I feel like I'm doomed and I become severely depressed. I had a sudden mood swing about a week ago and it felt so odd and that's what my mind is currently focusing on. It's relentless and it's fucking torture. I really wish I knew how to make it go away faster, but it usually takes a week or two or sometimes more for the thoughts to stop bothering me. I guess I'm just looking for reassurance that I'm not alone in this, because I feel alone and it sucks."

889,I just want to be normal !!!! what the heck is wrong with me ???,"Hello, so first a little back story, i'm a 16 year old boy from Brisbane Australia. I've been suffering from mental health issues for the better part of 6 years now. So basically from the point i became a teenager. over the years my problems and issues have evolved into different things. Some things have gone, some things have come, some things have gotten better and some things have gotten worse. 

But basically, I never ever feel happy or content with my life and the world around me. I struggle greatly day to day with just getting through the day. My mind is constantly going at a million miles an hour and will never slow down. I can't sleep properly, I've always had issues with sleep, but i wake up through the night all the time and when i finally do wake up in the morning i'm always tired and just want to spend the rest of the day in bed. 

I do see someone for it, i see a psychiatrist. I take about 6 different medications for my various different problems, two anti depressants, one anti psychotic, two sleeping medications, and one to stop the anxiety feeling inside my stomach.  They do sorta seem to work, but they definitely aren't working to their fullest potential. I've been told i'm very resilient to drugs and medication. I have tried so many different things and they haven't really worked. 

The best way to explain it is, i have never really felt comfortable or content inside my world. When i say my world i mean the world, like the one we all live in. I don't know why though, i have a wonderful family with support all around me from them, i have some truly great friends, i have recently just gotten into a relationship with a beautiful girl. I have always gotten everything I've needed and wanted. I'm not rich but i'm certainly not poor. I live in a middle class suburb in a first world rich country. I've never experienced anything overly bad in my life, nothing has gone terribly wrong. 

I just can't seem to help myself, everything just makes me anxious or scared, if it doesn't make me feel like that then i just feel like everything is wrong, or i have it terribly or something along those lines. It's really hard to explain, if you want to ask me to explain something more in the comments i will. 

I more or less just wanted a vent and hopefully might find someone who is similar to me. Thanks."
890,I don’t know if this is normal,"Rather not say any personal details except I’m in high school. 
I have a weird problem where whenever I’m alone or nobody is talking to me and I’m not doing something I enjoy my thoughts tend to travel into thoughts of murder/suicide. Most of the murders involve my ex-girlfriend from 3 years ago who I deeply resent, they vary with the most common of just bringing a gun to school and raping then murdering her, or alternatively the ol’ bat. The suicide ones vary with bridges to guns to dying in a classroom with my good friend. This has been going on for some time and I don’t want to tell my mom or ask to go see a therapist or whatever, I have already disappointed them with failing grades and don’t want to add more their plate. I don’t know if I struggle with depression when I’m around friends I’m genuinely happy or playing a game but after that ends after the dopamine rush I get down, I’ve tried committing suicide before but couldn’t bring myself to it for some reason.

Please if you have any help I would be so gracious"

My family and I have seen her almost commit suicide on multiple occasions and thankfully stopped her. I tried everything in my power to help her but she always gets worse. I feel powerless right now. Any ideas and help would be appreciated.
892,Really bad stress,Heyy everyone! Just posting to find out if anyone has serious stress problems and thinking about the future. It causes me to stay up most nights and I get really tense and freaked out. I’m really young and it really scares me to see where I’ll be in the next 10 years in my life. Does anyone else feel this way?
893,Just a small vent/ramble,"I recently joined reddit despite already reading different threads on here. I wanted to share some of my experiences that could possibly help others feel motivated. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past but recently I decided to see a therapist again to help myself do better in my wonderful relationship. Well, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and as you can imagine my PTSD episodes caused a strain on my relationship. I have been doing better but I simply can't get over the guilt and sadness over the fact that I hurt my loving partner; a person I would never consciously hurt. My episodes as we call them completely overtake me to the point that I am not myself and I can't remember what occurred during them. I feel awful that I say terrible things to the man I love and he just accepts me and does his best to understand what I am going through. I love him deeply and well I am making a positive effort to break this and get better. Today, I cleaned my apartment and ate a decent dinner. I also took a nice shower; I always take care of my hygiene but this shower was more for enjoyment and relaxation rather than one just to get clean. I also made a big step in reaching out to one of my closest friend about what is going on in my personal life. My boyfriend has been supportive and I honestly can't thank him enough; I'm thankful that our relationship is super healthy and good despite these mental roadblocks. I never thought that I would make it this far but honestly taking baby steps and creating and reaching out to your support group does wonders. To those of you struggling with anything please don't give up and be patient with yourselves."
894,I feel like I'm spiralling,Everything seems like such a blur nowadays. Nothing I'm doing seems to be right and nothing I do will ever be right. I'm so tired of being wrong all the time. So tired of being useless. I have no purpose. I won't ever accomplish a single thing. My life has absolutely no meaning. I want to get better but no matter what I do it seems like I won't be able to. I'm just so tired. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. Everything fucking sucks.
895,I think i just had a panic attack,"I was laying in my bed getting ready for sleep and watching tiktok cause i had it installed. I stumbled across a video about growing up through school. I over thought it immensely, vented all my insecurities to a discord friend and spent 5 minutes hyperventilating in my bed."
896,Anxiety,I had serious anxiety and I was put on Xanax after having a serious (vomiting blood) reaction to valerian root. I can't get any more xanax. I am now taking st Johns wort andahswagandha?? Whatever that is. I use cbd at least once daily also. Is there anything else you would recommend? I know I need to be on medication but I can't at the moment before those comments come rolling in.
897,"After months of fighting for it, I finally started therapy today...","And it went super well!! I love my therapist; she’s so welcoming and down to earth. I’m such an introvert and I hadn’t said anything I said today out loud, so I was expecting to be really tense and quiet, but I also promised myself when this appointment that I would commit to recovery and do my best to be as honest as possible. I opened up about being passively suicidal a few months ago almost immediately, and she was so accepting and willing to listen. I didn’t realize how much I needed this, but now that I have it, it’s so amazing and helpful and honestly? I can’t wait to go back."
898,Suffering badly.,"Hi all, I’m not sure what can really come of this post but I’m hoping for some advice. 

A week ago, I broke my arm and hurt my shoulder and the man I was with broke up with me because of his own mental health issues. We are still friends and talk every day but my stomach sinks when I think about him moving on. I get angry and sad and spiral into a worse depression. I can’t get myself out of this. I want to be happy and loved. I want him to be happy and I know for a fact he would be loved (he still is) but so much by me. I know time will sort things out and all I can do just now is put myself forward and first but it’s really, really hard. I’ve never put myself first. I don’t really know how? I’ve booked a trip away with my best friend to our favourite BC town for a week, so I’m hoping that will help a lot. I also have some health issues but I’m hoping they settle and I can start working out again. I’ve started anti depressants a few weeks ago so I’m also hoping these kick start my brain into feeling normal again. 

I just need a friend right now, I’m sick of going to bed every night thinking about ways to kill myself or hurt myself. I have never felt this unwanted and unloved before. I just want things to be ok."
899,how do I tell my psychiatrist I'm not willing to take ssris at all?,"I have my first psychiatrist appointment tomorrow and I am very nervous because I have no idea what to really say and I feel like the first thing they are going to try to prescribe me is anti-depressants which I am not willing to take. I am mainly going to get treatment anxiety but also depression. I feel like if I tell them I'm not willing to take ssris but want treatment for anxiety it will look like I'm drug seeking. I'm also scared they will ask why I'm not willing to take them which I don't have a good answer to. 

advice on this please? I genuinely have anxiety and depression but ssris aren't something I want to put in my body"
900,Don’t know what to do from here,"I’m only 17 but i have been dealing with terrible anxiety for years now. I’ve probably been actually depressed for a year now and slowly it’s gotten worst and worst. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a year and have been on different meds for months and nothing helps. A few weeks ago I swallowed a bunch of pills, not because I wanted to die but because I wanted a break from everything. I just found out my boyfriend who was my best friend was cheating on me and i’m just destroyed. I want to die and get rid of these awful feelings but I don’t at the same time. I don’t know if i should be hospitalized or what, I have no clue what the next step is."
901,Society are Animals,"Many seem to want to defeat ego and individualism.  Some just do not like me personally.  Some of my rivals are just coward pussy individuals, trying to use cowardly tactics to make an example of me.  

I was being ""cased"" for a hate crime for years now.  These individuals are trying to find reason in their pussy ideologies of assassination.  I did not believe in these ideologies at all.  We had Chivalry for a reason, Rules of Engagement, Sanctions, and the Laws.  
These people are just pathetic beings eeking out their existence.  Ideology like this would ruin life into shadow games and coniving bullshit, the Lord was famed for despising such ideologies.  I do not understand the gangster, assassin, ideologies coming into fruition a novel thing.  

This is the period of which Mankind is failing to properly represent itself.  Accepting this type of coward ideology is inexcusably laughable in life and death.  These coward beings may triumph through bronze, many will ally with it.  

Fear not, your wits are are a necessity, as well as your humor.  Humor is a necessity amid this insanity and cowardice.  

It's come to turn my stomach.  Not only these ruffians, the nature of being a Warrior entirely.  Even our best are reduced to espionage and shadow work. 

It must be called upon.

Fuck the Shadows."
902,I’m going back to therapy and I’m nervous,Last time I went it was helpful but I just wasn’t ready. Going there made my stomach churn and I just wasn’t ready to face some stuff. I am hoping this time it goes better and I feel more ready to talk about stuff. Do you guys have any advice for feelings comfortable and getting rid of that feeling like I’m about to throw up? Thank you
903,Emptiness and Boredom,"I really need some advice, though I'm not sure if it's not common sense. I've pretty much lost all interest in the things I've used to love. I'm tired, and I don't really care about anything.

I can get glimpses of happiness, though. Sometimes, if I'm doing something, I'll get a fleeting moment of passion. It's beautiful.

It's enough to keep me going for now, but I'm struggling hard and I'm not sure if I can keep it up. I've made it a choice to stay alive, but it's hard now.

Any advice?"
904,Anxiety causes objects to seem as if they shift or float?,"I haven’t been diagnosed as bipolar but I am aware that I am in fact bipolar. It runs deep in my family. My doctor and therapist both have said I display symptoms of it. Please don’t try telling me to not self diagnose, I’m not. This is something I’ve been told by people in a professional atmosphere. 

I do have an anxiety disorder. I’m on medication for it. But I’ve been a bit stressed and anxious lately. Lots of changes are happening. But I’ve noticed when I get anxious or hit a manic depressive episode I’ll look at things. And sometimes I swear things look like they are floating or shifting. Like a picture on the wall or my blankets 

Does anyone else experience this from time to time?"
905,I cant remember the pain,"About 3 years ago I had depression and was in a lot of pain, but for some reason I keep forgetting it. I know i went through it and if I try really hard I can remember some things but it's like all that was wiped from my memory. Has anyone else experienced this??"
906,I feel lost,"I think I've been avoiding these feelings for far too long. I just feel sad most of the time. I'm 21, I work in a department store, and k hate every minute of it. I feel like I need a change but I don't know what to change. I'm overweight and I can't bring myself to fix it, even though I know it hurting me in the long run and draining my self-esteem. I have almost no sex drive, even though I have an amazing girlfriend who I love very much, and I know that will eventually start to wear down out relationship. I just don't know what to do."
907,Hating myself alot these days,"I find myself really getting agitated with myself. Whether it be over things others say to me that I blame myself for, whether it be over something as ""simple"" as breathing which God like it is not working Mann. I can't take a proper deep breath. And the more I try I end up having a mini panic attack. I keep getting impatient over tiny things and releasing this ridiculous rage which is so uncalled for and I feel guilty and ashamed every single second of the day over something that happened in the moment or something that's already happened. I'm so frickin exhausted with myself and feel ashamed that I can't be patient with myself so how can I expect anyone else to be and I know they are. And if they see this ever, I'm so so so sorry 😭 I'm exhausted. I don't want to be weak but can I be allowed to feel vulnerable and not have to switch gears in 5 minutes to cover up the choked up feeling in my voice, or the tears behind my eyes or the pain in my jaws. I'm tired and I know somewhere subconsciously they're probably tired of me too and I'm sorry for all of it . I wish I could make it easier for my family but I don't now. I think out of all of it though for better or for worse, I'm like legit the happiest I have ever been. And I get these are just road bumps, maybe? Hopefully? There's just so much more to the emotions than I can explain verbally or by writing and I wish I could but the more I even express the more irritating it gets but I can't bottle this up either so I guess in an round about kinda way I just wanted to say thank you. To whoever has read this. And any of my posts on this sub. Thanks for validating my being in someway. It means alot."
908,Got an interesting compliment,She told me I'm way cooler than I seem like I am.  Which is kind of understandable I guess?  I'm just a simple ass guy but I really just dont give a fuck so I've been into a few things.  Some people think I'm a mark but I understand what they are doing and I don't mind helping someone out.  People often don't realize that really I just dont care about me and I'll do anything to help someone who really needs it especially with kids but I'm also a super freak in bed but I don't have chicks usually because it's too much hassle.  It's been a good year in a lot of ways.  Some people think I'm disrespectful because I treat women like adults and ask if they are into something I'm into instead of being satisfied with some missionary that I could honestly never come in a million years for
909,My new subreddit,I've created a subreddit r/bodyissues where you can share freely your issues with about your body. Hope some of you join
910,Oh dear... Fell big time...,"I cut my arms up bad.

I can't sleep. We were talking about trauma in Group and I nearly had to leave bc I was having flashbacks of the prison and all the stuff I'd seen there. I can't think about it. I still have nightmares. I can't burn because I am being watched... I'm not paranoid...I am truly being watched (which isn't a bad thing). I am feeling tense and restless and I want to burn something badly. I can't so I cut. It hurt. I put peroxide on the cuts. I am crying silent tears as not to wake everyone up. It is 1 am.

My arms (mostly my right arm where there is no tat except for a semicolon on my right wrist) are sliced...yet I still feel angry. Restless. Needy.

Fuck. I'm not making sense. Sorry."
911,"Today was tough in my eyes, even though everyone else said I did great","Today was my first official day at a new job as a veterinary technician. It didn't feel real, I was trying to be positive and learn, but in the back of my mind I felt something bad was gonna happen. I can't shake the feeling of something bad happening as soon as I get comfortable.
Prior to this, I accepted a different position at a different clinic. The manager was a douche and told me I had to clear up my past because he didn't call my references until after I was hired.... so I didn't get that job.
Because of this happening, I can't seem to get comfortable in this new position. I'm so afraid and so negative all the time even though it was a good day and I learned a lot. I'm having trouble sleeping and concentrating and its really rough.
I'm sorry about my rant and grammar, but I need some reassuring vibes.
Thanks reddit"
912,Found out just now what I have long speculated- my little sister is an anorexic.,"*trigger warning* for a long time I’ve speculated that my sister is anorexic. She’s 14 and has a BMI of 18 (border line underweight). Her habits and her body just scream at me “anorexic”.  I have said this to my mother, who dismisses it. Today after what looked like a day with out eating, I decided to try something new. I logged into her Snapchat. Among all of her private stories, was one named “rants”. She has not allowed anyone to view it. But since I’m on her account... I open up the story and it says quote
 “you’re fat! You eat too much. Sometimes I just wish you’d give up. Don’t eat anymore. You’ll be happier. Hungrier. But happier” 

I know she was talking about herself from previous context clues. Then she goes on to say in the next slide

 “I’m disgusted in you. Why couldn’t you just not eat. Why’d you have to make all these bad decisions all the time. You wanna be skinny but you’re doing the opposite. You’re just fat. A fat person who can’t control herself, I’m sick to my stomach.” 

That’s all she says. But I am shaking right now. I know where this all stems from. And I know that if I uncover this, our relationship will be ruined. And if she finds out that I did this, which she might, our relationship will be ruined. I am going to keep logging in to her Snapchat to keep checking up on her. But I don’t know what to do, I’m lost, and scared. Do I tell someone? do I talk to her, if so how? Just wtf do I do, I, terrified."
913,How can i convince my mom to make me study by myself?,"How can i convince my mom to make me study by myself? I never get the time to do anything else in my free time. She makes me study 3 hours a school day with her, 5 hours a day in the weekends. She constantly yells at me when i make a mistake twice or when i dont get a problem in a worksheet. I've been beaten, got stuff taken away, and the majority of my grades are bad because of this. This has been going on since the start of elementary school."
914,Side thought,"I find it EXTREMELY odd the majority of people (society?) don’t have suicidal thoughts every day. 
Speaking for myself only: I feel everyday periodically and without reason I have strong suicidal ideations. And then I will recall at some points that this shouldn’t be standard of living I accept."
915,Folks please give me some advice,"I have a very low self esteem, I tend to criticise myself A LOT. I hate myself for the kind of person I am. How do I stop this shit? What are some things that I can do to improve myself and build my personality? How do I improve my communication skills? I really want to start loving myself unconditionally...that literally solves so many of my problems...im compulsively doing stuff that is not beneficial for my mental and spiritual growth and I just can't stop because I get my dose of dopamine from doing these things. I've lost control. My circumstances at the moment are just bad. I'm a mobile addict too.. please help me guys.I KNOW I WILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE DARKNESS. I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP."
916,No one understands,I’m young so people assume I’m stupid when all my life I’ve been through so much shit and had to grow up and be mature and responsible from a young age. It honestly makes me upset because I’m not like the other stupid people my age and I’m not just a moody teen going through something no all my life I’ve learned from mistakes that turned into bigger problems and yes I know I’m still learning about life but I’m done with stupid ass adult acting like there all that when they ain’t shit. You’ll probably think the same thing that I’m just young and don’t know about life but I know enough to understand why and how my life got fucked up and that I’m done living in this fake ass life
917,Treading Water,"First post. Yay?
I’m Bipolar type 2. This is my first episode in about 3 years which is a success in its own way I guess. It comes on the back end of a severe stomach illness where I was unable to eat anything solid for about 6-8 weeks so I survived on Gatorade and popsicles. I thought it was just the stress of being sick and trapped at home making me spiral, when I started to improve I had hope that returning to work would bring my mental health back into shape. It just made me overwhelmed and the anxiety hit hard. Now I can hardly leave the house.
The good thing is I have a wonderful SO who takes excellent care of me. He reminds me to eat and bathe so I don’t spiral further. I see my doctor tomorrow. Praying I can get back on track, I despise this hollow feeling and these nasty voices telling me how worthless I am."
918,i’m so afraid to tell people i’m suicidal,all my friends have so much going on in their lives and they don’t need the extra stress ya know. like i know in my heart i deserve comfort and love too but at the same time i just feel like i don’t deserve it. one of the only reasons why i’m still here is because i can’t stand the thought of them hurting over my loss but at the same time i can’t stand the pain of my existence. idk man. i just feel like i’m in limbo.
919,hi i am very down right now,hi i am very down right now. i got a lot on my plate i dont know what to do
920,I want to die,"I just want to commit suicide right now, i can't stop thinking about it, i hate myself i hate myself i hate my life i am in pain (emotional) and can't feel anything but sadness i single handedly ruined my life and my only chance to do something with my life, i am a disappointment to everyone who put trust in me, i just want the pain to end, i am too weak to face life anymore, i just want to die."
921,I would like some advice.,"Hey guys, sorry if I make any mistakes I don’t usually post on reddit but at this point this is the only place I can think to turn to. So I am a sophomore in high school and lately the workload has gotten to a point that I cannot handle. I have probably slept a max of four hours these past two days because of my desire to finish my homework. I usually have no problem doing so, but ever since this semester started I find it extremely difficult to concentrate; I seem to get sidetracked for long periods of time and end up doing only a bit of work at a time. It is very embarrassing for me because I find that I am having panic attacks where I cannot breathe every night because I am afraid that I am behind my peers or that I am not working hard enough, but I cannot bring myself to return to the way I was. I look at my text book and feel almost nauseous. Opening my book bag causes an immediate difficulty to breathe. I’m not sure what I can do anymore but tonight I’m doing something risky; I’m not doing my AP World History homework. When I woke up this morning I absolutely intended to stay up all night if need be until my homework was completely finished, but upon sitting down and trying to get my work done, I found that I was feeling very light headed, and I could not remember the words I had just read. I could not make any sense of what I was reading. This scared me and I laid on the ground for a bit. I considered missing school tomorrow, but I cannot do that as I have something that I absolutely must do at school tomorrow. I would very much like to confide with my teachers the problems I am having, but I am afraid that they will call my experiences excuses and punish me. Ideally, I would hope that they would give me an extension on my work, but I know that is wishful thinking. Even if I am destroying myself mentally and physically, I know that I have certain standards that I must meet. I don’t exactly know what I’m asking here, but I’d appreciate any advice or opinions. I just need to escape for a bit because it’s getting especially difficult to breathe right now. Thanks."
922,Don’t know what to do.,"So, I apologise if this goes rambling a bit, I’m just in a situation with my workplace that I’ve never been in before, and don’t know what would be best to do. 

A little background first - I’m 40, and was originally diagnosed with reactive depression when I was 27, but the GP seemed to be very much a case of ‘here’s some pills, stop bothering me’, over the years, from seeing other GP’s and mental health professionals, it’s been fully diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder following several traumas from my younger years. 

A couple of years ago, the company I worked for were intensely strict with taking time off sick, particularly for mental health, to the point that as soon as you mentioned even feeling a little off, there’s by eye-rolling, and almost interrogation like questioning about what I’m doing to get better, will I be back tomorrow, why can’t I come back now, etc - it’d get really stressful, and just make everything worse. 

Fast forward to the start of last year I moved jobs to a different company, and after 4 months had an episode which included getting very close to attempting suicide, as soon as work knew suicide was involved, their safeguarding team sent me home till I could have an occupational health appointment. In that appointment the nurse essentially said that I needed therapy to get better, the BPD is always going to be there, I could have a relapse at any time, but to minimise the impact and get the best out of me she’s recommend I don’t go back till I’ve had my 2nd therapy session. 

Work took this on board and followed everything, with me having to get therapy through the NHS I ended up off sick for 8 months, going back to work at the start of January. There’s been a couple of minor blips, nothing too major until the week before last, when I had suicidal thoughts again, and everything seemed to kick in again. I’ve been off work for 2 weeks. 

Because she’s officially classed as my carer other than the initial calling in sick, my fiancé has been liaising with my manager about everything. I was meant to be going back on Tuesday but in the morning didn’t feel right so my fiancé emailed my manager and told him she was getting me a sick note to the end of the week, but I’d probably be back before it runs out. 

Here’s where the advice side comes in. My manager has come back to her to tell her it’s all fine, but he’d expect me to stay off work till the sick note runs out, she hasn’t actually requested it yet, and has suggested that she just asks it to run out today, I go back tomorrow and essentially lie and say I asked the GP to do a new one with a different end date. 

I now feel like even though I feel up to going back tomorrow (it’d be 3 days in then 7 off), if I lie like that I’m going to feel guilty and that’s just going to make things worse, but in the same breath if I don’t go back, I’m going to feel like I’m letting people down particularly as my sick note conveniently ends right at the start of a weeks annual leave, I don’t know what’s best to do, and feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place, just any ideas from anyone on what’s the best route to take?"
923,ask for help. you deserve it.,[https://imgur.com/zog9Qc9](https://imgur.com/zog9Qc9)
924,How do I talk to my father about seeing somebody for depression?,"My father works very hard for us as a family and it seems at the end of the week he has nothing for himself. Over the years we can see he is slowly withdrawing into himself, getting more irritable, complaining and only seeing the negative. 

I came back from three months abroad and he seemed happy enough to see me but that night at the dinner table he hardly said anything while the conversation flowed between the rest of us. Then he went to bed without saying good night to anybody.

His relationship with his parents is pretty sour, long story. They’re on talking terms but everything between them is awkward. My mother and he have had their disagreements over the years including coming close to separation, now when they have an argument it’s usually over something small and he resigns and just grumbles. 

He has no friends. He lacks self control with eating people’s snacks (he’s not overweight I just mean he doesn’t have respect for what belongs to others). He uses my tools sometimes and leaves them out or breaks them accidentally. If I do that he goes fucking mental. In my opinion I think he doesn’t respect himself enough to respect others) But he works so hard. 

His relationship with my sister isn’t that great, she is heartbroken over the lack of affection shown over the years. When I came back from my trip I was press-ganged into talking to him by the whole family. Thing is though, I’ve tried in the past and he seems happy to vent but it’s the same the next day. I need to convince him to see a professional but I’m afraid his pride and financial worry (time is money) will prevent him from actually trying.

I have had mild depressive periods in my life, he doesn’t seem suicidal, just numb. In the past he has admitted to being depressed or losing interest in the things that make him happy, but I cannot help. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t want to fuck it up. I need some advice on how to get him to see somebody."
925,Scared to come off anxiety meds,"I have heath anxiety and have been taking citalopram now since July 2019. Before I started my meds I was really struggling. I had multiple panic attacks a day, if I felt my heart beat it would lead to a PA, if I saw something online about health, it would really effect me. I began dissociating and life did not feel real anymore. Flash forward to now and I feel great and like I’m ready to come off my meds, but I’m just terrified of these symptoms returning. I’ve looked extensively online and there only seems to be horror stories. I have a GP appointment booked to talk about it but I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice from experience!"
926,i dont feel safe with myself,"my mind doesnt feel stable on its own, i had a dream i went to the hospital. i felt.. safe.. there. i know its likely so very different from real life but fuck idk... our did is getting a lot worse and it always gets worse before if gets better. our whole body is in so much excruciating pain its stupid and the stress of life is getting too much

i want to be in a psych ward, just for a while, just to feel safe... but will i feel safe?

theres nowhere to go."
927,What happens if I tell my counselor I feel like killing myself because I know I am going to fail an exam?,"It seems stupid, I know, but I've always been good at school but this semester has been dragging me through the mud. I failed my first Algebra Exam (Its a college credit class) and I have another exam tomorrow that I know I am going to fail. I have been feeling awful lately and relapsed for the fourth time into my eating disorder so my brain always feels cloudy, I try my hardest to pay attention but as soon as I leave the classroom I don't remember a single thing of what was taught. I try to sit down and do my homework and study but I feel like a total moron so I pretend like it doesn't exist. I feel like I'm at my tipping point and I feel like telling someone but I feel like they will completely disregard me and act like I'm being dramatic and send me to my college class just so I can fail. I don't know if I can handle that. I don't want to be admitted to a psych ward, my family doesn't have insurance so it would HAVE to be out of pocket and we cant afford that, I just feel so helpless right now."
928,Getting better but my health has suffered,"I’ve suffered with bouts of depression since I was about 12, and have had really bad self esteem and confidence issues and such. I’m getting better now, but I’m 18 and have no idea where to even start with getting my health back on track. I don’t want to be a bother and I know GP offices are already really busy, and I’m ashamed of how long I’ve let some symptoms run (I’m pretty sure I have a skin issue now). Any advice on how to even get started?"
929,Is something wrong with me for always wanting to be talking to people?,"So growing up I met my best friend in middle school. We were friends for about 10 years and he and I were really close. During high school, we would play video games every night and we would message each other all day about random things. I was his only friend and I had other friends, but he was always my best friend and the one I looked forward to talking to.

Early last year, he found some online friends he liked to play games with. He slowly stopped enjoying all the things we did together so we just stopped doing everything we used to and I sorta felt useless. It became harder to message him and I got toxic toward him because I felt like he replaced me. We’ve since made up, but it’s not quite the same. We still message each other, but I still feel alone.

Before we made up, I met a girl online and we became extremely close. We would message each other for hours everyday and we liked the same TV shows and video games so we would talk about those things endlessly. I told her about my friend and how most of my friends sort of replace me after a while and she assured me she wouldn’t do that. Eventually she stopped talking to me and now we barely talk. We occasionally send each other pictures on Snapchat, but we aren’t as close and I miss her a lot.

After that, I met someone else online. Something drastic happened in my life so I currently go to bed 4 AM EST and my new friend is in PST so we’re usually awake at the same time. I really enjoy talking to her, but she’s the only friend I have. I don’t really have any friends at my college and she’s the one person I look forward to talking to everyday. It’s just that I feel annoying and she has a lot of friends so I feel intimidated and I don’t really think she wants/needs me as a friend.

I was thinking about trying to find more friends (well I never really stopped, but I don’t really get along with a lot of people because I’m introverted), but I’ve been told I need to be more independent. Currently I feel lonely if my friend isn’t responding and I don’t think that’s healthy or normal. 

Is it wrong to be wanting to talk to a friend a lot so I feel less lonely? Do you think I should try to work on being happier alone and if so, how would I go about doing that?

Any advice would be appreciated. I’ve been really depressed over this for a while."
930,anxiety might kill my relationship,"I have a long history with anxiety around a vast number of things... but a big one is disappointing or angering people that I love. My biggest triggers are yelling and aggressive body movements (like stomping or slamming doors), these things can literally make my flight response alert me that I’m about to die somehow (I feel so stupid for this but I haven’t healed it all the way yet.) 

I moved in with my boyfriend and his mom earlier this year and, for the first time in years, I started experiencing intense anxiety on an almost daily basis.
I find that I’m acutely sensitive to my boyfriends tones and body language — I always feel that I can tell when he’s frustrated with me, which feels like fairly often. 

Here’s what I’ve learned since moving in together: his mom is a NIGHTMARE. Quite certainly one of the most unstable people I’ve ever met and she RAGES toward her children completely irrationally, then turns around and acts like it never happens.
That being said, I can cut him a little slack and understand where his pent up aggression is rooted. And for the hand he was dealt, he is truly one of the most sensitive and patient men I’ve ever known. 

For some back context, I’ve only had one other truly serious relationship, and that man left me because my anxiety was too much for him; he cited our future children and that they deserved a mother who could hold herself together. Yea.... that fuckin hurt 

So anyway, tonight my boyfriend was acting a little aggressive and it was definitely stirring something up for me. He had already told me that he was feeling angry toward his mom, and I know the difference between what’s just a trigger for me, and what looks like it might become violent. 
But he kept saying critical things to me and expressing very obvious frustration. My anxiety came out full force... I cried, I questioned whether he’s really happy with me (because he IS frustrated toward me often and I CAN tell even if he denies it.) And then he said it... “it’s emotionally exhausting dealing with it. EVERYTHING makes you anxious. You impose your anxiety onto me.” 

In our 1 year together, I’ve checked in as level headedly as I could as often as I could that I’m not putting too much pressure on him; that he feels comfortable being honest with me.
Tonight he used the phrase “I wanted to finally be honest.” 

We didn’t break up, but I can’t stop thinking that’s because he’d feel too bad for me. I don’t want to break up, but I feel like I can’t really get past this... and I have never meant to impose my anxiety on him. I truly feel so sorry I’ve repeated this mistake and it makes me wonder if I simply cannot have a healthy relationship until my own healing process is further along... but how can I ever know when that will be"
931,Can anyone with Pure O / intrusive thoughts help?,"Since the age of about 21 I convinced myself I am depressed I tried about 6 different anti depressants with no real success, I was then given about 30 CBT sessions but came to the conclusion with the therapist I am not clinically depressed but have OCD (intrusive thoughts/‘pure O’) with some low mood and anxiety. I am 30 now.

6 months on from CBT I feel like I am struggling again I wake up in the morning and I dread what my mind is going to throw at me.. it doesn’t take long before I have a thought and run with it for the entire day, my current theme is that I am mentally unwell and I need to try out medications and go back to see the doctor but I’m worried that this is just OCD tricking me into starting the off the whole procedure again

Other thoughts I have are:
-I haven’t been truly happy since I was a teenager 
- I’m going crazy

I am also really stuck in my head all the time I find it very hard to be in the moment

I know these are really common OCD themes but I’m stuck, I don’t want to ask for more help because I’m afraid of starting the cycle again.

I’m not taking any medications at all at the moment and haven’t been for around 18 months, I’ve been reading up about combining antidepressants with low dosage antipsychotics but again I’m not sure if this is just OCD giving me more solutions to a problem I can’t solve

TLDR:
OCD intrusive thoughts for 10+ years do I got back to doctors or is it just OCD tricking me into worrying

Thanks for reading"
932,My personality has changed and it scares me. A lot. (20M),"Not entirely sure where to start, so I'll just say that for most of my life I have been an extremely confident, outgoing, extroverted and humorous person. I never had any issues with myself, felt very comfortable in my own skin and never cared much about what others thought about me.

At 18 I moved out of home and in with two other friends. It's important to note that I was quickly assumed to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy within this house, I was the smallest, most short tempered and least confrontational. I didn't realise it at the time, but looking back on the situation (currently still in it), I realise that my confidence and personality has really been stripped from me. I'm unable to directly pinpoint why this is, but It scares the absolute hell out of me. I have had people tell me lately that I've changed a lot, and the tone of their voice assures me that they don't mean it in a good way.

I find some silver lining in that I think I have become a more empathic, understanding, genuinely happy and aware person but I can't seem to socialise anymore. I get too anxious and nervous. Anxious about something I may have said, anxious about what they think of me, and it kills me when people bring up the fact that I'm different.

I guess I'm just seeking some closure, if anyone has gone through this I'd love to know how to keep my chin up and continue going on, because it ruins me and sends me into depressive episodes with awful anxiety.

Thanks."
933,Death is consuming my every thought it's all I think about it's all I can think about I try to think about other things I enjoy like politics but still my mind is flooded by constant reminders of my inevitable demise,I can't stop it. Its like a infection in my mind every tv show video I watch picture I see reminds me I'm going to die it's gotten so bad that sometimes it feels as if I'm not living like life is all a video game like I'm a passenger in my own body existing to the inevitable destination. Its not even death that I fear my mind just can't cope with the unknown of it what happens after death I don't know. And every time I try to grapple with the concept I hyperventilate and start to feel as if I'm breaking my mind.
934,I accidentally hit the right side of my head with a basketball. Now I can’t sleep. What can I do?,
935,How do you work for yourself and not others?,"All my life I've only gotten good grades to make my dad happy. Over the past two years, I finally realized (2 weeks ago) that I had been subconsciously not working in spite of my father. I can't get anywhere with my grades, the only thing keeping me up is the goddamn level of classes I'm in... does anyone know any good tips so I can just do things for myself for once?... I try but I just don't know-how."
936,My SO is depressed and I think he might be developing a delusional disorder. I need help.,"Hi there. I'll do my best to keep this short and avoid ranting, but it's rough.

My BF (37M) and I (31F) have been together for 2yrs now, he moved in one year ago. Don't get me wrong, I fiercely love that man, but honestly, he's a mess. He's never had a purpose, he just picked a random career and now he hates his job with every fiber of his body, but there's nothing else he can do for a living because he doesn't have even the smallest skill in anything else that he can turn into a job. He feels worthless and miserable.

I'm pretty sure he is depressed, even though it's not diagnosed all the signs are right there. In the last 1,5 year he changed 3 jobs, and recently I start to see a pattern. His boss is always an asshole who humiliates him all the time, calling him an incompetent flake in front of others, and his co-workers are bullying him making him feel dumb and excluded. He has had panic attacks because of this and he's visibly depressed. 

Problem is, despite changing 3 jobs in 2 years he's never been fired, he just got convinced that they were about to kick him out and applied for a new job (which he got). He says his co-workers are awful but he's been out grabbing beers with his former co-workers several times, after he resigned. Also, I know the world is full of assholes but what are the odds that the same exact scenario keeps happening all the time? 

Same thing with sex. Our bedroom is completely dead, even though we cuddle a lot, we can't have sex because every time he panics about his perfectly fine boner: he is worried that it won't last and guess what? He gets nervous and it stops working, doesn't matter how I try to make him feel comfortable. Being with him I can rule out any medical conditions, I know it's all in his head. 

Also, his family lives across the country and I don't have the chance to talk to his parents really often but I've been under the impression that sometimes he talks about them like over controlling, super intrusive parents but lately I've been reconsidering his description as well. 

So, either he is developing a delusional disorder, or he is just desperatly trying to find an excuse for his failure. Or maybe, he is so biased that everything is going to suck that when he gets a new job his attitude toward bosses, co-workers and the work itself is all messed up and he makes this happen. I tried every approach I could think of. To be only supportive doesn't work, looks like I'm allowing him to give up. Now I try to be his lucid POV and play the devil's advocate, but I don't push it too much because I don't want him to think I'm discrediting his words and downplaying his struggles. Ultimatums won't work with him, he'll just think that he is so worthless that he's been able to ruin our relationship on top of his career, so I can't threaten him about leaving if he doesn't fix this. 

He's been in therapy years ago and every time I try to bring it up he says that it's a waste of money, his problem is that he is a useless flake and no therapist will help him with this. 

I am running out of resources here, I need other points of view to be able to help him getting out of this, or at least, make him willing to do that."
937,Why am I so dependent on people,"Seriously. I feel great when I'm with people I'm close with (not strangers though, social anxiety is a bitch) but when I'm alone my mood slumps. I motivate myself by saying I'll disappoint my family and teachers if I fail. When I think of the future one of the first things I consider is friendships, but then I remember I don't have friends anymore and likely won’t let myself make new ones when I move out soon because I'm way too anxious to talk to anyone anymore. That's when I lose hope. 

I have potential with science, art, becoming a better person, but I lose all motivation just because I don't see myself having any meaningful relationships ever again. I just don't see a point in living if everything I accomplish is in solitude. I don't understand why I feel the need to have people around me at all times to feel meaningful."

940,Is mental illness a right?,"I hope this doesn't offend anyone. It's just that i feel like i'm not worthy to have any mental illness. Not that i'm a good person or anything it's just compared to other people, i had a fairly good life. Like i don't have a reason to have mental illness. Unlike others who really went through something rough causing them to be depressed or something. I feel like ashamed. It's like i'm not ""worthy."" This is also the main reason why i don't want to get myself checked. I know this sounds so stupid and i'm really sorry if i offend anyone. Just wanted to know your insights if it's okay."
941,Feelings of depression when having a cold or the flu,"Hey! I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but when I have a cold or the flu, my depression symptoms always come back. Even though I haven't had a really bad depression for a year, I always have to keep fighting it (like probably many of you on this page). And when i'm sick, it feels like i'm getting a depression all over again and it really messes with my head... Does anyone have the same problem and if so, how do you deal with it?"
942,Helping my dad with severe depression,"My dad apologised this morning for his almost bi-polar like behviour lately (sever mood swings) and that he thinks it's due to feeling depressed. He's going to see a doctor next week about it and he knows he's going to put him on antidepressants, which is something he's been fighting to get off.

He was tearing up and said he isn't sure if it's because of his recent brekaup (he doubts it since he was unhappy in that relationship), or he maybe didn't give himself enough time to heal after my mum's death, he's really unsure what it could be. He's not worried about his health or money but he's worried about my brother doing his exams or me getting a full-time job, but that stuff's normal and wouldn't affect him that badly.

He's seeking help because he knows it's not fair on my brother and I to be around him not knowing if he's going to be happy or angry and it's something he needs to get sorted out.

I'm really glad he's taking those steps to sort his probem, but I wish I knew of a way to make things easier for him.

What can I do?"
943,Working alone in an office is causing me to feel depressed,"So i have been working in an office for almost 2 years now. My boss and i are pretty much the only 2 people in the company at the moment. My boss travels all around the country, so he is barely here (except for Friday every 2 weeks). Since about 9 or 10 months ago i started to notice myself slacking, feeling unmotivated and irritated with being alone. Wich slowly turned into feeling depressed asf while at work.

I had an intern to keep me company for about 6 months, but since he had to go back to school im all alone again for 8/9 hours a day. And im only getting less and less motivated everyday. Wich is really messing with my head. 
I don't want to slack and do nothing at work, i want to feel useful. But i just cannot seem to push myself to even get out of bed in time anymore.

I really don't know what to do about this feeling. Quitting ain't an option, since i am very dependant on this job. 

Does anyone have any past experience with this? Help or advice would be greatly appreciated."
944,Started to see a new psychologist today,"I had many bad experiences to them, but this guy seems nice. I hope that this time will actually do me more good than bad. Wish me luck."
945,Im not sure what to do anymore.,"I've had this issue that really worsened around about the 9th grade, where I would lose focus, not be able to study or concentrate and get frustrated at the prospect of studying for exams or doing assignments. Well now im in my first year of university, second semester and its the worst it's ever been.

  


There are multiple assignments i completely didn't do, which I've never done before, and I'd walk up mere hours before a class to skim read the notes for a test. I have an art class where we have to submit 2 courseworks every week and every week we delay it we lose a letter grade, and it's been 5 weeks and I've only done one coursework from the first week and didn't do the others. I also have this language course where we have to write a paragraph long diary entry every week and i haven't done any of them. Among other assignments i just can't bring myself to do. Everytime i sit down and tell myself to work i just feel frustrated and angry and cry almost everytime. I've also always worked so slowly that something that i predict should take me an hour at most takes me the whole day and i might not even finish it.

  


This doesn't only happen with studying, but also with starting things i actually want to do, like drawing or reading, i just can't get myself to start them because it always feels like the time in a day passes by super quickly and im lagging behind.

  


I tried to go to a counseller at uni before but it either didn't help, i had bad experiences with either the booking or they cancel, or the counsellers were just kinda rude or standoffish.

  


I made another post on why i can't tell my mom about this either, but the gist of it is that she doesn't believe me and waves it off, as things like this make her worry and she doesn't like getting stressed.

  


At this moment in time im on a two week break, and i still want to start on my overdue assignments, as well as an english assignment that was supposed to be due 3 days ago and i didnt realise with today being the last day, but again everytime i try to type or even think abouy doing research i get frustrated and angry and anxious and cry. I don't know what to do, i don't wanna fail because my family will get mad at me but i just can't do it at all.

  


I try opening articles, I've opened so many of ""How to start studying"" or ""How to do things you don't want to do"" or otherwise, I've asked on here before and I've looked at other people's advice on websites but none of it works. I don't know what to do."
946,Scientifically Proven Methods To Reduce Stress," [**How to relieve stress**](https://www.calmsage.com/how-to-relieve-stress-and-anxiety/)? Exercising doesn’t just make you muscular but there are several ways that it even helps you relieve your stress. Take muscle building, for instance, it helps you detoxify which occurs because of inflammation and stress. When you run or ride a bike in the morning, you get a lot of oxygen and fresh air which further purifies your mind. And, also for the time you are exercising, you get to focus only on your workout which helps you divert your mind."
947,"Do I have ADD? I am seeing a psychologist tomorrow for the first time ever and I'm really nervous and anxious. I don't want to blow things out of proportion but my self destructive behaviour is just becoming worse. I'm overthinking this so much, need advice, help","EDIT: I'm so sorry for so much text, I just wrote what came to mind!! I'm kind of panicking so I just kept typing, it's all related to my title but I bet you could cut this down by 75%. Anyways, whether you read it or not and just comment from the title alone, I'm very thankful.

I don't know if I'm just mistaking depression for ADD or something but I'm so anxious and overthinking this. It feels like I'll just look like a lazy young adult male looking to get hopped up on free speed, I can't fucking calm down and I'm really nervous about seeing a psychologist tomorrow, I'm so scared I'll be ridiculed or she will think I'm overreacting, I don't know what to expect. It feels like I'll be all cloudy like I get in most conversations and forget what to say.

But my (ADD? I don't want to be disrespectful and self diagnose) has gone to the point now where I've started having extreme bursts of aggression a few times a month when I'm home alone, but it's like a switch being flipped by the tiniest gust of wind. This was *very* common for the vast majority of my childhood, and it's scary it's returning now that my issues have started making me depressed too. Like I'll drop a fucking fork on the floor as I'm eating lunch and that sends me spiralling into aggression, I'll throw the chair on the floor, start screaming about hating life and about how I can't even just sit down and focus on a simple one-page E-level assignment. I had no idea procrastination could be this brutal. Same shit in elementary school too, teachers gave me a book I could draw in because I spent lessons just nonstop drawing on tables and daydreaming out the window, couldn't focus at all. The only school work I have done what so ever all of 2020 was a simple TWO page assignment, and that only worked because I managed to get hold of illegal amphetamine which helped me quite a bit but also made me very anxious because I don't want to resort to drugs, but I just can't do anything it feels like. And it's not about motivation, my motivation is totally there, has always been. If anything my motivation can be really intense and make me super disciplined about something, I just can't direct it and it's so temporary and I end up reading a book I like or playing a game for hours on end and loosing track of time.

I don't even talk about my interests and hobbies or worries with my parents *in the slightest* nowadays because I'm scared shitless of the slightest ridicule. I pretty frequently have bouts of anxiety where my head becomes completely clouded with racing thoughts like ""why am I so weird"", ""why can't I just be normal"", ""why does it feel like everyone looks at me like a fucking alien"", ""why can't I accomplish the simplest fucking chore"", etc.

Conversations have always been hard too all my life and the depression that's been creeping in recently just makes all the symptoms worse. My mind feels pretty damn clouded most of the time in the sense that I cave in and fixate on what the person just said and what I'm going to say next so I end up not being able to think about it at all and give up so I just switch topic or say something super open which leaves conversations stale.

It's been like this all my life EXCEPT a period of about 8~ months I had two years ago in which I actually managed to do good and get good grades and get into working out. I couldn't keep that shit consistent at all, fell off all the time, but I ways managed to get back into it quickly. I've also never had trouble sleeping. Other than that this self destructive behaviour has been with me all the time. 

I read about various symptoms online and on other Reddit posts and it is scarily accurate. I am the only male in LITERALLY my ENTIRE close family who isn't diagnosed with either ADD, ADHD, or depression, which makes me even more worried.

I'm nervous and scared I either: won't get help cause it doesn't seem that bad, or I'll get too much help (like trying medication) and it'll be unwarranted because I'm blowing things out of proportion. Am I?? I just don't know, please help. My behavior sounds like ADD to me and it's ruining my life, especially school. Thanks for reading, it means a lot to me."
948,How to handle the important situation in life,"I'll give you guys a similar situation that I'm going through at an important point in my life and let me know how you'll handle it. 

The Situation

You're a drug addict. You've been an addict for drugs for more than 4 years. You wanted to quit but you couldn't. So you've decided to find yourself a passion for your better growth in mental as well as physical life condition.

You are good at painting from an early age and you chose to be a painter. You've been painting for more than two months but the thoughts to take drugs again are striking your mind. You're trying your best to stay focused on your passion and career but you simply couldn't. You're worried that it may affect your future but you're also feeling like it's better to do now than in the future. So you take on the drugs again and regretting it immediately. 

You're thinking it's a mistake and you shouldn't have taken the drugs again. You're thinking and regretting the same thing again and again and couldn't stay focused on your passion and career. You're feeling like you can't pursue your passion anymore because of these thoughts. Whatever you try to do the thoughts and regret are blocking your mind and making you feel guilty.

How will you overcome this situation?

How will you get back on track again?

How to stay positive in this kind of situation? 

How to let go of the thoughts and regret?

I can tell you guys what I'm going through if you want to know. I just didn't want to add it here and the make it a long post."
949,Should I see a professional?,"After watching a video from Chris Ulmer (SBSK) about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I saw myself identifying with the interviewer a lot. Therefore I used my old friend Google and I found that I can identify with the “9 major symptoms” or whatever of BPD. I know it’s not good to self diagnose so I was wondering, people of Reddit, should I see a psychiatrist on this matter?"
950,From no emotion to too much emotion (long),"I'll start this by saying I know I need therapy. It's on my priority list, but I don't have health insurance currently and I'm trying to get a better grasp on my financial situation.

I (26M) spent 8 years in an abusive relationship with a woman who had BPD. There is a ton to unpack there, but the summary is that nothing was ever her responsibility. Nothing was ever her fault. All of my problems were my problems and all of her problems were also my problems. 

Her poor spending habits meant we were constantly on the back foot. We never had any savings, and money was a constant stressor. I wracked up nearly 10k in debt and destroyed my credit during this relationship just trying to keep us afloat. Her personality disorder cost her job after job, which she always blamed on other people, and I worked in a stressful food-industry job making a piss-poor wage for nearly 55+ hours a week to make things work.

On top of this, her moods dictated every day. I wasn't allowed to have a bad day because my bad day would bring her down and that wasn't ""fair to her"". I wasn't allowed to break, and yet I had to endure countless nights of endless yelling and sleep deprivation. All of this, of course, was ""my fault.""

I learned to disassociate. When her yelling started I would go somewhere else in my head. It was kind of like being in the bottom of a dark well and if I looked up at the mouth of the well I could see reality, but at the bottom I was secure in this darkness away from it all. I stopped feeling a lot of emotions in general, because I was too stressed to feel anything.

Fast forward a bit. I broke up with her, got an apartment with my brother who is also my best friend, and started my life over. I'm slowly getting my finances back on track. I have a new career that is going super well with a lot of opportunities and I love it. Most importantly, I met the woman I'm going to marry.

This is the most incredible woman I've ever met. She's absolutely beautiful, she's successful, she's hilarious, she's a badass who climbs mountains and she takes great care of her body. She's sweet, and she's caring, and no one has ever made me feel the way that she does. Which brings me to the point of this post.

I have suddenly found myself becoming very emotional lately. I don't remember the last time I cried, but on Valentine's Day she wrote me this note and it was the the most beautiful thing I've ever read and I broke. Tears were streaming down my face uncontrollably. After spending so long being emotionally deprived it almost felt embarrassing to have no control over it, but at the same time it felt great. 

It has happened a few more times to smaller degrees. I was in Seattle for the first time a little bit ago and we went to this park together and sat on a hill while the sun set and I could feel it coming again. I didn't cry, but I felt that emotion swelling and my eyes began to water a bit.

Then I had a big one again this morning. I was driving to work and listening to ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" by Frankie Valli because me and my (current)girlfriend had said we are going to play that at our wedding. I was listening to it and picturing her in her dress on that day and I broke again. Tears pouring out of my face, almost sobbing. There is nothing on this planet that makes me happier.


So I guess my question is this: Is this a normal response? Is it unusual to go from a void of emotion to being overcome by it regularly? Am I just adjusting to feeling things again, or will I continue to be overwhelmed by it? 

Thank you for reading. Any comments or advice are appreciated."
951,I just want an answer.,"I crashed really badly yesterday and I'm still feeling it today. I'll always have these kinds of episodes every week spanning a couple days where I feel nothing and everything and I fucking hate it. It just feels alien and I don't want to feel like this anymore but it's so hard when you have nothing up your sleeve to even try and distract yourself and no answers to go on. I feel as if I'm too emotional at times and I hate it. I'm so fucking sensitive, I don't want to be this sensitive because it feels so shit and you feel everything and it gets too much. It just means I can snap easier and it makes me feel weak-minded. I just want an answer on why I feel like this. I'm meant to be happy, I have a loving family and a caring girlfriend who I love very much but yet I still feel like absolute shit half the week.

Everything just feels like It's crushing and pushing against me. I don't want this to go on. I'll just sit in my room not even moving or having the motivation to sit up and do something about it or try and distract myself. There just is no end, I just want to know why."
952,Desire to be famous/Well known,"First post so bare with me. I've been battling this desire to want to be famous, have a career like no other, and everytime I realise its not possible it sends me into a horrible mood that can last for a very long time. Sometimes I can't watch movies because I leave the cinema wishing I was a part of the movie, while listening to music I realise how much I want to be a musician, but then I remind myself that I have no talent and I'm too old to try.

The point is, I really want people to know who I am. The feeling of someone recognising you for something good just sounds great. I want that. 

I'm at a great university, doing a course I should theoretically love but I'm just not happy.

There's nobody I can open up to about this and it's getting ridiculous letting it hold me down for so long. So I thought I'd come to Reddit in the hope somebody would understand or listen."

I did not study for a test.It is not an important one as it doesn't go into our report cards however tests always make me feel anxious and I always seek sleep to ease me of internal tension,whatever name you want to put on it.I wanted to stay home from school on the day of the test but I did want to go as in my mind I just knew that I won't get anywhere in life if I don't face my fears head on i just needed a nudge like we all do.I knocked on my aunt's door asking for tremedol,my doctor prescribed it to me to eat when I have pain and I was in pain bc of my hip and my gums were already hurting for the last two days.I did not want my physical health to be bad when my mental health was already on the rocks.Instead of just giving my my medicine prescribed by a doctor who clearly has more qualifications than my aunt (as a doctor) she scolded me in the morning.Accused me of putting up an act and making me cry in the morning.Her yelling is hurtful because she never fails to attack point which trigger me such as ""you're faking it"",she took that and expanded it and yelled at me for 15 mins while I left my house crying.Cried to school,cried in school,sat through school and completed both my exams with my head scattered.Finally she came to pick me up and drop me home.When I reached home,I ate and relaxed because the day had me stressed because I'm human and that whole week I've had tests every single day.When she came home,she yelled at me again.Key points basically calling me useless,how she's in more pain than I am,how much of a disappointment I am and the million dollar statement that broke me ""It is all in your head,there's nothing wrong with you.Why can't you just have faith in God and push through?"" test trigger and I've been alternatibg between crying and sleeping for the last 6 hours or so."
954,Why do you always blame yourself ?,"let's say you have been abused raped bullied whatever it is, most people blame themselves and end up hating themselves to the point they would cut themselves why is this ? Why not blame the person that needs to be blamed stop blaming yourself its not your fault"
955,Panic attacks started again,"I finally started having less panic attacks since this December, but my pet cat of 10 years just recently died and I think it triggered my attacks to be worse again. I cant take a break from college so I can properly grieve even, and everything just sucks. I'm in a public restroom and I feel like I'm gonna past out or start screaming I'm freaking out so much :("
956,Women being extremely toxic to each other,"idk where to post this really but im already following this sub so i figured here would be ok also there may not be much to really add here or respond with since its not really a question just something im been thinking about


so i was talking to my friend thats in some kind of nurse school and her class is all women pretty much all i ever hear about is them being extremely toxic yelling at and degrading each other 

skip this next bit if you want to but im gonna copy paste some of the conversation here for context 

 
""and bc this dumb bitch in my program was like she isn't even your real sister, just like brandon (her adopted son) will never be your kid. &amp; i screamed at her bc she doesn't know me and she doesn't understand a dysfunctional family bc her parents are still married and everyone in her family is wealthy her parents pay her bills and all she does is wait till the last minute to study and go to the gym. &amp; fuck any man in uniform""

my girlfriend works somewhere that is also all women and comes home crying all the time for very similar stuff people being mean to her and such or will come home trying to tell me what she thinks is a funny or cool story and its basically just her being a huge bitch to some other female 

i work in construction and have had a few different jobs all have been with only men and iv never had anything close to any of these issues we cut up we laugh we buy each other food and are just generally nice to each other 

women are seen as much nicer and gentler generally but it seems to me like its definitely the opposite im most cases especially when its just groups of the same sex 

i really dont have any kind of conclusion here just ramblingd of what im thinking about i tried to talk to my friend about it but she just said it seems like that to me because men are emotionless and dont care about anything so i posted it here instead lmao"
957,Why am I so angry all the time?,"Hello everyone, 

I (20F) feel so undeniable angry and aggressive pretty much at any chance I can get. 
I feel like it’s really easy for me to get angry and stay angry and it’s become my default, like it’s my fuel and I do it so well. 
I never used to be like this but going through the education system has really just made me miserable. 
really small things like someone walking slowly or chewing loudly will put me in a bad mood and wish that person were dead. 
I’m so irritable and I can see it coming out when I talk to people and I hate that people might think of me as a rude/aggressive person. 
Why am I so angry?"
958,Anyone experienced with Oppositional Defiant Disorder?,"My boyfriend (40) and I (32) were both diagnosed with ODD as children. I've come to believe that I don't actually have it, even though we're both anarchists now. I still believe when I was diagnosed I was acting out for other reasons...long story short. 

Anyway, my boyfriend seems to actually have it. When I say, ""text me when you get home"" or ""drive safe"" or ""let's go to my bedroom"" he gets upset. Or really anything I say that is not a request and sounds to him like a demand. 

My question is, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I have tried to remember to make requests and not demands, but it's difficult to make that a habit, because 1. It wouldn't bother me if he said those things to me. 2. I'm a manager, so I tell people what to do all day long. 

Thanks in advance! It might help to mention, he is currently in therapy, I am not. I graduated from CBT therapy a year ago or so and I've also studied DBT on my own."
959,I just cancelled my plans...again,"Every week I have a regular schedule to meet my friend. She’s been on holiday for a few weeks and we haven’t met up in more than a month, so yesterday I told myself I’d go this week out of guilt, even if I didn’t want to, so I could see her (and please her). 

Well of course I woke up today and I feel dread in my gut about having to leave the house, so I cancelled it again. This is becoming a weekly thing where I tell her I’m going and then cancel a few hours before. I feel like utter shit and feel like I have to punish myself in some way because she is obviously upset and irritated about it but I’m just so stupidly tired. She says she doesn’t care if I don’t take while I’m there, but I don’t see how it would be fun to sit with me like this the entire night. 

I just needed a bit of a vent because I’m thinking of self harming or starving myself again because I feel like a bitch for purposefully messing her around. She knows about my situation but it’s not an excuse, and it’s not right that I’m now pushing away the only friend I’ve ever had. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with this guilt again?"
960,I'm really struggling with anxiety about everything surrounding me,"I've been dealing with serious anxiety for a few years now, since my early 20s, but it was mainly related to my own situation; I still have many uncertainties about life, I don't like where I am now and I don't really know where I'm going. Recently though, I've also started to feel really anxious about the world around me. Talks of an impending world war at the beginning of the year, then the current virus situation, the underlying constant climate crisis, constant economic struggles for people of my own generation and so on. I feel like I can't find a single reason to stay positive. The only thing that gives me a bit of peace is staying inside my room with my own things, but you obviously can't stay locked away forever."

962,Could anyone tell me what this is ?,"I am a 21 year old male. Back in my childhood I suffered abuse and blackmail, that messed up my nervous system. It gave me crippling mental illness like anxiety , OCD and hypersexuality and fuckload of other issues . 

What I want to know is that why do I feel so depressed on the days when I have nothing Productive to do ? All my OCD patterns come back , I become extremely sensitive, I avoid going out interacting with anybody , I feel like I look disgusting , people may mock me , my mind starts to weigh me down ? My life is going extremely great in other aspects like academically , financially . But still I feel extremely guilty , sad , anxious everyday when I have nothing constructive to do or when I do something as basic as masturbation . I wanna get rid of these masturbation phobias. Help me out people . There is ton of other kinky sicko shit that I do that I dont wish to put here."
963,Help.,"Hello everybody, 

 I've come across the mental health subreddit, along with various others, and it has further emphasised to me that I am not alone and others are going through similar stuff that I am. HOWEVER, that doesn't change my circumstances. 

For quite some time, probably around 3-4 years, I've dipped out of suicidal thoughts and general low moods, some of which can last weeks and weeks. Just to clarify I'm 18 now. Whenever my mood would peak again, I'd say/convince myself that I was just feeling a bit sad, and blame it on something going on in my life, like receiving a bad grade at school or argument with my parents etc. 

I really need some advice. Nowadays, I go through spells of feeling great, and spells of feeling worthless. A lot of the time I feel light-headed, and it is honestly the most frustrating thing in the world. I don't know why this happens. On top of this, I feel numb to my emotions a lot of the time. I feel as if I don't love my friends, family or S.O, even though in my head I know I do. 

I get annoyed while hanging around with best friends, it's like I don't want to be there. It feels like my battery is constantly drained. My energy levels are low. Always. I used to be suicidal, but now I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. 

My friends and family haven't been much help, and that's because I haven't really opened up/they wouldn't understand. I also can't control my emotions. I would always convince myself I could, but I was just choosing to act that way. However I know I really can't control them. I get emotional/cry over little things, such as my parents arguing with me. This never used to happen at all.  I used to sort of love getting shouted at lol.

My S.O often asks if I have anger issues, because when feeling low I can't be bothered with anything or anyone and lash out easily. Then shortly after I feel the utmost guilt and apologise, feeling bad about it for days. 

There is nobody in my immediate family with a history of mental health illnesses/disorders (from my knowledge). Can someone please help?

I slowly feel myself dropping into a low mood. I reckon within a week or two, I'll be depressed and numb again. I can't stop it. 

I need answers. Help."
964,Suicidal,"I am very suicidal. My bf and first everything, left me after 5 years, in december 2019. (im 21). I had to sell my/our dog, cause i couldnt afford him alone.

965,I am writing my heart out,"P.s IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY A RELATION PROBLEM IT IS JUST I WANT TO VENT SOO HARD AND DON'T KNOW BETTER PLACE TO

Please ignore my grammatical errors
 And thank you if you are reading this 

So the thing is I am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is I don't have friends, not a girlfriend. This is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends.  

There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. Now I don't know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and I want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds 

I am trying so hard to don't give a f*ck but overthinking is killing me and I am losing all my self-confidence and self-respect. 

I want to be a stronger person so I could f*ck everyone who made me feel bad about myself and made me battle through myself. 


I just want to be happy from inside and don't give a F*CK"
966,physical health making me want to kill myself,so i have terrible mental health anyway which is a different story (im dropped out of highschool because of it) but i also have terrible physical health and im beyond fucking sick of it i cant be bothered to deal with it anymore i just want to be in control for once and end it; i have a fucking shitty immune system and i have been on tons of meds and antibiotics and had so many fucking illnesses im sick of it and it makes my already god awful mental health even worse particularly now my mum doesnt even want to take me to the doctors anymore even if i have something wrong with me cause shes sick of it and its made me develop health anxiety too alongside my already long list of mental health conditions im fucking sick of being physically ill and mentally ill and fucking existing for no purpose other than to be ill
967,I don’t know what to do from here,"
I’m only 17 but i have been dealing with terrible anxiety for years now. I’ve probably been actually depressed for a year now and slowly it’s gotten worst and worst. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a year and have been on different meds for months and nothing helps. A few weeks ago I swallowed a bunch of pills, not because I wanted to die but because I wanted a break from everything. I just found out my boyfriend who was my best friend was cheating on me and i’m just destroyed. I want to die and get rid of these awful feelings but I don’t at the same time. I don’t know if i should be hospitalized or what, I have no clue what the next step is."
968,what the fuck is happening with my brain,"(sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, just the first thing I could think of)

For the past month or so my brain has more or less started to collapse in on itself and its fucking exhausting. I can tell all the symptoms but it doesn't seem to come together to anything at all in the slightest and that just makes it even worse? So I just wanna see if any of y'all have any clue about what the FUCK is happening bc I can't stand this shit. The main symptoms would probably be:

•First and foremost, I've been struggling with dissociation for about three years now, and its gotten a lot worse as of late.

•My internal monologue, which used to be active as all hell (really the best conversation I normally got haha) has been completely ghosting me.

•I don't seem to be able to enjoy anything anymore. I talk to people I love, and it feels like they're not even there. I listen to my favourite albums, and it doesn't feel like anything, just the sheer fact that music is on, with no emotional connection. I try to read, and they're just meaningless words. 

•Life in general just feels like a dream, like everything is unfamiliar, off-kilter, and not playing by the same rules it always has. Like the sky has turned purple, gravity has stopped working, and no one noticed but me

•Anything I DO enjoy doesn't connect with me. If I heard album which was a hundred times better than my all time favourite, I'd have completely forgotten it by the end of the day

•I keep waking up at 2 or 3 AM with a feeling that something is wrong. A mixture of fear and guilt and complete sensory overstimulation. And its awful.

•I have no DRIVE to talk to people, even people I love with everything in me.

•I feel completely exhausted, even if I sleep for 10 hours or more hours. Like I didn't sleep a second last night, I was running off a can of monster, and now I'm starting to crash.

• I'm just constantly pissed off for absolutely no reason.

• I've lost all creativity, leading to the worst ever writer's block, so I just feel completely unachieved.

• And above all else, I can never be satisfied with what I do in a day. Yesterday, for example, I watched a film, went out with my friends, wrote a really good piece (sometimes shit slips through the block), heard three albums, and read one third of the book I'm reading. And I'm still telling myself I didn't do a single thing and wasted everyone's time

Are these signs of anything? Are they gonna go away? Or is this just it now?"
969,I hear voices of people talking about me,"I'm a male 25 years old

Every time I walk down the street I hear people talk about me, but I know it's in my head because sometimes I think I hear them in a really loud place where it would be impossible to hear anybody, or when people are really far away and It would be impossible to hear them, but it's an every day thing, even when I'm alone I hear like short sentences sometimes they are nice and sometimes they are mean. 

I know this might not be normal, should I see a psychologyst or a psychiatrist??? What should I do???"
970,Pretty sure the only thing I've looked at in 3 months and haven't wanted to just scream at is my cat.. Fuck people,💉🧸
971,Am I The Problem?,"With events that have happened in my life, I often think, “well this is my fault I’m the crazy one, I’m the toxic one!” Looking back at all the fallouts I have had with past friends, I’ve realized now that I haven’t done anything wrong and there’s no reason for me to overthink everything and make myself feel like a bad guy. I have constant anxiety and stress on a daily basis based off the choices I have made with people I used to be friends with.

I am a very passionate person. I’m passionate for friendships, relationships, my veganism, my art, my fashion, etc; Due to my passionate personality, I am also an extremely honest person. Struggling with social anxiety since the age of 11, being 19 now I have grown to control this anxiety and to start speaking my mind. I am not someone to tell you what you want to hear. I am not someone who’s going to keep something from you out of fear that it will hurt you. I am not a quiet person when it comes to my passion for any relationships that I hold both for friends and lovers. 

I was told that I am drama from M, my best friend. It hurt me because in the moment I felt she was correct. Looking back at it now, I am not the drama. Am I considered drama because I got upset with you for doing cocaine at 18 and being fucked up in a trap house full of 30 year old scummy addicts? Am I drama because I told you that your low-life, drug addicted, piece of shit, 22 year old boyfriend cheated on you for the FOURTH time? Am I drama because I tell you what you NEED to hear and not what you WANT to hear? I'm sorry I don't enable you anymore. I'm sorry that I can't support your fucked up relationship anymore. I'm so fucking sorry that I am the ""drama"" in your life, despite everything going wrong the moment you started dating that sociopathic fuck. But still, you have made me feel like I'm the toxic one. You make me feel like I am fucking up everything in your life. I understand when I was 16-17 I made some mistakes, but for you to make me feel like I'm that person again fucks up everything that I have worked for to change. 

To H and J, the girls that fucked with my head. Why am I deemed the bad guy when I couldn't handle being friends with people who were extremely mentally unstable. Why am I a bad guy because I couldn't be around people who were enabling me to drink my issues away. I didn't have a fucking job, I couldn't apply for school, because you made me feel unmotivated, you provided me no support unless it was through substances. I couldn't handle my own mental health wasting away because I was around constant negativity. When I ended our friendships, I was told to kill myself. I was told that I'm a sociopath. I had rumours spread about me, lies that I couldn't even comprehend. I was thrown into a pit of anxiety and stress because I couldn't escape the insanity you girls hold. Still to this day, H stalks me on my social media, fucking with my head. I ran into J a couple weeks ago, and I got told that I have ""no right to make eye contact"" with her. Am I the bad guy because i wanted to be happy and I couldn't be happy around these girls, in their own fucked up way it was like they were restricting me from happiness. They were withholding me from joy, almost like they fed off my miserableness. I got insults thrown at me, stories told about me, every ounce of confidence I built up got knocked back down again, and for what? Because I wanted a better life? Am I the problem for wanting to do something with my life, for not wanting to feel like garbage anymore?

I can't seem to understand what is even going on anymore. People ghost me, people hear a manipulated story about me that emerged from anger, and suddenly I am a bad guy. Am I the bad guy though? Am I the toxic person here?

I will admit that my approach to situations is anything but subtle, I don't sugarcoat. But am I that horrible of a person? It's a constant fight in my head, a cross between wanting to be happy, but also being filled with anxiety and constantly overthinking my decisions. Please help me understand what I am doing wrong because it seems like I all I do is lose friends, but I can't pinpoint if I'm actually the toxic one or I just put myself in situations with toxic people that make me feel bad. My brain feels manipulated and vulnerable, but on top of feeling like a victim, I also feel like the offender."
972,Every Day A New Kinda Death. Hoplessness Multiplied By Cripplig Anxiety &amp; Every Mental Sickness Known To Mankind. 27M,"Hi. Forgive the way i start this. Or end. Trying my best to make sense, Life has been less than fair in the past, it continues to be so. I have not done much to improve this. Days go by, then weeks, then months. All i am doing is existing. Broken from the top to bottom. I am the poster boy for dissapointment. To put it plainly. I have zero friends (had many, pushed them away), I have fucked my finances, debt that i cant clear off. i earn far less than what i should, because i wasted alot of time doing God knows what. I have a decent job, but everyday i feel someone would realise that i am a fraud and would ask me to leave. I have real anger issues, i have hurt myself and things around me, i have tried sucicide ones last year (was in the ICU for a week or so) I live with my family (Indian System &amp; Culture) I have no bond with anyone other than what you develop because you know them for decades. except for my parents i dont even make eye contact with anyone. I run away from family gatherings, I had an abusive relationship with my brother (broke my confidence every chance he got), i have had 3 failed relationships, and my current one breaks every other day (love is not enough when you are wired wrong), i try everything, there are days when i write shit down and organize, download shit apps, read articles and then i tell myself this is it, i am gonna change things around, and then the very next hour, i am where i started, i am lazy, i dont feel like doing anything, i am overweight, i want to workout, but i cant afford shit right now. I know i am in debt, but i have no control over buying shit and then regretting, i know i am fat, but i keep eating junk. right this moment too, i am frustrated, tearing up, no confidence. always comparing myself to others. Always feeling that ill be ridiculed and caught out. That people will notice how lame or uncool or unattractive i really am. Fucked up sex life due to enormous amounts of stress, need pills just to get things going. I start off being productive then i slip somewhere, and end up wasting my time, i get so angry attyms that i could probably end my life, for a small reason as to my internet not working, i have no idea when this started, of if i ever was anything other than what i am today. Nothing can help, what people i have around me, i dont seem to connect with any, the ones i do, i push them away. I start talking and sharing shit to any human being that shows the slightest interest in my life, then i realise i overshared and that they judge me now, then that thought eats me up, so i start boasting about random shit to sound cool again, then i realise i am being fake again, so i cover shit with humour, when the person doesn't seem to laugh on any of it, i get worried that i am bad at this. Then the same old thoughts and the same old cycle. I have no idea if i made sense, i try shit, meditation, writing a diary, organizing, going for runs, but i dont seems to continue doing any of it. I am   just about done now. I am tired of searching for answers. I am tired of being like this, so fucking broken. don't want to look around and feel i suck. Dont want to feel angry, dont want to be so depressed and sad. How? How?"

I explained to my school's counselor what was going on and they'd told my family about it and told them that I needed to go see someone. My family blew up on me, berating me and essentially saying I had no reason to feel the way I do. Over the past few days I've waited for them to either talk to me about the issue, find a professional I could talk to, etc. This morning however I've been informed that they've pulled me out of my school, are refusing to let me see a professional, and will not be enrolling me into any other schools... So guess my life is over because I wanted help."

No matter what I do everyone always leaves me, not because they're bad people but because I'm insufferable. I've never caused anything but harm to others.

I’ve been able to recognize it since at least age 18. One week I’ll feel intense amounts of motivation and confidence. It’ll be borderline overwhelming. I don’t want to sleep because all I want to do is grind and be my best self. I’ll come up with all these amazing ideas for my future and how to work towards them. I’ll suddenly be going to yoga and to the gym often. There’s been a few times where I’ve splurged money into something that I actually cannot afford, but I do it because I’m not thinking clearly. Then suddenly, I’ll wake up and I’ll be wildly depressed. Often suicidal. Looking into my journal, there is numerous entry’s where I even go as far as writing suicide notes and how I could kill myself. I feel guilty and sad and worthless. And it seems like absolutely nothing can get me out of that funk. It’s such a horrible feeling. Then suddenly, after a few days to a week or two, I’ll get a wave of motivation and I’m on top of the world again. I feel so good that I don’t even care about how wildly depressed I just was. I think “I’m okay now. I don’t need help. Because that feeling was temporary and I’m good now.” And the same cycle will continue. Sometimes I do feel fairly neutral in between these bouts of extreme emotions, it’s not always such extremes but very often it is. I’m so sick of it. I just want to stay motivated and happy but it always disappears.

This incident had happened one other time shortly after beginning the meds, so I believe it’s just a side effect. 

A stomachache woke me up last night. I’m a recovering emetophobe (phobia of vomit) so I tried to breathe deeply. But a rush of nausea overtook me, so I went outside on my back porch to get some fresh air, and to throw up if needed. 

The next few minutes I was trying to fight against my own rioting body, feeling trapped as it stiffened and trembled and I had trouble breathing. I took a few hits of a CBD vape pen I bought for both anxiety and chronic pain, and it worked. But I woke up feeling unrested and dissociated from reality, and just feel exhausted. Deep down I know that having occasional grapples with mental health and everything that challenges it doesn’t make me crazy, but it’s hard for me not to feel crazy sometimes when things like this happen."
985,Does anybody get anxiety over this coronavirus outbreak?,"It is starting to spread everywhere. While I am a young and healthy individual, I am terrified for older members of my family."
986,I was in a mental hospital last year for a week for a suicide attempt. I feel much better now but a memory just resurfaced.,"I feel a strange urge to post this. It just came on really strongly and I need to get it off my chest. I'm going through a bit of a rough time, mentally, right now, though improving. So it's not surprising I'm thinking of past mental crisis.

When I was in the psychiatric ward last May for a suicide attempt, I hadn't had my anxiety meds for a whole day. I was stressed. I ended up being there for a week and it helped immensely. 

One of the nurses was understandably stressed, and accused me of running to the head nurse to complain about not receiving my medicine fast enough. I hadn't done this. I was told to wait, so I went to my room, having a panic attack. 

The head person came in to the room and asked what was wrong. I told her I was waiting, and she took me up to the front. This actually happened twice, but was cleared up both times.

I snapped at the nurse. Not hugely, but I slammed my fist on the desk, yelled I hadn't done it, and used the f-word.

I have never yelled at medical person in the 11 years I've had anxiety. This was wildly out character for me.

I immediately backed up, hugged myself and apologized. She might have been short and incorrect, but she didnt deserve to be screamed and cursed at.

She was much more patient afterwards and was very kind. I apologized again the next day, but she seemed okay with it.

I don't know why I feel a need to post this. During my stay, there were a lot of great nurses, including the one in my post. They were under a lot of stress. I'm not mad anymore about being accused. I wish I hadn't been, but I understand why she said that, and why I reacted the way I did. They had a lot of patients going up multiple times. Including my roomate. I get it.

I guess I'm posting this to say give yourself a break if you have a momentary freak out. And maybe don't accuse patients of doing something they didnt, maybe ask them first. I dunno. It's a tough job, and mistakes happen."
987,Adjustment disorder,"I was just given this diagnosis, and was wondering if anyone else has had it or gone through it?"
988,has anyone had success treating chronic depression/dysthymia,"ive been medicated for 6-7 years, 3 different med combos (first zoloft, then zoloft + welbutrin, then cymbalta) and seen a therapist for probably about 60% of that time. It just keeps coming back. It doesn't matter what i do, as SOON as the world changes slightly for the worse around my my brain goes absolutely haywire and I get so depressed. honestly it doesn't even have to change for the worse it just has to change. 

Anyways. I recently moved and so of course I'm depressed now. Going to see a psych later this month. but (and i know some of this is the depression talking) I am feeling more and more hopeless as the years go by and the depression keeps coming back. I feel like I'll never not be depressed. I'll just have a few brief moments of normalcy while my meds work and then as soon as something slightly stressful shows up, my meds wont work anymore and I'll be depressed again. 

has anyone found something that works? for the record I know I'll hear exercise and sleep so-- I have a great sleep schedule, mostly because I have a sleep disorder. I am medicated for said sleep disorder, and to my knowledge my sleep is now pretty good because I have very few symptoms. But, I get 8 hours every single night except once in a blue moon. As for exercise, I have struggled to find any motivation to do so but right now I'm running like 4 times a week. It does not make me feel better and never has, even when consistently working out. I do it because I know I should but it has never made me feel less depressed."
989,The problem with failure(s),"There are countless ways to fuck things up, and only a handful to make it right. I didn't set the rules and didn't want to play the game, yet here I am.  

That's how most of us going through difficult times deal with the world. You try for years, fail for a moment, and that is what turns your life around. Over and over again, the pattern happens. It just feels like a downwards spiral.  

This is in fact the convergence of two things:  
- we forget to acknowledge all the other little moments that led us there, all the little victories and things done right that the world takes for granted and we learn to take for granted too  
- when a hardship eventually hits our weakest point, we are so tired that we give in: mental disconnect, self-destruction, violence, and so on  

Keep that in mind. Improve at both things, and fail again just a little bit less painfully next time. Fail better, because if this is bound to be a gigantic failure anyway you might as well have a joyride and get good at it and give a big Fuck You to whatever decided you had to exist.  

To these two things I reply:  
- Acknowledge the little things of life, the beauty of a moment, an action. Call it a distraction from pain if you want, but enjoy it nonetheless. You're going to feel fully the pain, why not try to feel fully the good times. Neither is a given, neither is deserved or undeserved. It just happens, and you definitely eat up the bad part already.. so you pretty much owe it to yourself to get the good too  
- When shit hits the fan, learn to take a metaphorical step back. A breath is often enough to be a good start. Closing your eyes. Anything that stops the onslaught of the moment from turning the rain into a storm and the storm into devastation for yourself and others. 


Today another hardship hit. Big one, in a stream of big ones. Of course I'm exhausted, of course I'm not owed anything. Initial thought? End this life right now. Or self-destruct in a shitty way. Maybe hit the wall with your head until there's no wall? Or a high jump? That seems all very appealing.  

I closed my eyes for a brief second, and that second was a separation from the 'me' who is ever so good at responding to pain with pain. It's all it takes, a second or a breath, to let that timeline wither away.  

The one that's left is feeling the pain all the same. **It's not easier to get better**, most people won't understand that. But the one that's left is taking that step back to make a better step forward today or tomorrow.  
I came here and wrote this. Maybe I'll help out someone if I know anything useful to them. I feel pain all the same, but the biggest Fuck You I can give to that pain is hoping I can turn someone else's into something a tiny bit less worse at least.  

That's my rant of the day. Whoever you are, reading this, I feel you. You didn't set the rules either, might not want to play the game either. But you can let the other you wither away, gradually with each breath. I wish you well."
990,I might be able to talk to a therapist but I have no idea what to say,"So I have a chance to either go speak to my school psychologist tomorrow or book an appointment for later but... It seems so scary. I can't just go in and say I want to die and don't see anything in the future. I can't say how horribly I've failed as a person and how all my friends hate me because I was a burden and then cut ties with them. I don't feel comfortable letting a stranger know all this. 

Maybe it would be easier if I had a steady therapist instead of simply going to vent to a school psychologist but I don't have the resources right now to seek constant therapy. Where would I even start if I really could muster up the courage to speak to someone? My mind is such a mess and I feel embarrassed just thinking of speaking about it to someone. And I'm still not sure yet if I even deserve the help."
991,Why bother?,"Nothing I could talk about with others seems interesting, no game appeals to me anymore, and I feel some kind of hole inside of me. Is this normal?"
992,Celebrating 6 months since I stopped cutting 🥳,Yay
993,Am I just toxic?,"i have literally no sense of self like since september ive tried to reinvent myself maybe 3 or 4 times and i always hate what i percieve to be my identity

i cut without any real reason for cutting and i never feel pain after, just emptiness

i have tons of “friends” but only like 3 people i trust and every relationship i have goes from loving to hating to loving to hating

i can have so much rage and anger and i lash out so hard so easily

i get hyper attached to friends like super anchored to them and my biggest fear is abandonment like any time i have an argument i will cry because i think ive lost someone

maybe im just abusive"
994,Procrastinating when I'm excited to do something,"Why is it that when I want to do something, say watch a movie, I can't because I want to? I really enjoy movies and tv shows and not as just a pass time kind of thing, but when there is a tv show that I really want to watch I end up not being able to and putting it off. I have dreams about how badly I want to watch it and yet when I wake up all I can do is think about it. It's like I'm really excited about it and the excitement overwhelms me to where I can't actually get myself to press play."
995,Looking for advice on how to continue living and moving past issues( i want to live my own life and not be a reflection of my past anymore)[21 M],"I have a lot of adversity to the mislabeling of ""mental health issues"". I mean my dad has a pretty severe case of bipolar disorder and nobody ever acknowledged it until few years ago when he had to be hospitalized. Everyone thought my dad just had a very loud personality accompanied by anger issues; but recently its gotten to the point where its just pitiful- like waking everyone up at 3am in tears saying ""I need to tell you all something"" and he gives a few hours worth of pretense to what he's about to say but never quite gets to the point and blames it on us for not being receptive enough. And it's such a hard place for him and I love him and feel sorry for him but also like, im 21 and my sibilings 24 and this is supposed to be the prime of our lives but every time i come home im on egg shells. I feel bad that my sibiling still lives with him but hes afraid to move out bc of what my mom would end up like living alone w my dad.

Im so pissed off! I wish I could leave my two parents together and rest assured that no violoence will take place but thats never been the case. On any given day, ill hear a terrified yelp in my moms voice screaming my name and have to run down to see their room in pieces with my dad standing over my mom. We moved houses 13 times growing up. Not like my parents travel for work but more like they split up 6 times and got back together 7 times.

Growing up, he would go on for 4-5 hour 'lectures' *as we called it* when we got in trouble. Now looking back I realize that isn't a normal way to raise your kids, that's a textbook symptom of BPD. He would remind me as a kid that i am not my own person but a propogation of himself. 

Most of all, I hate who this turned me into. I've always been a *weird* kid with terrible social skills. I remember my dad asking me in 4th grade, ""what happened to your spark you used to be such an expressive kid?"" IDK dad I lost that shit! IDK who i am or why my life is the way it is. Even as a kid i would fantasize about sitting infront of a therapist and telling them everything thats been going on at home and for that imaginary therapist to just say

""its not your fault, none of what youre gooing through defines you""

What do i do now? as an adult i still have anxiety. On one hand i feel very smart and aware about some life issues most people never have to confront in their whole lives. But on the other hand, i wish i couldve had a better childhood and i hate the way I handle myself in relationships and see a reflection of my dad in that. 

If I ever raise children myself, Im going to make sure they never question their own identities. They deserve to have a childlike naivity and not deal with strange stressful living situations."
996,Developing a weepy problem...,"I've been taking medication for anxiety for a long time. I just started taking a new one. My mom broke her leg a few weeks ago with me walking with her, and went to the hospital. I cried the next morning. Ever since then, I've developed a weepy problem. I feel like crying every night, even though I don't quite cry. I'm also in a new country, and feel a overwhelming sadness since my 33rd birthday, which is also due to lack of progress. I am also a virgin. Does any of this have to do with my new habit? "
997,Struggling with bipolar diagnosis,"(24, F) Growing up my family treated mental illnesses as a very taboo thing. When I was 16 I told my mom I was depressed, and she told me that she was going to put me in a crazy house if that was the case. So I didn’t talk about it, and eventually three years later it started to subside. I got diagnosed with severe anxiety at 20, and started taking medication and therapy for it against my moms wishes. Now at 24, I am having an incredibly hard time. I go from happy to sad, to incredibly angry; with really no warning. I know that I am being irrational, but I cannot stop myself. I thought that I was just stressed and that maybe my depression was coming back, since I’m sleeping all the time now and have no motivation. But, I went to the doctors this week and after an evaluation they diagnosed me with Bipolar 2. I don’t know why, but I am taking this diagnosis much harder than my previous ones. I think I am worried that people will not want to be around me if they know I am bipolar. Has anyone else ever experienced this feeling around a diagnosis?"
998,im struggling,im really struggling at the moment my anxiety has been through the roof but ive not told anyone how can i tell someone that am struggling with anxiety am to scared
999,How to not hate myself?,Does anyone have any advice on how to stop thinking you’re a fat ugly piece of shit. I know it’s my mental illness and I can’t figure out how to be... better at all
1000,Why do I do this?,"So I'm not sure if this is triggering but here's a pre-warning for selfharm (I guess?) just in case.


When I get really sad or angry (when I get into a state of sadness where I'm like sobbing I then get extremely angry at myself and vice cersa so one doesn't really come without the other) why is it I start punching/ thumping myself in the head or hit my head off of walls? I really struggle to restrain myself when I feel the urge to do it, like sometimes I will be a sobbing mess and be walking around my house and just headbutt a wall. I just really want to know if the only person who does this and if anyone has an idea as to why?"
1001,study abroad,"Hi anyone here who had been or currently studying abroad specifically Malaysia. If there is, can we talk at private, i need to ask some question about my application."
1002,Is it selfish to leave behind a toxic life with a parent that has a mental illness?,"I don’t want to get too in detail but my mom has several diagnosed illnesses, and it’s been taking a toll on our family before I was even born. Although, I’m not too sure on the background of why my family is so toxic. It’s complicated. Anyway, I really want to leave. I’m 20, a full time student and working, but I’m afraid of looking at the one that chickens out because everyone else stays. I have siblings and we’re all pretty much adults. Im not sure why they’re still sticking around though when they could leave and live their life and out their happiness in front of them for once. I’m afraid I’m the only one that looks at it in that way. I have trouble wanting to live so how am I going to get through a life I don’t want to live? Maybe it’s selfish of me to look at it in that way, I don’t know :("
1003,I’m heartbroken.,"I’m 19 I’m a Virgin and I’ve never felt love before. I’ve been rejected or never given a chance. I want to be able to hold a girl and tell her I love her. Forget sex and all of that bs. I’ve always wanted real love. But unfortunately I’ve never come close to finding it I feel. No matter how nice I am I’m never accepted or loved back. I love but they turn Away and sleep with others or their ex’s. I feel like such a selfish pos for writing this too. I’m already massively depressed and lonely but this on top is just too much. I’ll never find love. I’m left alone screaming “why”? “What makes them so special? Why do they get to abuse and manipulate people and they get love”!? But someone like me who would honor and love their girlfriend or wife, is ignored and rejected. I’m just a emotional broken mess. I can’t fix myself either, I go to the gym regularly but that still does nothing. In fact nothing really brings me any genuine joy anymore. No therapy or meds have helped either. I’m so alone and sorry."
1004,Should i tell my psychologist about homicidal thoughts?,"Ive had them since i was around 14. Usually when I’m angry annoyed or in a certain headspace. I enjoy having these thoughts when I’m in that headspace but I’m completely different in a normal headspace and wouldn’t hurt anyone. I wouldn’t act on these thoughts but they’ve been increasing more and more and I’m afraid it will get to the point where I’m homicidal. Im afraid to tell my psychologist because I’m always seen by adults as nice,probably don’t seem that nice from this post but I actually am i just have problems which I’m working on, and I don’t like telling her things like that because her opinion of me will change. Will telling her about this be important and help with getting a correct diagnosis or is it ok left unsaid."
1005,Is there a name for this symptom? Similar to Deja Vu,"I recently I've had been experiencing something odd that I'd like to identify,  If it's an actual potential issue. 

Background:   pretty intense ADHD, take adderall for it,  take Ambien for sleep.  Pretty strong anxiety but no medication for it.

Usually when I'm working from home,  I've got some shows playing next to my work monitors.  Twice in the last week,  I've experienced this bizarre thing where I'm working while a show is on,  so only half paying attention to whatever is going on in the show.   On two separate occasions,  I've had it happen where the episodes are ""out of order"", and I distinctly remember an episode being played previously, as if I dropped a stack of pages and picked up with a few pages out of order.   Normally I'd chalk this up to a software glitch,  but once was on Netflix,  once was Kodi.  I wasnt fully watching,  so I can't be 100 percent certain,  but it's much stronger than a feeling.   Like,  I'm worried if my brain/ memory is placing things out of order.   I struggle with organization and short termed memory things to begin with,  so this was extremely concerning.   Maybe I'm being overly cautious,  but if it's the beginning of something,  I at least want to know to look out for something"
1006,Are Disorders common? Or are they just personalities?,"I just got screened for the first time due to being in a rough spot trying to figure myself out and I essentially got screened to have 

Major Depression Disorder 100%

Manic Episodes 67%

Bipolar Disorder 100%

PTSD 79%

Generalized anxiety disorder 80%

&amp;#x200B;

And what gets to me the most is the manic episodes. I can actually reference these episodes in my daily life and now I kind of just feel like shit because all these times where I told myself I'm going to fix my life, AND actually did something towards that goal, was all just me being a slave to my own mind...

&amp;#x200B;

Are they really disorders? Because I feel like these are normal in people, no? Its our personalities that are being shaped due to the environment surrounding us, of course if someone gets dumped like garbage in a long term relationship they won't just be robotic and shrug it off."

1009,Doctors won’t call back,"I’ve been trying for a long time to get a new psychiatrist to see for meds. My last doctor retired and so I’m on my last prescription. Some doctors say they’re taking new patients and still don’t call back?

I called one place and everything was good- they have multiple doctors. The scheduler called after I gave her all my info but I didn’t catch it. I tried to call for a week after and she never picks up so I texted and finally got her. She said she’d set me up with someone and they’d call me to make the appointment.

A week goes by and nothing. I text her again yesterday (after calling a bunch) and she says sorry and that she will check right away and still nothing? 

I’m worried.. they know it’s time sensitive because I’m running out but they’re just like not... lol I’m scared. I’m doing horribly and I’m actually reaching out for help and getting none"
1010,A friend distancing herself from the world,"I have this good friend who has been distancing herself from the world from almost 6 months I think, and I’m really trying to help her get back into the world coz I’ve been in the same spot a year ago. And no matter what I do she always make some kind of excuse. There was this one time where I texted saying I would kidnap her sometime that week and she was actually pretty excited about it but then when the day came where I texted her to get ready she all of a sudden got sick and couldn’t come, she’s also stopped working and talking to any of her friend from school. And at this point I really don’t know what to do anymore"
1011,Should I flush the ring he gave me?,This guy and I that I have known for two years have spent time together every day this week and last week. I usually spent the night at his house and we had sex a lot. I texted him and asked him if he wanted to hangout tonight. He told me he can't because he has to go to his parents' house tonight. I just feel so sad and hurt and I don't know what to do. I feel like throwing the friendship ring he gave me on my birthday in the trash or flushing it. I'm 25 and he's 29.
1012,I hate my home,"I’m 21 (almost 22) and haven’t finished my degree at all. I’ve been on and off community college since 18 and have such a low gpa. I’ve been working the same fast food job as a regular team member for the same amount of time. Idk what’s happened lately to me but despite feeling suicidal and hopeless, I chose to leave my job in pursuit of something better. I even started going to the gym again and it’s hard to maintain a habit of it. I stopped eating out and started saving my money too. I don’t see the fruits of my changed behavior yet because I still feel pretty fucking worthless but I know the fruits are there and blooming. 

Now, I’ve concluded that my depression stems from home. My parents have argued so much throughout my life. I’ve always seen my mother in a negative aspect. I’m not affectionate to her and we argue constantly although not so much now the older I get. She would (and still does) hit herself with her hands or wall, throw things when angry, yell at my face or anyone’s face, says that it’s better to not have friends and not trust them, never truly praise me and thought negatively when making mistakes at school, work, etc, and always assume something bad would happen if I left home or make life decisions. She is a really nice person with others but very tough with my upbringing and my sister’s too. A lot of her behaviors have reflected onto me more than my little sister (which I’m so blessed for bc I wouldn’t like my little sis to feel the way I feel). I’ve done many of the things above, being more violent than my mom.

We just argued. My little sis (15) and I don’t have the best relationship and the argument stemmed from my sis’s friends being over last night. I got home late and the dishes were left dirty and the table was a mess. I chose not to clean it up. This morning, my mom was cleaning up and asked for me to finish it. I refused simply because I wasn’t responsible for my sister’s irresponsibility. My own mother started yelling how she feels alone and how she does everything. She said I was almost 22 and haven’t done anything in my life which is true. But it hurts because it’s the same topic again: me. She never understands how fucking hurt I am inside. She doesn’t understand my current depression that makes me not want to do anything. She doesn’t understand that I’m also tired of cleaning up after everyone. She doesn’t understand that it’s ok to refuse to something you’re not responsible for. At the end of these stupid fucking arguments, I’m left feeling worthless again and I’m reminded that at almost 22, I haven’t accomplished anything in my life. I work a minimum wage part time job (my new job is still min wage but better) and she doesn’t understand I can’t make ends meet at times. I’m a fucking slave living in this home to get an “education” even though I’m slowly correcting my past educational mistakes to boost my gpa. I’m trapped in a home unable to get a car and the car I do have is under my parent’s name. I’m trapped in a home that leaves me depressed and makes me cry every single night. I’m stuck in life and I’m slowly trying to get out. I absolutely hate living home."
1013,Colors seem brighter,I’ve been very stressed over the past few weeks. My trimester in school is ending so teachers have assigned a tone of work due this week and can’t be turned in even a day later. My boyfriend has also had a super hard time finding motivation for anything and can almost never sleep( I made another post about it). Today was the last day of the trimester so there was no homework due today and we have tomorrow off and a school trip all of next week so no homework at all. My boyfriend has been taking new medication for his sleep problems and it’s working. He’s also been talking to teachers after school and getting help. With all the stress being relieved at this very moment i feel so good. I looked up at the fan in my room and saw that is was colorful. It’s always been rainbow but the colors just seem brighter than they have lately. Then i looked around the room and all the colors are more vibrant. It sounds like i’m making stuff up or i’m using a metaphor or something but everything actually seems brighter. I don’t know if it’s related to the stress being relieved but I like it.
1014,How to get tested for depression in secret,"For quite a while, I've suspected I may be depressed or bipolar.

1015,Quick question,"I've had this problem for several years now and would like to know if anyone else experiences it/understands what it is.
I've been suffering from a voice in my head for as long as I can remember that will repeat whatever I hear, say or think in a voice I cannot describe but gives me an extremely intense feeling of vertigo. I can't think of anything that could cause it and it happens on and off rather than being there permanently. I'm almost 15 and have had about a years break from it but it returned recently and I'm in a much better state of mind to ask about it openly, if you need more information I'm happy to provide whatever I can."
1016,"Getting creative is a great way to ground yourself in the present moment - whether starting something new or returning to an old hobby, picking up a paintbrush, guitar or pencil can bring calmness to your life","I had a talk to a friend of mine about how [being creative](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Be-calm--be-happy--be-creative-Other-Voices---Dr-Lauri-Bower-eb8ot9) has made a difference to our lives.

1017,Just venting because I cannot sleep,"Hello Reddit, I feel that therapy is not working for me. I am trying to be mindful and healthy. However, it is not getting easy and I read in a self-compassion book that it is supposed to be hard specially if it is working. My head is spinning because of what my brain keeps telling me. It does not stop telling me how bad I look and how terrible human being I am being when I fuck up. Today I have been having a horrible episode and it was stressing me during work, but I pulled through it. I am very dependable on emotions and love and I have been working to making that all independent and to love myself but that task is taking a lot of my energy and at the end of the day I am just exhausted mentally and physically somehow. I realize that you might see how scattered my ideas are and that's because that's my brain literally throwing a lot of dilemmas at me at once and I have to deal with them which put me in an unfavorable place. I'm seeing an old friend tomorrow and I hope that I won't be showing a bad side to him. Send me prayers a lot of them it is getting harder and harder to deal with this life. God have mercy on us all. Goodnight."

Has anyone else had surgery and felt super bad mentally?"
1019,"Contemplating suicide because of my laziness and procrastination, and I can't do seem to do anything about it.","I'm 18M from Russia.

Last year, I basically failed my biology exam(technically I just barely passed but no way any university that requires biology would accept me with that result even with good results on other exams) because I haven't studied at all and biology is not a subject you can take lightly in my country, unlike Russian, English and social studies where I haven't really studied specifically for the exam for the most part(there was also a compulsory maths exam but its difficulty was a total joke unless you are doing the non-compulsory part of it).

Anyway, I finished school with most of my exam results ranging from good to very good except for biology, which my parents weren't really all too happy about, and neither was I, but I coped pretty well and didn't stress out too much about it even when I inevitably didn't get accepted into a universtity that I was hoping to enter. I figured I'll just try to take a biology exam next year, **actually study in advance** and everything will be fine.

Oh how naive I was in thinking that I would actually study for the exam. I'm currently slightly less than a month away from my second try at the exam and I barely studied yet again. I hate myself for not being able to just sit down and study for god's sake. My parents stress out over me not studying, and I hate myself yet again for making them worry about me so much, but everytime I try to actually sit down and study I either procrastinate or study for a bit and then go watch YouTube videos or something. This cycle repeats until it's too late and I have to go to bed.

You're probably thinking that I lack the motivation to even get a degree in the first place and that might be true, but at this point I want to do a decent job on the exam not even to get into a university, but to prove to myself that I can actually be productive. You see, I'm not passionate at all about university and maybe pursuing something that I'm actually sort of passionate about that doesn't   
quite require a degree(writing, becoming a youtuber) would've been wiser if I can't even study for an exam, but I'm afraid that I can't become a writer or a youtuber while being such a lazy person. FFS, I wanted to become a writer for almost a year now and I still haven't written the first page of my fantasy book. I'm afraid that I can't do anything productive, and if I can't even study for an exam, then how am I going to write a book or start a YouTube channel?

And so, after a mental breakdown, I decided that if I were to keep being unproductive and subsequently fail the exam because of that, I would kill myself. It was an impulsive decision, and I tend to ignore such stuff later most of the time, but I don't think I'm going to be able to ignore this decision so easily. It seems silly to kill yourself over education, but I think this is a problem of self-actualization rather than just education, since I basically stand to inherit my father's passive income(he's a landlord among some other stuff, basically he made sure he wouldn't be dependent on the meager pension that the government pays him) and I won't have to worry about income that much unless I royally screw up, which means that I can basically continue to be a jobless, uneducated parasite on society who only plays video games and doesn't contribute to anything. Would've been a dream way of life for some, but what's the problem about this other than maybe an ethical one?

The problem is that I *do* want to become a writer and *do* want to become a Youtuber, but can't even get myself to study for an exam and haven't written anything yet, let alone recorded a video. My original plan was to force myself to study and somehow magically fix my laziness by doing that and start on writing after the exam, but you can see how that plan worked out. If I can't even study, then how can I write a successful novel or make a decent video? To me, the point of living is not living, but actually accomplishing something and how can I do that when I can't bring myself to do anything other than playing video games, browsing memes on Reddit and watching educational videos on YouTube, reflecting on how very smart I must be getting by watching them.

So what do I do about it? I haven't been to any therapists nor taken any medication. If this continues, I might actually commit suicide to save myself from the shame and stress of failing an exam a second time because I've had enough of stress-induced mental breakdowns and stress is only going to get stronger if I fail again."
1020,Call me,I'm struggling with thoughts and text doesn't in any way translate what I'd say if I were to narrate what's inside my head. I need someone to talk to me in real time to even attempt to seek help. Help me.
1021,I’m an asshole to everyone around me and I hate myself for it but cant stop,"The smallest things make me so angry and I feel so justified in my annoyance that it’s impossible for me to let things go. for example today I was in the car with my mom listening to kid cudi’s Day n Nite and my mom says to me “I hope you don’t relate to this” and that one comment has ruined my day. It made me so mad cause first of all obviously I fucking relate to it or else I wouldnt be listening to it, and beyond that when I first started listening to kid cudi what I loved about him was that I related to it so much. So for her to say such a stupid and unnecessary comment like that it implies that my feelings are wrong or bad and I shouldnt relate to something I do relate to, it makes me very angry. Little comments like this happen in every single conversation I have cause someone says something small and meaningless but to me I find it so insulting. I cant help but either say something rude as fuck or just glare in silence at them. then afterwards I hate myself so much for it and get so depressed cause obviously the people I talk to aren’t intending to offend me, to them it’s just a regular conversation and suddenly I’m pissed at them. so it’s completely unfair for me to treat other people this way with no explanation but im too mad to let things go or explain why it bothers me. plus so many things set me off that it would be impossible for someone to talk to me successfully. I’m stuck in this loop of getting angry then feeling guilty and I honestly do not know why anyone still puts up with me. I’m just waiting for the day when they’ve had enough and everyone i know tells me to permanently fuck off"
1022,This is a vent // please don't take it too seriously,"I don't think there's anything in this world for me.

I've been feeling suicidal on and off since I was five years old. I'm 20 right now. 

The emotions I feel the most are anger, fear, and apathy. My head feels like it's about to explode and I am so sick of being alive. 

I went to a crisis center a few days ago and left after 18 hours. I hate places like that. The only times I don't feel anxious are when I'm very drunk or when I'm alone. I hardly ever leave my room after my roommate gets home from work. Places like the hospital make me feel like I'm losing my mind even more. 

I feel like I'm a narcissist and abusive to the people around me. They all tell me this isn't true. I hate talking about anything related to myself because immediately after I feel like I've said too much and have confirmed my narcissism. 

I think it's very likely I have DID/dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) or if that's not what I have then I'm probably just psychotic.

I can't sleep, I've been losing weight and I can't bring myself to care enough to try to eat more. It doesn't matter anyways because I dont have enough money to feed myself enough. I don't have enough money for therapy either. I get SSI and food stamps and that's my only source of income. 

My bf smokes and drinks all the time and my roommate is a borderline alcoholic. I don't think this living situation is helping me, but I have no where else to go. And I care about them, I don't want to leave them. 

Everyone tells me I should keep trying and get help. The kind of help I need costs money that I don't have. I already have a lot of debt. 

At this point I feel that it won't be much longer before I end up dead. I'm tired of pretending like everything is and will be fine. It's not ever going to be good for me. My brain is fried and I don't want to continue with this sad pathetic life."
1023,terrified,"Probably going to get help, what kinds of questions are they going to ask me? If I tell them I have a plan/resources to kill myself are they going to hospitalize me? I don't want to go to a hospital. I live in Canada."
1024,Why me?!,"I wouldn’t say I had the toughest life on the planet and I already know that , but mental health makes you feel like you are already at the end of the world . My whole world kinda just stops and I’m worried about where I will end up . The thoughts that go through my head and the things I do to get them thoughts out are awful and I hate doing it , mental health has gotten the best of me and sometimes I feel like I can’t go on , we are three months into a new year and I could say I’ve have been in hospital more than I would normally in a year which is bad. Being in hospital and seeing my parents faces is the worst because knowing I’ve failed and not bringing myself back up is hard enough especially when they don’t understand , I just want someone to talk to ☹️"
1025,My $2500 hospital visit makes me want to kill myself.,"This past week I went to the ER after extreme dehydration. I had the signs of stroke but im only 28. I had been working out at the gym on a freak-warm day and had pushed myself probably past my limit. 



I went to the ER just to have things checked out and the doctor ordered a CT scan. I was still dehydrated after drinking at home and they wouldnt give me water after asking. I got the CT done and after they finally gave me water I started to think clearer and realized I should have just gone home, I was fine, and now I have a risk of Cancer down the road. 


Now I have to deal with this, emptying my savings and explaining to my parents what happened. I can't focus at work and im paralyzed with anxiety and fear. I just want to die..."
1026,Opinions on how to react to this please??,"Myself, my boyfriend and our flat mate (also a friend) were just having a conversation regarding mental health. 

I was telling them how I don’t feel physically ill but mentally im not 100% at the moment and I don’t feel up for going to work tomorrow.
We were discussing the point that I think companies should introduce mental health: “self care” days. They disagreed. 

Anyway, they thought I went upstairs but I was still stood in the hallway. My boyfriend (who knows I’ve been struggling) and our flat mate started to laugh about the situation and continued to say “just get over it” ect and just going off on how people just need to get on with it all. 

I’m not really sure how I should be feeling right now but I’m angry? Am I overreacting or is that completely uncalled for? Especially from my boyfriend who knows I’ve been struggling. 

Any quick advice would be really appreciated. Thanks!!"
1027,"Earworms, obsessions, and childhood memories :)","When I was in 3rd-6th grade I went to a babysistter who would play some CD's when her youngest went down for a nap during the day. I borrowed these at some point and ripped copies into my computer. Havent listened to them in years but played a few tracks this past week and cant get them out of my head. Its driving me nuts. 

I barely ever listen to music because they always end up on repeat in my mind and it interferes with my thought process. I have a really hard time getting out of these cycles. Had an exam today and it was hard to study and recall the material during the exam. Not ideal. 

I really enjoyed this babysitter's care and so theres a of associated emotion and memories that I havent remembered in years. 

I'm overwhelmed by it all and have a tendency towards earworms. Sometimes I think my headphones also pick up the radio frequencies and will just play music without being plugged into anything. This happened a lot when I was a kid and was SO overwhelming. It doesnt really make senese that headphones would play music when not plugged in!! 

I feel like I'm going crazy but what kind of crazy? What does it all mean? What can I do for relief?"
1028,What constitutes suicidal thoughts,"Lately, I am going through persistent low moods, helplessness and lack of interest in anything. I believed that I never had suicidal thoughts. But in restrospect, I sometimes get mild thoughts that I was better of dying. I am very self-controlled and I have confidence that I wouldn't commit suicide but does this constitute a suicidal thought. 

As a matter of fact I have decent education, good family and earn sufficient to keep my family happy. However, there are a few bad decisions in my life that haunt me and I find it hard to undo them. Like moving to a different country leaving my aging parents alone, who were okay when I left but they have health issues. I believe staying with them would give them a sense of confidence that they aren't alone but moving back to another country would disrupt my family here. Similarly a few other things at work make me feel helplessness and would result in thoughts of being better off dying. Can this thought grow and make me do things which otherwise I wouldn't do to myself ? 

Thanks for reading."
1029,The Demons are real,"I'm prepared for brutality and all. It's hard to say Daemons moved in across the street from me, again, and are tormenting me. I filed everything with the police, nothing gets done. You want to be as rational and logical as possible when dealing with these predators. I've yet to make a fool of myself and exploited them numerous times, here they sit continuing to antagonize me.

I do not understand the pleasure they take in tormenting me. They had committed numerous felonies and still they get away with this bullshit amid other possible crimes, like murder.

I do not know the meaning of dishonor and disgrace in this world. The corruption and absurdity in this world is becoming more evident by the day. It's becoming clear we do not all have the same privledges and some are above the law. I do abide by the law and wanted to be a policeman myself, working on going to EMT school again now. I've crossed paths with some deeply evil and warped morbid individuals in this world, the military, civilian life. There are evil people in this world and they are powerful, wealthy and get away with some seriously fucked up stuff.

I become outraged from time to time and practicing Stoicism has helped. People are either ignorant or apathetic themselves, I do not know what to do. I've talked to people about exposing them, so many do not want to get involved.

There is only peace."
1030,Is this common,"Thoughts you wish to die, but not suicidal. Like you just want it all to end but you don't want to kill yourself. Is there a term for this or anyone else go through it? You dont want to live anymore, but don't want to end it yourself, like you just wish you would have an accident. Sorry if this isn't the type of post that belongs here"
1031,I am a attention whore at this point,"
To summarize, I’m addict to attention and want constantly. Of course I’m aware of it and do my very best to hide it from everyone. So when I get super jealous or angry from not getting enough attention I never show it.

I’ve have a period where I was cutting myself to get attention, plus I kinda think of that every day so I think I liked it at the same time. But never mind, when adult start to make a fuzz after noticing my cuts, I stop doing it because it was just bringing me too much problem. 
When my best friend saw it tho she just asked me why I was doing it and she didn’t do anything else. Like, she would just stare at It but didn’t do anything or tried to convince me to stop. It made me very angry and frustrated by I didn’t say anything. 
Today she came up to me to ask advice about a friend of hers who cuts herself and she wanted to help her. I talked to her for a bit about her situation and tell her to convince her to go to therapy for a starter, since she seemed she needed to just let her feelings out.
But when I saw my best friend concerned about her, it made me very jealous. And I also just have this feeling of not mattering. I didn’t let any of this being shown of course. For the rest of the day I was feeling like going insane tho. I wanted to scream and cut myself again. But like until bleeding to death. I have this thing of imagining me dying, but i only was doing it before sleeping because for some reason it make me feel great. For the first time I really thought of doing it for real once I could get something sharp.

I don’t wanna go to school tomorrow. I just feel worse and worse. I tried to call people that seemed cheerful to up my mood but it didn’t worked. I’m also afraid to talk about it to a friend I love very much. I just want to be alone for an entire day doing nothing. I feel like I’m going to be insane if I go to school tomorrow. Especially if I see my best friend, I don’t know if I’ll be able to crack jocks like I’m use to."

1033,[TW: SA] Only now feeling the weight of sexual assaults and can't stop thinking about it.," Like many others I've had some uncomfortable experiences liked being groped on public transit by strangers. However, these aren't the situations that are keeping me up at night and I'm realizing that it's because there was no grey area - it was crystal clear they were in the wrong and knew better.

I have two other instances that I have struggled with because I was on dates with those men and consented to parts of what happened, but I know my anxiety can prevent me from speaking up when I need to. The first being a guy where I had no intention of staying at his place that night, as it was just a second date, but the friend I was meant to stay with that night got sick. I didn't mind that much as he treated me well in the time we had spent together and while kissing that night he mentioned he didn't have protection so we both agreed to stop it there. At that point I felt good about things because he'd done the right thing in bringing it up and being honest and he was respectful of the fact that I wasn't ever going to do anything without protection. Cut to what feels like an hour into me being asleep and he's feeling me up kissing my neck - it didn't really wake me up until I felt him pull down my underwear at which point I ask what he's doing. He said he thought we were gonna have sex and I reiterated I'm not doing anything without a condom and that I was sleeping - he said sorry for waking me up, to just go back to sleep but in a way that made me feel like I was at fault. My dumb thought process was similar in the next situation I explain, he'd been the one to bring up on the first date how he wanted something serious and it was important to him I wanted the same so I suppose in a way I justified it as a mix up because he was otherwise nice and said he didn't just want something casual. Of course I found out that was a blatant lie and I ended things a couple days later and never saw him again after that 2nd date. I've thought about that night since and I know it was messed up but only recently am I realizing that I'd justified this guy basically trying to rape me thinking I'd be too tired to object to sex without a condom. In the moment I let him make me feel like I'd done something wrong. I guess I'm just disappointed in myself for thinking that way and letting it slide just because he wasn't successful.

The second situation is the one that seems to be eating at me the most and was just last summer - I never fully processed it, I cried the day after it happened then had a trip to keep my mind off it, then moved on. I prided myself on being able to get over it so quickly and yes, I got over him quickly but I haven't got over how he treated me. It was another situation where he'd seemed serious about things as we'd talked for a while before even going on our first date so I felt like I could justify what happened if we'd end up together long term. We'd gone to lunch and had plans to watch a specific show at his place - I knew the likelihood of hooking up was high and I was okay with that although I wasn't expecting him to jump right into it the second I sat down to watch tv. I had recently started taking anxiety medication that really dehydrates the body initially so I made it clear to him that if we were going to do anything it had be slow and careful or it would either not be possible or just be pain on my end. He told me he would go slow and then followed the roughest anyone's ever been with me physically. By the time I'd registered what was happening it was too late, I had been turned face down and I was being held down by my neck unable to properly breathe so I couldn't tell him I wanted it to stop and that I was in pain. I was basically just stuck there upset and waiting for it to be over. Once again I feel disappointed in myself for freezing when he started hurting me, I had a small window to speak up and say that I didn't consent to this - we'd agreed on the exact opposite of what was happening - but I just couldn't unfreeze and spit it out. It became clear while being choked and suffocated that I meant absolutely nothing to this guy, he didn't care about how I felt physically or emotionally, I was just an object for him to get off. He'd told me he could definitely see a future with me and then turned into a completely different person who was emotionless and cold the second we parted ways after that date. I could no longer have a justification to make myself feel okay about what had happened, not like us being in a long term relationship would've made it okay either, but that was the icing on the cake that made me feel disgusted and degraded. To make things worse, I had a pap smear days after and had to explain why there was so much tearing and bruising - then got a yeast infection as a result.

It just keeps playing in my mind over and over and it makes me feel like I want to scrub the skin off my body. It kills me that I didn't speak up in time before being put in a position where I couldn't at all. I also hate that it's taken so long for me to care about myself enough to only feel this angry now and not back then right when it happened."
1034,being unproductive makes me so angry,"i had a lot planned for today. i wanted to go for a run, get homework done early, keep up with eating healthy, sit outside for a while. none of it happened. i went to ice cream with my friend after school (which isn’t being healthy). i got home at about 4 and it is now about 6:30. i’ve done nothing but sit in my bed because i felt tired (didn’t run, didn’t do homework, didn’t go outside). and this is making me so fucking mad at myself. why i am so lazy? why can’t i do simple tasks? i had 2 hours and i wasted them. i missed my chance to do things that i need to do because they are good for me. this is the last day i could’ve enjoyed coming home sort of early because now my spring sport is starting. so how i am planning to achieve anything if i can’t do it on a day when i have a ton of free time? i’m so mad at myself and i don’t know what to do. i’m addicted to my phone and i’m lazy. i have no self control."
1035,"I want to cut because I sort of like how it feels but I don't necessarily feel depressed, I don't know how common that is and I don't really know how to explain why I do this sometimes. I do know that something triggered it yesterday (I was reading a book and there was this drug addict dude)","so I suddenly got really into the mood(??) of the book and felt like self harming?? oh man

1036,to my mental illness...it's time to stop,"I have struggled with many issues my entire life. 
I haven't been ble to hold down a job due to my mental illness. 
I've lost friends, lost opportunities and cut ""family"" members from my lofe over my illnesses. 

Today is the day I move forward. 
I still suffer with PTSD flashbacks and I still live under many layers of a fake personality but today is the day I go forward to live how I want to live, without fear of what others may think. 

I will no longer let my mental illness dictate my life. 

I have set a date for my wedding and am moving forward with school to do what I love. 
I am going to push with every last breath within me to make this work and make it fall into place. 

Time to kick butt and prove that I can be more than my diagnosis."

I love my mother very much but when she makes me angry I just get into a rage and want to end it. I don’t care how anyone else would feel about it. Also about a week ago I thought my friend was mad at me and I considered us really good friend we are both into a lot of the same things. But when I thought he was mad at me I was pissed for hours. I actually started thinking about leaving school to jump off a bridge near my school. I am surprised on how I kept it together and not at least left school. Should I try to get help or talk to someone about this?

1040,Trying to be a good person is actually harder than it sounds.,"I'm a diagnosed schizophrenic with severe depression. Both issues have plagued me since 2014, and I've gotten no help. I have a lot of bad experiences that I still think about almost daily (neglect, really intense bullying; both verbal and physical, several failed jobs, sexual harassment as a child and as a teen, a death threat, a few near death experiences, etc).
  
   
It's so easy to spend all of my free time lying in bed poisoning my insides with caffeine and pain pills, and then taking out any sadness or frustration on my family if they dare to interrupt, but I'm trying not to do that. 
  
  
I'm learning to drive, I'm going back to college, I'm working on my career, I'm working a full time job to afford to move forward, and I'm trying to help with my toxic, stressful family and train my dog at the same time. I genuinely have days where I'm just done, and I can't deal with it all, so I'm not as nice as I should be, or I'm just sad and spending the whole day after work in bed instead of working at my computer. Everyone needs time off, but I feel guilty when I take it.
  
  
I just really want to find some balance where I can move forward in my education, career, dog training, and so on, but I still have enough time for myself without feeling like a lazy, pathetic waste of oxygen for it."
1041,My friend opened up to me a lot today and I don't know how to react.,"Now I don't want to get into specifics because this was said to me in complete confidence and I don't want to betray that. So my friend, let's just call him Mike, and I were talking with it just being the two of us. I'll say that I've known Mike for a couple years now, and I would consider him my best friend, and it was mostly our normal joking and hanging around, but then he started talking about how he might be a sociopath. He said that he has homicidal impulses and a tendency to hurt animals. He also said that he's a compulsive liar. This really surprised me, but he also said that he was ""testing"" me after he revealed a lie that he had during the conversation. I really don't know how to react to this news. He's still my best friend and he's still the same person I knew before this happened. I think I just need some help with this."
1042,Can you get low self esteem occasionally? Or is it always a chronic thing?,"I feel fine most the time then sometimes something can easily knock my confidence. It usually doesn’t get to me for long though. Other times out of nowhere I can just feel like being all negative about myself. It sort of feels good when I have these rants. I am usually quite jokey, chatty and sociable though. Some people I don’t reveal that side to me and tbh it rarely ever happens especially this last year or 2. I am feeling a bit low tonight and it’s like I know I should keep up appearances but my take is it’s only online and who gives a fuck"
1043,Trying to understand the mental wellness of abusers,"Cw/tw: abuse, dissociation, anger management, similar subjects, physical abuse, gaslighting

So I started reading more about dissociative identity problems so I had a question that someone here might help answer this -

I've heard of people who hurt/abuse others, you hear them say something like ""how'd you'd get that (enter mark here"" like they genuinely dont remember that they physically hurt you go cause said mark, even though it literally happened within 24 hours of said remark.

Some stories I've read they say things like ""it was an impulse one moment I was fine and then the next I've seen I've hurt someone""

So my question is this:
Is this a type of dissociative amnesia? What exactly is the psychology behind this (severe anger management problems, PTSD/cptsd, a type of dissociation, all of the above or something else all together?)"

1045,Not cried in many years,Please help
1046,Been having some not so welcomed thoughts,"So I’m typing this out late at night, can’t sleep and can’t get some shit out of my head. Where do I begin, I’ve been to many psychologist and psychiatrist through the years mostly for anxiety and feelings of emptiness, no matter how long I go or how many different types of medications I try to follow nothing works. I’ve always been a “good” kid always polite pretty sociable when I have to be and I was always pretty emotional, shit gets me feeling down real easy, anyway I’m kinda scared to say the stuff I’m about to say even on a throw away account so please try and understand that no matter how I feel I would never act on this, basically I’ve been having some thoughts about killing or harming people, whenever these thoughts pop into my head I just shake them away but I’m scared that it might be the begging to a bigger issue. The thoughts in the begging where about criminals yknow rapist murderers etc, but the past few months I’ve been having these thoughts about people who have mistreated me or used me in the past. I’m not a professional at this but I don’t think I’ve shown any signs of ASPD up until these thoughts started coming to me. The thing that scares me is that sometimes for a split second it feels like it’s the right thing to do. I’ve never told anyone about these thoughts because I don’t want anyone to perceive me as danger or a threat. I don’t know I could just be overreacting but I wanted to see what y’all think."

1048,My Friends With Kids Is Mentally Unstable And Talks About Being In Real Danger?,"Hi, new to reddit and also on a throw away account due to nature of my post.

Not sure if this is the best place for my post but it seems to be relative to a degree.

I have a friend Betty who lives in the USA. Betty is married and has two young children.

Lately, Betty has been worrying me with some of her bizarre ideas, I call them conspiracy theories.

I’ve tried to talk to Betty a bit about these things, did some in depth research and put forward some counter arguments and points regarding why things might not be that way but it seems no matter what I say or do she will flatly refuse to see any point of view that isn’t her own, it’s gotten to the point where she will say something then later deny that she has said it.

Some of the things that she has said have me worried, she’s mentioned that her husband and friends are part of some secretive group and being a part of this group they have access to special information.

She’s also mentioned that if she was to share this information with others then it would put her life and her children’s life in danger.

It seems to me like she may be involved in some sort of cult but I am not sure and obviously did not want to bring this up.

Her husband is a very tough guy, manipulative and controlling so I feel that this is having a big part in her change of behavior.

That said, her behavior is getting more and more bizzare, she’s getting very aggressive In general and started swearing during her conversations with me and more recently I’ve found it quite hard to contact her at all.

She mentioned that she is very scared about her situation and the way the world is going but is unable to leave this group as it will be very dangerous for her and her children to do so, when we talked about the future she said that she won’t be here anymore so it doesn’t matter.

I really worry about her and her kids, this is not a healthy situation for them to be in.

I am not sure what I can do to help or where I could start so if anyone could suggest some options that I can take with this then I would really appreciate that!

TLDR, My friend is mentally unstable and might be involved in a cult. She’s stated that she fears for her life. How can I help her?"
1049,How do I see a Therapist without Health Insurance?,"I am not employed, I collect unemployment but I collect ""too much"" per state guideline for free state health insurance, so what do I do? I need to get my life together or I need help cause if I dont I will most likely put myself out of my misery"
1050,Quick questions for a mental health providers outside of appointments?,"How common is it for psychiatrists to refuse to answer any questions (even if relatively urgent) outside of appointments? My new doctor has an online portal where it seemed like I should be able to message her, but her staff replied to me and said **she will not answer any questions at all** outside of appointments. I understand that she wouldn't want people to email her questions all the time, but I saw her recently and I thought it was a relatively quick question about my medication increase that could be kind of urgent. 

With other providers I've been able to send them an occasional quick question and they reply no problem. But now I'm wondering if that is not the norm and if my expectations are too high. 

I feel more anxious now that she won't answer my question (which she should probably know based on one of my illnesses), and kind of distrustful that she's not that interested in my treatment. This is a turn off to me. I don't know if my standards are too high by wanting her to occasionally answer a quick question between appointments because I'm not sure what is the norm. Anyone have any insight?"
1051,I’m off to the hospital.,"I’ve been in this place before, just this time is a bit worse. I’ve harmed myself is a way I always told myself I would never do. Never go that far. But I did. 

I told my partner, and they’re taking me right now."
1052,I need a psychoanalysis really bad.,"Conventional therapy does nothing for me, everyone I've ever talked to who is supposedly ""professionally"" trained come of as incompetent and narrow minded to me. Where can I find someone who can help me understand who I really am? I've struggled with understanding myself for about 6 years now. I have so many conflicting thoughts and I really feel like I'm going insane, in fact I'm almost most certain I've already gone insane. I've been on the verge of suicide many times.

I see myself as an extremely empathetic person yet I have a lot of thoughts suggesting the contrary, and I want help in sorting out my personality and mental state."
1053,MY JOB IS TO CONTINUE TO HEAL,"I don’t like feeling like this.
I don’t like this.
Why stress about life when I feel like I’m not even supposed to be here

I feel like my being here is a mistake

Or if it’s not a mistake

I feel underappreciated

Then I think, maybe there’s no reason to feel I should be appreciated, maybe I’m just delusional about what and who I am

I’m expected to just go out and continue to act normal, when clearly I am anything but.

Go get a job
Even though death is trying to befriend you,
Never mind that
Go get a job and make fifteen dollars an hour
You still won’t be able to afford anything 
But people won’t think less of you
If you can hit the pause button on being bipolar or possibly an m-f-ing alien, just turn it off if you could from 9-5, that’d be great.

Heal, but do it while keeping up with everyone else who’s never even imagined half the shit you’ve seen and experienced. Heal even though your experience is not valid to the people around you. Get over it. What’s wrong with you.

Nurture and reparent your inner child, but ignore the fact that the waves of her emotions are big and consuming and that I must continue to hold space to process them, ignore her anger about feeling constantly invalidated too, hit the pause button on all that and go out and get a job you lazy heroine.

1054,If I have traits like cluster b and pyschopathic traits how come I have not killed anyone?,"I have some traits like hpd but it's always been seemingly the product of my environment like I've alwas just wanted to belong no matter if that was as the lowest person just that I was allowed to socialize like with everyone else. And then on top of it when I was a kid I had stuff that was more like people certain traits where like I had no regard for right or wrong when I was as young as 3 to me that was a matter of made up stuff my mom made up but was not real. I did not really believe in religion either for those reasons and when I did I just wanted to do everything wrong that's just how I always regarded everything kind of like go against what you're told. Aside from that I had really bad bouts of boredum back then I never had empathy or guilt if I got away with it. If I didn't though and that's how I've always lived my life is if I didn't when I didn't it hurt like hell. Then you know like physical abuse for example I was never hit but when kids were I just thought well I never really could sympathize with them if anything I didn't mind laughing at them. But I wouldn't to their face because then I would be judged for it. Then like things like true altruism I never believed in I kind of felt like we all do things for a reason that's why we're breathing. If we didn't we wouldn't be here. That reason is our own satisfaction we can't feel someone else's satisfaction because that is in someone else. But we trick our minds into thinking we can.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And I actually feel like I have done this so many times. I have a thing in my adult years called devotion. I will be committed to something and not really give up on it. No matter what. That's my love for the company love for my family member love for my dog or whoever. At that time with that said that devotion is always my life tied in. I can easily mentally think if I have a new plan to walk away and move on to the next option. For example when I was a kid my mom went to jail. I did not cry did not feel any sadness I was like guess I'm staying with grandma for a week because one I knew why she was going away and secondarily my needs were met.  With that said I had a devotion to mother as an adult. Then also added to that I don't mind attacking smaller animals. But it's just specific animals. Usually prey animals. I love attacking them tbh. And this is tied into my adrenaline side. I have a lot of excitement strangling animals for example or beat them with something. With that I like seeing people fight. Again it works in my adrenaline line. If I am comfortable and know I'm not hurt then I usually don't mind seeing others get hurt. Am I excited to see it on a picture? No but I don't want to ever become it either. I don't like death for me. For others I don't mind it. I'm like a live and let live type. Lastly I do like to see dead people. Sometimes I think my adrenaline is off or something like one time I had to take a painkiller and after I was off it I remember feeling like I wanted to randomly kick this like 9 year old. For no reason at all. It's like a surge of feelings but I never really got what that is. Sometimes I have even wanted to see someone die or already die but that is more because of my mother in how she told me when she first saw a dead person how peaceful they looked. It's that curiosity of those who passed on kind of thing. But then there's things like I've always wanted to see dead people or injured people but that's more like an adrenaline thing when like they look dead. Now that part though I never want to kill anyone though. I'm a very anxious person I would be forever scared that I would go to jail like I said my thing is if I do get caught. I'm not one of those stupids who would say I won't get caught like an idiot. I gave the government technically my dna (through dna testing gedmatch and whatnot) so if I ever do anything well it would lead back to me and so obviously I have no intent to ever hurt anyone. Nor do I care to.

&amp;#x200B;

In a world where it was legal to kill people I still wouldn't because someone could kill me too. I am not a homicidal person in any sense of the way. And I am not a psychopath either if I were I'd be able to manipulate people I don't do that I don't really care about people that way. I care about their amusement but not really them giving me anything in return. And that's how I relate well with hpd in many ways because I do crave attention. I have never committed a crime. I have a lot of sympathy for dogs but not cats also. I was so sad with seeing all the dogs in the shelter I wanted to take them all home with me. But cats I've tortured cats when I was a kid. And rodents. Then friendships as I said have never developed. I know I don't really want to trick them into being my friend I just want them to really be my friend. I realize when people smile that does make me uncomfortable because I feel they are going to hurt me in some way but that has always proven to be true. smiling can also be really just laughing at you. I have never made friends and I have no real desire for romantic relationships. Just meaningless sex. Friends I've tried to make but I think for me I push myself so heavily on people and people push me away but I really don't know how else to be social to people. If I am quiet people say I don't want to socialize with them and stay to myself if I am friendly I am too much. I feel like most of the time people don't want me around and are uncomfortable and feel it's more comfortable to them to say I like to keep to myself rather than they don't like me and I need to stay to myself which feels like more of the truth for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow I don't get how are my traits similar to this if I have not killed anyone used anyone and am otherwise not interested in using people in this manner?"
1055,"Is it just me, or does depression start to feel like the soul slowly leaving the body?","Hear me out. I'm not dead. I'm not dying. I'm not brave enough to try something like that. 
  
  
But I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else out there has felt like they're constantly having an out-of-body experience because of a super strong urge to off themselves?
  
  
Like... maybe I've had that urge for so long that it overpowers most of my thoughts, is constantly on my mind, and is the thought that I wake up and go to sleep to every day and night. Even though it's my biggest, most common thought, though, I can't tell anyone because they would be upset, or they just wouldn't be able to help. And maybe having to keep that huge part of myself a secret for so long has made it to where I feel like a stranger among my family and friend?
  
  
At this point, maybe I feel like I'm the truest form of myself, sad and self-loathing, and the shallow shell that I display to others is just the mask that I hide behind so nobody can see how badly I'm hurting, and how quickly I'm fading in front of them because my biggest desire can never be fulfilled.

Are You a Miracle? On the Probability of Your Being Born

Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean, with exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water -- into the middle of that life preserver. On one try.""

1057,Does anyone else find that winter calms them ??,"Hello, so i'm from Australia, so we are currently in summer. Year after year i find myself longing for it to be winter again. The heat here can become so annoying all the time, the bright light from the sun and all. it's not as comfy.

Something about the colder softer weather that comes in the winter always seems to make me much happier. Also, the clothes, i love being able to cuddle up in blankets and hoodies, it makes me feel safe and calm. I love it. 

Anyone else feel the same ??"
1058,Where did my motivation go?,"I posted this on another sub, but I felt like this also belonged here.

I have had depressive episodes in the past. I'm only 15, and this might be my third relapse. I can't find the motivation to live or do anything that I usually enjoy. I feel like the days are just passing me by. My grandfather died almost a month ago, maybe that has something to do with it? I just feel like everything I do blocks time that I could be using for something else. My art is the only thing I can focus on lately, but I need to do stuff for school. I feel like everything is too much and like the only thing I can do is curl up and cry. Or maybe sleep. I have such a lack of motivation that I almost feel like I can't have friends and go to school at the same time. Like if I have friends, they'll just distract me. I feel like I have no time anymore. And the stress has just been getting to me. I just want to know what to do. Am I overreacting? Is this normal? I feel like I can't tell anyone this because they'll just tell me things that I already know.

Sorry for the vent."
1059,My Life is a Fucking Lie,"Now, I probably have no right to be depressed. If you don’t give a shit about some random teenager and don’t wanna read all of this, I don’t blame you one bit. I live in a wealthy family and I’m spoiled af. I also go to a private school. But nobody cares about me. All of my “friends” want me to die in a hole and rightfully so. I might as well kill myself right now and I definitely would if pain wasn’t a factor. I think I’m definitely going to be dead by October of this year. I’m just gonna go through a couple of my friends and why they hate me. The first one who I’m talking about has all the right in the world to hate me. Right now, I’d love to give him a gun to shoot me. He’s in a terrible family situation and his mom just had surgery. His dad isn’t with him either. And my ass has the audacity to insult him constantly about his breath, body odor, haircuts, being a pervert, anime stuff, and literally so much more. That’s how great of a friend I am. Another one is so nice to me but I complain so much around him and he doesn’t mind. He acts so kind and deserves better friends then me. My grades aren’t currently reaching my insane standards so I’m disappointed all the time. I still have a b in the fucking easiest class(art). Every time I see a post with my friends in it, I feel awful. Nobody ever invites me to like anything and I’m an only child so my life is boring. My friends are under the impression that I do math everyday when I don’t and just play on my console for the whole day. The math thing is because I’m good at math and bc I’m Asian. It gets boring after a while and people ignore my texts even when they see them. Nobody responds to me but the moment someone else says something, somebody else responds. I cry for an average of probably an hour a day. During ski club, I skied alone for pretty much the whole time and I was crying then too. I was once skiing with 3 other “friends” and I was supposed to go on the chairlift with one of them. Then he ditched me to go on it with the other two. So now I was by myself and I was on the chairlift alone. What made everything even better was that when they got to the top of the hill, they fucking ditched me. So I cried for an hour straight and made a cut on my throat that night. And yes, I’m aware that nobody asked and that I’m a bitch looking for sympathy and advice. If I had one wish, I would want to be able to commit suicide without feeling pain. I need fucking help"

1062,What is wrong with me? Am I delusional,"Hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd.  Recently I have been filled with self hatred. I am 5’7” and weigh 140 pounds. I am convinced I am fat even though this is a very average body weight. When I look in the mirror I think how ugly I am. People tell me I am attractive but I do not believe them. I feel like my life is a failure. I graduate college with a degree in fine arts and history with honors...this is not good enough. I feel as if I am very ignorant and perceived as such. I’m have traveled abroad three different times...yet when others tell me about their travels I feel inadequate. When ever I go out into public I think everyone hates me and is talking about me. I also constantly google mental illness and symptoms because I am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me I am “normal”. I take multiple mental health quizzes everyday to see if I have lost my mind. I am constantly asking my coworkers at work what they think about me. I am an artist and believe every work I produce is garbage. Even with people validating me I usually don’t believe them. Any advice?"
1063,I’m feeling stuck at a crossroad and so lost.,"I was recently broken up with by the person that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. It came out of the blue and she didn’t give me reason for it. We weren’t fighting and things seemed genuinely great with us. She never communicated any negative feelings to me and had even spoke about marriage with me very recently. It’s over now, and I have no choice but to accept that and move on.

I’m trying to figure out where to go from here. The main reason I was staying in the town I am living in currently is because my ex wanted to finish school here before we moved to another state and bought a house. Now I’m not sure if this is where I want to be and I am trying to figure out what I should do next, or where I should go.

I have friends all over. I could move to a couple places, but nothing feels “right” to me right now. What feels “right” is waiting around for my ex, but I know that’s the heartbreak talking right now. I feel completely stuck at this point in my life between should I stay, should I go, and where do I even go?

I have been very scared and have been putting it off for a while now. I realize that I should go but I am very nervous. I don’t want to go and then have them tell my parents because they get mad at everything that I do. I don’t want to go and have nothing happen because then that means I’m helpless. I don’t want to go and then have to do more because I hate talking to people. My friends are telling me that I really need to go but every time they bring it up I say that I will tomorrow. I can’t bring myself to go. I keep thinking of everything that could go wrong. I keep going through the lists and I can always find more cons than pros.

Imagine having a conversation where only one person is talking outloud, so every other sentance is on mute.

Initially my parents were against the idea of me taking any drugs in favor of me working through some of my issues with psychosis with therapies and I agreed with them. Now, after meeting with a counselor for a while, I feel like I'm ready to start trying them, as so far things have gotten more intense and confusing. The problem is that while my parents obviously aren't in charge of my medication, I'm worried that they would freak out if I started taking any. I live with my stepmom and dad. My stepmom had a family emergency that she left town for and my dad is on a work related trip for a few weeks.

I have so much fucking trauma and life just seems to keep shitting on me no matter how hard I claw to be even a LITTLE bit better. I’m trying so fucking hard not to let it get to me but I’m tired of putting my heart into everything I do and never having ANYTHING to show for it. I’ve been severely suicidal for the last few weeks and I don’t even know why I keep hanging on anymore. I feel so unlovable and sick. I really don’t know how much I have left in me.

1072,I've become a lawyer on Discord and I hate it.,"I care a lot about my friends. Even people I don't consider friends; and that philosophy has gotten me to be the ""bigger man"" or ""lawyer"" in multiple disputes.  


I'll tell both sides to calm down, think over what has *actually*  happened vs. their POV of what happened, Then I bring them together. Based on hostility I'll either hold their hand through the apologizing or let them do it on their own terms.  


This whole process usually lasts about 2 hours. Not including added stress *before* everything where I decide to intervene, and after where I'm hoping the crack I sealed stays sealed.

&amp;#x200B;

I just had one of these with 2 very close friends. First-ever. All my previous ""cases"" were between mutuals/acquaintances. (One of which was between 2 rival RUST clans I had happened to build in between.) I couldnt've imagined the exponential increase of stress that comes with a ""case"" that I care deeply about.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it worse is that a few years ago we were a trio. If you saw one of us, the other 2 would be either close behind or you missed 'em. Now I'm dealing with a hostility rivaling that of opposing *internationally-based factions.*  


As I'm typing this post I'm debating with one side of the issue. They're vouching for bluntness and telling side 2 what's up. I'm trying to talk them into what I've dubbed the ""Stray Cat"" philosophy.  


You can't just walk up to a stray cat.  


Speak softly, Move slowly, gain its trust. Once you've done that, then you can be more assertive once it's sure you're not going to hurt it.  


I spent a good 30 minutes trying to convince side 2 that side 1 wanted to sort things out. I couldn't get side 1 to message side 2 because side 2 had blocked them, I was the middleman.   


Look, just...  


TL;DR : I'm dedicated Devil's Advocate. I was forced to advocate for 2 of my close friends, and now I don't want to advocate again."
1073,I feel like I’m the worst friend,"So the title says it all. I make plans with, why I would call, my best friends yet I still cancel them and make up a reason why I can’t hang out yet they only real reason I don’t hang out is due to my anxiety. I have anxiety when I leave my home. I work 40 hours because I can’t afford to not work 40 hours but if I could, I would stay home 24/7. I’m not fully comfortable with anyone ever. I only trust my sister and that’s all. I don’t know why I have these issues and I want to hang out with my friends and not let them down but I always get severe anxiety the day before and cancel plans. Please give me some advise. I don’t want to lose my friends because of my own stupid problems."
1074,Life is really shitty right now,"Oh boy where to start. Well, I just got turned down by two different jobs I applied to. My crush (who rejected me a couple of months ago) has completely stopped talking to me. I almost get a panic attack every day. I'm completely alone most of the time now. 

I wanna cut again so badly, but it'll be hell walking around with fresh ones so visible. I just don't know what to do anymore."
1075,Mood Fluctuations,"On some days (like today) I am super motivated and focused.  I can process good amounts of information and think clearly and logically. During this period, I know I can be really good at the work I do. 

On other days, I can't think about anything clearly. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. My outlook on life is very bleak. 

Have any of you experienced anything similar? What did you do? How to control the fluctuations?"
1076,Seeking Advice for Assisting a Friend,"My husband and I have a friend living about 3 hours away that is going through a terrible and sudden divorce. Her husband of 20 years returned from work on Friday as normal, but then packed up a bag and said he was leaving her for someone else. Her world was turned upside down as she had no idea that there was anything wrong in their relationship.

She saw a therapist that broke confidence by communicating with her husband, and is going through legal action against said therapist. She's also under the care of a psychiatrist who doesn't fully listen to her problems and concerns. That said, she has multiple mental health diagnoses now that are freaking her out just having these labels to her current condition and the social stigma to them. 

Both friends and professional help have told her she would be over it in six months. She is currently on several psychiatric medications that she doesn't feel are helping. She barely eats, she can't sleep, and it's been this way for nearly six months. Due to the social stigmas of both divorce and her condition, she's kept this under wraps from friends for most of this time. Only recently did my husband and I find out what was happening. And so, we're trying to help in whatever ways we can.

I wrote her a lengthy handwritten letter about my issues I had (and still have) from dealing with my first marriage and divorce ten years ago. I included a sheet of self-care to-do's that I feel are difficult to do when in such a depressive state. She reached out to us after reading my letter, inviting us to come visit her, and she told me she reads it every day because it has validated what she's feeling versus the criticism she's received elsewhere. During our visit, she relayed most of the above at that time, and both my husband and I sat and cried with her for several hours. We're resolved to assist her however we can.

We decided that we would make meals in small portions for her to give her something that she wouldn't have to cook but would hopefully be able to stomach. She has appreciated these so far, and we're continuing to do this to help her out. Our current plan is to visit with her every two weeks as we travel to the area for my work. But, I know very well that this isn't enough. With multiple suicide attempts, and my fear that she will try again soon, we're running low on ideas. I don't want her to feel abandoned and alone, but I also want to respect her needs to not be pestered by friends asking for updates. 

So here we are, posting to ask for any advice on what more we can do. When you were at your lowest, what helped you come out the other side? Any advice we can share to other friends to also help her out?"
1077,Today I learned that I saved someone's life,"Today my friend said to someone ""If it wasn't for \*\*\*\*\* I would not be here"" right in front of me. I kind knew it already. That night was pretty scary. Me and the wife were just about to start making dinner when my friend sent me a super long text that was clearly a cry for help. I just looked at my wife and said ""Put the food back in the box we have to go now!"" I called my friend and they tried the ""no no Im fine"" routine but I was adamant and already headed towards their home. We had a nice dinner, nothing fancy, but we made a plan for the next day and got them to the services that they needed.  
I've been around this friend everyday, we work together, and they have made so much improvement and I am super proud of the person they are becoming. But today, I don't know. I just was not ready to actually hear that."
1078,How do you handle recurring intrusive thoughts wondering if you acted weird or looked weird or sounded weird?,"I’m taking part in a month long off site training session for work. Myself and about 25 other people are participating and we’re all taking daily classes together. We were all strangers to begin with - working in offices spread across the country. We’re just over a week in and lots of people seem to have made friends but I struggle with that...always have. I just don’t make connections quickly or easily. I don’t like that about myself but I’ve come to accept and sort of expect it. What I’m struggling with is now wondering every day if I’ve done or said something weird that’s alienated people. Everyone is cordial and polite and no ones treated me poorly, I just feel tolerated rather than accepted and can’t pinpoint why. I do chat with people at activities and events but don’t get invited to after hours things, so I feel like I must’ve done something to not be included.

How do you handle these types of thoughts?"
1079,Overcoming guilt of cheating and lying,"I previously cheated on my girlfriend and then faked dissociative identity disorder to avoid breaking up. We have broken up now, but it still remains a secret that I didn't have dissociative identity disorder. 

I'm now filled with immense guilt and self loathe, and don't know what to do."
1080,Avoidant Personality - No Close Relationships,"Just thinking about my childhood and how I spectacularly failed to make close friends at every event I went to. I made friends surely, but I'd say 95% of them were activity friends. I saw them at a certain place and time and was content at that. They were a step above colleagues. Even my roommates I didn't really form close bonds or come to understand them more deeply. I had one roommate, who I was closest to, and when I moved out that ended spectacularly badly and I never thought that moving out was because our relationship  was bad. Honestly, the apartment was shitty for me, but somehow, we cut ties. I regret that, but idk how to keep being friends with people I dont see regularly. Nowadays I dont see anyone regularly. I wonder if the few people I did connect well with miss me or our friendship wasn't as big a deal to them because I treated it that way. I dont have that same urge to embed myself in someone else's  life that it seems like you need to come to deeply and intimately understand another person. I know its because I'm avoidant. I'm satisfied with very little social interaction, but you cant have real true friends that way. Even my romantic relationships have been ...lacking in the connection department, either because they were flings or circumstance or maybe that's just what I tell myself to feel like I'm not responsible for the shallowness of my relationships. I dont know if I've ever really tried to hold onto a relationship I've felt slipping away. I liked this article:  https://wealthygorilla.com/establish-genuine-connections/"
1081,Sad and lost,"First post ever and a throwaway so forgive me this might be long,

Not really sure where to post but maybe here is the right place.

This i about my (26f) Boyfriend (26m). who is having some issues and i don't know how to cope with it anymore, he was diagnosed with clinical depression with psychosis, He is very into the Magick works Tarot card, crystals ect ect. 

Now he believes that all his mental issues are magick related, i'm not one to put down somebody's believes but where does one draw the line? We have been together for about 9 months, the first 2 months where amazing,, until one day that started the downhill battle, He ended up baker acted and spend a week in the hospital, 

he was okay after that for about a month but refusing to take his meds ,i didn't push him to take them as he seemed like good old him, after that is has been a constant struggle of him thinking that everybody is spying on him and he is being followed and him hallucination, he would take his meds for 2 days and quit, he would go see his family and not come home for a week as they kept him hostage a couple of times, more baker acts,

He would go from being super close with me to  thinking i'm a Russian spy , and then realizing that the voices just don't want us together as i make him happy and keep him save 

He doesn't seem to realize that things that he said hurt me , and i beat myself up over being impatient with him from time to time, and letting the things he say get to me, 

Im lost on how to keep strong, how to fight a war i feel like i'm losing, how do i keep from losing my mind ?

now he is going for a walk as he needs space and heal , now i know i'm clingy just to much has happened and i'm scared that he wont come back or get baker acted again.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my post,, i'm sure it wont make no sense at all, i'm just here crying and venting"
1082,I don’t get it,My step dad married my mom around 8 years ago and I’ve never spoken a single word to him. I live with him and my mom and whenever he asks me something I just nod. I don’t hate him or dislike him I just can’t talk to him and if I think about talking to him I get so nervous and scared so I just can’t talk
1083,Hmmm.... fuck him,"Let me explain. I am a self harmer, and nearly decided to just fucking die. But I was a coward and quit. Obviously I was a little bit freaked, so I went to (probably not the best decision) omegle and under mental health and help form things the 1st person said this exact thing. ""You pussy. Try agian. Dont be a fucking coward, the pain will go away.""

I be thinking, fuck that guy, so I see another few people on there and we talk and I be feeling better but damn fuck that first guy."

1085,Things that are wrong with me,"Im mentally and emotionally fragile 

I’ve never spoken a word to my step dad I’ve lived with for 8 years ( I don’t dislike him ). Idk I just get to scared and I start to freak out. I just can’t talk to him like if someone told me to talk to him or I would die I would probably end up dying because I’m literally unable to talk to him 

Mood swings 

I cry too much 

For some reason when I’m hungry ( at school ) get really sad and I feel like I’m being starved or abused or something even though I’m not. And it makes me want to cry 

I have no motivation in school so my mom is constantly reminding me that I’m failing and that makes me feel like a failure

A lot of nights I just lay in bed and talk to myself in my mind about how I was an accident and how I wish I was never born 

I have depression and anxiety but the doctor and my mom only know about my anxiety because I lie to my parents and say that I feel good and I’m happy even though I’m not. I’m too scared to tell anyone that I have depression because my sister had it and my mom told everyone in my family and they constantly talk about it.

I literally cry when people say anything mean to me or about me. It doesn’t even have to be mean, like if my mom or my teacher is disappointed or just raising their voice I would have to try so hard not to cry 

I constantly remind myself that nobody cares about me and that nobody would care if I died 






And I also remind my self a lot about how I’m probably going to kill myself before I’m 20"
1086,I struggle between wanting to be self-destructive and wanting the best for myself.,"It’s so hard to put into words, but essentially, I go back and forth between being entirely self-destructive (starving myself, prescription drug abuse, going on benders, erratically spending money) and wanting to actually get my life together.

Does anyone else experience this, or at least can sympathize with this? 

I feel a bit like a loser for admitting this."

I buried a radio in my yard because I could hear people spying on me even with the batteries out it...Anyways things seem to be getting worse and I am scared ECT will not help and I am worried about any complications like memory loss etc.Any input would be helpful"
1088,advice for an extremely unwell loved one,"hi everyone, i actually got reddit for this reason alone and that reason is to get advice for my sister.

my sister is 16, in high school, and she’s been balancing depression and anxiety for years now. i have my own share of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, ADD) but in terms of recovery i am much farther ahead than she is. 

she keeps to herself a lot emotionally, but she will tell me a lot if i get the conversation going. i understand that she has major trust issues, the root of which i’m unsure. these trust issues bring her debilitating anxiety around other people, even according to her, around me and our mom. when a conversation is finished, she walks away feeling regret and rethinks her words to the point where i’m sure it drives her crazy. she overanalyzes her appearance (she also struggles majorly with body image issues), and the way she comes off in conversation, frequently asking me things like “am i annoying you?” “am i talking too much?”. she fears being looked at or having her classmates know she even exists, so she avoids school and classes. she can hardly get out of bed most mornings, even when she understands potential consequences she ignores anyone who tries to get her up. she will sit there in silence while i urge her to get ready for school. if i talk about school she becomes closed off and angry. she says she doesn’t like thinking about her problems, but i know that won’t solve anything for her. she also knows just how bad it is but for some reason it won’t stick. not only this, she hates therapy, and insists it doesn’t help her at all. she avoids trying new ways to help herself because she “doesn’t understand how it will help”, specifically medication. 

she is hopefully going to a doctor soon, but i’m wondering if anyone can give me advice on how i can help her through this? everything i do seems to either make it worse or do nothing at all and i feel like a failure of an older sibling. her situation is so upsetting to me and all i want to do is help her out. any strategies, coping suggestions or ways i can guide her away from her fears? what works for you guys personally? maybe someone has been in a similar situation? 

if you read all of this, thank you so much. it means the world to me."
1089,My sister is always stressed. Can I do anything to keep her normal until we see the psychiatrist?,"We lost our father 2 weeks back. She was also getting treatment from a doctor before dad passed away, because she had these visions and hearing voices. It had mostly been controlled before our father died. She was almost getting well. Now after he died she tells she can hear voices again. She also tells she feels like someone stands behind her. She passes urine without her noticing for a few times a day. Last night she found our old camera and saw father's pictures in it and that caused her to become stressed more and more. Our psychiatrist is only available after 21st of March. Can I do anything to keep her happy and normal till we see the doctor? She's only 11 years old."
1090,Here’s one,"Any suggestions if I should bring up the issue of not being medicated for adhd to my nurse practitioner prescriber? It’s taken a year to learn how to have a functional relationship with them, and they’re provided free by my county- so I am extremely grateful I have that option.  
I don’t want to seem Med-seeking, I just want to offer my opinion. My other symptoms are being treated and managed- but having something in place for my attention deficit would really improve my quality of life. 
I’ve made peace with the fact that it isn’t really an option for me now, but I was wondering if anyone has had similar fears: bringing up adhd to their psychiatric prescriber."

1094,How to sleep with anxiety?,"So I can’t sleep. It takes me a very long time to fall asleep because I have so many racing thoughts about everything I did and everything I need to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything to relax my mind, but nothing seems to be effective for too long. I usually can’t fall asleep until like 3am and then end up sleeping way too late. I go to therapy and take meds, so just frustrated.

1095,Depersonalization/Derealization disorder with a blank mind for 2 years.,"Soo I’ve had all kinds of abuse in my life, from both sides. Mom and dad. verbal, physical, sexual, etc. But I was very angry as a kid, I lived with my dad, and my mom lives in Canada. My mom shuts down and doesn’t talk to you. She just walks away. And my dad follows you and taunts you and gaslights. My dad is physically and verbally abusive to me. And my mom neglected me, we were basically homeless with an abusive step dad in Canada. When I came back to my dads house after visiting my mother in Canada after a very traumatic summer. He kicked me out and I was homeless , I moved in with my exboyfriend and his mom shortly after. I didn’t start feeling disassociated until my best friend had passed away. That mixed with watching my grandmother die in my lap in the summer was hard. And it’s been ongoing for 2 years without a break and constant possible traumatic events happening during  that time . It hasn’t been in episodes, it’s been 24/7 no breaks. I’m stressed. It makes me have some break downs. But for the most part I’m numb and zoned out. I don’t really have thoughts unless I sit down and really try to think. Ive suffered from a pretty blank mind. I can’t really work because I get exhausted and cry and break down and feel anxiety. But every emotion I have is just physical, I feel so de attached from my mind . Any suggestions? I need to work, And I’m currently living on my own with some assistance, but it’s not enough. I want to have a normal life, I was told that it’s not permanent but it feels like it. It’s just been so long."
1096,I came very close to committing suicide an hour ago **TW** DESCRIBES SELF-HARM,"I was self-harming on the inside of my right forearm, at first, just scratching myself with a piece of glass I'd found...then something terrifying happened. I moved to the top of my left hand, where my veins are very prominent, and I actually pressed hard and began to cut. Something stopped me as soon as I'd gotten over one of those veins, rhough.

I wanted to do it. I had every intention of cutting deep into that vein and bleeding out. I was happy and excited I was about to die ... And I'm still here. 

Guys... I've been cutting since I was a teen (I am 49 now) and even at my most suicidal then, I had never come that close to slicing a vein.

I am regretful that I chickened out. I am angry that something is keeping me tethered to this shithole life in which I am suffering greatly. I am damned if I do give in to my mental illness (I will go back to prison--STATE prison this time--for 2-5 years) and I am damned if I don't (this medication is doing NOTHING to help it and that means I will probably go back to burning large things again)... I have to bear the urges already... Which is getting out of control again.


Anyone else know what I'm talking about? I feel alone so a nice word would be comforting. Help? I don't consciously want to die, even though I'm not against it. I got stuff done today!! We got out of Program early today because The Toxic Cheeto (President Trump) was in our city today. 

I need sleep....yeah...right.😴"
1097,"Today, I dropped out of college and I couldn't be happier.","Hi, and welcome to my TED talk.
As the title states, I dropped out of college today and honestly, I've never felt so free. 
Ever since I was little I've been on the fast track, when I graduated highschool last year I also recieved my associate. My GPA is stellar and I have approximately 14 credits remaining until I complete my bachelor's program. I know what you're thinking, ""you're so close!!, why stop now?!""
Well...because that exact phrase is what almost killed me this school year. I'm diagnosed with the holy trinity of PTSD, Anxiety and Depression, for years I thought I was getting better bc of all I was achieving. When in reality it was years of surpressing of my mental health and my fear of failing. Well...look where thats gotten me..dropping of college, my mental stability is nonexistent. I've started self harming again, and my suicide ideation become more severe. I simply...can't do it anymore. When consulting my professor and the school therapist all I was told was I need to ""get up and keep going"", but I can't. How many times do I have to shout it out that I can't continue living my life as if everything is okay. That's all I've been doing my entire life is telling myself to keep going ...and I've gotten no where. I don't want to fucking walk anymore, I want to sit and just heal. As simple as it sounds it's taken me almost 5 years to get me to say that...grades aren't worth dying for. Life isn't a race, and we travel it as our own pace. I've told myself that for years, now its time to put my words into action. 
Whats the plan now? Well...I guess focus on myself until my wings are healed and Im ready to fly again."
1098,I feel trapped.,"I won’t say much. 
My bf and I have been together for 4 years. Basically, a lot of it has been unreasonable arguments he’s started (getting really upset that I didn’t say okay instead of k) and I feel very unrespected and small. 

Yet, I feel crazy. He goes from being loving and normal to crazy and leads to me crying. It’s very confusing for me. And I’m just tired. 

If I leave, he will hurt him self. So I’m stuck. I feel terrible everyday. I don’t see any reason to live(unrelated to my bf. But my sure does add to it). I’m just existing in a space I don’t belong in.

1099,How to help a mentally ill sibling?,"I definitely feel like I've only been turning to Reddit for advice but oh well I guess.

So I (18f) have a younger sibling (16m) and we are very close. He was diagnosed with Asperger's quite a few years ago and has been dealing with depression for the last few years. Depression definitely runs in our family, as our dad is dealing with it and I myself am dealing with PTSD from our mother. I love this kid with my whole heart and I don't live with him anymore but I know that he's been having issues with waking up in the morning for school. He's been having so much trouble with his attendance at school that they might take action over it. Whenever we ask him what's up, he says that he doesn't know and if we try to lightly push him to tell us how he's feeling, he completely shuts down.

The reason why this terrifies me so much is that we have an uncle who has very severe bipolar and schizophrenia who has completely shut everyone out and he has become nocturnal and doesn't attend any family functions. My brother is acting very very similar to our uncle and I'm scared.

He did see a therapist at one point and he was prescribed medication at one point and I noticed an immediate change, he was getting up in the morning and going to school and doing things and we were so excited! He decided at a certain point that he was not going to be taking his meds anymore. I don't know why, but he just stopped. Then we went right back to square one. I've tried telling him about how seeing a therapist has helped me and how meds have helped me but he just isn't into it at all.

I really just don't know how to help him and neither does my dad. I just don't know. Does anyone have similar experiences with others or themselves?

TL;DR - My brother (16m) has depression and Asperger's and is really struggling but I don't know how to help him"
1100,I got called a bitch today... because of my name (tl;dr at bottom),"Literally because of my name. Nothing else. I've dealt with bad depression, social anxiety, and anxiety since I can remember. I've had problems with my image, how I am, and who I am I guess. I can't help it. I can't help that shit fucks with me. I'm not gonna cry, or whine, or any kinda bullshit but I just literally can't help getting depressed. 

And ever since I've hit a certain age as an adult, it just seems like my brain stopped maturing. I feel like I act childish at times when I shouldn't. I don't feel like my brain can handle situation's like other adults my age can. My friends think that I have a mild form of autism that wasn't able to be detected until now or something. I'm probably just fucked and trying to find a reason for why I'm weird. 

Anyway me and my roommate went to one of his friends houses. Hung out for a while, smoked, had a good time. I knew some of the people, so I thought it was pretty cool. We weren't supposed to stay for that long but ended up we were gonna stay and hang out for a while. Well dudes girlfriend got there and then we had to go pick up one of their roommates girlfriends. So we got there to pick her up. Me and my roommate got introduced. She was cool as fuck with my roommate. And then she told me that everyone she's ever met with my name was a bitch. Just like what the fuck kind of introduction man. And I just kinda brushed it off like wtf. And then she commented on it the whole ride back to their house. And more when we got to their house. Just like some weird obsession with telling me my name is a bitch name. And then we went outside to smoke and it was like after that I wasn't allowed back in the house or some kinda shit.

 Some more of their friends came over and when they opened the door and walked inside I could hear her telling them about my bitch name. About how my name was a bitch name and I was bitch. I'm literally just sitting outside. We physically haven't seen each other for like 15 min and she's still talking about it. And then they all came outside to smoke. I was ready to just smoke( My and my roommates which we were smoking with them)  and go home. I had to sit in a group of people I literally didn't care about and smoke my smoke because my roommate really likes them. It was awkward. Everyone looked at me weird. None of the other people said anything but after listening to that fat chick talk, I know what they were thinking. And she was one of those chicks. Fat and ugly with the mindset of Kylie Jenner. After we smoke we finally left. 

What fucked me up was every time this chick made a comment my roommate would bust out laughing like it was the funniest thing he's ever heard. Really fucked me up there. Caught me by surprise. He got upset when I told him I wanted him to take me home. Told him I didn't care what he did I would give him gas to come back I just wanted to go home. What he was even more mad about was that I was depressed and mad that I was stuck at some motherfuckers house that I don't know and don't give a fuck about and that I had been called a bitch by some irrelevant fat cunt for the last two hours. 

I just wanted to go home. To leave and I would be fine. I don't care about those motherfuckers but the more I'm forced to be in a situation the worse it gonna be. I've dealt with this my whole life and life just moves on. This seems to be the only hand ill ever be dealt. So just fuck me I guess. 

Thx if you read it. 

tl;dr Hungout with roommate at his friends house. Went to pick up a girl they lived with from her work. Got called a bitch by her for the next two hours because of my name. Roommate laughed at me and got mad that I wanted to leave."
1101,Happy for the first time in months!,I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2018 and have had 2 major depressive episodes and just got out of one that started in the middle of September of 2019 and ended March 3 of 2020 and I've been sh free since January this year and when I told my mom that I just got out of a depressive episode she said that she was proud of me and I'm happy for the first time this year!

My father lives with me and we work off of each other for bills. I only get so much money a month from work, I'm an at will employee. I don't want to seem unreliable or useless at work and get fired for being hospitalized. I don't want people at work to know."
1105,I feel like I don't deserve to feel down :/,"Been going through a rough patch over these past few years. Never been to a therapist or doctor about my mental health. My family has simply been through too much these past few years to bring that into the equation. I don't want them to worry about me too. I have always been the rock, and I can't show them how weak I truly am. They need me, and well I need home to stay normal for my own sanity. Some days I feel worthless/depressed. While others I tell myself that I am fine, or that other people have it worse therefore I have no right to not be okay. I have never had many friends, and I distance myself from the ones I could have because I feel like they don't want me. Recently I started cutting. To cope with my emotions, I guess. It helps, but I know it isn't healthy. Never thought I would do something like that, but here I am doing it. 
Anxiety has controlled me most of my life. I don't fit in anywhere, and I fear it will always be that way. I just wish I had someone that actually fucking cared. Now that I am an adult I feel this need to already be something, and the people around me expect me to go to college. I did, but everything was just so overwhelming I dropped out. I fear that I will never amount to anything. I fear that I will always let myself and others down. Working toward moving out of the house for a job. Hoping that helps.
I just feel like no matter what it is I am doing I always manage to make a fool out of myself somehow. I just want to be normal. Maybe I don't have a place in this world. I don't want this to be the end of my story, but sometimes I just feel like there is nothing left. Just tired of feeling depressed, anxious and insecure ig. I don't even know what I am hoping to gain from typing this. Maybe just to vent, but any advice is appreciated. :):"

1108,Why is self destruction so much easier than self care,"Depression, or whatever it is I feel, can't be cured in a fortnight but certain things can help because I've done it before. Basic hygiene, reasonable sleep schedule, leaving the house just to even walk, cooking real meals etc.

But all of that shit requires so much work. Much more effort required to me it seems than a 'regular' person. And I'm so fucking tired already

I wish I could just constantly be sunk into my vices. Drinking, smoking, jerking, hours in bed on my phone etc.

Just can't seem to get out of this cycle. Or maybe I don't even want to anymore and this is just my normalcy now. Idk"

i just wanna get better but i know the one thing i truly want is impossible to get

1113,Is it inappropriate to send a card to your Psychologist?,I am about to open a new chapter in my life after 2 years of the darkest and most challenging period of my life. My Psychologist whom I was seeing during the last 18 months of that time is largely responsible for me getting my life back. I am no longer seeing her as her time is much better spent helping someone else now however she did ask in our last meeting that I update her on a potentially life altering job prospect should I get it (I got it :D). Anyway I assume she meant via text as this is how all our previous communication has taken place but I would like her to know that her help is very much appreciated and a text seems a little impersonal. Anyway is it crossing some kind of patient /therapist boundary in sending a thank you card to her?
1114,I find it hard to motivate myself to graduate because I want nothing from life,"I don't care about material things nor about people or society. When I was younger I thought being a scientist would be nice. Now that I could be one I don't know what the point is. My depression and anxiety hits hard, and I have nothing to motivate myself. Everyone seems to want something from life, but I just don't fucking care. Still most people seem unhappy. I don't get why giving up is so bad. What's the point of trying to ""get better""?"
1115,One day at a time.,"If you stressing right now, please remember you only need to take it one day at a time. You always have enough strength and energy to get through one day and try your best... don’t think about tomorrow’s struggles and remember it’s another day, it has not yet arrived so there’s no need to worry about it now. Dive back into the present moment and only focus on what you have to deal with in this exact moment. Celebrate your tiny victories. Take it one day at a time. PAUSE. BREATHE. You’ll be okay. I wish you all a wonderful day 🤍"
1116,I’m too scared to call a confidential help hot line.,"I don’t know what to do, I can’t, I just can’t function anymore."
1117,Sometimes I wish I could just not speak,I just want to go at least a few weeks without having to talk. I hate talking I don’t know why but I do sometimes. I want to just stop talking for a little bit. I think it might calm some of my anxieties if I’m being honest.
1118,I hate how I look as I don’t recognise myself,"For years I have been fighting with who I see in mirrors. Every change I make is not right, it never shows the person I want to be and it’s frustrating. Why is it so hard to love myself?

I’ve tried to lose weight, cut and dye my hair. Been through more outfit types then I can think, makeup and so much more but it’s never right...

Every time I look in the mirror it shows a fat, ugly wanna be that always looks like a freak. There’s too much fat in areas I don’t want and too many scars across my skin. I can never look pretty like other girls my age. My skin is so stupidly sensitive it breaks out with most creams and products. It’s embarrassing to look at myself so god knows how badly others see me. 

I want pretty long hair with a slim attractive body that wouldn’t disgust anyone. I want the comments about how bad I look to stop. I want to look okay. How can that person in my reflection possibly be me? It’s not fair, I do my best to keep meals small and scrub the imperfections from my skin but not even the baggiest tops can hide how disgusting I am. 

I just want to be the person I see myself as...not this beast..."
1119,Anxiety Ridden because of some stupid SELF SABOTAGE (rant warning and bad grammar),"I just feel like shit, won't help myself get my goddamn grades up, and I know this is like a pity party despite what my counselor and a therapist said...but like AGH fucking hell, I don't like living like this. NOT TO MENTION, and look I fucking know I'm not diagnosed, BUT I GODDAMN KNOW FOR SURE THAT I HAVE THE DEREALIZATION SHIT, which means IM STILL PROBABLY FUCKING DEPRESSED KMS, I can't with this shit anymore, this whole week I've just constantly been saying in my head how much I want to literally kill myself, and I KNOW!!! IM NOT GOING TO... I know my family loves me and I have a group of very close friends...and I don't want to hurt either of them. I love all of them, even if I do come off as cold to them... but anyway...I've felt distant from my everyday life for literally 2 years now I think... I'm not sure, I can't remember most of last year, it's just a blur... I can't even remember how to do Alg 2 (cause our school teaches us Geometry then Alg 2) from last year, and I have the SATs next Saturday and I'm just goddamn super nervous. I take magnesium supplements and god do they help BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT IVE BEEN BREAKING DOWN THIS PAST WEEK, I've just had enough, I'm done, I can't deal with this shit, I have a bunch of late work due today, and I don't wanna tell my Euro teacher, ""look, man, I haven't done my shit at all this year cause I think my depression is helping cause some self-sabotage and I can't find a good environment to help myself."" Cause like, there are people with Clinical Depression who still can do things for themselves...but they also have psychologists and shit (from all I've heard of) and I have a school therapist I've only seen 4 times and am not comfortable with despite it being a very big privilege, and I appreciate my school for the programs it has...but I just want to do it in an out of school setting idk SOMETHING, ANYTHING. That therapist lady was also supposed to recommend what I should do to help myself... so she really isn't supposed to be a regular thing. And I'm done talking to my friends majorly about my problems cause I just have been feeling like a burden and a hypocrite (long story, involves a completely different person) and I just wanna die, dawg.  Idk maybe I'll just tell my euro teacher that shit fr, maybe he'll kinda get it. Also my dad is probably gonna get me a psychologist soon through a program at his job...which I appreciate greatly, dont get me wrong, but I wish he got me it sooner when I was so clearly fucking depressed last year. Like I was so fucking suicidal... that's mostly all I can remember from last year, CAUSE I FORGET IT ALL.  I just don't wanna go to school today, but it's my dad's birthday and I don't wanna make him upset but I literally had a panic attack at 3 AM cause I fell asleep instead of pulling my much needed all-nighter. And I keep trying to pull out my hair and cut myself, but I physically can only cut my keratosis pilaris on my arms...I guess cause my mind thinks I'm like shrinking it down, cause I do hate my arms cause of it. I just can't do it. I can't I gotta stay home, it's so bad. I literally felt like vomiting I'm so nervous and I'm writing this crying Idk what to do. I don't wanna go to my counselor cause I make her sad and concerned and shes an absolute angel. And I just canbhediofghdisgohsidhgio ugh sorry anyway I just don't know...what did I even write... see I don't even realize I'm writing this shit, Im just floating, I wanna just pass out and die, dude I like...;when I get happy Im like ""oh I'm not depressed, I was just... overreacting or something at the time"" No man I'm fucking depressed, I'm literally so depressed, this is really fucking bad man I cant deal with this shit, legit. I've dealt with it for way too long...it's been like what 3 and maybe one half years of this shit....wtdfhifoshgiosdfiho I just- wtf. I hate to say it but why me? Why do any of us have to grow through this feeling, I get we're human, we need to feel a range of emotions, but I don't wanna be stuck feeling sad for most of my days. I just wanna die. Fuck I cant go today, but my friend is counting on me to bring her a gift for someone, I hope my family and her will understand if I just cant go in today, I'm literally breaking down. How did I do it in the past without my magnesium pills, jesus. And Im taking vitamin D3 like the doctor said cause a lack of that vitamin can cause depression, but like jesus fuck I just wanna die, and I've been taking that pill and magtein for like months now and I'm back to feeling bad...and maybe a new version of bad cause now I'm slowly starting to cut myself, and beat myself up HAHA FUCKING KILL ME. ill go to school today, but I'm going to talk to my euro teacher, he needs to know what the fuck has been happening, unless he already knows cause he is a very intelligent man, I know he is. Fuck this depression. I know I'm not diagnosed, but if a doctor, a counselor, a father who had bad depression, and a therapist say I do, I think I pretty much have my answer... probably got anxiety too...fuck highschool."
1120,I really hate myself,"I hate everything about myself and I feel like everyone who looks at me finds me disgusting, and everyone who has to interact with me hates it. I feel like I can't connect with anyone. I just really don't know what to do. And even though I know struggles with mental health don't have an age limit, I feel like I've been dealing with this for too long, and everyone else I know around my age who struggles with mental help seems to at least be able to somewhat take part in society. Whenever I sit in a room with other people I don't even know what to do"
1121,fear of getting depressed?,"now, i have never been prone to depression, but i have this fear that it might start out of nowhere, its so fucking weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

also, im 18, can this shit be age related?

&amp;#x200B;

ended up lonely too"
1122,I don’t care about anything.,"I recently found out my Dad is cheating on my Mum. She doesn’t know. I haven’t told anyone. Feels like I should be pretty torn up about it. At least be angry or sad or something but I just - don’t care. I really don’t care. It hasn’t bothered me at all. I’m more bothered by the fact I’m so unbothered. It’s made me feel nothing and I feel exactly the same way toward my parents as I did before. 

My emotions just don’t work the same way anymore, I care about a few things still, like I still experience anger or sadness or excitement but a lot less, and not to the same extent or in the same way. I have no opinion about many things and things I enjoy doing or should enjoy doing make me feel nothing so I’m at a point where I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore, if it’s not making me feel what’s the point?"

1124,Have you ever actively avoid getting diagnosed with a mental disorder?,Because I have to in order for my transition from female to male to go smoothly. Even beyond that it’s a disorder that still has a lot of stigma tied to it so it could affect my life in ways beyond that. Although I should get help getting help can make things soooo much worse so I can’t. It’s so fucking stupid.
1125,Two part question here: What advice or suggestions have you received that was helpful in setting or maintaining boundaries? What areas of life feel the hardest to set or maintain boundaries?,
1126,"I'm suffering from sever Imposter Syndrome, I need help to stop thinking this way.","I think I'm suffering from imposter syndrome because I'm always thinking about how I'm not good at anything, how I'm never gon a be able to graduate college because of how stupid I am, and how no one likes me or wants to be my friend. The worst part is that I think I'm stupid and cant do anything right, so I'll get mad and not want to do any of my work as I think ""I'm to stupid to do this."" I guess I also have a high ego, or maybe just a low self esteem, as I HATE asking for help either because I'm afraid I'll be judged even though it's the tutor labs job to help me or because I'm afraid I'll be a burden even though it's the tutor labs job to help me! Although to be fair the math tutor lab is always so cramped and I never know who the tutors are or they're busy helping someone else, it's the same for my CS tutor labs but it's not as bad as I know who the tutors are there. 

The thing is, I dont have that bad of grades, my first semester GPA was a 3.177, yet I still think I'm a failure after failing a quiz, a test, or I just dont understand something right away so I get so demotivated to try and do better. It also doesnt help that my ""friend""/roommate is always saying how ""crap,"" except he uses a more vulgar word, I am at everything even though he doesn't even know how well or bad I'm doing. He says he says that stuff to be sarcastic, but he never says anything nice its literally just mean/hateful words 24/7. I get friends are gonna pick on each other but I still feel they should help boost/motivate each other too. Although I'm also probably just being a bit** like my roommate claims I am 24/7."
1127,Having a small dick has taken over my thoughts entirely and now I can barely function.,"I’m 4x4 so about half of what women desire and everyday living is getting harder.  I can’t stop hating myself internally   This was never a problem when I was young, but now that I am college age and people around me are sleeping with anyone and everyone I realise just how cursed I really am.  There’s no point for me to try anymore and I’m going to be celibate forever.  Not really looking for help I just needed to get this off my chest.  Life really sucks for me and I’ll never experience things normal people do because of something I’ll never be able to change"
1128,Slayer Threshold (how I feel everyday),"I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything can't you understand
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it

I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me

Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else
You're in my way

No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life

Never wanted bliss never wanted you
Never needed anyone I've polluted
Everything you feel everything you are
Everything you'll ever be you repulse me
It's always about you always come at me
With shit I can't identify you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me

Take it
Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it

Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way

1129,I feel selfish but I also care to much about other people and what they think?? Help please.,"I know the title sounds crazy but I constantly feel that way. I'll go out of my way for others then I will get called selfish for trying to do something for myself. As of now, I'm an 18  yr old in my senior yr of high school. When I was around 7 yrs old I started to have the need to make everyone around me happy and If I did something wrong or if I needed help, I would keep to myself to make sure that no one gets mad/annoyed at me. 

I'm still going through the same problem, sadly. Its one of my biggest faults because I will go out of my way for people, buy things for people when I have no money, I won't ever talk shit about anyone even if I don't like them or feel uncomfortable by their actions, if I'm sad I will keep my problems to myself because I don't want to burden my friends with my worries. I'm a big people pleaser and it's ***not*** a good thing. 

I've noticed that when I'm with people who aren't family I will go out of my way for them and do the most for them and I get called nice and sweet. But when I'm at home, with my mom, I've noticed that I get meaner. I will give attitude and make her feel badly. When my mom calls me out on it, I get ""weird""? Like I don't even know what to call it. It's like whenever I do something wrong and I get called selfish I want to bang my head on the wall or cut myself or stop eating for a few days (I never do it, though). But I don't know if i'm just manipulating myself to make myself seem like the victim in my own head or if there's something wrong with me. When this happens, I don't tell her that I feel this way, I just try to do my best to do as i'm told and not make her upset.

I know that this is a loaded question but I don't know what to do. I'm still in high school and whenever I tell my mom about something I have to do or if something is wrong with me she tells me that I'm being selfish for asking for her help. Maybe I am being selfish but I don't know where the line is anymore; I have the constant feel that I need to help everyone around me and when she calls me selfish I just want to hurt myself as punishment for messing up. What do I do?"
1130,"Im thinking going to psychiatrist, but im asking for your opinion about my condition","I'm not sure I'm good with explaining my own story, so please ask if you need more details.

I'm 18 and male, living in Indonesia. I work as software engineer in kinda bad management company and I make less than $250 a month. Since I was a kid, me and my big brother only have few friends from our neighborhood, I was kinda a boy avoided by older kids and I don't know why. And then when I was around 8-10 (I'm not sure because I couldn't remember much or specific about it) I was kicked from religion class and it makes me trauma and until now I have problem remembering religion things and I feel like I lost my interest into it (I think I'll do better if I have someone to support me). And then few years later my mother cheats and it makes me feel numb for years, and few year ago she did it again and it broke my heart

Sometimes I wish that I never been exist, and this kind of mindset has been in my mind for around 5 years, and since I was grade 10 I usually absent from 1-4 days a week (6 days a week), it's because I don't feel good to meet them, so I'm staying at home playing computer or learning something new. I always hate myself and I have to overthinking to sleep, I did scratch my left hand with scissors (I don't remember this until someone I told before tell me) or with my finger if my mind can't get better

And around 3 years ago I went to my teacher, and he was psychologist and I tell my story and he said I'm just fine, I don't have depression or any other. But I'm not believe him because I just feel ill somehow.

I think I can do something productive, and maybe it would help my career or maybe financial problems, but I just keep losing my interest and going watch porn (probably I find its the easiest way to satisfy myself). 

So what I'm asking is what actually happened in my mind and am I actually ill ? And thanks for reading, feel free to message me. Maybe we can be friend ?"
1131,2020 emotionally blunted,"Might be due to weed but I stopped smoking a month ago. I’ve had mental health issues for a long time but this year is so weird. On Christmas I was sexually assaulted and now I don’t feel anything. No, I didn’t report it :( okay I’m sorry. My mom works with the guy and she doesn’t take me seriously. I used to be so depressed and lazy and manic, now I’m depressed  and lazy and just hollow. My emotions are so hollow. I haven’t seen a therapist for it but I know I should. I don’t know how to recover from this. I don’t make much effort to talk to my friends and I don’t care on a level that is very new to me. Thanks for letting me rant"
1132,Feeling like not participating,"Me and my friend have the usual group that we go around with, but whenever going with them or walking to them i feel like i'm just needy and sticking around them instead of being a real ""member"""
1133,Hating what I used to love,"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot. I also posted in /r/depression, but I thought this could work too.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones.

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell.

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month.

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated."
1134,I’m really really considering ending everything,It’s scaring me and I don’t know what to do
1135,Does anybody else have trouble with patience in the long term?,"What I mean by this is that I’m just so frustrated that I have to go to school for 6 more years just to get to a point where I can maybe get a job that I enjoy. I’m generally pretty impatient when it comes to every day stuff do but this is different, it kinda makes me anxious in some weird way. Is this just me?"
1136,Yeahh,Because of my indecision my life has been at a total standstill for the last 4 years. I've told myself to just do it but i'm too hesitant. Urg
1137,Dont know what to do this my depression/suicidal thought. I NEED HELP!!!,So I'm lost been lost for years now and I'm think of end my life in my early 20s but in the back of my mind thought all the negative thought about myself I dont want too.
1138,Write a letter to yourself as a child,"If you’re feeling overwhelmed, down, or are beating yourself up, I really recommend writing a letter to your 8 year old self and imagining them in front of you.

This was recommended to me by a lot of people and once I did it, I cried a lot because I realized how badly I was speaking to myself. How much I doubt myself. And in doing so it really makes us more empathetic to ourselves and whatever struggles we may be facing. Imagining your child self in front of you as you right it, as though you are directly speaking to them, has a profound effect on how we view ourselves. Since we would never treat a child the way we may treat ourselves. 

I do this once a month just to ground myself and thought I’d recommend it to anyone who has tried journaling and found it ineffective or for someone who just wants to try something new! 

Remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re doing your best."
1139,Help with anxiety nausea,"My anxiety is so bad, I get nauseous, feel sick and just cry. I know what triggers it and it's such a silly reason that it makes me feel so pathetic. It's still trying to get over someone I have feelings for and so now they are going away for four days with friends, I'm racked with jealous, anxiety and anger. So many people say to have a distraction but I can't, there's nothing I have any passion to do. I'd love to meet new people but I have no way of doing so. I've tried dating apps to no avail. 

 I literally hate feeling this and I just want it stop"
1140,What’s a way to ask someone if they’re mad at me but not making it a loaded question?,"I have a bad habit of always thinking I’m bothering people and making people frustrated with me.

I want to ask if they’re mad at me but I feel like that is a loaded question and just gets people more frustrated.

What’s a way to ask someone if they’re mad at me or if I’m frustrating them without it being a loaded question?"
1141,I feel lonely,"I’m extremely sad I don’t have any friends. I’m 13, on the breaks everyone goes to their friends, not me. I don’t have anyone and if I try to say something they even don’t look at me. I feel like I’m worthless, ugly, Boring and wierd. I really don’t wanna live like this. I’m not that suicidal, just that I do want to feel recognized and feel like I’m a part of something. I’m outside the states and I hate exercise."
1142,Mental health service or medical service for diagnosis and treatment?,
1143,How do I make a Dr. appointment for mental health issues,"I’ve been having trouble for about nine months now, and I’ve really been meaning to do this since last September. I just don’t know what to say to the receptionist when I call to make the appointment. I’m in Canada and 19. Thanks for any help ik this is a dumb question."
1144,Hearing familiar voices in my head while very tired.,"Hello everyone. I’ve been hearing usually friendly voices while very tired for about 4 years now. Sometimes they call out my name, either maliciously or urgently, but most of the time I just hear friendly chatter, like the voices are talking to each other, yet I have a hard time remembering what they said.

I have no mental illnesses I know of that could cause this. Anxiety and S.A.D."
1145,Does anyone ever have moments of such clarity?,That you can see you've been in the middle of a storm but you just couldn't see it before and soon you won't see it again
1146,It baffles me how some people think it's ok to suddenly start yelling,[deleted]
1147,I Feel Like I've Been Left With A Brain Injury,"I feel like this depression that I've been in for the past 9 months has  left me with a brain injury. I feel like everything I've ever learned   has abandoned me. Expressing myself, even in the simplest of ways (like writing this post) is so  damn difficult. Has anyone else had an experience following a  depressive  episode where you needed to start over with everything? How  did you  move forward? How did you cope?"
1148,Reach out,"Hey everyone, I just want you to know that if you're struggling, feel free to DM me and we can chat about anything. Stuff related to mental health, hobbies, food, anything you want to talk about if you're feeling down and just need someone to talk to. I'm not a professional, just an aspiring high school teacher, but I'll check back several times a day to chat."

Gašpar decided some years ago to work more intensely on himself, to discover his highest potential and the things he loved the most. His curiosity for what life has to offer was immense and he followed his intuition. 

Now he pursues painting spiritual and intuitive paintings. He sees every painting or just the particles of it during meditation. He transfers those pictures – glimpses of it out onto the canvas and the whole image gets the true meaning. They are painted with an intention to bring a wider audience closer to the thought that we are all one, one energy and that everything is possible when we have a clear vision of our desires and future.

1150,Trying to do my bit to help others after struggling for over a decade.,"**I'm NOT selling anything here, no products and no services. But I am offering a link to my podcast which people who are struggling with anxiety might find useful** (does that count as self promotion? If I'm not trying to exploit sufferers like most people do who try to offer help).

Hi all, I've been experiencing anxiety, agoraphobia and panic attacks on and off for around 15 years now and a few years back I decided to document my struggles on YouTube. My channel is called Anxiety United, it's reasonably popular. Over the years I've tried numerous things to try and build free resources for people, create social networks for sufferers and a bunch of other things (I'm not looking for praise here). I always felt like I wanted to share what I've learnt over the years through various self-help books, therapists and peers.

The reason for this post is to inform anyone who might be interested in my latest Youtube series where I am speaking to authors of anxiety books, cbd experts, doctors, celebrities, professionals in various mental health conditions. Of course it's early days yet and I've only just filmed the first episode with an author, but the potential is there to actually make this something useful for people.

**My podcast called ""**[**The Breakdown**](https://anxietyunited.com/the-breakdown-podcast-ep1-drew-linsalata-from-the-anxious-truth/)**"" is available on** [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWod0TRCSWQ) **in video format and on Spotify for the audio only version.** I called it The Breakdown because I want to breakdown various elements of mental health, I want to learn more about treatments, medications, sufferers experiences and more. At the same time hopefully breaking down some of the stigma attached to mental health. I have a decent following on twitter with a bunch of celebrities who I hope to reach out to once the podcast gains some traction.

If you can spare some time, feel free to jump over and take a look at the pilot episode where I talk to an author and creator of The Anxious Truth. Any feedback, suggestions or even viewers would be great to help get this new podcast on the map. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWod0TRCSWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWod0TRCSWQ)

I built a website for sufferers to freely use a few years back where people can share their own experiences either in blog posts, videos or via the social network based on the website, you are of course welcome to come along and see - [www.anxietyunited.com](https://www.anxietyunited.com/)

Thanks in advance for any views of this post. I appreciate the time and hope you find my offerings useful.

**JUST WONDERING:** Why would we not be allowed to share something (even if it it self-promotion) if it is aimed a helping people who are struggling for **free**? If the purpose of any social media platform offering mental health information is to help, then surely resources should be shared and then allow people to make their own judgement."
1151,"Haven't been happy in a while, not sure why","Lately I just can't seem to get myself in a good mood. I'm either totally deflated to the point where I'd really rather just not come in contact with anyone or I'm really angry. It's probably been this way for 2-3 months now. I've had issues at times before but never this intense and for this long. I saw a doctor (just a general practitioner, not a therapist or anything) in September 2019 who ended up diagnosing me with SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder) but I don't agree with the diagnosis to be totally honest. The only mental illness I've ever though I might suffer from is ADHD or something along those lines. I'm a huge PC gamer and would play every night but now I can't even bring myself to open up a game, there's just no motivation and I know it's not gonna bring me out of my slump and I'm not going to get into it. I work at an office Mon-Fri 8a-5pm, recently they have been making alot of changes (Commission structure, management changes, etc) and it has definitely been aggravating, though I can't say I'm sure that's what's causing all this. Every day now I usually go home, stare at my Steam library for an hour not deciding to play anything, and end up turning on the TV and just falling asleep early. I have a girlfriend who lives with me and there's nothing wrong with the relationship whatsoever, we are happy together. I just can't figure out what to do, I so badly wish I wanted to do things and felt okay again. It's really gotten to the point where I can't even formulate a response when someone tells me a joke or tries to be friendly with me, I just want them to go away."
1152,Why did I have to be a piece of shit?,I put on make-up because I think i would look better. After I put it on I still feel ugly. I try to do something different with my hair. I try different colors and styles and I still hate it. My eyebrows are terrible. Seriously I feel like (and I probably am) the ugliest person in the world. Seriously why do I have to be so ugly?
1153,Scared of losing imaginary friend.,"I talk to myself everyday since I was young and still do. It's not someone or stranger or illusion that talk with me but myself talking with myself, verbally, I only talk in my room so nobody knows it. We chat like very close friends. And one day I told someone I know about this, she said that is imaginary friend, it is okay. But I feel like I don't want to have imaginary friend anymore because  I'm sure it's a coping mechanism for loneliness and isolation I feel deep inside. But I don't know what to do or replace it. I'm weird, I don't have much friends, and my imaginary friend is someone I could trust with all my heart. So when I think I'll stop talking to myself, I'm scared of loneliness and of losing imaginary friend.

What should I do."
1154,How do you focus amidst OCD and anxiety?,"I spent the majority of last year in a panic/OCD spiral about my health and it really damaged my marriage. My wife is already pretty type-A and I really let my duties around the house and to our family slide from June until November last year, and like I said, it hurt our marriage.

I got off of weed in November and have striven to be better every day, and largely I have improved, but I'm still not at 100% with keeping the house clean, and she's got her own anxiety about her health (worried she's very ill, we don't see the doctor for 2 more weeks) so we're both on raw nerves right now. 

I'm doing my goddamndest to be better every day and not let my anxiety overtake me, but it's very difficult to not let my OCD/rumination take hold when I feel like she's being distant or not flirty or talkative or that she's just pissed in general. The way my brain works, I infer the worst possible scenario (she's fed up, doesn't want to wait for my full improvement and wants a divorce), then I get anxious and compulsively check messages to see if she's just wanting to chat, then I get internally defensive (how would I react if she wanted a divorce/imaging that I would be better off/etc).

This mental behavior monopolizes my time, makes me feel like garbage and question my reality, but worse it undermines my progress because in the back of my head, I feel like it's possible nothing I do will save our marriage (the same thing I felt when I had health anxiety - that nothing I was doing would keep me from having cancer/dying from some disease).

The therapist I'm seeing can't get me in until late this month, and she's not exceptionally helpful anyway, mostly just listens to me and sides with me, not offering any real solutions. I'm on the right path but my brain is undermining my progress. How do I snap out and push through to daily self-improvement despite this anxiety and obsession? Thanks for any advice."
1155,How to come to peace with things you can't control as a 17 year old?,I've tried browsing the web for answers but they are all useless they say you can't control it so don't worry about it but that's why I'm mad I can't change it how do you come to accept shit like this?
1156,Thoughts on how to move forward,"Hi MH,

I'm 26. I studied engineering for a while when I was younger. was super depressed, hated being in an office was very frustrated with a lot of things in my life and coped with it in risky ways. Got laid off my web development job and never finished my engineering degree -- I was super depressed and frustrated with sitting in an office all day to the point that I was suicidal. Started getting into hiking and had this ""moment of clarity"" that THIS IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. Like wow all of these years of therapy and all that and hiking is all I need to feel okay? Sweet. Let's do this.

Went back to school for a degree in recreation so that I could be outside as much as possible, with the thought of going into therapeutic recreation. Seemed reasonable. But as I was going back to school one of my best friends died from an overdose and I was so upset I needed a way to cope -- cool I'm gonna go hike the Appalachian Trail when I graduate. and I'm going to hike it in his honor. Just so I can get myself through this, because I'm not great at classroom learning. Did well in school, Dean's List, did an internship with a program that gets kids with learning disabilities get outside (hard but loved it). Graduated, though my last semester my mental health was not doing great.

Hiked the trail. Amazing! I felt like i was doing the thing I was meant to do! I loved it, until I got injured right at the end. Had some really intense anxiety as a result, trained for a program doing wilderness therapy while injured, thinking it was what I really wanted to do. Realized that not only was this the wrong place for me but I had a night where I feel like I kind of broke. Where everything I had ever done that was impulsive and shitty just came back into my brain (which was a lot through my early 20s) and I had such an anxiety attack that I'm still feeling it months later, and I'm feeling so paralyzed by fear of the future, fear that I've totally ruined my reputation in a number of places, that people all agree that I'm just not a good person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I screwed up a friendship because I was putting my mental health things on him and he couldn't take it. I ultimately had to move home and am getting intensive therapy and back on medication. and now I'm terrified that I've entered a field where health insurance and decent pay is not really a thing. but I feel like I can't go back to an office job. and I just don't really see a path forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on this? advice? I just feel like my career path is totally fucked now because of my employment history. and I'm so scared of the future and feel like I've thrown away my 20s. looking at the job market terrifies me and I don't know what to do."
1157,Stuck thoughts: an anxiety symptom,"Does anyone get these?
They are repetitive /unwanted thoughts or one thought that, in my case, obsess over.  
I literally can’t get that thought out of my head it repeats itself . unless I vocalize it out loud (to myself) or write it down over
And over again it  will go away. Like an OCD thought.
It’s something I’ve recently developed with my anxiety. 

Just curious as to what others do to get out of that loop."
1158,Need Advice,"I'd rather not go into specific details, but I have a diagnosed issue that I've been seeing a psychiatrist about. The past few months have been pretty good, but things started to take a turn for the worse recently. 2 days ago something happened that was really disturbing to me, and I spent the night drinking all of the alcohol that I had on hand. Though I really don't truly trust anyone, the person who I do trust the most checked in on me and decided to come over to help. I told this person a lot, not only about this incident, but about my thoughts in general, including many that I have in times that I would consider myself in good mental health. I could tell this person was disturbed as I talked and at one point started crying and shortly there after left. I know they care about me, but it seems I've hurt them with the truth of my thoughts. I am getting more professional help as soon as I can, but of course, that is weeks away. This person is checking on me, so I've been lying and saying it was just the alcohol and that I'll be fine, when I know that, despite my intoxication, I knew what I was saying and I meant every thing I said. I'm not in crisis. I'm not a danger to myself or others, but I'm not terribly functional either. The person made a specific point about not lying to them and how it just causes more pain for the people who care, but that is only if there is a fallout for them to learn about later. It will be super rough, but I'm reasonably confident I can make it to my appointment alone at which point I'll have the help of professionals and would be able to be more honest with the person without leaning on them entirely and causing them pain. I don't know what to do. Should I wait it out? Should I be honest? Of course there is the third option which would be to expand my support network, but forcing myself to trust another person would be more painful for me than waiting alone."
1159,untitled,"There's a maze you must travel through.

You see others make their way already.

You don't know what's in the maze.

Rather than joining others with discovering what the maze has to offer, you notice the walls surrounding yourself.

Yes! An escape! You admire your superior intelligence as you try to scale the walls around you. 

After many days of trial and error, you **finally** make it over those walls only to see nothing on the other side.

There you are, trapped in the void. Instead of facing your fears, you opt to avoid everything. 

Now you have to waste all your time again trying to get back over, this time with nothing but yourself to help you. 

But.. Wait... What if I there's another shortcut? Surely, within all the nothingness, there must be a secret path hidden somewhere.

You could put more effort this time and climb back over. You could meet up with the people you've lost, you could see what is on the other side, even if it takes longer.

1160,Brain Fog/ Feel like a failure,"I'm posting in hopes of getting responses from people who've gone though/go through similar experiences.

I haven't gone to a doctor or therapist but I believe I may have moderate to severe OCD and anxiety but I just don't know. These last three years I've been doing everything very slowly. My schoolwork, thought processing, chores, showers, you name it. It feels like my brain is all fogged up. I overthink every single thing before I do it. An essay that would have taken someone else 1-2 hours takes me 8 hours. Yesterday, I was solving a physics problem and what takes me 3-4 minutes in my head took me an hour and a half all because the way I wrote a number seemed wrong. I know I'm being ridiculous when I do this but I can't stop.

I study all the time and understand my work but I'm a blank slate when a test comes around. It's like I never studied it before and yet I'm able to solve it when I leave the class or go home. I constantly feel like a failure. I'm literally failing school as of now and I'm so tired of this. I'm anxious all the time and I'm so worried about my future and it looks like I have good reason to be.

During high school, my grades weren't the best but I've been really trying these past 2 and a half years. I want to be able to go to post-secondary this fall but I don't know with the way things are going. This is seriously affecting my life. Everything I do has to be perfect or I don't know. I'm posting this because I flunked my Physics test an hour ago, came home early and broke down. I solved the exact same problem during my review last night (and I got it right). I'm so tired of living like this. I'd like to know if there's anyone else who feels this way because I'm completely lost."
1161,Need Advice/Venting (Long Post),"Ok, this problem isn’t as serious as others on this sub but it is really eating at me, and I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with this, and how they overcame it. It’s kind of strange and I’m really bad at explaining things so please bear with me.

So there is this person in my life who is very special to me. She reminds me on a daily basis that life isn’t so bad and she lifts me up whenever I need it, and I do the same for her. I’ve known her for a long time and I have very specific feelings toward her.

Now, there is another person in my life, who I detest, and who always finds a way to make me hate him even more every time I see him. However I usually have a good time blocking him out of my mind, but back in November, something happened that cause me to think about him constantly. It became so bad that I began to subconsciously associate him with things that I love, even though they have no correlation at all. I know it’s all in my head but it’s like I can feel him haunting me, and it’s diving me insane.

Then came December. I was having a pretty bad day and then my thoughts turned to Person #2 again. I tried to block him out and I happened to be thinking about Person #1 again, and then I started getting these intrusive thoughts where I would imagine his last name as hers, and think her name when I see his, and basically it’s like their identities melded together.

The only thing is that these two people could not be any more different. They have completely different personalities, they look nothing like one another, they sound nothing like one another, and they don’t even know that each other exists. There is ZERO connection between the two, and I have two very different emotions associated with each of them. But, my brain being my brain, decided to equivocate my emotions towards Person #1 and I began to believe false things like “she’s always reminded you of him” and “she’s just like him” or “Person #1 (Insert P2’s last name here)”. I these thoughts are complete absurdity whipped up by my brain, but my brain keeps telling me these things and I’ve spent every single day of the past three months fighting against it. And I’ve ended up gaslighting myself into subconsciously linking the two, and I don’t want them to be linked. I know they aren’t linked, there is no logical reason for them to be linked and I want to break this link, but I don’t know how. I can still see P1 as herself, but it’s just that subconscious feeling lying to me, and I want it to stop. How can I get P2 to stop haunting my every thought, it’s driving me fucking insane.

Sorry for the novel, I don’t realize I had so much to vent. Has anyone dealt with this before?"
1162,What happened to me??,"Hi alll,

I don’t really know what to do with this and when in doubt, ask the internet, right?

(TL;DR I experienced intense and sudden ‘ups’ and ‘downs’ in mood, that went away without notice or reason)

2 years ago I really believed that I had bipolar. I experienced violent ups and downs that came on suddenly and without relevance to my life, I read all the articles and identified with all the symptoms.

During the up periods the most noticeable sign I had was the intense connection and feeling of oneness with the world around me and a sort of grand importance to life. I felt far more confident, social and forward. I got party happy, drug happy, outgoing and my anxiety lowered immensely. My sex drive and sexual confidence both greatly increased, my fashion and makeup choice were much more brave and over the top. I would sleep way less and have way more energy, Most nights I would spend the early hours of the morning pacing up and down my kitchen, feeling wired, brain moving incredibly fast and feel no worse for it the next day. I felt incredibly motivated and was incredibly productive. 

Sometimes when this feeling was quite extreme I would experience quick fire intense anger or irritation like I’ve never had before or outside of this state. Something as stupid as someone not watching as they crossed the road would make me want to punch them. I would go quickly through intense emotions and be furious one minute and crying the next. When it reached these states it felt like things were  too fast and too much. I felt overwhelmed and sometimes paranoid.

During down periods I felt crushingly depressed, all sense of time and scale when out the window, I could have only been feeling that way for a week but it would be like that’s all I’d ever felt and all I would ever feel. Nothing mattered despite me having strong plans for my life that I cared about deeply. I slept all day and skipped a lot of study because getting out of bed seemed impossible.

For the good part of two years I experienced this. As a teenager beforehand I had had multiple bouts of severe depression but never a period of ‘up’, and the depression I’d experienced had lasted for longer times. 
The periods of up and down generally lasted a few weeks with some of the downs being a few months; all of them sudden, and with hardly any normal.

And then, it just stopped.

I spent months being anxious to go up or down again, and dreading it, as more time passed it slowly left my mind. It’s been about a year and a half since a distinct period of either and life is fine but I really want to know what happened to me and I think about it often, I wasn’t going through trauma or anything significant that would cause something like that to happen and then just stop. 

Does anyone have any ideas?"
1163,"Five years later, I’m finally being seen.","I’ve been trying to get into therapy through the VA for years now. They gave me the run around multiple times, put me on a wait list, wouldn’t return my phone calls with open appointment times as they promised, etc. I had given up for a little while. I finally got in contact with someone a little over half a year ago that once again, had promised to return my call with their availability. To my surprise, they called me back last month and gave me a date. That date is today. I never thought this day would come! Before anyone says anything about why I didn’t just see a civilian doctor, I had bad experiences with two pervy doctors when I was a teenager so I’ve been anti-doctors for a really long time. The idea of being alone in someone’s establishment at my most vulnerable trips me out due to those experiences. Yes, I’m aware not all doctors are like that but guess what? I am a product of my past. Alas, I bit the bullet and decided to go so I can be a better human for my tiny humans. I don’t know what to expect, but I do know that even if it helps me get one more good day a year, it’s one more day that I woke up and chose life. I hope this reaches someone who feels the weight of the world on their shoulders and prompts them to find the strength to make it through today &amp; kickstart their path towards happiness. Even if existing is all you do, tomorrow you will have pulled through another day! If that person is you, I send you all of my love and all of my light."

1166,Girlfriend tried to kill herself because I was angry. Cant stop blaming myself,"So I was dating this girl for a while. Near the end of the relationship things became unhealthy. During the breakup she said one of the reasons is because she is interested in another guy. I was really torn up about this and I said several things about how angry and disappointed I was. I told her I couldn't stand her. I regret saying this. She kicked me out, and I just found out she tried to kill herself after that. She deleted me on social media and I'm doing my best not to reach out to her because I know that would make it worse.

I am dealing with an incredible amount of guilt for this. I can't stop shaking knowing that I caused someone I love to resort to that. I can't forgive myself and I don't know what do to. I wan't to talk to her and tell her how sorry I am but I am forcing myself to wait a few weeks, and even then I doubt she will talk to me. I really going through it right now and I need any advice I can get."
1167,What's wrong with me,"I'll try to keep this concise. 

This entire ongoing year I've had weird sensations in public, where basically everyone's faces look a bit weird and I start to feel uneasy. At the same time I feel 'numb' in a way when this is happening. It usually happens in crowded places like subways, but also when I'm walking in the city with a friend or whoever.

I also feel a bit derealized at random moments, and I'll have thoughts and sensations like 'how the hell am I conscious, why am I in this world?' and the like. When I'm home though, I feel at ease and rarely thoughts like this come up.

I think it might have something to do with anxiety, and I am quite an anxious person, paranoid even. But when these sensations happen, my heart doesn't start racing and I don't start sweating or anything like that. It almost feels like my brain numbs my sensations to avoid nervousness in certain situations. 

Last summer I also had a really strong experience like this; I was walking outside and I thought that I had died and I was living in some kind of a purgatory. I wasn't a 100% convinced, but nevertheless it was a strong feeling. This was probably due to the weed I was smoking at the time, although I only smoked once every 2 weeks or so. I've since quit and haven't smoked weed in ~6 months.

I hope I've been descriptive enough but as you might know, it's pretty hard to describe emotions and feelings, atleast for me. Hopefully some of you know/have gone through what I'm going through yourself and can help me with advice. Thanks."

I've had an influx of irrational suicidal thoughts and extreme insomnia since we tapered off this last bit of my SSRI. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow, but he said this might happen getting off the last bit of it. But I'd rathed hear your guys thoughts and experiences then these doctors. 

Thanks guys! Reading your guys comments really helps."
1170,Sorry this is super long but basically: how the hell can I make my brain actually believe that I'm in a better place now,"Before I begin I just want to say that I already know therapy etc is an option. I am not looking for something to replace or equate therapy, I'm not looking for a unrealistic quick fix and I'm well aware there is none. Just wondering if there are people out there that feel what I do, or have overcome it! 

Quick backstory: had an overall nice childhood but ever since I was younger I've felt a little ""off"". As I grew up I enjoyed being different, I enjoyed attention and being seen. I can't recall ever questioning myself or my self esteem at all during this time. Then, as I got older, I completely changed. Probably because of puberty but also other things. I completely changed from a kid that lived to stick out to one that would die to fit in. I was awkward, I felt awkward, I think many relate. 

I went to a new school, where I did not fit in. I can't say I was bullied, I was at times picked on and kind of an outsider. That's not to say I didn't have friends, I did, and I honestly don't know if other people also saw me as an outsider or if it was mainly in my head. Anyways, kids suck, they can be rude, and they were. This caused me to subconsciously avoid and feel threatened by certain people, such as kids my age, popular kids etc. I mean, I was there and I lived it, but I haven't given it much thought. I've come to the conclusion ""this really hurt my self esteem and those people are assholes"". 


Now I've changed A LOT as a person, I'm a lot more mellow and insightful and I'm happy with who I am. I feel wiser and more stable, I love my life and myself a lot more! And it's great! But recently it feels like everything from that earlier period of my life has been let loose, like it's bleeding into my life. I have never been diagnosed with anything and I have never gone to see a professional, but I'd have suicidal thoughts at times, but generally just really depressing thoughts. I'm in a new school now, and it's quite great, more specifically, people are really nice and mature. Like there is literally not one rude person. 

But my brain still feels like there is, it's like it's completely ingrained in my brain that I'm unlovable and unlikeable, I'll get these thoughts that my ~friends secretly hate me~ and I 100% know they don't, but the feeling of that thought is unavoidable. Being in a room, like in a class, causes my brain to just completely bombard me with self deprecating thoughts. And the thoughts are so primitive, I know they're not true. Things like ""you're ugly, you're really annoying, you could literally just disappear and no one would notice"", just imagine the most primitive insults you can think of and that's it. 

I feel quite confident, I have a genuine love for myself. I am not afraid of doing things, these thoughts about my self worth don't show themselves physically, only as thoughts in my head. I really don't know how to put words to the feeling but, it's like there's two parts of my head, myself and some nasty bastard that hates me. I get that from reading this it doesn't seem like I have good self esteem at all lol, but I feel a genuine tenderness for myself and I trust myself fully. I feel like I actively like myself, while a part of my brain hates me. 

And I know why this is, it's because of these previous instances in my life were I were led to believe I was unworthy of respect, all of those things. It's so deeply ingrained in me, and I don't know how to get rid of it. Feeling more confident has not made them decrease, it has only made me loathe those thoughts more as I know I don't deserve them. It is seriously messing things up for me, for example, i notice that if I meet a person that is similar to those that were mean to me, I'm scared of them. I guess in a way it's a prejudice, but even if i know they're a nice person my body physically reacts to them because of fear. 

I don't want to loath or fear people, and I don't want to loath myself, so my question after this fucklong post is: is there a way to feel worthy again? Is there a way to clearly tell my body and brain that the danger is over? No matter how much I'm loved or reassured, it's like I ""forget"" it after a while, like that love and reassuring doesn't stick in my brain. 

If anyone has read this far thank you??? Also I'm very sorry I'm on mobile :')"

I have a difficult time with intimacy because someone did something very bad to me when I was little. So many people have abandoned me. I’m really sick of waking up every morning. I fucking hate it all."
1177,Is this a thing with my mental illness or...,"Something else? My brain has been doing this thing recently where it will lag or skip moments. Sometimes it feels like 10 minutes but it’s a second or two and sometimes it’ll be a minute or two and feel like a second. Background: Diagnosed anxiety and depression and accidentally fell off my SSRI antidepressants a few weeks ago (so this could also be a withdrawal from those thing) 

Help?"

1180,Psychologist forgets every week what I said,"I‘m at my first psychologist since about 3 months. I am afraid of having schizophrenia and hallucinating and that causes me to be pretty uncomfortable through the whole day by never knowing if what I saw is real. That‘s why I‘m at a psychologist now and it doesn‘t seem to help at all. She forgets what I said every week. I had to tell her so many times my drug history and stuff. At least 3 times...? I‘m also pretty shy and am not able to just talk to people or say if something botheres me, and she said we will for sure try to practice that in the next lesson but we never did. I don‘t know if it‘s my fault for not bringing it up again or idk. Is this normal? Thanks in advance and sorry for my english..."
1181,Fear Manipulation,"Hi All, 
Do you have a better word/name for the behavior of fear/aggression based Manipulation?
Thanks!"
1182,A Reminder to All,"“Just cause you got the monkey off your back, does not mean the circus has left town” - George Carlin

When you start to feel better, whether it’s from medication or your own holistic interventions. It seems the battle is never won, when you have an illness. I know that I will be constantly in a mode of extreme self-care. That is what the non-ill don’t understand. We constantly have to put our minds to staying well, whereas someone without an illness, never has to make the space in their minds. They are free to think whatever, where we must think about why we feel, the way we feel. Stop things from breaking down. When you reach healing keep on striving. Stigma is discrimination and should be treated as such. But until it is, KEEP fighting! I love you, and the world loves you too!

And don’t forget the George Carlin quote above."
1183,What to do when my family gets worried about me,"Basically to make a really long story short,  I don't have the best luck with relationships. I ended my last one because I felt it was for the better but my parents act all concerned because I didnt go further with it. I know it's true because every now and then they still ask if I talk to him or regret leaving him, the answers always no.

The last guy that wanted to hook up with me was for the completely wrong things and I didnt want to involved with any of that. Ever since then I stayed to myself and pretty much stayed single.

If theres any advice on what I can say to my parents when they ask if I'm ever getting married or date, anything can help."
1184,"I just discovered that people actually like being with me, and I don't know how to feel.","My little cousin (she's 11) and other family members came to visit my family and me. I spend most of my time alone in my computer. She left yesterday, and the day before, she told me, with a kind of angry-dissapointed voice ""I just want to do anything at all with you"". And I thought, wow, I'm an ASSHOLE! She just wanted to spend some time with me and I neglected her. I wonder how much this happens. Because apparently people genuinely and wholeheartedly enjoy my company, but I don't understand why. I don't know what there's about me to like so much. I'm so replaceable. And because I don't understand it, I just don't spend time with the people I love. It seems pointless. They could be with someone that's actually worth it. I moved with my dad last year, and everyone else in my previous house was kind of upset with me because they would miss me. I'm not playing the victim card here, I genuinely don't get it. And I've come to the conclussion that people love me, and I know it, but I don't feel it all. Compliments, hugs, ""I love you""s and ""I missed you""s make me confused and a bit upset, because it doesn't make sense to me that someone could say that to me and mean it. I realized that when I'm with my friend, I get so anxious about her being bored because I don't understand that she might just... like being there with me. I don't know what to do and I'm thinking isolating myself would be best(?"
1185,I don’t want to be alive,Last day here
1186,How do I deal with my passive aggressive brother?,"So as of late, my older brother has been really passive-aggressive with me.  Just this morning, I asked him why he wasn't paying more rent, because I know our mom makes less money than he does, but she pays more rent. He responded with ""because it's none of your business"". It hurt a lot, and I'm not really sure why. It's been going on for a year, and I'm getting tired of it. 
How would you all recommend I deal with it? I'm trying to tell him, but I'm afraid he's going to be dismissive of my feelings, like he always is."
1187,I got a second dog and have slipped back into depression because of that,"I have a shih tzu and she means the world to me, I’ve had her for as long as I can remember and she’s been with me through all of my worst days, my mum’s death, she would comfort me when I would got drunk and threw up all the time, often stop me from hurting myself, she is the reason why I’m alive today and was able to get out of being numb or suicidal all the time. She’s always been enough but my dad and I had always thought about getting a second dog then we got the opportunity to rescue one from a friend of his who wasn’t able to care for his husky anymore.

At first, I was excited, I love animals and so I assumed that getting him would help me have a reason to stop staying at home in my room all day (my brother takes our shih tzu out) since I know how much exercise huskies need, I thought forcing myself out of the house would do good but it hasn’t. We got him and he instantly bonded to me but my shih tzu was not a fan of him. As he’s bonded to me he sleeps in my room and follows me literally everywhere, which means I don’t get to see my shih tzu very much who used to be the one to follow me around all the time and sleep in my room. He is poorly trained and I have been left with the responsibility of getting him lessons and training him until he’s more comfortable with my siblings. The poor dog is very anxious and only trusts me at the moment, so of course it’s my responsibility to do this.

He trusts me and I care about him a lot but I’m not happy unlike everyone else in my house who’re all ecstatic to have him. I feel like I’ve strayed way too far away from my comfort zone. I know this is probably a really stupid thing to cause me to spiral and I’m an awful person for thinking like this but I just needed to vent and see if getting this off my chest will help me get through this, I don’t want to have to make him move away from another home. 

I don’t know if this is the wrong place to talk about this and I’m sorry if it is."
1188,"I am a 24/m suffering a mild form of Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Today I had a major meltdown that I never want to repeat.","My mom was dropping me off at home today from work. 

She stopped at a yellow light and put here brakes on coming to a halt putting her over the big white line and with the pedestrian walk partially covered. 

Since I had anticipated this for quite a few moments prior, this provoked a major meltdown. 

I began screaming at the top of my lung and cursing and immediately began threatening suicidal topics. 

I have very weak emotional control and can't be doing this shit at my age (Rainman/1988 with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise). 

I don't want people to be scared of me, it makes me feel terrible. I want to appear as a kind, caring and very gentle person. 

Which is why I always have a clean shave now, and want to look as young and clean as I can. 

I don't want to take family for granted, nobody knows the last time I'll ever see someone. 

At 24-years-old, I should be very thankful to still have both my biological parents with me today. 

If my mom stops at a yellow light (many many mothers do), that is out of a mother's natural love and protection for children and I'll gladly wait the 30 seconds or however long it takes for the light to change."
1189,Suggestions for medication?,"(this is an alt account). So to make a long story short, I'm mildly autistic, have (diagnosed) depression and anxiety. I am currently taking escitalopram and risperidone, but I dont think the ladder is helping much. I've had the dosage upped twice but I still have breakdowns almost once a week now. Does anyone have any suggestions for an antipsychotic that would be any better? I'm looking for something that could possibly calm me down day to day since I'm not a fan of my personality. Please tell me if this is the wrong subreddit or if theres somewhere I should look. I will obviously just take these suggestions to my doctor, and not self prescribe any meds. Feel free to ask any questions."
1190,I’m having a nervous breakdown and panic attack,I’m really depressed it’s hard to function. Is that something I need to go to the hospital for or can they see me in out patient. I don’t have a psychiatrist or therapist
1191,Not Feeling Well,"Not sure if I'm allowed to post this here, but I don't know where else I can. Just failed a midterm and have been feeling horrible for the past few months. Today I finally broke down and ended up crying for the most of the day so far. I'm studying Computing Science right now and it's really hard. I don't know whether I genuinely hate programming or I dislike it because I don't seem to understand it. Overall I lack the motivation to study, and work. But I also don't know how to find a fix to this problem as I have been aware of it for the past few months. I also don't have a lot of friends, and I don't feel I have a strong relationship with the ones I do have. Relationships with my family are weak as well, I rarely speak with them and don't really know what to talk about. I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just lazy, but I don't feel very good either way. Sorry for the rambling and formatting, but I just needed to tell someone."
1192,How to develop an identity when there's none?,"Hello, everyone. 

I have a question that I think you guys might be able to help me with I have BPD obviously and I am currently incapable of developing on identity. I never really had a like a stable identity mainly because I grew up. You know all the time on the internet and I was pretty much you could say that I was educated by the internet. So when I came to real life later when I when I got older I still related a lot to you know, the previous education that I had via watching TV shows and movies in English. That's why my English is very good I'd say. About My native language, that's what I have trouble with. 

talking to people. I'm very very shy and I stutter a lot but only when I'm with people if I'm alone in my room I can talk very fluently, but it seems inauthentic to me. So I think it might it might be a coping mechanism because if I am capable of speaking fluently alone in my room then I should be able to speak the same way with friends or family (people who know me and therefore have a preconception of how I should express myself , but I'm worried that if I start speaking like that with people who know me, they will feel like I am faking it because to them it  won't seem ""authentic"". 

So basically I think it comes from fear of what people who've known me for years will think of me when I no longer stutter therefore breaking their expectations of you I should be. And I feel this is the thing that's stopped me from being fully myself and do the things I want to do. I've lost all my confidence because of this. 

This is going to be harder than I thought to explain. I am capable of speaking fluently and you know having an identity behind closed doors, but once I go out into the world with my family and friends I get this kind of mental block because the idea that I think they have of me is one that I have to keep up that shy stuttering guy . Listen, so, how do I switch from my inherited person to my ""real personality"" ? And I mean, how do I get that into the real world without seeming fake because all of a sudden I will be so confident and you know what I mean?

And as I already said this identity that I've created developed, but that's hidden from the world. I developed it by watching  TV shows and movies and listening to music internet culture. You know that all that jazz. So when I'm abroad for example, I was in France like three months ago and I could speak French with the locals but when I did that I changed into a whole persona, one which was perfectly comfortable using French mannerisms and the like in front of complete strangers! not perfectly but they were about they were able to understand what I was saying. Then when I went to London, same thing happened. I could be whoever I wanted to be because they were strangers. They didn't know me so Yeah, I just used my you know, my English that I know and for me it's kind of strange because whenever I switch to a different language, it seems like I'm I'm acting because I'm not just speaking the language. I also I also have an accent which I got from God knows where I had this mannerism which by the way come so easily to do they're like second nature. So it's like a different Persona. I dont know if I'm explaining myself correctly, but this is so hard. But then when I switch to my native language, I mean I can still do it but not with people that I know, because with them I get very very shy and I just get myself into a mental block, all of a sudden I develop a speech impediment . And yeah, I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to overcome this or or any books on the subject about, you know, creating creating a new identity  when you have none. I really appreciate it. If someone, you know could have some insight into this and I imagine that some of you guys have also been going through this in. I would like to know how how did you overcome it? I know this is a long post but I am desperate. So if you reached all the way here, thank you so much for reading it. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

Might taking acting classes help?"
1193,How to manage anger.,"Hi everyone. So, I (24f) don't consider myself an angry person, but sometimes I have a really hard time letting go of these feelings and thoughts that bother me. I'll let it bother me for 2-4 days constantly replaying scenarios in my head over what I'm angry about. I've gotten way better about being open with my partner, but sometimes it's still tough. The main issue is when it comes to my family. I have a very rocky relationship with my sister (30f) and it's been this way for about the last 6 years. We also live in the same home with my parents. I've realized lately that the anger I have towards her is because I'm afraid of her. She has had a difficult time dealing with her own mental issues.  She means well but she gains her power from yelling at others and trying to stand her own ground by feeling like she's in control. I have been hurt my her many times and when I let my guard down and trusted her with my feelings, she hurt me again. This anger comes from us not talking and communicating because like I mentioned I'm 1. Afraid of her and 2. Have a hard time speaking to her because of the anger I hold onto. How do I deal with these feelings? I was alright for a while, but lately it's getting the best of me."
1194,And I’m the crazy one?!?!? (A rant),"Me and my ex have been broken up nearly 4months, reason for the break-up I had a paranoid breakdown. At first she was still seeing me and my little girl then she started playing mind games etc. There’s been zero contact with her or her family for weeks then Wednesday the police turned up at my place of work. Because she had rang them saying she was worried about my mental state of mind and possibly a danger to life...... and in the same breath asked the police to tell me she doesn’t want any contact from me.......... WTF there hasn’t been contact in weeks and she could have asked any of my mates how I’ve been doing etc but rang the police instead...... I don’t know what she wanted to achieve from this but all it’s done is piss me off when I’ve been doing fine for once, cracking on with life etc and make the people I work with block her off all social media etc so she doesn’t know anything of what I’m upto etc"
1195,lethargy,"lately I've been curious about  lethargy specifically lethargy from conditions such as depression, anxiety and I am curious about other people's experience as my experience will definitely be different to everyone else . So if you experience lethargy or have experienced it, I would be really grateful if you could answer the questions below (if you don't feel comfortable sharing it, then you can message me your answers).

Thank you.

1. when did you begin to experience fatigue and how has it changed over time?
2. where does your lethargy come from?
3. does fatigue prevent you from doing things?
4. what do you feel mentally and emotionally when you experience fatigue?
5. do you find that because of lethargy, it affects your memory and communication?
6. how does it disrupt your day?
7. what is your sleep pattern like?
8. what do you do to make yourself feel better?
9. what makes you feel calm and feel comfortable?
10. (optional) what is your most recent experience with lethargy/fatigue?"
1196,Had a great day but got home and everything goes down,"So I had a great day. Woke up early, went to all my classes, actually understood things. Then gym and yoga class. 
Came back home and the world was crashing down. The two sentences that stuck with me was my dad saying ""If I go down everyone is going with me"" and my mom saying pretty much she prefers my cousin over me (my cousin is my age). 
Been crying since.
I'm trying to do the things that help me, and today was a great example, came home jamming to lizzo in the car, but for what?!?!?!? I come home and everything still sucks, I still feel worthless and want to die. I'm trying but it's not worth it"
1197,I don’t know what to do,"Hi! So, I made a post here a while ago that didn’t get any replies and I’m not salty or anythjng, to be fair it was kind of a mess :P I’ve been spending the last hour or so writing a post and ADJSKDLF I accidentally deleted the whole thing. So, I’m going to try and summarise it just to get it posted soon.

So yeah: I’m not really doing well with mental health sort of, I haven’t been diagnosed with depression or anything which kind of makes me feel as if my feelings aren’t as valid but idk... anyway, just if this is important, I’ve never been to a therapist before but I would like to possibly. I’m also fifteen and I’m male.

To start with, school is ok for me. It’s not awful but maths is... let’s not even talk about that 🙃 but I love English, reading and writing and all that stuff. It’s great. But I can’t seem to get my head around maths, some things I do get but the stuff I don’t just so happens to be the stuff that comes up in tests more... but I’ll stop going on about school now :P basically I just sort of feel... unmotivated, at times. I sometimes have bursts of confidence and get really into contributing in class, answering the teacher’s questions and stuff but at other times... yeah.

Moving on, I feel very anxious about the coronavirus situation. My parents tell me it’s nothing to worry about, but all the same... I just pray that it will have died down soon. I’m worried about our holiday to London next month, I just don’t know if we should go and if it’s worth it. I mean, yeah it’s worth going but specifically in these times? I don’t know. And yes, I do wash my hands a lot but probably excessively, let’s be real. Speaking of which, I sort of have to do these things or else I feel like something is going to go wrong (I know that’s basically the textbook definition of OCD but I don’t want to be hasty in self-diagnosing). I have this dumb thing where I say “don’t worry, it’s fine, ok” as a sort of phrase that I feel obligated to say. I probably sound so stupid, so I’m sorry if I do."
1198,Suicidal when Angry?,Is this a normal thing when I get angry I get really suicidal? Sometimes when my mother makes me mad and I want to do it just to spite her. I love my mother very much but when she makes me angry I just get into a rage and want to end it. I don’t care how anyone else would feel about it. Also about a week ago I thought my friend was mad at me and I considered us really good friend we are both into a lot of the same things. But when I thought he was mad at me I was pissed for hours. I actually started thinking about leaving school to jump off a bridge near my school. I am surprised on how I kept it together and not at least left school. Should I try to get help or talk to someone about this?
1199,please share your advice,Hey guys.. so i haven't really been feeling like my self. I had the flu for about a week and that really took all the life out of me. I dont feel 100% better i mean im not throwing up or feeling a 103 fever so i mean thats good. But ever since Ive gotten sick i have felt confused.. i dont even want to say depressed because i dont really know if thats what im feeling. I just feel a mixture of emotions... what kind of emotions you ask ? I am not sure. I am a 20 year old college student who is stressing over midterms.... one midterm that i have no idea about.... which is tomorrow. Oh and another thing is ive been feeling like i dont have purpose in life... like i dont know what my goals are or what im even aiming for... all i do know is writing my thoughts down make me feel sane and happy. My boyfriend makes me happy and very enlightened. Life is enlightening its just right now i dont feel that... anyone with advice that could help me feel better. (pls) thanks guys!
1200,Constant mental abuse?,What are you supposed to do about somebody that is constantly mentally abusing you but they are doing it in a way that if you told somebody about it then they wouldn’t believe you? Also if you told police about it they wouldn’t do anything.
1201,Is this concerning?,"This happens mostly when I'm the passenger in a car and I'm not looking at the driver.

My mind often plays tricks on me and makes me believe the driver is someone else (it's always someone that I know very well) and no matter how much I try to tell my mind that it's impossible, I won't ever believe myself until I turn my head and see who the *real* driver is.

But as soon as I look away, it happens again and it's such a weird feeling.

Should I be concerned? Is this just something that happens to everyone?

Also I'm already diagnosed with BPD and bipolar 2."
1202,Starting a Blog on Mental Health,"Hi everybody, Starting a blog trying to give me some mental releif. I'm a uni student, struggling with mental health, whilst i am struggling. I'd like to get some tips on how you cope with mental health wherever you are and whatever your struggles are. I'm new to this but i'm doing this to try and get my feelings out in the public eventually but if i could help somebody going through something at some point i'd be happy , 

Only a quick read but just setting out where i'm trying to go :) 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://studentmind47963714.wordpress.com/2020/03/06/whoami/](https://studentmind47963714.wordpress.com/2020/03/06/whoami/)"
1203,Never felt so happy in ages. Please don't give up!,I have been depressed for many years and genuinely despised everything about myself. I ended up having a huge breakdown in October and was on the verge of quitting college and just ending everything tbh. However i told my friends and family about whats going on and accepted that i need help urgently. Since then i have been on medication and have been to many counselling and therapy sessions. I can honestly say this has helped me soooo much and i feel much better about myself and my life every single day. Theres still times where im incredibly anxious and get depressed but thats just life really. Also last week i finally got the courage to come out as gay to my family and their reaction was amazing. Sorry for the random post i just wanted to share my experience and let people know that life can get better if you give it a chance too.
1204,My therapist asked me if I was sexually abused as a child. I was not.,"But what if? What if I repressed the memories in my head? I'm pretty sure I was not sexually abused. 

I am just so fucking nervous now. I recon I was badly handled at times (like that time where I was choked by my grandpa for crying, and another one where he punished (hit me on the butt and chest) me in public in the store for throwing food his way (it was merited lol))..."
1205,"Randomly I get this tingling shaking feeling down my body, does anyone else get it too?","I’m not sure if I should post this here if it has anything to do with my anxiety or if I should have gone to askdocs

But sometimes when I’m talking to someone about my feelings or when I’m reading/ something about stuff like that I get this weird chilling tingling sensation down my body, does anyone know what this may be?"
1206,How to seek help when not actively suicidal?,"Hi all!! So just to clarify I’m a 26F American. I feel like I’ve struggled with depression for a good chunk of my life. A little history: when I was 18 I had a suicide plan &amp; everything &amp; after an isolated incidence of self harm, I panicked &amp; called 911, resulting in getting a psychologist who I saw for about a month that helped in the short term but didn’t really do much overall (I’m not really blaming her; I was really uncomfortable/actively chose not to discuss my problems with her to the extent that she told me she could tell that whenever she asked me a question I was looking for a “right” answer rather than being authentic). I’ve had a lot of ups &amp; downs since then, periods where I definitely should have sought help but didn’t (mostly because my parents knew about my previous history since I’d been living with them when it happened; I know that making them aware that my depression didn’t magically resolve itself would make them panic and more helicopter parents than they already are, which isn’t good for any of us), but lately I’ve been thinking I really, REALLY need to get help if I’m ever going to be a functional adult. I’ve literally been working on getting my bachelor’s degree since I graduated high school at 17, and have yet to complete it because I’m constantly struggling mentally &amp; having to drop classes or retake them. 

This semester has been REALLY bad. I’m actually close to graduating &amp; I think something about impending success combined with a shitty work environment triggered a major depressive episode. I’m doing a lot of the same things I did when I was 18, which is skipping all my classes (I literally haven’t gone to class in 3 weeks; I know for a fact I’m going to fail at least one &amp; that’s going to set back my graduation by at least a semester, which is also terrifying because my parents are so THRILLED about my impending graduation &amp; I’m letting them down AGAIN). I literally don’t even do anything outside of class either. I can’t even focus enough or maintain enough energy to do the basics, like laundry or getting dressed/doing my makeup (also a big thing, because I normally love getting dolled up on a regular basis but I literally wore sweats out the other day...again, normal for a lot of people, absolutely NOT for me). I’m having a hard time remembering anything, so I can’t even keep up with due dates and assignments online. I just feel like I’m really falling down that whole when I never really climbed out, but I’m not “actively” suicidal so idk how to seek help. Also: my previous psychologist never actually diagnosed me with anything, but when I told her anxiety was my primary concern she told me she felt that I was actually depressed which was causing the anxiety, &amp; that I’d had “way more depressive symptoms than almost any client she’d seen” - so there’s that, I guess.

I have insurance through my work, but I don’t have a primary care doctor right now &amp; every time I look all the doctors that look decent near me aren’t accepting new patients. There’s a “symptom checker” on Sutter’s website which tells you whether you should do walk-in or urgent care treatment, and it said I should go to urgent care ASAP but.....what can/does urgent care do for mental health? Should I be making an appointment with a general practice doctor or can I go straight to a psychiatrist? I live in the Sacramento area, are there any recommendations from people who live around here specifically? 


TL;DR How do I find/utilize mental health help when I’m not actively suicidal but I’m worried I could be heading there again? &amp; when I have no current medical &amp;/or psych connections in the city I’m currently living (Sacramento, CA)?"
1207,The thing when you think about suicide but don't actually want to do it?,"I've got a history of depression, low serotonin, all that jazz but recently went through CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and now I'm the happiest I've felt since like forever... I still get suicidal thoughts though but with absolutely no reasoning for them or intention to follow through, like I was in the bath the other day minding my own business and my brain just hopped straight in there with; ""wouldn't it be mad if you just went underwater and never came back up?!"" and that was it, moment passes and I'm grand again.
I've heard the term ""suicidal ideation"" a few times but not sure if that's what I'm referring to, so I was just wondering if anyone else can relate and knows more about it."
1208,Going to get a psych eval,"I don't know how to feel. Relieved, but scared. Hopeful, but broken. All because one person managed to damage me more than I thought they did.

For the first time it feels like maybe I'm not crazy and just need a little help and This evaluation might provide me with some relief but it also has the glaring point of..."" You're a broken toy""

No one wants it really know they have mental scars or damage. That even others who hurt you don't have the kind of control to mentally break you to the point of some deep help beyond just talking occasionally to a therapists.

I hope things look up soon. I just want to live a normal life."
1209,I can’t eat cake therefor I should kill myself,That’s it that’s the text post no cake sucks
1210,I'm sorry to post again...,"Please forgive me for being such a needy fucking bitch...
I am so sorry. I am crying.

I am done with this life for real this time...no talking me out of it.

I am DONE.

Went to Program and the gals and I were talking about why I had cut myself up so badly last night. The gals were so understanding and they were legit supportive. Then the THERAPIST who runs the Group comes in and we were still talking about it. This fucking cunt said these two things to me:

""Well, I think you should be locked up for hurting yourself"" to which I had said angrily (and I almost never get pissed) ""Um...it is NOT illegal to cut yourself...they can NOT lock you up for that. Okay, maybe in a psych ward, but NOT in jail!""

Then she said: ""I think cutting is so stupid because someone cuts and cuts and then they just stop..."" What the FUCK?

I'm fucking done.

I had just been telling the gals at my table that I can't STAND fucking ignorant people. My point EXACTLY.

It was nice knowing you all. I am so sick of this world and the fucking hate and ignorance and the assholes who are supposed to be HELPING me...

Fuck you."
1211,Can’t get a job and depression is sinking in.,"Hi, I’m a first time poster so sorry for any mistakes. Basically a few months ago I (22f) moved over a 100 miles to live with my boyfriend (22m) of 7 years. I went to uni and he got a job so seemed like the best plan. However, since being here I’ve really been struggling to get a job and make friends. I’ve been medicated for my mental health for a couple of years  now and sitting in our apartment all day every day alone is just making me feel so much worse. My partner is so supportive and when he can he tries to get me out of the flat and cheer me up but it rarely works. I used to go for walks or drives to break up the day but just don’t have the motivation anymore unless I have an interview. I’ve started reading books again which has helped a little but I really need some advice on what I can do to help alleviate the depression that’s slowly creeping back into my head. I’m withdrawing into myself and becoming an introvert when I used to be so sociable. I can’t remember the last time I felt so alone and depressed. I don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome please."
1212,How long does it take to adjust to a new dosage of your antidepressant?,"My cymbalta dose was recently doubled. From 60 mg to 120 mg. 

I have been having a lot of side effects, which has never happened to me on this medication before. Fatigue, confusion, nausea, headache, light headedness. Needless to say, this shit is wearing me out. I slept 17 hours yesterday, and 13 today. 

I’ve only been on this dosage for 5 days I think. I don’t know how long it’s supposed to take for your body to adjust to a new dosage, so if anyone has similar experiences I would really appreciate you sharing them. I don’t know whether to wait it out for my body to get used to it, or if I should go back to my doctor.

Any answers are appreciated. Thank you all in advance."
1213,Can I sleep in the hallway at a mental hospital?,"This isn't my first rodeo, I've been 5 times but I always got lucky and never had a roommate. What can I do to ensure I don't have one again? Can I sleep in the hallway? Before you ask I'm suicidal and psychotic so i do need to go but refuse to sleep with a roomate. Please no rude answers."
1214,"I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist?","Lately I feel like everything takes so much effort. And largely like that effort doesn’t pay off. With each breath, I can feel my muscles labor and gravity pull my ribs towards my lungs. I fall asleep everywhere and I appreciate the sleep because then I feel free from my physical body. I kind of wish I could just be a little ghost/ball of consciousness without a body. I love the people in my life and I appreciate them a lot. I am just having a hard time. 

I know I’ll never be enough. I try to convince myself otherwise, but I know I don’t really have intrinsic value to others. My value to them is what I can offer them. My value to myself is largely what I can offer other people as well. 

There’s no point to me rambling, other than to get these thoughts off my chest. I guess I just have to reach a point of acceptance. I will work on that going forward."
1215,Need help moving on,"Hi all-

I should probably start this by saying that I don't think I have depression or a mental illness or anything like that, but I've never been sadder and lately I just haven't felt like myself and I wasn't sure where else to turn to for advice. 

So there's this girl in my close friend group who I have feelings for but she has made it pretty clear that she doesn't have an ounce of interest, although she still wants to be friends (idek if we're still friends though). Our relationship has become really awkward and strained and I feel like every move I make is the wrong one and makes it even worse.

Lately she's been feeling down and it makes me miserable to see her miserable, and I feel helpless knowing all my efforts to make her feel a bit better haven't done much. Everytime I think about this though I'm reminded of how little I'm worth to her compared to how much I care about her, and it's become this cycle of sad thoughts every night. 

At the same time, I've been dealing with some personal stuff and the little things I once appreciated just aren't as nice anymore. I don't even enjoy the stuff I once enjoyed. Like I recently hung out with my friends but as time went on I kinda just wanted to go home more and more. They're all great people though and they've given me good advice on how to move on, but it's proving harder than I originally thought. When I get home now, tbh I just sleep because at least in my dreams I don't have to face reality. I feel broken and don't have much motivation to do anything. 

At first, I thought it was slowly getting better but I came to the realization that it isn't after I started feeling sad sometimes at school, even though before I only really felt sad late at night. It's almost like it just accumulates over time. 

I'd really appreciate any input on what I'm feeling rn. Anything helps. Also, thanks to whoever took the time to read the entire thing"
1216,I've been thinking about this for a long time...,"So, if you die (depending on what you believe in) you end up doing something. But what if when you died you were just still, couldn't move, or speak. Just be. You would be left to the scariest thing of all, your own mind-forever."
1217,i have to get this off my chest,"
15f here. i really need to vent. i feel like i'm making shit up. please tell me if this is valid. if i have trauma. if i deserve help. because my brain is lying to me. ill try to make this post as short and comprehensible as possible, but will probably fail to do so, which im very sorry for. 
im diagnosed with bipolar ii and anxiety, and am prescribed depakine 600mg and asertin 50mg daily + atarax 25mg on a take-as-needed basis. i cut, bite, punch and scratch myself as a coping mechanism, which has turned into an addiction at this point, as i've been doing it for over 3 years now. the same can be said about my suicidal thoughts, with me having a thought-out plan to overdose/hang myself at 11 years old. i vape every day, and as u can probably guess it is also one of my coping mechanisms. i don't go to parties extremely often, but when i do, i like to get shitfaced, hoping i drop dead (i also mix my meds with alcohol). pretty sure this has something to do with my father being an alcoholic. drugs are on my to-do list.
besides all of my addictions and stuff i shouldn't do at my age, there is more to uncover. i have a problem with men. i'm terrified of them, i can't walk out on the streets in the evening. at any given time of the day, really. all that i can think of is that i'll be kindnapped, assaulted, raped, killed by a man. laughed at, my every insecurity and flaw will be pointed out. i'll be called a whore, a slut, a dumb bitch. as i should, because i am all of those things. worthless, a piece of shit, someone who should burn alive and rot in hell. even though i am a lesbian, and am in an extremely loving relationship with my wonderful girlfriend, i strive for male validation and attention. i'll wear short skirts and shorts, knee high socks, revealing tops, put on a long hair wig, do a full face of makeup, stand in a way that will make my boobs look bigger, stomach smaller and butt larger. when i'm out in public, i'll closely observe all of the men that walk past me, just to see it they checked me out. thought that they wanted to fuck me. have control over me. told me i'm useless. 
i came to the realization that maybe i have some repressed childhood trauma. it has always been this way. my father mentioned sex in conversations when i was as young as 8. i started watching porn at 7, learned how to properly masturbate at 10, lost my virginity at 14. even now, i use masturbation as a coping mechanism. i do it until i can't walk, until my body hurts so much that i can't move. during sex i like to be degraded, bitten, punched, slapped and hurt, because i feel like i deserve it. i watch struggle porn and imagine myself to he the women in those situations. i'm very hypersexual, which could very well be my bipolar disorder peeking through. but it has really taken a toll on me. i should also mention the time i was groped at 12 by my male classmate. i said ""no"", i said ""i dont want to"", ""please stop"". but he didn't stop. called me bossy and told me i'm overreacting. laughed at me. i dated him after that. i have nightmares where i'm sexually assaulted/raped, helpless, small, insignificant. panic attacks before i go to sleep. i see things. i hear some weird shit. i feel like i don't exist and that nothing is real. i feel like everything that's going on in my head is made up, a complete lie by me. i'm faking it, doing it for attention, i'm an attention whore. i also starve myself and then overeat. i vape so that i don't think about being hungry. i check calories on everything. i throw up when i think i ate too much. i'm so fat and ugly. 
also, another fun anecdote! my father is a piece of shit. he is a former alcoholic and was very abusive. i don't talk to him anymore because i blocked him everywhere. our relationship is non-existent. i have horrible daddy issues. but he treated me the best. he also had a gun in out house, was threatening to kill my mother and my sisters. i've been to plenty of rehab facilities, i've seen police at my doorstep numerous times. he used to call my sisters whores, slutes, told them they are worthless. tried to commit suicide twice and my oldest sister saw it all. i should also mention that my oldest sister had sex at 12 years old with a man in his 20s, she's had it way worse. 
another story. me and my gf were about it to take it a but further one time. she clearly wanted to put her hands on my chest (under my shirt), but was hesitant. i did it for her and suddenly, my eyes were watering. i felt a pain in my chest. i wanted to escape and scream. i wanted to die. i felt so helpless. she asked me if everything was okay and all i said was ""bad memories"". 
anyway, if someone is still reading this- thank you, you made it to the end of my vent. i'm sorry that this so long."
1218,"I’m like 99% sure I have anxiety and depression, but I’ve never been tested, how do I go about getting tested?","There’s no way I don’t have depression or anxiety, but I’ve never gone and gotten tested or gotten help because I’ve always just kept it bottled in and dealt with it by myself and been in denial that everything actually is okay when in fact nothing is.

But I’ve found a good friend that I’ve been talking to and coming to terms with everything, and they make me want to become better. How do I go about getting tested for this stuff?

I’m 18, but I go to my family doctor that my whole family shares, so will my doctor tell my parents if my parents ask?

Also, what benefits come out of getting tested and getting medically diagnosed?"
1219,I'm a hypichondriac. Any advice or recommendations would be very much appreciated.,"Every little symptom that I have - A pain in my side, a pop in my neck, a cramp - I always think the worst. I Google my symptoms and try to self diagnose. I get extremely anxious, I obsess about the symptoms,  and can't stop thinking that it's something serious. I'm terrified of dying. These thoughts take over my mind and it's hard to escape them.

My family is my main support system and they are truly amazing. But I need more help than their kind words and love. I don't want to have thoughts and feelings like this for the rest of my life. 

Does anyone else have hypochondriac tendencies? Have you found anything that helps?"
1220,Feeling the highest highs and the lowest lows,"That's the only way to say it. I just feel really unstable despite being medicated and having a nice therapist. I'm drinking and smoking a lot of weed after work. It's kinda like feeling life for the first time and needing to experience the extreme ends of physical sensations. I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've been mentally ill for years before I had any idea.

The future is like a black hole. The only decision I can make is that I want to stay alive long enough to feel happy. But I have no idea how to make that happen."
1221,What the hell is going on?,"Sometimes I get this trippy feeling that makes me feel awfully sick and disorientated. I simply feel off whenever I think about time and how simply time has been going by fast recently and people are changing and I’m not truly recognizing it, as if my mind is numbing itself to be unable to react to change. I honestly feel like the past year or so has been a blackout. I don’t do any drugs but I feel like my depression numbs me so much that I can’t seem to remember of any memories from even a year ago...it simply feels like a blur and it scares the hell out of me. I sometimes feel like I’m still living in 2018. I feel like once I OD’d on xanax in 2018 May and went into the hospital for suicidal ideation, time hasn’t been the same. Around that time, I felt like nothing was the same anymore. I feel like I lost my identity and I feel like a ghost, as if I’m drifting through life without actually experiencing it anymore and I know I am but I can’t do anything to stop this feeling. 

What really tripped me out was when I realized that I don’t really recognize my sister anymore. Maybe it’s puberty that’s changing her looks but it feels like she’s grown up now, and my brother is acting more individualistic, and my step sister’s kids are already 5 and 7. I’m almost 19 but I still feel like I’m in the past. What truly fucked me over is the fact that the past year has been a blackout and time is getting faster and it’s making me internally panic and I can’t act out of hand or I’ll end up back in the hospital.

Does anyone get this feeling? It becomes to disorientating and I start to dissociate and just the thought of time freaks me out."
1222,"No such thing as ""help""",Please stop perpetuating the myth of mental help. It does not exist. Hospitals cant help nor therapist. Stop spreading lies
1223,Feeling your worst at your highest point,"So I’ll try to make this sort as it’s basically a question/query that I was wondering.

Over the summer I attended a ‘bootcamp’ or sorts in an effort to get my weight where I wanted it to be. The camp was great, the people were cool, the training was fun and all in all I lost around 5 stone in less than 2 months and I had never felt better about my body in my life.

Weirdly towards the end of the camp when I was about to go home, excited to show off to my family and friends, I got really down. I was on the phone to my parents discussing noting in particular, probably travel plans, and I started crying. I ended the call and continued to cry for no reason that I could come up will, for a while.

When I can home and went back to uni the sadness continued. I’ve have mental health issues in the past that I only, in the past couple of years, came to terms with or understood.

I sought council and and happy to say that I’m feeling much better and encourage those going through tough times to do the same as it seems to help everyone I ask including myself.

So my question is, is it common to feel the most ‘down’ at your highest point? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thanks 

TLDR: Do you ever feel especially ‘down’ when you should be feeling especially ‘happy’ or ‘proud’?"
1224,"How can I find a psychiatrist near my zip code, that takes my insurance?","Pyshologytoday . com shows me offices that are no where near my zip code.  Yelp showed me a few that I emailed asking if they accept my insurance, so hopefully some of them work out. But aside from these, I don't know where to look.  I really need to find a good psychiatrist.  Please help, thank you."
1225,Lowest Point—-&gt; Progress,"Hey, I’m an 18M and recently was diagnosed with depression, I made the mistake of allowing drs. to prescribe me meds after my first visit and had a horrible experience with them which led me to come off them within a week, then I had my first panic attack which I will call the lowest point in my life because it was the scariest thing that has happened to me and I’m still recovering days after. After I hit that low point I went back to my therapist and we talked which made me feel a lot better. I wanna turn this thing around, I wanna feel again and be able to enjoy life like I know I can. I’ve tried meditation which definitely helps along with controlled breathing but I’m looking for more ways to help better myself. For everyone fighting this fight, what do you do everyday to help with the depression and anxiety? Any vitamins/supplements? What self care techniques do you use? For everyone fighting any mental illness, please remember, we are STRONG. And the thoughts in our head may seem bigger than world but they are the complete opposite, they are meaningless unless we continue to put value into them. Thank you for reading and a reminder that you are loved❤️"
1226,When should I see a doctor about depression?,"Hi I'm new to this sub so sorry if I break some rules! 

Basically, I've been exhausted nearly everyday and also sometimes I get super sad. Like overwhelmingly sad to the point where I can't do anything except sit in my sadness. I feel the fatigue everyday but only feel the sadness two or three times a week.

 However, this has only really been occuring for about two months. I've had some things happen in my life which I think might be the cause of the sadness and I am a full time student who works and volunteers which probably contributes to being tired all the time. 

Is it too early to see a doctor about my mental issues (if there are any at all)?"
1227,so i’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but i’m not sure where to go,"so just to start off i want to say I DO NOT HAVE DIAGNOSED OCD. i hate when people who aren’t diagnosed say that they do!! ok but anywho i have this thing i do that i think may possibly be ocd but before i make assumptions i wanted to maybe see if anyone possibly does that same thing or whatever

ok so basically some of the time when i touch something (anything with any part of my body) i have to touch it with the other side of me. like if i touched a wall with my right arm i’d have to touch it with my left. it would be (i’m not sure how to phrase it, but like mentally painful if that makes sense. kind of like an itch that needs to be scratched but for your brain.) it only happens maybe 15-25% of the time depending on the day. or when i’m consciously thinking about it. also super small detail but i normally check my phone to make sure my data’s off about 5-8 times per night like in a row, like i’m laying there and i check it then lay back down then 15 seconds later check again and so on. but it’s mostly the symmetry thing i talked about before. it’s this pattern thing in my brain, things need to be “left, right, right, left” or vice versa if that makes any sense.


there’s a little bit of ocd in my genes (my aunt) and i’ve had this quirk for as long as i can remember, also when i was like 6 i had a tic for like 2-3 months where i’d make clicking noises every time i talked but my parents just told me to stop and i eventually did.


anyways any help is appreciated (even if it’s just letting me know i’m over exaggerating lol) what should i do???"
1228,Anyone know how to fix the feeling that people are talking shit behind your back?,"Every day I go to school and talk to the same group of people, I've gotten to know these people of the course of the school year and some people I talk too I've known for upwards of 3 years.

Yet I can't shake the feeling that they all hate me, and talk about me when I'm not there.

I've had the habit of deleting discord messages I send to people just so they can't screen shot it and send it other people laughing at my stupidity or weakness

I'm in a group chat with some of my closest friends but there very much could be a second group chat with the same people in it that they use just to talk about me.

I just want this to stop, it's starting to hinder how I talk to people :/"
1229,I feel really uncomfortable when I lie,"No matter what the topic is even if it's ""small talk"" I have to force myself to lie and it feels awful.  It's always been this way. Even if the truth just makes the situation worse or awkward or if it's inappropriate, I'd mostly say what's on my mind coz it takes so much out of me just to say something I don't want to. I also believe people when they ask me stuff during small talk. I believe them that they want to know the actual answer and not just doing the socially normal thing. I've been ""the werido"" in any group because of this. And even when I know that they don't actually care I can't bring myself to say the response they want to hear.
As a kid I would not understand why people would ask if they didn't want to know. And in a certain way I still don't.
This is a mess, I'm sorry. I'm just confused. I just don't understand social cues as much. I got better at spotting people just being polite but those are just obvious ones... I still sometimes actually answer the old question ""how are you?"" From people who are at work or who don't usually talk to me...
Does anyone have an idea why this is? Or is like this too? I feel alone."
1230,tonight my adhd brain finally decided to think about this and i need help,"(i can't remember much of my younger days, even though I'm only 16 btw)as a kid, I was bullied and left out and I would never get included. my mom helped a little but I felt as though she could maybe help a little more. she wasn't much there for me as a kid, and I can't blame her for that. my grandpa is the most un emotionally expressive people I have ever met, and it rubbed onto her. she remembers getting hugged once by my grandma and that's it. but anyways, I never got to experience having friends properly, because id much rather want to be home alone. however, I want to change that. other than that, as a kid I would often get into fits of rage and bully people but without knowing I was bullying them. I once threw a kid across the pavement at recess, and just laughed. is there something wrong with me? idk what to do, and I'm terrified of being an egotistical jerk, because I never want to be who the popular kids were/are. how do I move forward? what can I do to get over these things, when little things nowadays are ticking me off? I used to be able to calm myself down and release the anger some other way, but now I'm losing that control to dissipate the anger. sometimes I get an incredible urge to break something, to punch something, and I can't tell if its influences, me, or something else. I'm scared of my anger, and I don't want to let it out because I don't want to hurt someone or myself. I used to smoke weed and that helped a lot, however now spurts of tunnel vision that occur when I'm anxious, and it's annoying the fuck out of me. I really need help with all of this, and I'm begging that unlike most of my posts, a few people could reply to give me some options. I have ADHD and OCD (not the organizational version, the kind that makes my brain run like a v8) even a week ago, i was doing laundry and had a conversation with myself in my own head. it went something like this M1=me M2=another version of me. M2:you need more boxers. M1: yea, socks too. wait what the fuck, who are you? M2: i dont know... i sound like you though. M1:so youre me? M2:i think so. M1well do you mind? i wanna watch this show and u scared the shit out of me. M2: yeah, i got u.

so that's my post, I'm begging yall, i need help but i cant get it anywhere else, because my friends aren't real friends, my mom will just reassure me and trick me into thinking nothings wrong and im fed up with this.oh, i forgot, I don't know if i already said this, but i have alot of trouble expressing myself, but just a little bit better than my mom.

thank you so very much if you read through all of this, but i understand if you dont, its a lot and frankly I don't think many people will care.

PS i didnt have time to check for spelling/grammar so sorry."
1231,Neighbor almost called the cops on me - for being nice.,"Yesterday, I wanted to share some marshmallows with my neighbors. We have always had a pleasant relationship with them, and invite them over for our winter holiday party every year. We give them treats now and then, plus birthday gifts. They have a key to our house. They know about my illness.

They recently installed a Ring camera on their front door. I told them that I can't go to their front door anymore, because those things make me paranoid. I told them I would call if I ever needed to come over, and just go to the back door. At the time, they said they understood and that was fine. 

This was the first time I have had any reason to go there since then. I called both of his phone numbers. No answer. Left a message. Covered the plate in foil, and went to their back porch. I knocked on the door, then left the plate on a chair. Went to the other neighbor's house, gave him his plate of marshmallows, and came home. By this time, first neighbor's wife was off from work, so I called and told her that I had left the plate on their porch.

A few minutes later, I get a call from the guy saying that he had almost called the police on me, and I am lucky he doesn't have a gun. His phone was off because he was taking a nap, and the dog barking woke him up when I knocked on the door. (I didn't hear her bark in the minute I was standing there, but whatever.) He lectured me for ten minutes, basically telling me he wasn't angry (why should he be?), and he didn't call the police (why should he have?), and that I needed to not go to their back door, phone call or not, ever again.

I've been terrified to leave my house since then. The police kill people like me. They don't understand us. I have no idea how I would react to a bunch of cops running at me, and am pretty sure that any interaction between me and police ends with me dead. We live in proud ""Trump"" country, and most people have more guns than sense. 

Wish I could afford to move, but I've also had that little voice in the back of my mind, wondering if it wouldn't be so bad if they did shoot me. It has been a really dark goddamn week. I don't remember Wednesday at all. After ""super Tuesday,"" my head was pretty wrecked. 

Pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong yesterday, though. Just... what the fuck."
1232,Feels like defining ourselves by traits instead of expressing ourselves is a big problem in both our self worth and how others view us.,"Instead of saying, I'm a 25yo virgin who's starting college late and struggled severely with isolation and depression, just go be. Yeah, if you introduce yourself to a girl as that she would probably not be into it. But that's not you. You aren't an amalgamation of traits and concepts. You're John / Jane and you have your own life experiences and interests and opinions and humor to share."
1233,Trying to piece together the past few days,"I'm not exactly sure how to begin this, but I figured this would be a good forum to post this, as I know no other place to. I apologize if this isn't on-topic.

For the most part, my life has been normal; some personal moments of depersonalization which has happened since childhood, but this has never truly affected my day-to-day actions. For the past week, after drinking a pretty fair amount of vodka daily, I've noticed reality has gotten somewhat stranger:
&gt;mental perspective of reality has begun to shift between the mundane to that of a first-person game, or a movie-like experience that gives me great fear
&gt;sometimes lose control of bodily functions (eyes darting around at random, walking around to different places without an intention of going anywhere, 
&gt;low-pitched moans, gurgles, and voices which speak no language have begun to resonate in my body, causing tremors and goosebumps
&gt;starting to alienate friends, who say I'm being irritable despite acting entirely normal
&gt;my reading interests have moved entirely to conspiracies and the occult, which has shocked me considering I only really read normal things before
&gt;every time I look in a mirror, I'm appearing as something different from what I'm accustomed to, and my eyes are bulging out
&gt;getting no pleasure from anything at all
All the while, the back of my mind is telling me to delve further into this. I don't think I'm schizophrenic, as I don't currently have delusions, or feel I share some greater importance in things; the voices I mentioned before happen only once a day, and aren't affecting me in a truly negative way. It's more that reality has become scary, and even if I know something with myself is off, there's something more sinister with this all.

Sorry if this turned into a rant, I just need an outside perspective on what is happening."
1234,Is it normal to blame myself for dumb things?,"When my mom yells at me I get really mad at myself and here are other things I overreact to:
-people not responding ASAP
-yeah sure (when someone says that and doesn’t sound like they actually want to)
-when someone is upset (in general)
-when I get depressed
-when I get anxious 

Some of this leads to cutting...

1235,"Am I schizophrenic? I'm a 26 year old woman, been having debilitating auditory hallucinations whenever I'm upright since I was 16 years old that are getting worse!","This is almost 24/7, every day, without stopping, for 10 years. It's also accompanied by headaches that get worse with sitting up, and cognitive decline. Nodding or shaking my head makes the 'tinnitus' chime, and makes the headache spike as well. The longer I'm upright, the more likely the headache, which starts at the back of my head and behind my eyes. I have tried 5 different migraine pills and they do not do a thing for any of my symptoms.

Now for the most FRUSTRATING part

I wake up in the morning to ***complete and utter silence***. (I live in a rural area, in a house with very thick walls - my bedroom is just as quiet in the day as it is during the night). 10-30 minutes after I assume the upright position, the ringing starts to gradually come back. Come night time, I literally cannot stand to be in a quiet room because the auditory hallucination that is mimicking tinnitus is THAT loud!

I've also done experiments where I'll wake up every 2 hours, but I'll be lying in bed for 15 hours. At hour 6 the ringing is still there, but mild, at about 30-40% of what it was before bed, and after 15 hours it's gone completely.

I'm having rapid heart beat and palpitations the longer I'm upright as well.

Seen ENT's and they found nothing wrong with my ears and concluded this is an auditory hallucination originating in my brainstem from ''migraines'' but migraine pills don't do jack."

For the most part, my life has been normal; some personal moments of depersonalization which has happened since childhood, but this has never truly affected my day-to-day actions. For the past week, I've noticed reality has gotten somewhat stranger:

&gt;mental perspective of reality has begun to shift between the mundane to that of a first-person game, or a movie-like experience that gives me great fear

&gt;sometimes lose control of bodily functions (eyes darting around at random, walking around to different places without an intention of going anywhere)

&gt;low-pitched moans, gurgles, and voices which speak no language have begun to resonate in my body, causing tremors and goosebumps 

&gt;starting to alienate friends, who say I'm being irritable despite acting entirely normal 

&gt;my reading interests have moved entirely to conspiracies and the occult, which has shocked me considering I only really read normal things before

&gt;every time I look in a mirror, I'm appearing as something different from what I'm accustomed to, and my eyes are bulging out 

&gt;getting no pleasure from anything at all 

 I don't think I'm schizophrenic, as I don't currently have delusions, or feel I share some greater importance in things; the voices I mentioned before happen only once a day, and aren't affecting me in a truly negative way. It's more that reality has become scary, and even if I know something with myself is off, there's something more sinister with this all.

Sorry if this turned into a rant, I just need an outside perspective on what is happening."
1237,In Need Of Help,"I'm not really sure how to word this in a short reddit post, but I desperately need help. I really need support or someone to speak to right now, but I currently have no one. I've felt so low recently and I'm really lost. Any help would be much appreciated."
1238,I don’t know what’s wrong with me...,"I feel like I’m always such an angry, pessimistic person now. I never used to be but then I went through a really hard time, lost a bunch of friends, etc. I feel like my problem is I hate seeing people happy, maybe because I’m so unhappy? I also overthink small things way too much which puts me in a bad mood, like if a couple of my mates walk off without waiting for me to tie my shoe. All this overthinking and sourness puts me in a bad mood and I distance myself, which makes me even more upset. I hate it being like this and just want to be as happy :("
1239,Help with something I can’t explain fully,"I’m really not sure what to say, I’m 14 so mind my explaining of things. The past while now I’ve had violent outbursts, the feeling I’m out of my body, If I’m in places with lots of different sounds I feel fuzzy and confused like I’m not there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and convince myself I’m there. Last month for the first time I climbed to the top of a building and threatened to throw myself off although I had no intent to actually do it. I was not attention seeking as I told no one about this. I feel as though if I go to get “diagnosed” they will tell me I have nothing wrong with me. I have trouble keeping stable relationships with people. Please someone help or give tips of what to do, if you actually took the time to read this, thank you."
1240,Are there any therapists on here,I need to talk to someone in private
1241,I can’t win,"I will never beat depression. I know I’m not worthless and that I can achieve my goals, but I don’t feel those things. It’s hard to explain. I know what I feel about myself is wrong, but it never goes away. I go to therapy and it really just gives me someone to talk to, nothing else. Every time a problem in my life is solved a new one just replaces it right away. I can’t even savor the small victories and that makes me feel like I shouldn’t even bother trying anymore. I know I shouldn’t give up and I don’t want to commit suicide, but I just want to be done with everything. I’m never happy anymore, even if I am enjoying what I’m doing I still feel awful deep down. I just want to be done."
1242,Would you consider this negligence?,"Today, my daughter's (7) psychiatrist refused to refill her ritalin until our appointment, which is next Wednesday Mar. 11, 2020. She will now have to go without it for 5 days. I am livid and consider this negligence on the part of the psychiatrist. I don't understand not doing a partial 5 day fill. My daughter has severe ADHD and has been medicated for 2 years."
1243,How to deal with the effects of medication?,"My medication was recently switched around and I don’t think I can handle the effects of it. 

I now have the shortest temper in the history of mankind. I am so irritable that whenever someone says something that I disagree with even slightly, I become so enraged that it’s hard for me to not compulsively attack something or someone. I can’t even hold a normal conversation anymore. If I try to hold my anger in it just gets worse and I start to cry. 

I strongly believe that my self image, combined with all of the terrible things that have been happening to me lately as well as my medication change is to blame. I am in a constant state of agitation that I can’t control. I’ve already mindlessly started attacking four people in the past week. 

I know that side effects like this are temporary, but does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do in the meantime?"
1244,ADVICE URGENTLY NEEDED! My Dad's Anger Issues &amp; My Anxiety and Depression.,"Hi everyone! Today, I finally reached a point where I had to share my story with someone to GET HELP. I've really gotten to a point where I needed to tell someone my story and I found reddit to be the most supportive outlet, and so, here I am. I don't really live in a supportive community, and I can't really share this with my uni friends either, and although my counsellor has been very helpful with the listening component, I haven't received any helpful advice that could get me out of this situation I'm in and improve my life. I apologize beforehand if my story is a bit long and may jump around a bit, it's my first time writing one of these and I had a lot to going on so hope you can understand!

Just to introduce myself a bit, I come from a very strict Asian cultural background with parents who immigrated to America during my childhood in hopes to allow me and my sister to grow-up for a ""better life"". My dad is definitely an alpha-male with the stubbornness of ""If it's not my way = It's the wrong way"" mind set. He is as Asian as one can get with growing up - ""my mother never let me in the kitchen"" = men don't cook in this family. Most importantly on top of this, he definitely has anger issues with quite the temper. I would describe a life with him as living with a time-bomb that I don't know when and how it will explode... Anyways, I will begin my story.

During most of my high school life, I've had a very difficult relationship with my dad (from my perspective). My parents have ALWAYS been arguing since our move to America around 10 yrs ago. However, things never really escalated until my dad permanently moved to America for 2-3 years during my high-school years. This was when he started to get physical with my mom during arguments. Their arguments would start from NOTHING (ex. ""the house isn't clean"") --&gt; ending with my dad YELLING resentment towards my mom for not being a good daughter-in-law to HIS family. THIS WAS MY HIGH-SCHOOL LIFE. Things began getting physical with my dad THROWING &amp; BREAKING plates, cups, and anything he could break when got REALLY upset. Then came to points where he would punch/hit my mom in the stomach, and my sister and I would run downstairs to stop it. Then there were moments when my dad began to just kick my mom, who was on the floor, and my younger sister (taller than me) ran down and jumped in front of my mom, and I would be trying to push my dad away. My high-school life was basically in constant fear and anxiety... But I didn't know better and didn't really understand anything about life and myself. I didn't know who to talk to. I didn't know how to tell anyone this. So i stayed silent with no help. And I didn't realize this was a trauma that would stick with me for so long.

When University came, my dad and mom still living together, things became SO MUCH WORSE for myself and my sister. Because we had grown-up and lived with the fear from the trauma and anxiety of ""what would happen to our mom if we weren't home?!"" mind-set, neither of us could leave the house knowing my mom and dad would be home alone.. Going to classes or libraries without Anxiety or Fear or Stress, were just NOT an option for us.. Then We soon realized this was becoming a huge PROBLEM for us because AT HOME, my sister or I HAD TO CONSTANTLY prepare meals (from scratch) for my dad, sit and eat with him, clean up (dishes), constantly do chores for him (such as ""make me coffee, choose a movie with me, set up TV for me""), and he would frequently just call us down to just talk shit out my mom. This was the case ALWAYS including Midterm Exam periods &amp; Final Exam period.. Meaning whoever had to stay at home could NOT get more than MAX 1hr to study without being interrupted. Even for a regular person, my sister, this was breaking her studying cycles. But as a person with ADHD, this was just breaking me down. I always took longer than an average person to get into focusing and studying, and so, this was impossible for me.

One might ask ""why do you have to do all that? You should just tell him to do it"", and I thought about it too. But I couldn't.. Because I know that not doing these things for him will upset him --&gt; his anger issues will kick in --&gt; then he would call down my mom --&gt; and the cycle of verbal and physical abuse will begin once more. We didn't want to risk this so we did everything for him. I constantly fear hearing my dad's voice. Whenever he speaks, I just immediately fear as I know how he is..

Even with all these responsibilities I had of being a ""perfect daughter"", my dad STILL expected AMAZING Grades from my University also. I am in Nursing and my sister is in Medical Sciences, so we both experience a lot of stress, anxiety, and panic-attacks while living with my father and mother and being a student. I entered a Uni program of Nursing. A career that I was forced into with constant ""I came to America BECAUSE OF YOU"" from my dad, and resulting in choosing a career path of HIS liking. Although I love helping people, I feel that my passion is something else... I have been wanting to tell him I wish to switch programs, but I fear for my mom's and my life as I don't know how he will take it...

There was a point where I confronted him with ""You always tell me your stories to understand your problems and listen to you as you complain. Can you try to understand that I am tired too? I have problems too but you always care about yourself and never try to listen to my problems.."" I thought I was being brave, but I was just being stupid because this led him to call me basically a traitor for talking back to him and blaming him for everything. And he cut ties with me for 5 months after (he was out of America for 5 months)...

My sister, who never really gets too upset, really got me when she came to me crying the other day saying ""Even my friends who don't have family issues like this are struggling to keep up with school... I don't know what to do..."" This made me realize that I'll never be truly able to focus on JUST BEING A STUDENT trying to figure out her life and focus on me and my career before anything ONCE...

As my struggle in this life is evidently becoming more problematic with combination of constant anxiety from even hearing my dad's voice, constant fear for my mom, fear of disappointing him, depression with my career and life path, and need to fulfill all of my dad's needs, I have gotten to a point where I wanted to disappear... I came to believe that this was not a problem I could just get out of... It was a problem that would disappear ONLY if either I disappeared or my parents did... But my parents would never disappear... I'm just in constant anxiety and fear with NO WAY OUT... I don't know what to do.. I love my parents who gave up everything for us... But I can't help but feel that I am not living a life and that I don't even wanna live it anymore.. I’m so sick of feeling so conflicted about my father when I know he doesn't even consider my feelings...

I feel like I am not living a life, and want to stop feeling anxious, depressed, suffocated and STOP feeling like I have to tip toe around a sleeping bear. Most importantly, I want to feel good about myself in University with improved grades and full effort into my career.... I just want to breathe a little better and feel like I'm actually living my life."
1245,I think I’m headed for a full blown psychotic episode. What should I do?,"I’ve never had this happen before, though I had a transient psychotic-like episode a few months ago (and was never really the same since). Things have been going steeply downhill over the past month. I’m beginning to the lose the ability to think clearly, I’m weirdly terrified of people, my weird and paranoid thoughts are losing their hypothetical/“what-if” quality, I can’t engage in University because it doesn’t feel real anymore. Nothing feels real. 
 

What do I do? I feel so confused and scared right now,  but I know once I get into another weird thought, I’ll become so absorbed by it I’ll fail to realize I’m being abnormal. Maybe I should go to the hospital, but that doesn’t feel real either and I think they will harm me. Fuck."
1246,I feel like a huge screwup,
1247,Walk in Clinics,I really feel like I need someone to talk to however because it is Saturday I’m not sure of what places would be open. I live in Toronto ontario so skylark would be the best option if it was a weekday however it’s not. It’s not urgent but it would be very helpful and conscientious to get some things off my chest!
1248,I’m realizing just how toxic reddit can be.,"I know it all depends on where you look and what you seek out but every community has people spouting their thought out but not factual opinions, for similar unoriginal minded people to latch on to the ideas themselves. 
I see it constantly in these mental illness subreddits and even find myself relating to things I normally wouldn’t think or put thought into that aren’t necessarily healthy to focus on. Normalizing negative feelings and actions does not make them okay. While yes, it is good to know that other people are going through the same things you are, but there’s a sick pattern of justification in it all if you’re not careful and it’s something you need to be aware in life. 
If you don’t like something you are doing but surround yourself with people/communities doing the same thing, it’s going to be easier make light of it and pretend it’s normal. 
Listen to the professionals, not some sweaty depressed dirt bag spreading their thoughts on reddit (like me :))"

1250,Things were going so well...,"In my last few posts u can see i’ve been happy and life has been going my way. I got a normal amount of sleep last night. My stress levels are good. We have a school trip next week which gives me something to look forward to. Life has just been amazing the past few days and i finally feel like it’s worth it to keep living and i have purpose. But then this happened. We have a school trip to the mountains next week and we were going to be hiking every day (i love hiking it’s what i do when i’m stressed). I was going to get to do one of my favorite things with most of my favorite people. It was going to create memories to last a lifetime. No school, no homework, and the best part, no assignments relating to the trip in any class. I was really excited. But then we get this fucking email saying it was canceled bc of the coronavirus. so i don’t get to go on the trip and we have school next week. Things were going so well until the one thing i was looking forward to in life was taken away from me. i’m starting to spiral again. i wish they never gave us hope for this trip in the first place."
1251,In need of advice,"Hi, first time poster here - kind of new to reddit. 

I’m 28f. I’ve been having a rough time lately with my anxiety and depression especially related to work.

Our floor changed around in august 2019 and all managers were promoted allowing for them to pick new team leaders. They happened to pick the popular kids at work who all hang out together. Since then work has been hell.
On Friday I raised an issue to my team leader which involved her and I cc’d in our operations manager (my old team leader, her friend and now also her reporting boss). My new team leader took it personally and took it out on me all day. But she did it by being overly nice to everyone around me, telling her friends what I did (which wasn’t personal at all, I was asking do I do this or do you what is procedure) and completely ignoring me all day. 
About an hour before I finished work I found out that my cat had been hurt and taken to the vet so I got a bit upset (I am a cryer, even if I’m angry. Which doesn’t help these situations). My team leader was told by someone else what happened, then someone else told her what happened and her response was “I can see she’s upset, I know and I don’t care”.

I’m in need of what to do next for two things.
1. It’s currently Saturday, we go back on Monday. I can’t stop having panic attacks over this and feeling extremely depressed that I have to go, that this is my life. Working 40 hours a week with people like this. I don’t know how to bring up my anxiety and depression because when someone has before they made jokes and said they were playing the victim. All management are friends and try and ignore stuff like this. Does anyone know how to stop feeling so horrible? Or stop feeling anxious about walking into this office.

2. How do I stop crying no matter the emotion. I’m upset but I’m also very angry and frustrated and I don’t know how to be a bitch back. I know that sounds silly but I’m a timid person who crys hahaha. Suggestions.

Sorry if this is not the right place to post this, as I said, first time poster. Please let me know.

Thank you in advanced to anyone who even reads this let alone responds ❤️"
1252,is there any way I can obtain a human brain or a brain that looks like a human brain so I can cut it apart?,"Sounds weird I know but I have a chronic neurological condition that has been destroying my life and as a means of stress relief I'm an artist and I often draw pictures of brains being physically tortured, cut into pieces etc. so I was wondering if I could obtain a brain specimen from a lab or biology class somewhere so I could hack it open, throw it to the ground, cut it into tiny pieces etc as a means of stress relief and acting like it's my brain"
1253,I Was Having a Decent Day for Once and then a Couple of Big Whoopsies Happened,"Now, I was actually having a decent day. I was playing with my friends, my art grade went up on the last day of the trimester and made it so that I had straight A's. I was ballin' out on madden too. I had 5 straight online head to head wins. So basically, we had a school trip planned next week, and I was so excited to get out of the house for a week, but then we got a text saying that the trip went bye bye.  And what made it 10 times worse was the fact that I had finished packing literally 5 minutes before we got the text. Next off, my clumsy self almost sprained my wrist on a suitcase trying to unpack stuff. Then, my parents gave me a 30 minute lecture on how irresponsible I am. And finally, I went to my pantry looking for some cereal, only to realize that it had expired 5 years ago. Uhh"

1255,"I, a 22 year old, have an 84 year old father. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year &amp; I'm continuing to live in fear.","Hi everyone.

When I was born, my mom was 67 and my dad was 61. I was born to older parents and was very lucky to not have any health problems. I am continually grateful for that.

I've always considered my dad to be my best friend, as I have always been a daddy's girl and we naturally understand each other so well. Growing up, I was always much closer to him as he had retired a little early to take care of me &amp; pick me up from school. I am very close to my mom as well, but my dad and I have a special kind of bond where we share several inside jokes, sharing similar political/moral values, can hold a conversation for hours, etc.

I have always been scared of losing my parents, especially my dad.  I had come to realize at an early age that most of my friends' parents had been a lot younger than mine. Since I was around 6, I was always worried that I would lose my dad at an early age. I would obsess over these thoughts, even wishing that I would die first so I wouldn't have to face this reality. Eventually, however, I was able to keep these thoughts away by spending as much time with them as possible &amp; living my life to the fullest.

This month marks 1 year since he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although the prognosis for prostate cancer is very good, and he is making great progress, my fears of losing have been slipping into my mind again. Almost every part of my day involves me wondering how much time I have left with him, and that the days are going by too quickly. I can't help but reminisce about how much younger he used to look before being diagnosed. I can see how tired he is from the frequent visits and chemo sessions. I can't even begin to imagine the toll it takes on him, but he continues to be strong for me. He always pushes the importance of education and my career, telling me that there is no rush to get into a relationship if I am not ready. He has seen me graduate university (although he wasn't able to physically attend because of mobility issues), but I can't help but worry if he will see me finish grad school, get married and have children.

I've tried expressing these fears to my mom but all she says is that it is life &amp; that she could die too. I am aware of this and I know that life is so unpredictable, that anyone's life could be cut short at any moment. I worry for her as well. She hasn't given me too much emotional support on this, and she just tells me not to cry in front of my dad because it will worry him. She is emotionally supportive with everything else, but not when it comes to this. She just saw me crying 10 minutes ago but she hasn't said anything. I am just so sad all the time, and I am finding it hard to hide it. I am holding in tears everyday single day, whether I am at work, on the bus, etc. I have suicidal ideation from time to time as well, but I am not not actually suicidal (nor do I have a plan). I don't know if I should seek help, but I just can't go any day without feeling sad and waiting for bedtime to come.

Thank you in advance for reading/commenting. Any help or support is greatly appreciated."
1256,I think I might have BPD. Who should I see to get help?,"In last year or so my mental health has been a roller coaster. I have never seen a psychologist or counselor of the sort, but am starting to feel I’m going to end up fucking up all of my relationships because of my mental health. I’ve read a good amount about BPD and the symptoms really hit home for me. Who should I see to help me and possibly diagnose me? Even if I don’t have any mental illnesses I want some sort of therapy/counseling for my intrusive thoughts. Would a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist be best? Help!"
1257,sometimes i think my mom likes me and then she comes home angry,"i was having a pretty good day and we’ve been kind of getting along lately and then she comes home and she’s visibly angry and she just takes it out on my every time. honestly she’s only nice to me when my doctors tell her that i might hurt myself because my mental health is really bad. i don’t know, i’m just so sick of crying and feeling like shit because she’s angry at me for things other people did."
1258,Cold Turkey: Confusion,"For insomnia I've taken Remeron (an antidepressant/serotonin class) for about 4 months now under my psychiatrists care. Well the side effects and weight gain made me want to get off the Remeron so he prescribed me Ambien to replace the Remeron. When I got to my pharmacy even the pharmacist said stop taking your Remeron. That was 2 days ago, and I've had extreme anxiety and lots of suicidal thoughts in the past 48 hours. I'm going to call my doctor in the morning, but now that I think of it doesn't it make complete sense this is happening. I was on antidepressant. They take me completely off it cold turkey. And substite with something that has no nothing do with anything. So essentially straight up cold turkey...anybody have any idea what could be going on? I've taken ambien in the past short term and I dont remember having this type of thing...

So it all went wrong when I was born. I was born with a few things wrong with me, I couldn't hear properly, so I had to get tubes in my ears, and by three I had to get all my teeth capped because they were too weak, this has effects early in life which I'll get to in a moment. By four I'd been molested by my half sister. In the early days of school, it was hard making friends, because since my teeth were capped and thus, silver, everyone was scared of me. This continued to around third grade when most of my visible baby teeth were gone, but then I had another problem, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, Crohn's colitis, that was around the time I started crying myself to sleep. In fifth grade I told someone and realized that wasn't normal. Let me preface this by saying I was a really shy kid, and I still am, and very anxious, so, in sixth grade, I got massively over-whelmed by the sudden fluctuation of around ~100 in my elementary school grade, to upwards of 2,000, this stressed me out, like, a lot, which flared up my Crohn's, causing pain, which would cause me to miss school, which would cause me to get make up work, which would stress me out, and it was a whole cycle. You can see where I'm going with this. By mid-way through seventh grade, I'd has enough, I switched to an online school, but that brought along with it, another set of problems. With my illness, anxiety, and overall introverted nature, I never have been and probably never will be the type of person to go out and do stuff, and that meant that without me having to go to school everyday, I didn't talk to people much. The only people I ever saw was my family, and even that was limited, as I was nocturnal, doing my schoolwork during the night, and sleeping during the day. Around this time I realized I was trans, which was a problem, because my parents aren't exactly accepting of all that. But I digress. This, and the fact that I had next to no human contact took a huge toll on my mental health, and my mind started to wander towards suicide. I started self-harming, and constructs a suicide plan, and drafted a note. When the day finally came, I sat there, staring at all the pills I'd measured out to hopefully be a lethal dose. Of course, I couldn't do it. So, I cowered in my room, frightened at the revelation that I was one step away from hell, at this point, I was probably going anyway, but I distinctly remember (this may be out of order) counting down the days till my 13th birthday, because if I wanted to kill myself and still go to heaven, that was my deadline. Around the time I started really considering suicide and almost attempting it, I had a conversation with my sister, in which my and our sister were naked and she was making me lick her, of course, else told our mother, and that was how I learned I was molested. Anyway, my parents found out I was suicidal (I don't remember how), and called DHS, and some people came to our house, so no, no, don't do that, gave me a snack on the wrist, and left. A bit later my parents decided to enroll me back in public schools. It was tough at first, being back, but I'm glad they put me back in. That year was okay, and then ninth grade was where I, once again, fucked everything up. See, the beginning of the year was going okay, I reacquainted with one of my friends with elementary school, so I had exactly one (1) friend. Things were going okay,  classes weren't too difficult, I was getting by at the very least, until I mad as new friend, whose name was Gary. See, Gary wasn't a bad guy, literally everything that went wrong was because of me, but anyway, I was obviously, excited that I'd made a new friend for the first time in years, so I invested all of my time and thought into my new friends, which had my grade drop. Drastically. I nearly failed that year. The only good thing that came from that year, was that I had a great friend for one year before he moved away. And that I got a B in biology literally without trying. Anyway, at the end of the year I got really sick, don't know what it was, a virus maybe, but I had to go to the hospital, missed about a week of school, right before finals, and so that was fun. Nothing crazy just threw that in for the Heck of it. Anyway, fast forward to next year, 10th grade. Probably (so far) the best year of my life. I had great teachers, one of which had the same disease as me, and I have it my all, did pretty good, and missed relatively little school. That is, until December 5th, 2018, it was a Wednesday, it was overcast (not even a joke I actually remember most details of that day) and my dad picked me up from school, like usual. He mentioned that my sister wanted a fat guy's hamburger (a local burger place) and I said that I'd be cool with that, but what I really wanted, was Whataburger, so, we went home, dropped our stuff off, and we're off to Whataburger, it took forever because traffic was insane, I think it was about five that we got out of Whataburger, and about 5:20 when we got home. Anyway I say down in the living room to eat my burger, drink my sweet tea, and eat my fries, all of which I did, as my dad and I watched the news, around an hour later, I was feeling really bad, my stomach was hurting really bad and I didn't know what to do, so I lied down in my bed, and told my mom when she got home. I had a doctor's appointment that next Monday so I stayed home for the next few days, and when we went, the doctor just said, ""yeah this is pretty bad"" and told me to stay home till at least after new years, which I did, at least, I tried to do, until Christmas eve, when, after it hadn't gotten better I we stood to go to the hospital. I convinced them to let me spend Christmas at home, and went the day after, I was there for about two weeks, and after we got out, we decided to get a new doctor, because no offense, but actually full offense my doctor was stupid, because apparently I was *super* malnourished, my entire gut was enflamed, and I was going to have to get my colon removed. Until I met Dr. Pickens, who fixed everything, I did end up going to the hospital again, this time I had to get a picc line, and so, had to stay home for another few months, but after that, I was good, got my picc line out, went back to school, managed to get my grades back up, catch up on school work, and finished the year strong. Now you may think that's where the story ends, but no, I wouldn't be posting here if that was where the story ended.


Fast forward a couple months, summers coming to a close, my knees have been bothering me for a while. I hurt them on Easter, but figure out would go away, but they were just hurting more and more, so I told my parents, we went to the doctor, and would you look at that; my knees are deteriorating as we speak, as a side-effect of the steroids I had to be on to make the pain bearable to me. So I have to start off the year in a wheelchair, that's fine, that's okay, right? That's not gonna mess me up too much... Right? Wrong. I have to leave school halfway through the day, everyday, for the foreseeable future for treatment for my legs. Great. Of course, me missing school affected my grades big time, and the treatment made me extremely tired so I just topped going to school for a while, I couldn't get to school from a combination of the depression that was beginning to set in due to the fact that I was in a wheelchair everyday, and that I was missing school, which put me further and further behind everyone else. For the second year in a row mind you. I just feel like I half to work twice as hard to half as far as everyone else. Anyway, slowly I ended up retreating from everything, I would wake up, go to treatments, go home, wallow in my depression, sleep, so whatever I could to take my mind off of it, maybe eat, go to sleep for the night, repeat. That was my schedule for around three months, until my legs were good enough to get out of the chair, I could stand, but my walking abilities were limited. So I would use a cane most of the time. However, the treatments would continue. So: I would continue my routine, this time without the chair, for another couple of months. Until I was back to school full time. Walking fairly normally, though occasionally with a noticeable limp. I was now leagues behind everyone else. And now I was back to my old habits, self harm, getting high, contemplating suicide. There's me, a suicidally depressed teenager with a chronic illness, two bum knees, and horrible grades, and my sister, a perfectly healthy teenager with a million friends, straight A's, and at this point, as a junior, has already been promised a scholarship at a college. Like I said, working twice as hard, getting half as far. Though, that doesn't really apply here does it? As ashamed as j am to say it, I've all but quit. I'm trying my best to keep up, but it's so hard. I understand nothing. My choices are either buckle down and try my best and go to summer school and do credit recovery, or get held back, but then I'll be in the same grade as my sister, and I know me, that's only going to make everything worse. So the way I see it, I have two options. I can either buckle down and work harder, or quit, take the easy way out, and end it all. I've been through all of this in the first 17 years of my life. Everyone always says it gets better, but then why hasn't it gotten better? At this point, the biggest thing keeping me here is my friend. I've known him his entire life, he's a year younger than me, and his best friend just killed herself, not but a few days before his 16th birthday, he loved her so much. I can't do that to him, not so soon. So as much as I want to let go, I'm hanging on for him.

Anyway thanks for reading my biography, if you read it all you're my favorite human, I'm not even sure do got the point across that I wanted to, but I'm too lazy to check so just gonna hope for the best I guess. Have a good day."
1265,I need an outlet for my anger,"The stress in my life and my relationship is destroying me and destroying my relationships with everyone close to me

I don't have any physical strength so working out is not an option.

Lately I've realized I get drunk and say really mean things to people I disagree with on reddit.

This probably isn't healthy.

I don't know what to do.

This is destroying my life"
1266,Loneliness.,"(Semi rant) It turns out someone I thought was my friend isn't really my friend. I'm now just seen as their friends little sister. I was so happy this year cause I thought I gained confidence and almost all of it dropped faster than my sanity. Last year I had no friends, Was lonely, And at a very bad mental state. I found the hobby cosplaying which helped because I made what I thought were friends. Turns out they hate me. I have a few friends left but its only once every few months I see them.. I feel like I've been used. I could've bought a new outfit but I bought it from them, I offered them money, Let then borrow a cosplay, And offered them boba. I tried to impress them because I was scared of losing this friendship but, I'm tired of them ditching me. Cosplay, The thing that saved my life, Turned into so much pain on the end. I have no more motivation. I'm gonna try to make some more friends but as of now I want to sleep without rubbing my eyes raw. And I want to wake up and cosplay my favorite character, Not worrying about all stress. Sorry for the vent, I love you guys thank you for reading this. God bless you all, May your lives be better than mine. 😂😭"
1267,What should I do?,"I was like 12 or 11 when a neighbour used to molest me sexually and used to threaten me.
I got beptized later when I became 13 and I told him to stop and my religion don't allow all these bad things.

He used to force me into doing shit. I am male and 22 now. No one knows about it. He is living normal life. Last year was so bad for me financially and mentally. My dad was not healthy, he was not getting any salary for 6 months. I was scared. He do not have gallbladder.

 I tried contacting some friends and asked them for work such as websites. No one helped me though. I found a friend lastly whom I found on Facebook who gave me small online work. I was studying in a uni and I thought that I should drop out. I was in severe depression and emotional as hell. I failed in 2 exams. I was good in academics throughout. Was in top 10. Everything messed up when I joined this new uni for higher studies. My roommate in hostel was pervert too used to fantasize about making playboy of our country. 

I can not sit in placements for companies this year. I am bipolar too and always think that I will make things work and do some stuff which end up failing, making me more depressed, everyday is a rollercoaster of emotions, one time I am manic and other time I am lying in my bed.

So my young brother who is now like 18. He is also shy. I looked at his phone, he searched for gay forums and apps and is part of some forums. I asked him about this. He did not tell me. This went for several months. I asked him several times that ""has anyone done something bad to him?"" He always denied. Today I told him about my past that a guy used to do bad shit to me. I was thinking that same guy was culprit. I was filled with resentment, fear and all that stuff. He told me that once a gardener tried to do bad shit to him, and my brother ran away as he was scared. My brother does not go outside anymore.

I can not tell it to my parents. They are old and are not much healthy. My career is ruined. I have no proof and I can not physically harm those perverts. This will raise many questions, and if went legal I can not win. I am really poor now atm. Now I am feeling so sad, I can not focus on study. I cry sometimes. I am coward I guess. I was always bullied, in school, in play ground, in everything. I was mocked because of religion. I live in area where we are minority. I am nerd wanted to break poverty of my family and make them proud. I wanted to freelance full time last year, but my procrastination, lack of expertise and depression ruined it. I try, give up, try again and procrastinate. If I get a job I will have to move away from my family making me more anxious. If this freelancing worked out it will be life saving. 

I am again in the beginning. I try to study, I get negative thoughts, I procrastinate. Yes I can not afford therapy. I will make it work somehow I think. I don't know how to feel safe in society. I am worried about my parents, my family all the time. 

I am reading ""feeling good new mood therapy book"". I have no friends, my career is ruined and I am depressed! This year I want to make myself stronger so that I can fight this bullshit. 

To the parents I beg you that always try to be in contact with your kids. Tell them when they are young that if someone touch them wrongly immediately tell you.

These perverts can ruin whole life of someone and can live normally in pride in society.

Sorry for my english. I am not native."
1268,Am I incapable of loving?,"I have someone I talk to everyday, multiple times, for over a year. He lives away from me. I was planning to move in with him. But since he has no money or a job I was going to pay for everything. That concerned me and I bailed.
He often gives me the silent treatment for the littlest things and I got tired of it. I'm on silent treatment every two days. Last time I didn't feel like apologising for the hundredth time because it was over something very stupid again, like the others. We didn't talk about 3 days. I didn't feel like talking but I joined the discord call with him anyway. I said 2 sentences with a long pause between them. He didn't listen the second one. If someone I love didn't talk to me for 3 days I wouldn't be zoned out at their second sentence.

People used to endure a lot to make their marriage work. I feel like maybe I'm too petty. I'm in my early 30s and feel like an asexual. I don't desire anyone anymore. I'm going to be alone forever aren't I?"
1269,It feels like I’m losing myself,"
I feel like I’m probably going to ramble on but to say the least I’m only diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder but haven’t had a re-evaluation in years and can’t get one for a while for financial reasons. I’d just like help finding coping mechanisms other people have used who have felt the same way, I’ve tried everything but nothing seems to stop this spaced out feeling. I know there’s depersonalization/derealization but since I haven’t been diagnosed I don’t want to self label it. But this is how I’ve been feeling. I’ve always felt like I’m not me, hyper aware that I’m a real person but not really connecting my face and body to “me”, but lately it’s gotten a lot worse. I’ve had episodes where it’s worse some days than others. The other day I got so spaced out i barely even recognized my own name, I’m struggling to keep a grasp on myself and who I am. I really can’t remember a time where anything felt real, even when I was a child I never felt right or really in my body at all. I feel like I’m broken and I have no idea how to fix it. It’s scary. I don’t have a healthy support system in my life which doesn’t help either because I have no one to talk to. I’m in a relationship but my boyfriend has never fully understood what I’m feeling no matter how I describe it. I’m at a loss on what to do. I’m not on medication (and as previously stated I currently am not in a situation to afford it right now even though I desperately need it). I’ve tried everything from hobbies to attempting to make new friends and force myself to at least go outside  but nothing ever helps me feel grounded. If anyone can help me understand this feeling I’d be extremely grateful."
1270,How to figure out appropriate level of care,"I've been losing my mind in multiple ways for the past 4 months or so leading up to me losing my job. I've been putting off going to the doctor for intensive psychiatric care because of an absolutely horrible experience I had being admitted about a year and a half ago. 

I've been having intense avoidant anxiety to seeking out the treatment I know I desperately need. Either I am reacting to the past experience of being admitted (along with a failed suicide attempt while ""under observation"" that the staff either failed to notice or didn't care to intervene) or large part of my subconscious has just already given up and my consciousness is slowly coming to realize this fight is no longer worth going through or I don't want to succeed.

Whatever it may be, I want to know how I can avoid being admitted to a place that, if it were a prison it would've long been shut down and the staff would've been indicted. I don't have health insurance currently which has been adding to my avoidance to seek treatment for the financial obligation that would follow. 

How do I accurately gauge the quality of a facility?

How do i explain what my needs are? What may help?

How do I know if I need to be admitted inpatient or can opt for a outpatient program?

Thanks, for any responses, I'm at a complete loss."
1271,My obsession with music and surfing the internet at the same time," I love music and surfing the internet, preferably both at the same time. I once failed out of college because I would rather listen to music and surf the net at the same time. I somehow graduated and I work full time in a STEM job. Outside of work,I have no desire to do anything outside of listening to music and reading stuff on the internet. I don't use social media outside of reddit and I have little desire to do so.

I've had depression (self diagnosed) but it only shows up in social situations. I have kind of dealt with my depression successfuly. However, I am rather selfish and blunted affect in pubic.

I don't know if this is normal or if I should stay like this but it does worry me."
1272,Anybody had trouble with sleeping on antidepressants?,"And if so, how long did it took you to get good solid 8-9 hours of sleep? Am on 10 mg of Trintellix, ( my first week though ), but seems I can’t pull more then 6 hours of sleep and that is with waking up every two hours. When does it get better and does it ever? Somebody wrote yesterday about 9 hours of sleep, feel I would kill for that now. :)"
1273,It’s 1 am and my mom still isn’t home after going to the casino with her “friend”,So bullshit and she complains why I get mad and she’s so oblivious. Always talks about how she’s bored at home and wants to go out but she doesn’t have to do shit like this! She has a son and husband at home but she’s prefer to be with her “friend” who I’m sure she’s done stuff with. I don’t even feel mad anymore I’ve gotten used to all the stuff she’s done but I still feel like I have a part in my mind that’s just cloudy and just tries to prevent me from going mad. Bullshit
1274,Can I go Back to Bed and not wake up yet?,"Tinulog ko nalang yung pagod ko kagabi hanggang sa magising ako ng madaling araw kanina it took me so long to fell back asleep again i listen to the music, i write and kung ano ano pa inabot ako ng umaga di parin ako makatulog i prayed and call upon his name pero bakit ganito? I woke up with the same feeling like i did before i thought i'm doing it all good now but why? Its here again, I'm in funk again and i don't want it to be here, 'coz i'm sick of it. I'm trying my best, i'm trying my best to be okay, i'm trying my best but every day it's so hard. Its like how can you fix something if you don't know what is broken? Everything is broken and i don't think any of it can be fixed. I'm broke all over again and again how can i remove this pain in me, i've been carrying all along i distracted myself to all the things. That i can able to do i go back to my old habbits that makes me happy before but i guess it didn't lasts longer; and here i am wondering why i feel this way again. Can i go back to bed? Sleep a little longer, voices in my head, can i go back to bed 'cause i'm not ready to wake up."
1275,I'm all for mental health but...n,"I cant stand the online community's that are influencing everyone to be so sensitive...

with the trigger warnings on school books 
with the fat acceptance
with the trans and drag making kids mad 
with anyone who just doesnt want to recover but want people to accept them 

I dont agree with these communities at all they turn everthing into B.S and never recover they are too sensitive to live"
1276,16 and need help urgant,"So basically my whole life I’ve had depression very simple things like yelling or someone being mean to me can trigger it while larger things can cause me to break down when I was 12 I invited a guy over and it changed the way my parents treated me my mom treated me with distrust our relationship got worse and so on eventually I invited another guy over and was sent to live with dad I OD but lived sadly a year ago I invited a third guy over now I’m treated with more distrust and am reminded by the constantly of what I did which causes me to have a deep depression I have no freedom in what I do, go, or wear can’t do normal teenage things like drive, have a job, even have technology (bought phone myself and hid it) And whenever I tell my mom about wanting to do something or be given more freedom she always says you only have two more years and refuses to let me live with my dad due to his financial problems and his girlfriend my family knows I have bad mental health and get me counselors but I doubt they know the severity of it all of this drives me in a deep depression and I’m just sick of all of it I have nothing to live for no friends and no one likes me at school or anything I feel worthless and like there’s nothing to live for I’m thinking about OD again because of all this above but scared of what happens when I die and if I attempt to do this again I want to make sure it works can anyone give me advice on how to make sure it works this time because last time i took a good amount of different types of pills and still lived and also help me get rid of my fear of dying I’m hoping that I’ll be reincarnated and finally be able to be happy for once and live a better one than this"
1277,Recommend me a book,I am severely mentally ill. Severe social anxiety makes my life so scary. But anyways please recommend me a book that is a generally very powerful book about keeping an overall healthy mind/psyche
1278,I’m lonely and I don’t know why,"Like I said in the title. I can’t see any reason in my life that I should feel like this. I have good friends that care about me. My family is supportive of what I do but when I hang out with groups of people, I just feel alone. I’ll be at a restraint with my friends and just feel like no one there is hanging out with me or I’m just a space filler even though we’re all at the same table. I just don’t understand."
1279,The Importance of Food in Mental Health," We all know how food affects not only our physical health but our mental health too, by influencing our mood. Have you noticed that eating certain food makes you feel great while certain foodstuffs make you feel ill at ease. There is a good reason for that as research shows. Nutritious food is required for our body to function well, more so our brain.  Studies have shown that cutting down on processed food intake, refined carbohydrates, and sugar, and increasing fruits, vegetables, fish, and nuts resulted in improvement in depression symptoms. Vitamin supplements and probiotics also have a positive impact on improving the mood and overall mental health of people. Research has proved that people who followed the Mediterranean diet consisting of more fruits, vegetables, olive oil, lean meat, and nuts, have a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms later.  To know more on the effect of diet on mental health, please read the article in my blog:  [https://hubpages.com/health/The-Importance-of-Food-in-Mental-Health](https://hubpages.com/health/The-Importance-of-Food-in-Mental-Health)"
1280,Feeling accomplished.,"After almost 6 months of the worst depression I have ever experienced, I finally picked myself up and spent almost  12  hours cleaning every inch of my home. It sounds stupid but I already feel slightly better knowing I’ve achieved what seemed to be such a daunting task and that I’m no longer surrounded by clutter and old reminders."
1281,I'm afraid of being touched,"This'll be long. I'm 18F. I dealt with anxiety and depression pretty heavily for 3-4 years. I feel I have overcome depression, and I'm a lot better at coping with anxiety than I used to be.

I struggle with my sexuality. I suppose I'm asexual, and knowing this and trying to escape it was a large part of my depression as a teenager. I am still afraid of winding up alone, and I am also afraid of human touch. I have never been in a relationship, largely because I can't handle the thought of sex or kissing. At the same time, I long to experience dating and love.

When I was younger I tried therapy a few times. One of my therapists was a very nice man, probably in his forties, who I wanted to like. On about our 3rd appt, he told me to sit all the way back on the couch (anxious mess I was, I always trembled on the very edge) and close my eyes and breathe. The fear was paralyzing. I have tried to analyze what I was even scared of. I was completely irrationally afraid he was going to rape me, but even more than that I was simply afraid of him getting any closer to me. Had he simply sat next to me, I would have broken down crying.

He isn't the only man I've been scared of. Teachers, relatives, even guys my own age. Women too. I am scared of physical exams. I haven't been to a doc in years because of it. It's so ridiculous, but I felt violated even by my female pediatrician's gentle touch. Even my best friends' hugs are accepted rigidly and reluctantly.

Why am I like this?! 

I feel left behind by life sometimes. My friends gush about their dates and crushes, but I can't do any more than smile for them. I can't even tell them about all these feelings, because it sounds absurd to be afraid of a doctor touching you or a therapist asking you to relax. My twin sister has expressed similar feelings and is actually seeing a therapist, something I can't afford to do right now. 

What would cause someone with no history of sexual trauma to develop aversions to touch and fears of intimacy?"
1282,How to fight confidence issues,"Currently a male college student, I have social anxiety (it's a lot better than it used to be, I'm on my way to overcome it) and have a history of self deprication (used to weigh 240 pounds, lost 40 pounds because I hated myself that badly) and lately I've been feeling so low some nights. 

My confidence issues aren't severe, but they're very much pronounced. My good friends make comments about it (with positive intentions) and I just feel like I overthink things and easily fall into self deprication. 

There are nights where I go home to cry in bed feeling awful about myself because of little comments that are made about me (even though I know my reaction is irrational, or if a friend made a comment when we were both saying jokes about each other)  or I just spiral into negative thoughts about my appearence, abilities, and characteristics. 

I think part of it is that as a guy, I feel like the principles of toxic masculinity have affected me to the point where I don't want to be seen at a low point and expose my struggles. And I think my problems now stem predominantly being overweight and how it makes me feel inadequate but also I wouldn't be surprised if part of it had to do with the history of bullying I grew up with. 

If anyone has any suggestions on strategies or resources to use in order to start building a future where I'm happier with myself, please let me know. I'm so tired of being limited by my insecurities and I want to start living my life with less fear. 

Thank you!!! 


TL:DR What have yall done or recommend in order to start attacking insecurities and boosting confidence to reduce the limitations it puts on your life?"
1283,How to cope with social anxiety,"So I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for a long time now, and that paired with major depression really makes for a killer combo for a vicious cycle of being depressed because I’m lonely, and not wanting to go out and meet people because of social anxiety. I’ve tried a few different mechanisms, both healthy and unhealthy, and nothing seems to work so far. So I was wondering what some of you do that I could try out that hopefully helps. 
Thank you all in advance!"
1284,The Fuck?,"Just want an answer.
Im 18, 19 in july,
Was homeless for 9 months now as of yesterday I have a 2 bedroom apartment, im reunited with my puppy, my relationship with my mother/sister is getting stronger everyday, there proud, and have watched me come up from what I have experienced and personally consider rock bottom(allat, just so you have a pattern painted that outside my confusion im doing fantastic for myself real world wise)I can't sleep, I feel out of routine(but what routine was I ever fucking used too?) I have stability now and I feel during the day I can get myself out of this ""autopilot"" state, though at night i can't feel relaxed, im not stressed or anxious im just awake and have a blank mind. I have past diagnosis n shit, but to me, that shits irrelevant. this is something new, I want to get a handle on it before I experience something else im not familiar with. Any ideas? Please respond. Im getting annoyed with myself, and I'd like another able mind to help me brainstorm. This shits just frustrating, I value my morality more than anything else, Im a keen believer in independence, and I can't quite get it through my head asking for a little help sometimes is aight, prove me right or wrong im going to try and get what little sleep I can manage, if I can manage, throughout the rest of the night. Thank you

1285,th is wrong with me?,"i dont even know how i feel

i dont feel depressed i dont feel anxious but i still feel weird

recently i went thru a period of psychosis, thot that i was mentally disbaled forreal,  well i had like a paranoia. im kinda over it now. but still feel weird.

i have this weird fear of getting depressed. like i have no reason to be depressed, but what if it will start out of nowhere? it is so weird. and that thought makes me feel the way i feel now. i know it doesnt make sense but i dont even know.

im 18 btw, and lonely asf. maybe that's the reason

well im sure it caused me to be psychotic

im off college for a month now. fell out with my close friends and i am mostly at home. well i work out everyday, but i definitely lack human interactions. this past month was so bad. i didn't feel at peace not even once. i forget how it is to be around people, or how im percieved by them and probably that drives me nuts. because when im around people i feel normal, i dont feel there's anything wrong with me. well thanks god im past that period.

but now the only thing im waiting for is the break to end. i will probably get back to normal

but still, right now, what is this feeling? is this cuz of my age or what?"
1286,Do people with schizoid personality disorder tend to have friends?,"I feel like I might have schizoid or avoidant personality disorder, due to the symptoms describing me quite well (not self-diagnosing, I plan on bringing it up with my psychiatrist). 

The only thing that makes me think it might be Avoidant is the fact that I do want to have relationships with my friends. I desire to chime in to conversations, but I don’t because i’m afraid of embarrassing myself. 

There are times where I’ll just sit at home and play video games with my other friends, instead of going out. Would this be considered avoidant or schizoid?"
1287,Except for therapy (too scared to go) what things can I do to start treating avoidant personality disorder?,"What can I do to make it better?

I want my life back."
1288,Seema like nothing helps or works,"I've been going through a rough patch. I was recently diagnosed with mild depression and GAD and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like I am making a meal out of how i'm feeling. I try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a distraction technique but I am now feeling like I should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, I wont feel guilty about bothering someone. I have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and I am sleeping less. I tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. I also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but didn't notice much difference. I'm at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do. I'm not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i'll get anything out of it. But i think the anonymity of it helps a little."
1289,Please help me understand myself,I know this is not the best place but I can’t afford to see a therapist or something. Lately I’ve been feeling this heavy weight on my chest from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep. Been crying almost everyday and I’m not surprised bc I’ve been going thru shit haha. But my emotions have been whack for a while from being depressed to getting really angry for the smallest things. Even when i just remember an experience that’s already passed. I didn’t have the best childhood which makes me lash out to my parents. Only to my parents tho never to anyone else. I’ve already suspected I’m depressed but I don’t understand why I’m angry all the damn time. TIA!
1290,"Basically having a full mental break (not break as rest, break as in broken)","I've been through extreme amounts of stress lately.  Brief summary of the past year:

Met the love of my life (at the time), had to leave due to visa issue (I am an American living abroad), left France at the end of my 90 days for a job in Poland.  Poland was shit.  After a  few moths I was miserably depressed and tried hanging myself in my apartment.  Someone convinced me to leave, went back to France to stay with this person (different person), and after two days she said she wanted her house back, this after saying I could stay for months. I scrambled to make money online, went to Romania.  Had a shitty month there, got a little more money together went to Belgrade.  Really liked Belgrade, decided to stay. Not realizing a lot of people just do border runs, I started the residency process.  Apartments were getting messy.  Noise, owners who wouldn't supply documents for the residency application, it turned into three apartments in a month, all the while trying to hold down a real job at this point (working remotely, but started with a financial firm based in NY).  So stress was already very high.  Then the apartment I took that was supposed to be my HOME after having everything approved with everyone, literally ... I got a Facebook message while running errands from the people I was renting from saying I had to leave.  No discussion, wouldn't say anything else,  just that I had to go.  I tried to find another place, more problems, and middle of the week, just had  a total nervous breakdown.  I was found myself walking the streets for hours not sure where to go.  it was a total mess.  I tried to talk to the people, and they wouldn't, which caused more suffering.  I get in to a new place, but at this point, I am broken,  I feel so utterly broken.  I maybe could have tried harder to talk to these people, it needed to be impressed upon the what state I was in.  I have a message drafted now i will send, but... I'm already in a new place.  I could go back, maybe it would help....  where I'm at now, though, work is not letting up, I cannot take time off (it's serious work, there are multi-million dollar deals riding on my work).   I can't just quit, I don't have much in savings and am living in foreign countries, I have no family, nowhere to ""go back to"" just ... the stress is killing me, I'm not sleeping well, having panic attacks, and mental breaks nearly daily I don't know what to do."
1291,Is this what life is supposed to be like?,"I feel like I live my life in cycles of feeling sortof okay and then periods of anxiety, suicidal thoughts, feeling absolutely horrible. I just don't know what the point is, if I'm just going to end up feeling horrible again."
1292,Went to therapy last week and i don't think i will ever go back to therapy.,"I am starting to realize i am becoming a bigger and badder monster. No amount of ''therapy'' will help or fix this animal i have become. I have missed so many appointments and sabotaged every little shred of betterment. As a result of the public system (Australia), i must attend a few pointless sessions to gain the trust to make sure i will attend CBT, Because it is not about the patient, it is about getting paid$$$.

Last week i was literally just sitting there and explaining my whole pathology and she just had a ''Aww baby'' look on her face. It exhausted me. i got home and went into a fit of rage, i beat myself over exposing myself and oversharing so easily.

i think it is pointless to literally blackmail me by telling me to attend a few sessions before referring me to an actual psychologist. 

I have no hope, the same abusive patterns continued in my life after returning home from therapy, particularly towards people online. It did not change anything, deep down i am still seething with rage and i believe nothing will ever help the unique human being i am. I am a serial Narcissist but one with the ability to have empathy. It took years of studying myself to recognize that i am a very rare specimen. I am a pathological liar, i am sadistic in every way, i feel envious all the time, i see everything as a competition in which i need to win, i am highly grandiose. I feed over hurting people and starting drama, i am a bully and i enjoy being a bully. A relationship is a means to an end in which i need to win, it is all about making the other person lose and crumble.

Sometimes i am able to reflect on my behavior and feel slight remorse, but most of the time i just don't care enough to feel any sorrow. I see society as a place that has destroyed me and as a result i am doing my due dilligence by abusing everybody emotionally in a very controlled, articulated, cunning way.

Many times i sigh at a therapist because i feel pissed off they don't appear as knowledgeable as i am when it comes to therapy. People on here keep saying ''get help'' and i have now, but i am just not committed, i am not interested in sitting and taking accountability for being some ''bad person''.

I can't even do DBT, because i would only use DBT as a means to manipulate all of the girls with BPD and low self esteem and use them as my narcissistic supply. I also wouldn't be able to handle listening to other ''losers'' personal stories, i hate most of mankind so how can attending a group setting help?

I feel there is truly nothing to fix, i recognize i need help in some areas but i just do not care enough to actually challenge it. It is all gonna take years of work, that is if no one triggers me in the process, but i am doomed. I guess i'll be another Sam Vaknin who will just be self aware but never do anything about it.

I am actually capable of improving some of these traits, but they come at the cost of other peoples needs. Some of these needs include: not triggering me, validating all of my suffering and trauma, validating that many times i am right and not wrong, having male role models, easing my defenses by treating me how i wish, and also giving me tips on better emotional regulation, anger resolution, conflict resolution skills, positive thinking. 

I forgot to add that reading many triggering things online is set to trigger a full blown episode in me, in which my homocidality is exacerbated, and trigger episodes of cutting myself, as well as tearing up on bed and having thought of overdosing on all of my meds. My mood is generally okay and i do feel empathy for people who may be hurting but this is selective and my brain decides who to turn empathy on for.

I am decided of being dismissed as ''traits'', i want full recognition of my personality disorders, if i do not get this i do not see myself as moving forward ever, and yes i care about a label more than getting better."
1293,Destabilizing,"Diagnosed with PTSD &amp; anxiety. 
I used to also be major depressive,  but that diagnosis was removed. I've been both on meds AND doing CBT.
I've been seeking treatment off and on for almost 15 years; I've had a lot of side effect issues. 
In November, they put me on buspirone, which was helping. About a week ago,  I started having rapid heart rate,  spiking bp, chest pain, shortness of breath,  etc. Turns out I've got serotonin toxicity.  By direction of my doctor,  I'm discontinuing meds and flushing this out of my system. I've got to wait to start new meds,  at least a week.  
I've been off my meds for a day.  I've been having marital issues,  and for the last months I've been clear headed enough to realise my frustrations with my marriage weren't mental health related, yet some of them were. Well, my husband upset me by not coming to bed until 630 this morning, a common occurrence.  I want to say something about it, but I'm destabilizing, so I don't want to overreact. Debating if I should just wait until I'm back on meds to address it, because I feel like he'll just say I'm not on meds, and that's my issue even when these same issues were brought to his attention when I've been stabilized. I hate that I second guess even legit concerns in my relationship and even tend to minimize my own frustrations because I'm afraid I'm always ""overreacting"".
I want to get this crap out of my system and move on to the next treatment option."
1294,Need some advice.,"It seems like it's on and off, there are times when I feel like helping anyone I can, being nice to others in any way I can think of, helping homeless people, things like that. And then the next day I get the feelings of fuck the world, everyone in it. On those days I hate to say it but I enjoy watching others suffer. I wouldn't ever want to be the cause of it by any means but if I see someone going through it I almost find a sadistic joy in it. I want to help people one day and watch them suffer the next. I prefer the first but its almost like the extremely negative feelings are more intrusive than intentional. Hard to control. It's like I just want to watch the world around me burn and then I want to help the world around me in any way possible. I dont know. I dont know if I'm losing my mind or what. Not to mention the general depression, anxiety, and feelings of extreme loneliness I have constantly.."
1295,When your SO causes your mental health to take a dive,"I think I just need some place to vent about how my brain consistently makes me believe that my SO values other, more immediate fun things more highly than me. Sorry that it's long.

In short: Long-distance since 2017, me (28f, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety) and him (31m, ADHD), see each other every 2 weeks, sometimes 3, he knows about my mental health issues, we're fairly well-attuned to each other, all in all very mature, loving and benevolent relationship.

Right now we're in a 3-week spell until he supposedly comes to see me next weekend.

It's been going pretty great for a few months now. Last week I felt safe and vulnerable enough to want to connect more and ask about more detailed future plans. We know we want kids and roundabout when, I wanted to ask him how exactly he feels about it as I know he's still scared of not knowing how to do things right/be a responsible enough adult. Also wanted to ask more about closing the distance, if he'd like his own place in the same city first, move in together in my existing flat or a new one, etc. Basically just create connection through specifying plans together. I asked him one Thursday if we could call (we only call about once every 1-2 weeks). He had to work a lot, and I didn't want him to push back his work just for some talk with me, as he has an important deadline at the end of March and his contract is on the line. Our call got pushed back more and more. Almost a week later I asked him if he'd be free the next night, and he replied that he was at a friend's house right now, drinking wine. I felt hurt because I'd had stepped back, but then not gotten first priority treatment when he was free. Instead, a hangout with a friend was more important to him. I didn't want to bring it up as this has happened a few times in the past, and I communicated how it made me feel like I wasn't important to him, and he always understood and said sorry, but yet it doesn't change. I attribute this to his ADHD by now, and a very secure attachment in that he trusts that I'm there and will be there, so it doesn't matter so much WHEN we talk.

Next thing is a wedding we were invited to together abroad. The couple changed their wedding date, I can't afford booking another flight. My SO didn't seem very fazed about me not being able to come. I know there will be a lot of people from his past there, and I told him how my brain was telling me that he'd just be happy to go there without me, because in my head I'm always keeping him from the more fun things (hanging out with friends instead of having a phone call with me).

And then, to top it off, yesterday my country's health government declared an area as at-risk for corona that my SO is going to travel to tomorrow for a yearly work getaway. They go to a hotel in the Alps, work around 6-8 hours a day, and spend the rest of the time drinking or skiing or going to the sauna together. We had planned that he'd come up next weekend, two days after returning from that at-risk area. Now if he goes, it's highly likely that he won't be able to come to see me. He has not decided against going. He says he's on the fence and hasn't decided if he'll go or not, but even that hurts me right now because it's in line with the other things mentioned. 

I'm having pretty bad anxiety with these three things stacking up and I'm just so tired of not being able to just brush these things aside.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: long-distance bf repeatedly chooses friends over even just a call with me, might sacrifice the one weekend we could have this month for a voluntary work-getaway instead, intrusive thoughts try to convince me that he doesn't value me like i value him."
1296,Stuck in a mental health ward,
1297,How to forget things you’ve learned?,"I’ve recently learned about quantum immortality and it has scared the shit out of me. I haven’t slept in 2 days, I can’t get the idea of not being able to die. Please help"
1298,Changing back to your old self when you’re in an old environment,"So I’m having this issue where I’ve made huuuuge strides in the last year, but I’ve reconnected with close friends from a couple years ago and being with them, I revert to this old version of me that doesn’t really exist anymore. 

I’m quite loud, boisterous and honest but I found myself being reserved, polite, quiet and self conscious, like my old self - who I’ve haven’t really been in about a year! 

Any tips???"
1299,"Unsure whether I'm having a psychotic relapse, or I'm just surrounded by assholes","This is driving me crazy.

Aside from chronic depression, which I'd been diagnosed with 6 years ago, I went through a period 4 years ago where I had psychotic episodes for a little over 4 months, mostly manifesting in verbal hallucinations, among other symptoms. The symptoms cleared away after I was on antipsychotics for around 3 months, they went away right after I started taking the meds, but I stayed on them per my therapists recommendations.

Jump to the current time, I've been employed at my current organizations for a little over half a year now, and I've been juggling with showing up to office and maintaining my own business and work. Early on, my failing to balance between the two may have resulted in my boss having second doubts, and **I think** he started monitoring my workplace PC use sometime around 3 months into my employment. I have no evidence to support this, but for the fucking constant cues and behaviours of my co-workers, and this fucking voice I keep hearing around me when I'm there all the time. It's eerily consistent with whatever is going on on my screen, as if I'm having someone consistently commentate on everything that I do. I cannot work under any sort of monitoring whatsoever, and it's drives me insane that I'm unsure whether there's actually someone monitoring me or not.

I'm a long time amphetamine and flouxetine user, as I use both to manage my depression and make enough money so that I can pay my own bills and my immediate family's. We've never been that financially secure, so I've had to do this since before I enrolled in university. I never told my parents about my depression or the psychotic episodes, as I fail to see how that would accomplish anything but make those around me miserable.

I'm tired of whatever the fuck is going on here, and I even hear the voice as I'm typing this, although I'm on my weekend break, and I'm sitting in a coffee shop nowhere near my workplace. One of my co-workers knows that I come here everyday, and I've somehow managed to correlate this with the voice that I'm hearing right now. I think it's insane to even believe that someone's watching me, and it's driving me crazy. 

I'm not sure what to do, and I cannot confront anyone at my workplace as the last instance I've done this resulted in a huge fallout with someone who had no idea what I was talking about. I was paranoid back then, and I'm afraid that I am paranoid right now.

If it wasn't for the constant clues that there's actually something going on, I'd dismiss this as symptoms of stimulant abuse, and as the result of my constantly working mind, along with sleep deprivation. 

My therapist isn't helping, and I have no one to discuss this with. I'm afraid that if I confront any of my co-workers that I'll go insane at the very confirmation of the fact, as it has been affecting everything that I do for a while now. In short, I might fucking kill whoever I talk to, and I came close once before.

This may sound overly exaggerated, but it really isn't. I can't deal with stress in a reasonable manner, as you may have inferred, and I tend to build up enough until I lash out all at once.

I'm quitting either way tomorrow, as either situation is affecting me all the same, and its no longer healthy for me to stay there. I'm not sure, however, whether I should say anything, or how at all I should deal with the situation. I can't ask, as asking would do me no good if anyone denied it, and I'd still be skeptical. If they confirm it, then I'm afraid I'd lash out. I can't think of a possibly good outcome here.

I don't know what to do, and I thought I'd ask a bunch of strangers to help me out. I just want some advice as to how I should resolve or approach this matter. 

Many thanks in advance."
1300,Carnivore diet is doing great things for my mental health,"I'm autistic and also have emotionally unstable personality disorder, I've also been depressed ever since I can remember and of course due to my conditions I have anxiety. I've been through so much shit in my life its a miracle I'm still alive. My whole life I've been eating SHIT food that tastes delicious but is terrible for me. I have very little self control when it comes to food. Everyone knows food is connected to gut bacteria is connected to the brain and mental health. However recently I started the carnivore diet, that is literally only meat and animal products nothing else. I was inspired by Joe Rogan and a few others and its been great. I mean sure it's boring as hell but I've noticed a difference already. 

I feel more mentally clear, less anxious, I don't feel like my world is coming to an end every second of the day which is amazing considering the financial stress I'm under. I'm not angry anymore, I don't get paranoid that people are laughing at me or judging me I feel more confident. I'm not looking to food for comfort anymore. 

Only thing I would say is I need more salt, I can tell this because I used to train mma and when I didn't get enough salt I would feel a bit dizzy sometimes.

If you are struggling with mental health please look into the carnivore diet not only for mental health benefits but also physical benefits. I've lost 5lbs in 4 days, yes it's mostly water weight but the lack of carbs means I'm not bloated with water anymore."
1301,Broke down in front of my manager,"I went to work today, and had a pretty bad nosebleed. I didn't really think much of it as they've been happening pretty regularly. I couldn't stop it so I asked to go home.

For some reason I asked one of my managers to come into the break room. I told him how my fiancé has been strugling with depression and about her suicide attempt, and how its been affecting me at work. Tears streaming down my face, but I made it to the end and told him everything.

I feel so stupid now.

The manager was so supportive. He said that there is life outside of work. That mental health is important."
1302,He said if I called an ambulance he'd pretend he was normal and they would never know. Help.,"Husband hasn't done this kind of thing often but I have noticed a few times he's really weird like this. Once when he still lived with his family we were on the phone late at night and he was hyperventilating, whimpering, stuttering, repeating the same words/sentences over and over again and then his mom knocked on the door. And he said in an absolutely normal voice, ""Yeah I'm okay mom. Good night."" And then after a minute he went back to freaking out. Recently he was going crazy again, wheezing and just...raving... I can't remember exactly because so much has been happening lately but he probably talked about killing himself or something and I said that I was going to call an ambulance and he just stopped and looked straight at me, and calmly said, ""I'll just act normal and tell them I'm fine. They'll never know."" And he continued on boasting about how he can convince doctors he's normal. I feel like he sounds like a psychopath at this point or something I am so very sorry if that's the wrong term...
Other things he does include banging his head on the wall, punching himself in the face, talking to himself, talking to voices in his head, more rarely but visual and sensory hallucinations as well as auditory like I said, wordless screams, seemingly trying to rip his hair out, sudden and rapid mood swings sometimes going back and forth e.g. intense anger followed by sadness and regret followed by intense anger again and again... Many times he has gotten a sharp object and would not let go of it and talks about how he should just kill himself so I don't have to deal with him or because the pain is too much... But he keeps reassuring me that he won't. The other day he wouldn't give me the knife but then he finally said that he would give it to me if I promised to listen to him... As though I don't listen if he doesn't have a knife? Yall that is just not true... I just don't know what to do at this point. I wonder a lot if he's faking everything.
He was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago but I'm so unsure of that at this point. I'm no therapist but there has to be more.
He pretty obviously has mania and depression. He suddenly gets very indifferent and somber...or weirdly energetic, upbeat and confident...
The other day he took my phone and said he was going to go kill himself and headed toward the door... Honestly...? I stopped him. Physically. For about an hour I just ran after him and we wrestled for the phone as I also tried to stop him from leaving and killing himself... We both have bruises everywhere now. I know that part is for sure really bad but I have just no idea what to do at this point. I want to tell his family. I sort of fear for our lives at this point. Just wanting some objective opinions about how bad/urgent the situation is. My personal opinion is that he needs an intervention and to stay in a mental facility for a while... Btw he only started therapy again a month ago and after like 3 appointments the psychologist said to see a psychiatrist. We're waiting for that which will be in a few days... I don't think it's enough and worry about us making it that far.

We're in Kentucky if you guys have any suggestions at all."
1303,"i'm not scared of death anymore, and i don't know what to do.","i'll just get straight to the point. no reason to pad any of this out.

i'm not scared of death anymore.
i've always been scared of death - the idea of no longer being able to think or breathe anymore terrified me ever since i was 5.

but now i'm not scared of it anymore, and that scares me.

i've always had trouble with mental health, and have had a few panic attacks and/or mental breakdowns since i was little. now with the stress of school, the stress of expectation, my want for my girlfriend's attention, and so much more, the idea of suicide seems more tempting than ever. i just don't want to feel anything anymore. i don't want to feel hurt, or want. all it ever brings me is more hurt than before.

i don't know what to do. neither of my parents are home, my older sister is out with friends, and my little sisters are at daycare. all i have is my dog and my cat. if i did try anything nobody would find me for a while.

but at the same time i don't want to cause even more pain to my friends and family. i already make them go through so much. what should i do?"
1304,Huge work mistake triggering anxiety,"I made a huge mistake at work. Like so massive that the legal team, our CEO and VP had to get involved, but it ended up not being a big deal (legal was unconcerned, and CEO/VP didn't think additional action was needed). 

The problem is my boss is really triggering some old trauma/wounds. She's extremely passive aggressive and unpredictable, so this was an issue before the mistake happened, but because this is happening after such a huge mistake my mind is running in circles. I'm terrified of getting fired, and she's giving me the cold shoulder (which to me seems like proof that I might get fired). 

The only reason that I know the mistake wasn't such a huge issue is because \*other people\* outside of my team invited me to a meeting to get more information from her. 

Anyway, I've been a wreck over the last couple of days. I can't eat, I can't sleep, and my OCD has been worse than ever."
1305,Having Intense Restless Leg Syndrome,"The only medication that has really shut my brain off at night and feels like it knocks me (I have next level insomnia) is Remeron. But it gives me restless leg syndrome that is tormenting. I could easily doze off it wasnt for how bad my legs get about 2 hours after I take it. Ive tried everything walking up and down the stairs, hot baths, Magnesium, everything... and it helps minimally... I've tried trazadone and Lunesta but it does nothing for me sleep wise... I see my psych in 2 weeks 

Input would on your guys experiences would be 🙏"
1306,I am failing,"In August, I quit my antidepressants. I had been taking them for 5+ years. After a followup with my doctor in 2018, he said I was okay to go off the medication. I knew I was supposed to wean off, so in 2019, I gradually decreased my dosage till I was completely off them. I felt alive. For 5 years, I was in a daze. I was not actively working on improving any aspect of my life. I realized that and I was now ready to take charge. 

In November, I got dumped by a person (X) I had been seeing for about 8 months. It broke my confidence and made me question everything I was doing. I was so hung up on X that I continued to let them in my life even when it was clear to me that I was a second option by then. I broke all contacts last week, but I worry that I will go back crawling if they ever decide to check in on me again.

In January, I quit my decently paying job in the hope of getting into a field I wanted to try out. I got exactly 1 job offer, in a month of passively hunting. And I have not heard back from them when I shared my salary expectations with them. 

In February, I decided to quit smoking. I had grown sick of the habit and though it wasn't easy, I did well and was proud of it. Until today, when I had an altercation with my flatmate. I broke down and smoked 3 cigarettes. 

I have a test to take in the first week of April, following which I will be able to study for a master's degree in my area of interest. I don't think I will be able to clear it. The competition is tough (15 seats, 75 applicants) and I don't have a portfolio strong enough to land me a seat. I have a month to build it up and I am doing absolutely nothing for it, even though I sit jobless at home every day.

I need to look for another apartment to rent by March end, but I am not looking, and it is tough to find a place in the area I live in. 

Before quitting my job, I was hopeful, ready to fight and fix the drawbacks in me. My mantra was to give myself all the time that I needed, focus all my energies into trying out something new. I was ready to invest in skill building courses, all the tools I need. Instead I spend once a week on an elaborate day out, out of my limited funds. I am afraid to commit fully to the new field and want to keep my high-paying older job role as a backup for when I inevitably fail.

Over the course of my 1 month of unemployment, I got more and more focused on doing nothing. I don't shower every day, just on the days I have to step out. My health is declining - I lost about 25% of my body weight over 6 months by just not eating properly. It could also be a side effect of going off the antidepressants. I don't have a sleep schedule. I don't finish basic daily chores like folding my laundry, or even making my bed.

I don't have a lot of friends around me. I know a lot of people but no one is close enough for me to dump my insecurities on them. I can only talk superficially to my acquaintances and make light of the situation I am in.

I feel like crying for help, but I'm too passive to do even that. I am overwhelmed by the position I have put myself in. I know failure is the first step to success, and I know I am supposed to keep on working on it. But I don't think I have it in me. I don't have the drive that I see in others. I am not a self-starter, and I've always wanted to fix that about myself. I don't think I can. I am beginning to consider I deliberately sabotage everything I have going for me. I am starting to see why I needed the antidepressants to keep me functioning."
1307,I'm an empty shell and a mess,"I can't tell what I'm feeling anymore. It all feels so unreal and like I've split into different dimensions and I can't access the other parts of myself. I'm not myself, I'm barely a person anymore.
I'm only alive when I'm around others. I'm not good at being alone. I hope I die."
1308,Anybody Want to Be Text Buddies... To Vent and Talk about Life and Story... I'm Burning My Family Out lol,"I'm a 28 year old guy, medical student (on leave of abscence because I had a nervous breakdown). I'm feom Northern Kentucky/Cincinnat areai. My primary issues are severe generalized anxiety and insomnia. Depression and self esteem issues has kind of started becoming an issue this past year or so though.

I'd prefer developing a text friendship with a female within a 10 year gap between me. I have issues with opening up to other guys. But I'm not against talking to a guy if your close to my age. 

Have a good weekend my fellow comrades!"
1309,"My constant changes in mood are exhausting, I feel like there’s something wrong with me","I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me or how I’m supposed to get better. I feel like I struggle so much with supposedly simple everyday tasks, it’s like I’m just stuck in bed all day because everything I have to do I’m just sat thinking what’s the point? The only reasons I have to get up, wash, feed myself etc, is to survive and I don’t even want that. I feel as if the world around me is going on without me, I don’t feel sad right now, I feel quite numb. I wish I could just stop existing. I quit my part time job because the thought of it before every shift I would get extreme anxiety, for me it’s exhausting having to get ready, walk around in public, talk to people even if it’s just for 2 minutes. 
I keep putting things off all the time, which in the end makes me feel even worse. I’ve signed up for counselling even though I’ve been about 5 times now, it never helps in the long term and yes I do give it a proper chance. I want to see a psychiatrist, my sister has depressive bipolar disorder and I see some of it in myself. I just feel like depression shouldn’t be this hard, that there must be something else to it, as to why I’m struggling so much. I know online mental health tests aren’t exactly accurate, but I’ve taken a few for bipolar and autism, so many symptoms match up to mine and I just feel like I need closure on what’s going on in my head, because I don’t even know at this point."
1310,Why i'm hopeless.,Its hard for me. I get depressed cause I'm in a sexless marriage. Then I'm being told I am an asshole for complaining. This shit makes me want to die and feel hopeless. Its not even about screwing but don't we all seek or need intimacy?
1311,Severe depression/anxiety has taken major toll on me,"TW// Abuse, Overdose, Lack of hygiene  


Over the years things for me have gotten a /lot/ worse than they were previously, say &gt;2015. As a very very young child my mother left me with my father, who was barely an adult at the time as they had been a little dumb and decided that they'd do what they did at the age of 17-18. This affected me as a child somewhat but for a while, I did have a step-mother who I did love and care about. Around when I had turned 11-12, my step-mother started showing very abusive tendencies in which my father had also joined in on. Fyi, my father is a great person and I love him to death, but this woman at the time severely affected him.  


During my elementary school-middle school years, I had been a very talkative child and often got in trouble about it daily. I had to be graded via a score card that'd determine if I was good, okay or bad that day. I started growing a fear around it as my step-mom was clearly unpleased. I often got yelled at for this specific reason and vaguely remember how I felt back then. It wasn't good at all. I didn't have many signs of depression/anxiety as I was seemingly a very very social child and noone thought much of me being upset when I was home.  


I remember when I reached my freshman year, I felt like things were getting better and had a rather normal freshman experience. I was bullied around a bit and treated in a very mediocre fashion, but, I thought it was very very normal, it was common after all. Once I had became a sophomore, I could tell my step-mom and fathers relationship was falling apart. Near the end of freshman year and beginning of sophomore, I was losing motivation to even go to school. I couldn't pinpoint the reason at the time, and I still can't remember exactly why. I tried to fake being sick as much as possible or even harmed myself just to make sure I didn't go to school so constantly.  


Junior year was terrible. It was the largest turning point in my life besides when my mother left me. Around September I had decided I was done with everything. I felt so tired of everything and couldn't find a reason to continue. I had brought some prescription medicine a family member was taking, (I think painkillers, I can't remember) and had decided to bring it to school. I had a plan to take one or two each passing period before entering class, I took two in the morning before my first period. I continued to take it up until lunch time where I had taken it and sauntered off into the lunch room. I sat by my ""friend"" at the time, named Emily. Her friends didn't quite like me but I didn't care, it seemed like nobody did. I remember vaguely resting my head down and falling asleep, only to be awoken by noone sitting directly by me, assuming they went outside. After a while the principal and a member of security came by to check on me, asking if I had a headache. I didn't admit to it but they brought me along to the nurse nonetheless.  


They left quite soon after as the nurse, someone who I talked to very frequently and considered a mom figure, gave me an ice pack and let me relax in the office. I wanted to die still and I don't know what made me do this, but I told her what I was doing that day. I brought out the pill bottle and set it on her desk as she confiscated it. She asked me why I was doing it yet I don't even remember if I answered her or not. She called in the school counselor and called first response while the counselor talked to me. It was hard for me to talk to anyone at all, everything felt like a mess. A few men with equipment and obvious uniforms walked in, had me sit by a chair and started to take my blood pressure and ask me a few questions. They were going to take blood at the school but I begged them not to. I have a very very bad fear of needles and at the time I knew i was not putting up with it.  


After a while, my dad and my step-mother came into the nurses office. My dad was crying and my step-mom was staring off blankly. She didn't seem to care that much. They couldn't come talk to me quite yet but they were silently staring off at me. I felt a very bad sinking feeling in my stomach and felt a bit dizzy at the time, I was getting overwhelmed. After a little more assessment, the paramedics allowed me to go with my father to the hospital. I don't remember exactly what it was called. I can't remember much of what happened while waiting and it hurts a bit to think of my father crying. I of course had to get my stomach pumped, blood pressure checked every hour or so, blood drawn and ect. I was in that room almost all day and I felt insanely weak and tired.  


After that whole situation that happened that day, I had taken a week off of school by request of the principal themselves. The rest of that year was terrible as I couldn't be pulled out of it, I had to put up with it. I only started taking therapy in January once I convinced my dad I severely needed it. By this point, my step-mother at the time was not around anymore. She left because I was allegedly too much to handle. I had gotten abandonment issues, insane amounts of depression and anxiety all stacked into one on top of me and it was crushing me. I constantly begged my dad to put me into online schooling. I hated being in public school anymore and expressed it as much as possible. Finally later into my senior year, I made the transfer from ps to os. I was happy for the first few months.  


Skip forward to now, for the past few months I have had problems eating consistently. I am not able to eat as much as I used to and find myself forgetting that I didn't eat that day. My memory has been degrading for a long while also, I never was one to be able to remember my family member's birthday but it's just gotten worse. I'll lose track of time being in my room so often because I don't want to leave. I'll often forget conversations or important things people have told me. I feel like a terrible person because of it. My anxiety has gotten even worse as I'm not used to going outside anymore. I can't handle large crowds of people or anything of the sorts. This sounds a bit gross but, I rarely have been keeping my room clean, often hoarding dishes or trash in my room. I haven't been practicing any sort of hygiene for most of this month, I haven't showered in a little while, I believe I could have a UTI and I'm a bit worried but I can't find the courage to drag myself out of bed to go deal with it. Loneliness has been a major thing that has been killing me also. The feeling of wanting to be loved is so strong and severe yet I'm terrified that I'll be abandoned again if I even dare fall in love."
1312,I’m so tired of seeing armchair diagnoses on reddit,"(Sorry Im on my phone)
TLDR at bottom 

This is especially common on AITA but every where I look randoms are accusing each other of being narcissists or of having Borderline personality disorder, over a petty couple argument. It’s fucking wild. It’s like they refuse to believe that a neurotypical person could be shitty so the MUST have an undiagnosed mental issue and are obviously evil. 

And besides furthering stigma the ppl diagnosing others often can even name criteria for a diagnosis beyond what they’ve heard in some crime show, it makes me feel sick honestly. 

They don’t even know what they’re talking about but they feel so entitled and ‘educated’ that they talk down to and lecture anyone who points out that even if they where a psychiatrist or therapist you can’t diagnose someone off of a biased post on reddit that only shows one side of the situation. 

TLDR: idiots who pretend that they’re smart like to play psychoanalyst on Reddit and perpetuate negative stigma against serious mental health issues."
1313,Tw: Child Abuse,"The more I understand my struggle with sensory processing disorder, the more the way my mother abused me for how it affected my behavior bothers me. The woman literally tortured me into being afraid of bothering anyone. She used to even make me pick what she was going to beat me with sometimes. To this day, I'm very aware of whether or not I'm making sounds other people can here or if my stimming is noticeable to them. I'm terrified of being annoying. It's even part of why I can't stand to be touched. They tell me I have ptsd from the abuse I suffered at her hands. My siblings treated me like shit too, following her example. 
 
I remember my brother and his friend pinning me down to force a shirt on me they knew I couldn't stand. It was agony againsy skin. It was a button up, and they even put it on me backwards. My mother and everyone laughed while I screamed and thrashed. It was amusing to them that I was so sensitive. I remember several occasions when they antagonized me into losing control just to watch as my mother would beat the shit out of me for it, even knocking me out on occasion.

That's just a fraction of what they all did to me. It wasn't just my relatives, but also my mother's boyfriends. Lately, I've been having a lot more flashbacks of those times. It sucks. I spent half my therapy session yesterday trying to overcome a flashback and the resulting anxiety attack. All because I had sensory processing disorder."

I've received diagnosis last week and I'm looking for ways how to cope with Bipolar II.

I can barely beat depression, the only thing this is to get so damn angry at something. 

I'm on carbamazepinum atm. 100mg a day; this dosage will never help me out, so I need new ways."
1315,Need some help,"I suffer from anorexia. Things were going really bad and it was a dark time but eventually I started eating. I still haven’t fully recovered though as I still have the same thoughts and skip meals very often. This was just the eating disorder part but the psychological effects it had on me are a different story. I’m suicidal. I’m pretty much always thinking of suicide. I wish i didn’t exist. My mental health was not that bad before but day by day it’s getting worse. I don’t really have anyone to talk to except one friend. Because of my disorder I successfully pushed away all the friends I had and now no one talks to me. I try to talk to them but get really anxious and it doesn’t work out. I have one friend who’s supported me through all this and she’s really great and she’s the only one I talk to but the thing is she has her own life, problems and friends. I cannot bother her with my problems the whole time. I don’t want to talk to my parents. I was depressed before but not this severe. My parents thought as I would start eating, I would get better and they still believe the same. But in reality, it’s completely opposite. My mental healths only worsened. And now when I’m sad, my family behaves as if I’m faking it. Look I feel really bad typing this about them considering they’ve supported me a lot but it’s the way it is. After you try so hard to recover from something you’d think your family would be proud and support you but they’re still of the same mindset that I’m not eating. Things are getting bad and now I get anxious around my own family. I can’t think straight if I’m in a room with any of the members. I get really anxious. I prefer to be alone. I don’t want to talk about this to my parents as they’ll only send me to a therapist and I seriously don’t want to see one because of a past experience and the fact that I’m sure I won’t talk. I don’t know what to do. I wish I could talk about it but I’ve already pushed away all my friends and the one that I still have, she’s already helped me a lot and I don’t want to bother her anymore. I really don’t know what to do. I wish it would all end."
1316,"Do you physically feel a crazy hatred towards someone? I can't stand my mother and sister. Their sight, smell and even touch gives me a utter urge to smash shit","It hasn't been like this forever. I lived alone for six years in a tiny dorm and I always assumed I grew apart. So, it didn't bother me that on my trips home, arguments occurred unfailingly. I got a home on rent since then and every time they come over--alone or together, I simply lose shit. It's not that they act spiteful or do anything to hurt me, but I simply feel an overwhelming sense of digust and pent up anger towards both. I smash things, unable to scream and the aura is all of. As if their presence is killing me. My sister arrived today. After spending on an extravagant meal, I am curled under my blanket with a migraine. I don't understand why I despise and hate her to a point where I just want to punch her face into a fucking wall.
(Prelude: I live in India where family sticks on all along and there is no concept of separation even if you have spent a decade away from home. I buy my mother and sister nice things, clothes and spend time on phone, but it is their physical presence that angers me. I even screamed at my dad at the top of my lungs for sending my sister to my place for the weekend.)
My hate is feeling physical. I hate everything about this. Anyone else ever felt something this strongly about someone you are expected to like?"
1317,They Don’t Support Me..,"After years of procrastination, I was finally able to find it in me to come out to my parents about my mental health, which didn’t turn out the way I’d expect. I was publicly insulted, personally harassed and shamed for it, by my own parents.."
1318,Is this anxiety?,"To begin, I have no idea if this is to do with anxiety or not, it's actually why I'm posting this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been experiencing fainting and dizziness, however it has only been in some specific situations.

These have been times like:

I went for a blood test and just after it was done, I felt extremely dizzy and almost passed out.

I had some vaccines and, again, only felt ill about 2 minutes afterwards.

Today I went for a contact lens trial, to get them tested for my eyes and whatnot, and around a minute after they had been put in, I experienced the same dizziness as the situations before. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am wondering is, why do I only experience this after what has happened, and why only in these specific scenarios?

I was not really afraid of any of these ""procedures"", and I felt 'emotionally' fine after them, (as in I was not scared), and I feel like what happens to me is not really in my control, perhaps my body's reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, I don't suffer from any other medical issues like diabetes, etc that would cause this dizziness, and I am always fine day to day, never fainting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this some sort of anxiety that only gets released afterwards? Or adrenaline? 

Any answers much appreciated, as I have been looking for some clearance for a while.

1320,"I remembered I used to hide myself entirely in my raincoat, as a little girl at school. What did this behaviour mean ?","I just remember I was doing this quite a lot at school, at around 10 years old. During the breaks, I wasn't always playing with my friends: I sometimes had these episodes during which I wanted to DISAPPEAR. So I would go to the darkest corner of the courtyard, and roll myself into a ball, then adjusted my red raincoat so it would cover my ENTIRE self, the hood over my head , reaching below my feet, and both my hands deep into the other opposite sleeve.

That way I felt safe, away from reality. No responsabilities anymore, nothing, just me and my breath. I was lucky enough that none of the kids annoyed me during these phases.

I feel so worthless and I've failed everyone."
1323,I sometimes feel suicidal.,"I know I don't have it in me to go through with it. I tried a year ago and chickened out at the last second only to end up in a ward for a few days. I changed my work environment and relationship since then. I eased out of meds and weekly therapy because it made such a huge difference. I was in a toxic workplace. I thought everything is going to be rainbows and sunshine now.

I broke down in front of my students. I felt my depression and anxiety crawling back. I felt like I lost one of my classes because of worsening behavior, and I felt like I failed despite teaching at a much better school. The kids felt terrible, I had support from another teacher, and admin told me it happens. Kids be wild sometimes. Every teacher's ongoing struggle will be behavior management, and I've been proactive in seeing what veteran teachers do with their kids. I felt really good about having this growth mindset even on the bad days, but the past two weeks, I feel myself falling into a slump. 

At the end of the day, maybe I just suck as a teacher. I have all these ideas swimming in my head, but right now I just feel like shit. Friday was a disaster. I wanted to prove to myself that I would be a successful teacher at this school. Because on the good days, it feels really good. I'm going to be known as the teacher who cried in front of her kids. I don't mind being more closely observed (go ahead and tell me what I'm doing wrong).

My motivation is at an all-time low. My boyfriend is picking me up later today because he thinks I'm burning myself out. I've been enjoying working and actually wanted to take some work home. I just feel like lately, I'm messing up more, and I'm not being a reliable teacher right now. I should be thinking about strategies to re-establish classroom expectations and consequences, and easing back into the curriculum, but I feel like I'm going to cry again. I'm not capable of taking my mind off the kids. I want to do this job well.

I can't find any happiness anymore since I'm always worried that if I get one person mad, or do one thing wrong, they could do something bad to me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so sensitive to the point where I have panic attacks almost daily for no reason at all. I'm scared that I might end up going crazy because of this, I've even considered suicide more than once already. I know taking a break might do me some good but honestly I've got almost nothing to look forward to outside of this place, it's honestly scaring me. I've considered seeking a psychiatrist but that would just cost too much money and I honestly don't see myself worth the trouble or the money.

Hello! I recently applied to RN school and am waiting to hear back. Applications were due January 15th, and I have been patiently waiting to hear back. They have 60 days from the deadline to make a decision, so when I called yesterday to verify she said they would be sent out within two weeks. 

I cannot stop thinking about this and if I’ll get in or not. I know it’s only two weeks away but my anxiety has been so bad and I keep preparing for the worst. Any tips on how to be less anxious in terms of waiting? I know I’ll find out soon but it’s wrecking my mental health.

1327,"Disturbed sleep schedule, sleeping TOO much","Hi! Long time reader, first time posting. I am going to book an appointment with my doctor, but I figured it won't hurt seeing if anyone has experienced something similar.

I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a looong time, but I don't have any sort of diagnosis for either (which is strange because my doctor keeps prescribing me antidepressants, but whatever). So, with these issues I do know that your sleep might be affected, but it has NEVER been this bad before. 

Basically, since around Christmas when I stayed up too late studying for my last exams of the year, I have not had any kind of normal sleep schedule. At first, it was just the regular ""won't sleep at night but sleeps during the day"" kind of flipped sleep schedule, but this past month I've been switching between not sleeping at all, or sleeping WAY too much. 

For example, Thursday - Goes to class, takes a nap after lunch but wakes up at 8PM. Stays up all night, falls asleep around 8AM on Friday, plans on only sleeping until noon but turns off alarm in my sleep and wakes up at 4PM. This time, I stay up until about 9PM, goes bed and falls asleep again at around 11PM. Sleeps through the night, wakes up at like 6AM on Saturday (today) and then drifts off to sleep at around 10AM and wakes up again at 5PM. To be honest, right nor it's about 7:30PM and I could probably sleep more if I went back to bed.

I've been sleeping more than I've been awake. It's kind of scary. Has anyone experienced a sudden shift in sleep like this? Like I said, I've been struggling with sleeping normally for like 3 months now, but no matter what I try I can't flip it back to normal. Luckily I only have class twice a week so I usually keep up pretty well, but I'm still worried my sleep will ruin my studies.."

1331,I had an epiphany last night...,"I have a sense of humor, I can joke, and I am silly- but my jokes are not usually at the expense of others. I have \*tried\* good-natured ribbing and joking insults, that I never mean- but it doesn't come naturally to me. And trust me, anyone at the butt of these knows I am always joking and seem to enjoy my attempts at joking or insulting them... But it still makes me feel awkward or guilty... I can't make jokes like that without apologizing afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I even do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Because it's expected of me. Friends, co-workers, family- there are always people who like to tease me, and it doesn't rub me the wrong way most of the time- but if it does, I am expected to brush it off.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, my boyfriend and I visited my family in another state recently. It was his first time meeting them. It didn't take long for my grandmother to laud herself for her intellect, about how women have more common sense than men, but she couldn't speak for me, that I had always been an oddball. I was proud of myself for rebutting with, ""I was wondering when that would come up."" Growing up, I would have kept quiet and just taken the insults. But she made the same comments a few more times through the rest of our visit with them. I would rebuff them each time, as though they didn't bother me, but each remark on how odd I was stung more and more. As a side note- one thing I was looking forward to was telling them about my awesome new full-time job in the arts. I wanted them to be proud of me. When there was finally a moment where they didn't monopolize the conversation, I brought out a postcard and brochures from my workplace so I could visually explain what I do... And I didn't even receive feigned interest. I was relieved when we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't express my hurt feelings without being told I am too sensitive. It has always been that way. My way of coping has always taking the insults as best as I could, focused on improving myself and trying to be a good person, and work on my self-esteem and sensitivity.

&amp;#x200B;

But why? It still hurts me, and if I just take the insults without expressing my pain, the behavior will go on, uncorrected, the insults will continue, and it will inhibit my ability to grow as a person. I told my boyfriend last night- on a good day, an insensitive remark can irk me-- but still be brushed off. On a bad day, it will be a tipping point that will put me through a downward spiral of self-hatred... Which led me to my epiphany:

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of people that don't want to watch their phrasing, because if they don't mean to hurt your feelings, then it is your problem- not theirs, if they do. That is as irresponsible as offering a beer to an alcoholic that is trying to be sober. You could say that a beer has low alcohol content- or that the alcoholic could refuse the drink, but it doesn't take much to go over the edge when your will is already weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise with seemingly harmless words. I have suffered a lot worse than being called an oddball. Growing up, my stepfather emotionally abused me. He insulted me for my looks, for my interests, my intelligence- and even my worth. I was regularly called a bitch. I was regularly told that I would end up homeless. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when my grandmother made a thinly-veiled joke, a seemingly harmless remark, something as simple as calling me an ""oddball,"" the real translation is that she doesn't see me as someone with common sense. So much did she feel the need to point out this perceived flaw (and however else she thinks I am an oddball) that she did it several times more in conversation, which just further underlines her disapproval in me.

&amp;#x200B;

On a bad day, this could be what tips me over into a downward spiral. If I make a mistake at work- or if I have an argument with my boyfriend- being an ""oddball"" could mean that I lack common sense. Or maybe I'm too stupid to work where I do or be with the person I'm in a relationship with... Which means I don't deserve these things, and so I am essentially worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

I assure you, I have made great strides in knowing who I am, and loving myself, and working hard for my career in spite of the emotional roadblocks I had to pass to get there. I also know I have a lot more improvement though... But I would hope that anyone that loved me would want to see me improve and would do anything they could to at least not inhibit that growth.

&amp;#x200B;

If that means cutting out insensitive remarks or even watching one's phrasing, why wouldn't that be a consideration? It's so easy to so when someone's mental health is at stake.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think, for my own sake, next time I won't hide my hurt feelings when I am insulted. I don't think I will try rebuffing insults either- because that will only mask how I truly feel. The homework assignment I am giving myself, for the next time I am insulted, is to tell that person, plainly, how their remark hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

And if they seem offended and say that I am overly sensitive, I will just know that they would rather make a stupid joke than care about my well-being- and who needs that nonsense in their life?"
1332,How do you guys know if you guys are taking too much/too little of your medication?,"I’ve recently started Lamotrigine (Lamictal) for Bipolar II, and I’m curious as to how you guys knew you were at the right dose, or if you need to adjust it. I was taking Trintellix a couple of months ago, and that just kept me at a manic high the whole time, but I was so “high” that I didn’t want to adjust it. At least, until I ran out and couldn’t afford to refill it (my healthcare had cut off at that time, but it’s back now).

I'm not messy but I've noticed I don't really take care of my surroundings or personal hygiene unless I have somewhere to go. Science and art used to be my passions and just a few months ago I was excited about going to uni, now I simply can't see the point.

Nothing interests me. Everything I do is because I feel obligated to be at least somewhat productive every day but I'm starting to lose interest in that too. What's the point? 

I'm supposed to be applying for a job but I keep postponing it. My life is so empty and meaningless. I can't believe just a few months ago I was so into life and excited about my future prospects but now everything feels vain and like a bother. I can't even bring myself to book a therapy appointment because I genuinely don't believe this is anything I can fix. This is either me failing as a person or some cosmic joke set upon me in order to make me fail at life. 

I'm scared about what I'm setting myself up for because my finals start in just a few days and I still can't bring myself to study. A while ago I would've gone nuts, panicking about failing, but now I kind of can't even remember *why* I was scared or what about the idea of failing high school made me distressed. The feeling is kind of vague now, like a dull understanding that regardless of if I pass or not my future will be still spent in isolation and emptiness."

So, I've been in therapy for a few diagnoses for like 5/6 years now but I never made any progress. After getting therapy for a specific phobia, social anxiety with avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), the specific phobia again, and depression, I'm now on a waiting list at a specialist for AvPD.

&amp;#x200B;

I got an intake at a personality disorder specialist and they diagnosed me with AvPD. I'm now on the waiting list but it'll take a year before I can start therapy. This will be schema therapy in a group. Now, the issue is that I'm not sure I really have AvPD and it doesn't feel like it's my main issue. I am socially anxious but I don't feel like it's so bad that it could be diagnosed as AvPD.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I kind of began to realise I've been depressed and suicidal since I was a kid. My home situation wasn't the best and it never really got better. I decided to move out at 19 so I'm not in that situation constantly anymore. I also got my first ever boyfriend at 20 and he was my whole world. This guy meant everything to me and I could NOT lose him. The relationship was rocky. The problem was that I didn't mean anything to him so we broke up after 1,5 years. I fell in a deep dark hole and was suicidal for 1,5 years. Since the breakup I dated quite a few guys but I always attached very quick and I got so insecure about myself while dating them. They had a reason to not date me anymore or they just ghosted me. I basically realised there is something wrong with how I attach to people, especially when it's about a romantic relationship. I quickly attach to someone, I demand too much attention, I get enormously insecure about myself and about them liking me and that gets too much so they decide to stop talking to me. The last guy I was seeing called me out on this and I get it. Every time this situation happens I fall back into being depressed and being suicidal and it feels like I'm of no use to this world, that I'm not good enough. In the last therapy I had I realised that I get depressed and suicidal when a romantic relationship fails because I've always been 'lonely' in life, as in that everything I had to go through I had to it do on my own. And when I have a relationship, it means I'm finally not on my own anymore. So when that support suddenly falls away it makes me feel alone again.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the depression gets triggered by 'failing' in relationships and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I've made this clear with the psychologists I've seen and told them my main issue at this moment is me getting depressed because my relationship ended and I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. However, I don't think they understand how much it affects me. I've been looking into what this could be. Although I don't want to self-diagnose, I do want to have an idea about what I could present to my GP so I can get a better diagnosis and a better referral. I've been thinking about dependent personality disorder, co-dependency, or something with having an anxious attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious about opinions on this matter. What could I be dealing with? Should I wait a year to get treatment for AvPD or should I seek for another diagnosis? I'm at a loss to be honest."
1335,Not sure what I’ll do next,"I can’t stand it when my internet friends hang out without me. My friend group is a group of 4, me, G,P,and A. (Letters for their names). G P and A started playing Pokémon together. I was never interested/had the money to play the game so they just played it without me, for days. Days went without being able to talk to any of them because of the game- now I can’t even look at/hear about pokemon without wanting to die. Same thing has happened with other games. They play them without me and now I can’t even think about the games or the experience without wanting to kill myself. Last night I was on a call with P and G and left to go to the store, saying I’d be back later. When I came back they were playing one of the games. I didn’t tell tell anything, but I had a full on breakdown. Like, shaking and stuff. Everytime this happens my mind is clouded with suicidal thoughts. This June P and G are going to meet up irl. I was going to, but possibly won’t be able because of COVID-19. If they do I don’t know how I’ll handle myself. I might actually do it. If seeing them on a call together hurts me this bad, I don’t know what I’ll do if they meet up irl. I actively try to avoid anything regarding the games they’ve played, but they always talk about it in calls and it’s struggle."
1336,"I’m absolutely tired of Social Anxiety ruining my life, how do I get over it?","My life has never been perfect and I never expected it be to do so. Ever since transitioning into high school, I started to feel way different and finding things as simple as meeting new people to be one of the worst experiences. From freshman year to senior year, i found myself isolating from others and expecting people to come towards me instead of the other way around. I’ve developed multiple toxic ways to try to avoid thinking like this, but i’m in college now and it’s relevant all these years later. My social life has always been small and i’m not concerned about that. I find it extremely difficult to talk to people and it’s even worse when it comes to building relationships and bonds. So many lost opportunities and i’m sick and tired of anxiety ruining my life and I just want to be how I was back when I was younger because no fucks where given. How do get this out of my life? I’m open to pretty much anything. Thanks for reading my post! It really means a lot knowing somebody read it till the end."
1337,"Here is a story about my schizophrenia, and drug use.","This story takes place back when I was in high school. Alright. So back before I started taking my antipsychotic medication, I would have very bad delusions. I thought the government was following me. I thought that I was a robot being controlled my aliens, and my brain was inside of a vat of liquid. I believed that I wasn't real and that my entire life was just some story that someone planted inside of my brain. Anyway, I smoked a bunch of weed, which is very very bad for people with schizophrenia. THC makes your symptoms WAY worse. I smoked in my room, while my parents and brother was home. Then it hit me hard as fuck. I started having a panic attack and vomited all over the floor. It was a fucking HUGE pile of vomit. I thought I was a robot. I wanted to cut open my skin with a knife to prove myself that I will find only wires and metal, not organs. I wanted to open my stomach and see if I even have organs. I wanted to get to the bottom of those feelings that i had. Eventually i called 911 because I was just freaking the fuck out and I thought I was going to die of a heart attack. The fire station, ambulance, and cops showed up at my house at about 10pm. I stepped outside and my family followed me. I was surrounded by cops. The medic told me to get into the ambulance and I walked over there and was taken to elmhurst hospital. They had me hooked up to an EKG. i was reading it while laying down. My resting heart rate was 150 beats per minute. I layed in the hospital until maybe 12 or 1am. They ran drug tests on me, it was just normal weed. It wasnt laced with some other drug. I thought it was laced with PCP because of how fucked up I was. My dad was in the hospital the entire time watching me trip fucking balls. Eventually he just took me home and gave me a speech.And THAT is why I never smoke weed that has THC in it. Moral of the story???? If you have psychotic symptoms. Dont fucking do drugs!! Imagine if I took acid or shrooms. I would have fucking killed myself because of how bad the trip would be.My mom remembers it. And she keeps bringing it up, she reminds me of the time I did drugs in the house. And I hate how she keeps talking about it. I want that memory to pass. She angers me whenever she talks about it."
1338,"""One is the loneliest number""","I've always said things like ""I want to die"" or ""I'm gonna kill myself"".  Most of the times that I've said it, I didn't mean it, it was a joke. Depending on a person, they all reacted differently; I've went through a phase of saying shit like that to my parents and let me tell you, they did not like me saying it. They said that life is beautiful and that I live fairly comfortably, I'm not disabled or starving, my family loves me and I should be thankful for that to God. My friends on the other hand, the meme gen z, usually replied with ""lol"", ""xddd"", ""same"" or they would just laugh with me, because mostly, it wasn't anything serious. Now I see that because I said it so often, I got used to feeling like wanting to die and not really doing anything about it. Whenever I had suicidal thoughts I just kind of felt accustomed to it. They weren't foreign to me anymore. I suppose it's because there were times where I've said it and meant it. 

I'm not good with sharing stuff like that but I do overshare a lot. Like right now, for instance, literally publishing my entire life story. But even as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm still leaving out some parts of what I want to say. I'm not a direct person; I hate confrontations. And every time I've experience a desire to share my emotions with someone, I've chosen to keep quiet. I'm guessing that me repeating ""I want to die"" is a way of me hinting that something it off. In case where a confrontation about my emotions does take place I can't express anything. I don't know where to start. And when I start trying to put my thoughts together, I don't feel like I'm making myself understandable enough. This has caused me to retreat into myself. There was a time where I talked about how I feel with my brother and his wife (I have a great relationship with my siblings and their significant others). I know it wasn't their intention, but they made it seem like it wasn't that bad, anything out of ordinary. Again, me being unable to express my thoughts and emotions kind of made it hard for them to help me or make them understand, still, it made me feel like shit.

Many factors must've contributed to my current state; my dad was a mentally abusive alcoholic, I was brought up in a very Catholic household and I turned atheist (me and my siblings have this game, where we count as many religious symbols in a room as we can and whoever spots more wins; one room had 23 religious tokens), my parents are homophobic and I'm bi, I live in a small village and in a conservative community. Basically, my life isn't perfect, but at least I'm not starving. 

About that ""mentally abusive father"" part, he's still in my life. When all of that was happening I was very young and he stopped when I was 6. He went to rehab and hasn't drunk since. I've erased most of it from my memory, but now and then bits and pieces come back. We all forgave him and he's been trying to make it up to us. 

Some parts have stayed with me and continue to affect my life. I feel like I'm unable to love/be loved back. I'm not sure if that's because of the abuse but I think there is a link. Every time I develop a crush on someone I (again) keep it to myself. There was this one and only time, that I had told a boy that I liked him. I was 13 around that time. We became a couple. From the moment I let him know about my feelings, I had regretted it. There were nice times, but for the most part it was just me, being embarrassed about displaying affection. You may think that it's normal for kids to be embarrassed about feelings, but I don't think I've ever exited that phase. A year ago my friend asked me if I was dating this girl I was texting with. I did love her, but we weren't dating and as soon as I was asked that question, I panicked. I started stuttering how I wasn't into her or whatever. I remember how my mind went blank at the thought of us being together. It wasn't nice. Later that year I decided that I had to let her go, because not only she didn't love me back, but I couldn't bring myself to love her the way she deserved to be loved. I was okay with her only being my friend, as long as she's happy. We still talk sometimes and she told me that she has a boyfriend now. 

I don't know if I can blame it on the fact that my friends and I are becoming adults, but I've been feeling very lonely. Not the ""horny-lonely"" (but to be fair, that too) but the ""wants-to-deserve-to-be-loved-lonely"". I know I wrote an entire paragraph how I'm unable to do so but hear me out; people that are close to me are now entering a phase where they're interested in getting a s/o or they have already got one. They're entering relationships that aren't based on crushed anymore, they actually know and love the people they are with. You're probably thinking ""well isn't it the whole point of a relationship? to love someone?"" and you are right. But the thing is, I never had that. I see my friends be with people that find them interesting and want to pursue a relationship with them. And here I am, literally zero people have that kind of interest in me. And I wouldn't feel as bad about it, if I wasn't reminded all the time of how I can't have this. It's probably so fucking sad and cringy for you to read that but I really, really want someone to love me. I don't know if it's bc of the lack of love I received as a child, but I really care about that. I know that I can't love someone unless I love myself but I can't shake the feeling that no matter what I do, I'm not going to be loved. That I'm never going to be enough. 

If I already went so far in exposing my darkest secrets and you survived reading my overemotional rant, I think you deserve full transparency. 

There were a couple of times where I actually considered killing myself. I didn't go as far as actually doing it, but there were times I was about to attempt it. I always wanted a quick and painless departure, but I suppose you never have that luxury when you attempt suicide. I has to be painful, even for a moment. And I didn't want that. I believed that I endured enough pain in life so I didn't want to feel any of it when I was leaving. But there I was, trading a second of pain for a lifetime of suffering. Don't get me wrong, I never wanted to die but I wanted to leave and dying was the only option for it all to stop. I used to think about it a lot, begged God to take me away, that was during my time as a person of faith. Now I think about it a lot less but more seriously. I don't think of myself as strong enough to do it, but in a moment of impulse I don't trust myself. Still, the most likely thing to happen is me just living with so much anger and sadness to the rest of my days that I will regret not killing myself when I had the guts to do so. Or maybe I'll get out of it. 

Most people don't know that part of me because I pride myself in being the jokester of my group of friends, I'm said to be a good person; always helping those in need. And I know for a fact that I have a soft heart and I'm sensitive to other's suffering. I'm good at hiding how I feel because I can't communicate it. Most of the times when I feel like this I just power through, because what else am I supposed to do? My days are filled with me doing normal stuff, a panic episode/crying session and then back to going on with my day. I continue doing my thing and bad thoughts are just passing through. But when I am alone and I have nothing to get done, I just let all of this to consume me for a while. I cry, punch walls, vent online and when I have nothing more to cry over, I'm myself again. It has worked just fine, but I know I can't do that forever. I really want things to change. 

The title of this is taken from a song ""One"" by Three Dog Night. I just thought of it. I like it, y'all should give it a listen."
1339,Didn't get the job.,"I was so ready for this period of my life to be over. I can't keep job searching, its been 5 months. I'm broke, bored and mentally drained. My depression keeps getting worse, I'm pushing away all the people that love me. I feel so godamn USELESS. Such a fucking stupid loser. I've been rejected from internships, full-time jobs, even fucking ENERGY EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. People tell me the rejection will get easier to handle and toughen me up, but it's just breaking me down. 

This job was perfect for me. It came down to me and 2 others. I was on the second interview. I already fucking WORK for this company in a different role!!!! That was supposed to be my in! My leg up on everyone else. How did I not get it?!!?!? There's always someone better. I can't keep this up."
1340,"Well it's been 4 months since I had a drink (haven't touched hard drugs in a year) but what can you do when other people don't respect your ""bubble"" when you have clearly stated the ""line"" and it bothering my mental health...","💉🧸

1341,I can't find PURPOSE! I need responsibility but can't hold down a job due to regular surgeries!,"I was in a fire a little over a year ago, and thought my 20 skin graft/serious surgeries are behind me, I still have Lazer scar removal surgeries planned almost every month to every other month for a year at least to help the damage. I'm forced to live with my dad and can't drive very far because of my leg pain, plus there's nothing to do in Rural Indiana anyways!

I need structure in my life and I need the extra money, Social Security only does so little. My PTSD and anxiety as well as NO self esteem, depression and guilt flood my mind each day and I need to have some responsibility to help keep those thoughts out.

What can I do? I go for walk a few times a day but can't go far &amp; have to sit back down for twice as long, I don't really have any hobbies or productive things that interest me....maybe a call center job since I don't need to walk? But with surgery that makes even that impossible. What should I do please any advice would be great!"
1342,I have neglected my health due to depression and now I'm too embarrassed to seek help,"I have suffered from depression for about ten years now, starting in my early teens. During my worst periods the only thing I could find the motivation to do was get out of bed, and even then that was on good days or if I was being constantly hassled. Well now I'm trying to fight back and get something of my life back, but unfortunately my decade of rarely bothering to look after my teeth has come back to bite me, no pun intended. One of them is just screwed, like bits chipped right off about a year ago and I just have a big whole in it, I'm assuming that I have a lot of cavities since I love fizzy drinks, they are so crooked that I could be in an add for braces, and to top it off my wisdom teeth are coming in and I hate them. I know I  need to see a dentist, but I can't stand the thought of being shamed for letting it get like this. I just hate this so much."

1345,Feeling lonley and down,"I was born and raised in the mid-size city of arround 80.000 people.

Bullied by a guy in the neighborhood, but I had some friends.
I had a little hard time growing up. Doing drugs, mostly mariuhanna and some MDMA. Hanging with the wrong friends.

I got into a mental breakdown at 15, I am 33 now.
I was was a little bullied in high school and dropped out.
Then trough additional training I managed to get a BBA in accounting. 

I never had a grilfriend, but some online dating.

The few friends I have I lost contact with and I am mostly alone and no girlfriend.

I work 10 min away from home and I like the job and the people.

But when I am out of work I am alone.

I have no car and I am lazy to go out. Or I have nothing to go to. I watch a lot of movies on netflix.

I play football(soccer) but training only because I am not good enough to play on a team.

I am getting mental help and being tested for autism.

Any things I could do to feel better at this moment?"
1346,okay so i have a serious problem and i honestly need help and would greatly appreciate some advise,i'm a teenager and i try my best and i feel i'm very respectful and do pretty much everything i'm asked to yeah i get in trouble and yeah i deserve it but idk but when i get angry i just explode and then like 5 10 minutes later i regret everything i do and said and i don't want to be like this i want to be able to do something to get better and i just don't know what to do are say. what should i do. my current therapist thinks it's anxiety and because if that my anger comes out and wants to put me on medication should i i want honest opinions
1347,Parents need to realise some shits,"My father has been implying lately that im a stupid person. I have really low common sense and stuff. But can you just not make fun of me in front of my siblings about that? Can you just not imply my sister is smarter than me? Can you stop comparing us? 

Im not jealous of my sister let me clear that out. But comparison between siblings is a horrible horrible thing. I DONT want to compete with my sister. C'mon she is my little sister there should be no comparison between us. 

All my life I've tried my heart and soul to prove myself to my dad which either turns bad or turns good but he isn't pleased with it. I just want to hear ""im proud of u"" from my father ONCE in my life. He never appreciates even if i do something good or smart. Hes always bragging about  my siblings but NEVER me. Meanwhile they dont give shit about him as much as i do. I want to follow my father's footsteps and be like him one day but he probably think im not capable of it. 

This is for all those parents out there who have multiple children PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THEM.

 when you come in at night to check if we're on our phones, sometimes just check if we're okay or not. Cause your appreciation and concern means a lot to your children. Dont misuse or neglect the wisdom you have."
1348,2020 sucks and I need to vent,"I learned one of my best friends has apposing and potentially harmful medical views for her future children

My work commute went from 20 minutes to an hour for less pay

My doctor told me my scoliosis has gotten worse 

I learned my SO has wracked up 15k in debts and didn't tell me

I've almost been run over 3 times while in the crosswalk

I had my groceries stolen

barely avoided 2 major accidents while driving caused by someone swerving out of their lane

Yesterday, my car got parts worth 5K dollars stolen that I'm not sure will be covered by my insurance

And this morning I was told my oldest family cat broke his back, is paralyzed, and will most likely need to be put down. 


All this, in a month. I don't know how much more I can handle. I can't get in my car without feeling scared of other drivers. A car swerved ever so slightly towards my boyfriend and I the other day and I couldn't hold back my tears. I cried in front of my mechanic this morning. I've been thinking of talking to a professional but I'm nervous because of poor experiences in the past with psychologists

Thanks for reading, I just needed to give my problems a voice so they stop taking up space in my mind."
1349,Clashes in my personality (vent),"So it's super frustrating, but I'm a doormat. Like. Especially in situations where I need to stand up for myself. I just stay relatively quiet. 

I got myself into this situation with my current boyfriend's like. Grade school crush. And what I mean by that is he didn't like her but she was obsessed with him. Apparently 20+ years doesn't mean anything, because she's still kind of obsessed. 

We're literally about to have our first baby. And this girl has stayed a ""family friend"". She's acted uncomfortably attached to me since we've initially met. 

Last night it came to a head when we were all attending my boyfriend's grandmother's funeral service. She cornered me and asked for my number and I felt so put on the spot I gave it to her. She also proceeded to add me on Facebook and message me at 5 in the morning. Then whilst I've been at work she called me. 

I feel like I put myself in a Fatal Attraction position just because I couldn't just be assertive and tell her no. And the worst part is I really am a independent person and my boyfriend has to tell her to leave us alone because I can't buck up and do it. ;_; 

Does anyone have similar issues with setting boundaries and being assertive? I could use some help."
1350,Got triggered and can't talk myself out of it,"As a psychology student you'd think I was better than this but apparently not. Oh, trigger warning for self harm.

I've been clean for nearly 3 years (minus a few days). I used to cut almost daily, never deep. I made sure it would heal and it mostly did. I have some scars on my legs and my ankles, a few on my arms but you'd have to know where to look because they are just tiny white stripes.
I am generally happy. I don't understand? I watched a movie on Anorexia (to the bone) and it somehow triggered me because I had eating problems around the time I used to cut.

I can't stop thinking about it. My boyfriend has a nightshift and won't be back until 7am (currently 9pm). I never talk about this with him. I mentioned it once but I don't really like talking about it. He knows I get triggered from movies in which people are cut. 

I am really triggered. I don't know what to ask for really,  but someone help. I'm scared if I start again, I won't be able to stop."

1352,something is different with how I’ve been behaving/thinking,"I’ve never posted here before but I’ve been getting really weird things I’ve been doing and. I don’t know why I’m doing it

So a couple of weeks ago I was waiting at my boyfriends house and thought I saw something - I’m a big believer in ghosts and stuff so chalked it down to a spirit or something - then I heard someone call my name. Got freaked out, also chalked it down to ghosts.

I checked with friends and none of them (sans one) have ever felt anything in his house, so I was a little paranoid but I thought whatever.

I was working at my job and I thought my manager was behind me on the phone. I’m 80% sure he was actually there, but I turned around a minute later and he was gone. It’s possible he just walked past and I didn’t notice. Freaked me out though, I spent the rest of the shift worried that something was wrong with me.

I go to school and I check my locker. Some year 12s are putting shit in my locker. Danny Devito memes for gods sake. So I go ‘what the fuck’, to which a girl next to me says ‘oh the year 12s are doing it, they’re everywhere - just know you’re being watched’ and of course I went ‘what’ and she went ‘nothing’. Scared the shit out of me and I couldn’t focus for ages. 

I’ve told people about this and they think it’s funny, and they don’t understand how scared I am about this. Another meme appears in my locker. Freaks me out again. I leave it alone.

Yesterday, I went round to my boyfriends. Completely sober. We were lying in bed after I accidentally broke his glasses (which in itself sent me into a depressive episode,,, whole other topic). I suddenly started getting really confused. I’d say something and then half a second later I’d say ‘wait did I just say XYZ’ or ‘why did I say that’ or ‘i don’t remember what just happened’. When reminded I remember but just thinking back I can’t always.

It lasted for what seemed like 20 minutes and it was really freaking me out. My boyfriend just kept assuring me that I was just tired. I have been exhausting. The thing is, I remember that it’s happen before. I don’t remember when or where but I remember that feeling.

For context, I have depression/anxiety/ocd(triple threat lol) and have had for years. I have tried substances and have been drunk etc. I’m thinking that’s probably related - never got these symptoms before trying substances. 

I’m sorry that this is so long I’m just really freaking out and no one believes me. I’ve spoken to my therapist about the locker and ghost thing and I mean to talk to her about the confusion thing at my next appointment. 

Just really looking for advice and support between now and my next sessions. Any help’s appreciated."
1353,Help: depression relapse,"Apologies if this is not the right subreddit. I would've posted in r/depression, but it didn't seem like the right place to seek help.

Also, I am not seeking for professional help here. I am going to see my doctor next week and my therapist the week after. 

However, that feels like an eternity away, so what I am seeking is help with pulling myself together until then. My depression is back. I've spent the last few days crying for hours, staring at the ceiling and laying in bed, thinking about how shitty everything is. I've mustered up the strength to write this post, of which I am proud of, but I need a plan to keep me going. To stop the negative thoughts racing and the tension/anxiety I feel. I've called my parents and told them how it is, and my dad is coming for a visit tomorrow. But that's 2 hours of distraction. I need ideas for the rest of the day. I've tried to force myself to do stuff I normally enjoy, but I just can't. I watched netflix but just stared through the screen. I'd love to go for a run, but I tried earlier and because I started crying after 200m I went back home, because I don't want people to see.

So.. what do I do, guys? Meditation? Cold shower? Heck, a certain tea brand that I don't know yet which calms the mind? Any ideas are welcome."
1354,I don't know what happened to me...what should I do?,"I am ugly, very ugly... I did know that all along, from the start.... But have never been bothered by it... It never really mattered to me ever... I used to focus on my work instead of my looks and it all worked... But a day before yesterday or day before that... I was just bored and uploaded my picture on r/amiugly... I was feeling low and hoped that maybe they would cheer me up saying that looks don't really Matter and you can work on other things...and say you are not really that bad... But I got a rating of 2/10 which I was not ready for...ik it's the truth... idk what I was expecting or why I was expecting it... maybe I was expecting that they would say I am average and would move on... because that's what I do on every other post there... I didn't know that they would bash me hard with 2/10... I have never had low self-esteem or anything like that... I have been a very, very confident person... Being a confident person who is proud of his intelligence... I also wrote I am 'exceptionally intelligent' but the people there didn't like that and bashed me even harder saying that you are arrogant and that's why people don't like you... Some even went forward saying... 'It's your personality that makes people agressive towards you'... Which isn't true... nobody is agressive towards me...But it made me think about whenever I have been confident.. maybe I shouldn't have... Because I don't look good  and maybe people would have judged me and would have thought that I am arrogant as well...

I am also not able to talk to my friends now... It's very weird... I feel very weird... Exasperated from that I went to my barber and got everything done they recommend me to do... But no, I feel more uglier now... I didn't had a haircut from last 3 months... Because I was working on some papers... But I felt very good... I didn't want to have my haircut and wanted to grow'em even longer... But now I got them trimmed and and will now have to wait another 3 months to get that back... I don't know what to do...I feel more uglier than I have ever had before... I can't even go out of my house and feel like everyones noticing me...I have never had any self esteem issues... But have had clinical depression last year... I also have moderate social anxiety disorder but major selective mutism... I feel like my mental health is going down again after so much of improvement...I slept after coming from my barber crying and woke up to a dream that I am all alone because nobody likes me anymore and I lost all my friends due to my looks... And now here I am writing this post... What should I do now? I seriously never have been influenced by anyones comments ever in my life... But this time I don't know what happened to me... Thank you for reading this long"
1355,Do you guys have overactive internal dialogues?,
1356,🎶🎶I'm in this place You'll all never know I've been erased From outside🎶🎶,I guess this is just the constant feeling and the smile is the short one?
1357,I wish I was enough.,"I suck at life :) I’m not smart, I’m not pretty, and I’m not talented. I’m not good at anything.

If I were to ask someone about what they think I’m good at, they would just say “Being a friend.” or “Being kind.” I haven’t heard anything else from my friends. Or family. All of my friends have some sorts of talents; singing, drawing, piano, guitar, being book-smart, etc. I don’t have anything.

1358,My philophobia hasn't disappeared.,"It's been a short while since I last posted my issue here, but it did seem like ages to me. Now, it's weaker, but more constant. Life itself frightens me, and I can't stop feeling strange. Any advice on how to solve it?"
1359,In need of advice - the first time posting,"Hello everyone. I've come to this subreddit in hopes that someone could help me find resources that could help me with my problem. To give you a bit of background information I'm the eldest son in my family, I live in Orange County, CA, and I need help finding a way to help my dad. For several years now, my dad has had problems with mental health. He's had several break downs over the years, but the worst has been this year. To give you more information about the break downs, they vary in intensity and frequency. The most minimal break downs are when my dad will leave the house and just walk around for hours. He won't tell anyone where he's going or when he comes back where he went. Other times, they are often more intense. For example, this past break down, he told my mom he had seen someone break the windows of his car (not true by the way). He also cried for an extended period, and then when he stopped he talk cursed at my mom. During the breakdowns, he'll usually talk about leaving my mom and us to be by himself. He will also talk about how people are following and he thinks someone is trying to hurt him. It's difficult to distinguish when he's having a break down and when he's drunk because sometimes both will happen at the same time. He refuses to seek a professional and get help but I'm really worried for him hurting himself or others. I'm not sure what my options are when it comes to helping him or there where I should start to look? Any point in the right direction will be appreciated. Thank you."
1360,Help me please,"So this kid I know (about 16, I'm 15) told me about this app, and he said I should try it for help with my problems. So.. Story so far.. I have been depressed alot for the past 3 years, self harm and all that, but I've had the sudden urge to harm others, and when I do, it feels like.. Like a rollercoaster ride, I used to use mdma to ease the pain, but now harming others feels the right thing to do, they all deserve it don't they, making fun of me, telling me to blow my brains out, I feel like I should blow theirs out.. Just a thought but I always act first then think, so many people I'd love to hurt, my brother, the school pupils... Its all feels so surreal, I really want to harm people, it just feels... Right? I don't know, I'll keep you updated on what I plan to do."

1362,"Need help establishing baseline self care, habits, and routines but struggling. Advice please","I don’t really know if this is the right place to post this but I thought it would be worth a shot. For context I have been formally diagnosed with and am medicated for ADD (not ADHD), generalised anxiety, and depression. I also see a counsellor monthly. I’m a 31 year old female.

I’ve been struggling my whole life to establish proper routines and habit to support myself in life, things like keeping my house clean, bathing, brushing my hair and wearing makeup, washing and folding laundry, getting enough sleep, etc. I’m able to just barely get by keeping it together but it seems like every once in a while after I’ve been maintaining these things better I slip right back to my bad habits again. I think this has a lot to do with my mental health and family background, but I’m not sure how to fix it.

Right now my house is a disaster with dirty dishes and vegetable scraps everywhere, I haven’t bathed in a couple days, my clean laundry is in a basket in the hall, my dirty laundry is on the floor, all surfaces are covered with junk, I have a pile of clean pillowcases and pillows I haven’t put together in about 3 weeks, my car is full of cans or paper, I’m only getting about 6 hours of sleep a night, there is garbage bags building up out back because I can’t even be bothered to walk it to the trashcan, etc. I feel very overwhelmed and disappointed in myself for this. I was doing well keeping up with this basic stuff for a few months but now am slipping back to where I was before.

My counsellor has recommended planning out my days by the hour, so I bought an hourly agenda but can’t seem to commit to it. I only ever seem to clean up and do what I ought to when there’s pressure, like someone is visiting my home or it gets so bad I can’t handle it anymore and do a large burst of cleaning all at once. It’s just me and my dog in the home. (My dog is well cared for and loved, though I realize it’s probably not good for him to live in a mess either. I always ensure nothing within his reach is harmful).

Has anyone gone through this? Does anyone have advice for conquering this? I want to get to a place where these things aren’t constantly issues I have to fight through and force myself to do, where I just do them out of habit and to keep myself happy and healthy. How does one establish a baseline routine? I seem to need so much time to recharge when I’m not out (maybe once a week) or at work that it overruns all the basic care.

Thank you in advance for the help!

TL;DR: I’m struggling to keep up with basic home maintenance and self care. Looking for advice to overcome this and establish healthy habits and routines so that I can do these things without thinking and don’t know where to start."
1363,I obsessively beat myself up over anything I do wrong and I can’t stop,"So for the past 10 years or so I’ve had really bad depression where I’ve acted out very manic got myself into debt didn’t care about anything just wanted to either die or be reckless. 

I’ve never had any structure in my life until 3 years ago. I got a job I love, Met someone, got out of debt and am functioning normally. 

Now, instead of my depression I obsessively put myself down whenever I do ANYTHING wrong. For example, if I speak to someone in a rude tone (even if was an accident) my inner voice for the next week will be like ‘you’re a piece of shit, you deserve to die’ etc etc or if something goes wrong I’ll be in a downer of a mood for weeks. I’m constantly scared that my life will go to shit again and have this overwhelming need to be perfect 

Why am I like this????"
1364,It’s been 2 months to the day since I was admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation.,"I went from hardly being able to function to actually caring about life. I’m about to start a new job, I’m more active at home, and I’m finally at a point where I feel peace of mind. It’s been a whirlwind since being diagnosed bipolar depressive, but with the right help and support, I’ve learned things will get better. To anyone out there that feels like they’re suffocating and don’t know what to do, know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Please find the right help so that life is worth living again."
1365,Does it ever get better,"I had an existential crisis a few months ago, and now everything in life has become super weird and depressing. I get this heavy feeling in my chest and just get super depressed when i think about the future because i know that I'm gonna just not exist one day. It feels like days are fusing into one another and nothing seems to truly make me happy. But does it ever get better or do you just have to live with this your whole life?"
1366,i don't know who to talk to or what to do with my life,"it seems to be stuck in limbo. I was real bad last wednesday and got dragged to speak to a support teacher. I've been told to get a doctors appointment sorted but i really don't know what to do because I struggle so much with talking to people. Theyve called me once to say that they're going to get back to me about getting an appointment BUT i missed the call later due to being at home and not wanting to pick up in front of family. 

ill try and call back monday but I don't really see the point because what if they just shove therapy in my face again like I've had 6+ years of my life for it to never work. ive tried it recently and it didnt work again. and since it was not CAHMS it isn't recorded medically

i hate talking to people about my problems. it makes me cry and feel sick inside. 

i dont even know what's wrong with me. teachers think its anxiety, I think its something else due to me not having very many panic/anxiety attacks other than for presentations. could also be depression but I've not self harmed in 2 years ish and i havent had a suicide attempt. i don't know what's wrong with my head. 

i have got a support teacher at school but i cant speak to her because she has loads of other students to deal with. she called my mum up a few days ago. my mum keeps telling me to talk to her but i really don't want to."
1367,What are your reasons for living?,I don't have any
1368,My anxiety is ruining everything,
1369,Scared,"Alright so let me start at the beginning:

Growing up I was raised by two bipolar guardians, my mom and grandma. Throughout the years I had to deal with the emotional backlashes from them up until my early teen years.

It wasn’t until around 2013 I noticed my mental health started to deteriorate. I am fairly certain I have some form of psychotic disorder, but I am afraid to get help.

I currently take Sertraline to help lessen anxiety and depression. I mostly don’t want to be an inpatient, seeing as how I don’t function well being locked up or isolated.

I’m really scared shitless.

tl:dr I’m scared to get mental help due to being locked up in a psychiatric ward."
1370,What are mental health hospitals in the UK like for a 17 year old?,"Hi, so there’s a chance that I may be sectioned and put into a mental health hospital for depression and anxiety. However, I’m terrified as to what this actually entails. I’ve visited family in hospital before and have been told the basics of how it works by said family. But as a 17 year old I’m petrified as to whether it’s actually ‘worth it’ I guess if that’s how you’d phrase it. I’m really struggling and people, including myself, scared for my safety hence the hospital. 

So just wondered if anyone could express their experience, let me know what is and isn’t allowed in hospitals (such as personal items - eg. teddy, phones to contact family, books), and or how the system works inside??
Many thanks"
1371,i'm bad person :),"I trying to fix myself, for example stop lie, so i trying first time to tell story about my real life and not lie (at least anonimus).

I from east europe. My family not rich, but i always had home, food and i think even love. I will tell things i thing inportant for me.

My father then i was kid punish me around 0-3 times per week. I think i was good kid who was very active and who make a lot stupy mistakes. Thats why then i was kid i lied always a lot. First time then i felt lie is good was in 2 school year. Somethink happen and i with teacher go out of class. Don't remember if she cry before or after, but i told how it's hard for me, becouse ""father lost finger"" (it was lie). My feeling mixed about this event. I have problems with bullying me, but it wasn't hard for me. I had friends, my best friend and i was good student (avarge my result was \~8,6 till 9 school year)

Secound big lie witch i remember was with my best friends friend, i liked her so i told a lot fake story about myself and everyone. I think i remember this becouse it didn't worked. it was in 9-10 class

My life started fuck up in 8 school years. My parents started divorce in hard way: 2 years process, 18 police calls, runing from our home to live in ""help centre"" and so on. We started have money problems, but everythink worked in good way. I remember this moments then we all worked togever. After 6 months ""family protection"" blocked my father from living in our home and after 6 months everythink was almost ok.

I was studying in art school. Also my mom was teacher in same school. With new school year, i organized class party in forest and from this moment i started drink, first time didn't comeback home becouse i found nice girl in concert :) Becouse our school had many room to practice, we drinked in school, miss lessons and so on. It was fun moments.

I started missing about 80+ lessons per semester. In 10 school year i lost best friend. He didn't wanted share music cd, so i stolen for a day and copy it. He saw it, after he few friends teached me ""lesson"", i told about it for director. All class started protect him and at this moment i thinked my life is ending, but in same week my happen even bigger disaster. My granny die. I didn't come to school about 2-3 months.

I not remeber much, but then i comeback to school, my goal was to stay repeat school year, becouse my music teacher told me i will never get in university, so i wanted get more time. For me teacher was like a father and i think it was biggest mistake in my life :( So i convinced my mom, i want move to other school where my music teacher learning and i did everythink to fuck up my school, becouse i wanted to reapeat year. But becouse my mom was school teacher, she fixed it.

After i moved to new art school i lied about my class and they taked me in same school year.. They didn't check my papers, just trusted my word (i not joking). This school was worse, but had much strong music students from my instrument.

After i started study, most people was from my perspective losers. Everythink was easy for me. Everyone was drinking and smoking so i join them. In winter i found love in internet 300km away and i started autostop a lot and miss lessons. I missed in first simester around 50+ lessons, in secound \~150, gf left me and after a lot drama i was expelled from school.

I had grandpa in my girlfriends town, i got idea to move here. I worked hard and got to good art school. The idea was to show how good i'm for my ex-gf. For my family this big city was last place where i could continue my studies so they supported my again. With first school papers i got to 11 year school.

Started my golden year. Before semester i found way how to make money on the street, started party nonstop, got a lot friends and so on. In new school i come like rock star. I had amazing music group and had many activities non stop. I found 2nd GF in my class for 3-4 weeks after i left her becouse i didn't started it and i started to be boring with her. After i left her, i had problems with class again school again.. but before i also was missing lessons, just now started even more. I think first semester i missed \~80, and secound \~140. Again a lot drama in family..

After i fuck up, i comeback to my home town and i was trying to finish last 2 years in adult school. I didn't told about it for anyone. In this adult school nobody care if you are in lessons or not, just tell them u are working and you not need to go. So i lied and i always was drinking, parting and autostoping every week from 700-1200 km to play with my band, meet friends and so on.

My look i think was 4-5 max, but i found gf who i think was 10 (now she is profesional pole dancer). We were able to be togever 3+ years. I lied to her a lot about my past. For example i told, i before was drug dealer and so on.. I told many good real stories, but it was not enouth for me. I was hiding fact, i was studing in adult school for a year i think. After i told, but don't know why. She supported me.

After i finish studie i with my family moved to other country. After few months GF left me and it was hard time for me. I was not going to language lessons, but i didn't wanted learn stupy language with idiots who can't read so i was played everyday 11-16 hours in small music school. My family thinked everythink is ok, until they got info about me from school. After this i started learn in curses for working in shop, but at the same time, i registrated to university and i manige get in. In university exam i lied to profesors how i had punk green haircloth (actualy i had only long her and only 1 times i painted them...)

And i thinked again i'm superman, relaxed and started play computer games. In summer i got weight from 95kg to 115kg. University was not in english, it was language witch i know only basic things. First lessons was easy for me, but i didn't feel in right place. After main music teacher pressure i didn't come back. I stay at home and played games until I was expelled from university. I still didn't told for anyone about it.

Now i'm 160kg and 30 years old. I never worked in my life, living on minimum money whitch i get from my mom. She thinks i finished university, working, just can't surivive without help. I know this gona finish, but i wish to live like this more.

I had idea about killing myself but i don't want to die. I know i will always find they how to be piece of shit and keep my lies safe forever, but i wish to change.

My plan is:

1. Stop lie and learn to say things who I really am and can be proud of myself.
2. Start doing sports, becouse now i can't normal move..
3. Find fucking job.

But it's almost inposible and i trying to find way to do it.

I feel bad about many things, but i think i'm not bad person.  
I not feel bad about lies, i feel bad about not being good in some situation. I can't delete them or accept it.  
I don't know how to work. For now everythink i have is my moms money..  
Shit live i have now is ok for me, it's hard to imagine somethink better..  
I hate school.  
I love music, but i can't listen it anymore without hating everythink about it.  
Now i writing from 20 square room with 4 month trash and beetles.

So ye, my life and i suck :) But maybe some good advice will come also i want to see people reaction to my life."
1372,Has anybody else had no genuine friendships as a child? Will the feeling ever go away?,"I was bullied since I was 3. When I was 4, a girl I tried to be friends with told me she hated me. By the time I was around 7, I believed that the concept of a friendship where your friends “have your back” and want to spend time with you was a ideal fantasy created by the media, because I was often warned that media portrayals of romantic relationships weren’t always realistic. So I thought that since other children always preferred to insult and exclude me and never showed interest in treating me in a positive way, friendships as seen in books and television must’ve been made up like magic and superpowers. My parents encouraged this idea and told me I expected too much from other children and that if nobody wanted to be nice to me, it’s because something is wrong with me and I must be a bad person. I’ve had psychiatrists who were abusive as well.

I struck it lucky when I was 14 and got a really amazing friend, I can’t believe how unbelievably fortunate I was. It’s been hard to learn how to be social and talk to another person so late in life, but he’s been exceedingly patient and supportive. A lot of people haven’t had this luck and never got the opportunity to live. My friend lives very far away in another country, but he is wonderful.

I’m 16 now (I am aware that I’m technically still a child). I still have severe depression. Sometimes it feels like I can’t remember that I have a friend, as though my mind is stuck years in the past. Sometimes I find myself struggling with really simple social things that are expected, because I just don’t have the experience to recognize certain mistakes and it makes me feel stupid. I miss my friend because he lives so far away and I have no chance of meeting up for years. Being at school and being surrounded by people who get to be with their friends makes me feel envious and miserable. It frustrates me that most children have always had friends. 

Has anyone experienced a deprivation of friendship in their childhood? It feels like there are no people who have experienced this and gotten better. I see a small amount of people who never had friends but are adults and still never recovered from the isolation and angst, and this terrifies me. I hear about people who were bullied or lonely for periods of their life (usually in adulthood) but never of someone who didn’t make any friends until past 10 years old and managed to live a full life today. 

It feels like there are so few people who were friendless as a kid, and it feels like there are none who actually recovered from it. Can anyone give me some hope?"
1373,I'm so alone,"I'm 19 and have 0 friends, the only people I talk to are my parents but even then our relationship isnt that deep. I have nobody I can be myself with, I struggle with conversation and find it really hard to keep friends. I'm just afraid to talk and dont know how to unless I'm really familiar with someone, which is super hard when I dont let myself get close to anyone. After breaking up with my ex lobelyness really hit me hard, I felt lonely with him but atleast I had 1 person to talk to. Now we've broken up I have absolutely nobody. It's not normal for a 19 to feel like this. I hate being so isolated yet I can only blame myself for it."
1374,People (even neurodivergent ones) treat my disorder as a gateway to treat me bad,"Hey everyone. Long story short. I (22F) wanted to vent in one group, stupidly thinking it was a safe space to talk about my problems. I have schizotypal disorder and it spiked recently, manifesting itself in appearance delusions. People started jumping to my throat, accusing me of trolling, attention seeking, indirectly calling me stupid. Mind you, it was a group for fellow neurodivergent people. But apparently I'm a subhuman if I suffer from anything else than depression or anxiety. I'm not trying to depreciate people suffering from these diseases as all are serious, but I had hoped I would be understood. Instead, they started treating me like crap for my delusions. I feel really hurt and betrayed. I've been trying so hard to see myself past my disease, that it doesn't define me, but now it's all gone to waste. I feel like a schizo, a nutter again, that I'm a literal subhuman. I don't know what to do with it."
1375,Does anyone know what this is?,"Does anybody have an idea for what I’m experiencing? About two months ago I smoked weed for the first time and had a horrible reaction, i went out of control. Before that I had anxiety as you could say but I don’t understand how I could ever go crazy. Was I really predisposed to some type of mental illness? For two months I’ve been feeling like my past memories have been of wiped, Ive felt dissociated, my body has been feeling heavier and harder to move, my appetite has been bad, my focus has been bad, and I have eye floaters and flashes of lights and shadows. I just want this to end so I can return to a normal life. Everyday random memories pop in my head. Will this go away? Does anybody have an idea to what I’m experiencing, because I don’t want to take medications and worsen it. Hopefully over time I will be healed."
1376,Stupid me :],"I’m a stupid, talentless bitch.

I’m pretty sure I have OCD, I’m always repeating shit in my head and in real life, and I often wash my hands until they bleed. I’ve had an ED in the past, and I’m kinda relapsing at the moment since I have a 2 week break from the outpatient ward. I probably have seasonal depression or some kind of bi-polar disorder too, I’m either unmotivated, tired, full of suicidal thoughts and overeating, or getting my life together but then falling into the “depressive state”, I don’t really know, again. I wanted to kill myself a few weeks/months ago, I don’t really know how much time has passed. I forget a lot. Periodically, I get anxiety over dying and shit.

I’m so fucking ugly and I’m not confident at all. I just want to hide, nobody wants to see me. It looks like I have Down’s syndrome or something, when I actually don’t. I want to get plastic surgery as soon as I can afford it. A nose job, something with my lips, my forehead, my eyes, my cheeks, my jaw. Everything.

On top of my ugliness, I’m also dumb as fuck. On a scale from F-A (F=failing, A=good), I’m at an E. I’m so fucking stupid. I wish I had something to be proud of, but I don’t. I’m only good/mediocre at starving. I like the feeling of starving. The feeling of being thin.

I also can’t draw, play an instrument, sing, or do anything like that. I don’t have any hobbies. I’m fucking empty, but still so full. I’m full of shit.

My dad also fucking hates me. He yelled at me today for removing a piece of fucking avocado from my plate to another one on the table. Ge makes me feel like shit sometimes. He tells me I would be better off dead sometimes too, but he says it jokingly. I still think about what he says though, I would maybe be better off dead.

I don’t know why the fuck I’m writing this, I guess I just need to vent. I’m sorry if you read this far, I don’t matter. But, I hope you (the one who’s reading this text) have/has a good day :]"
1377,I had a traumatic experience and not I constantly worry about everything where you COULD die,"I was in a bus that crashed and tipped over, I was  perfectly unharmed but ever since then I have been constantly worrying about how ‘that rock could fall on me’ etc. There was this one night I was staying at an air bnb and it was right on the main road and I was so worried that a car was gonna crash into the house and the house was gonna collapse and I was gonna die I got virtually no sleep.
Should I seek professional help?"
1378,Been fighting depression for most of the 17 years I’ve been alive,"I have a lot of questions I’ve always wanted answered about my depression. I doubt that I’m special and many people feel the same things I do but sometimes I wonder. I will try and keep this short. Maybe I’ll go into greater detail in a future post but for now I have only have a few questions.

Does anyone find great comfort with their depression? I feel like every time I’m in a situation where I feel some happiness it’s almost alien to me. I don’t feel comfortable with it and my brain automatically pushes it away. Depression feels like home and when I leave it for even a short period of time I get home sick.

Do genetics play any role in any of it? My Dad struggles with depression along with what I’m pretty sure is bipolar disorder. I find a lot of my habits and mental issues to be very similar to what he deals with. If you were to compare us side by side it would be almost identical and this worries me. Because of his mental illnesses he has turned to alcoholism. Since a teenager he has been drinking heavily which lead to my parents divorce and many other things I have seen which still stick with me to this day.

Last question. Does medication really work? When I was going to counseling medication was always recommended. I was prescribed prozac and a couple other things I can’t remember. I tried them for a short period of time but never stuck with it. I’ve always leaned towards the idea of being able to fight this on my own with out medication. I just want to know if it is possible to do so or if medication would be a better route.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
1379,Typical Male - Bottling things up - Feel like I'm going to burst,"TL:DR - How do you deal with the feeling of Loneliness and it's amplification of self-doubt, especially when you bottle your emotions up.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I (29M) went through a lot of emotional trauma in my early life - people walking out on me, deaths, bullying etc. and from a young age I always had the typical male mentality of stiff-upper-lip, chin-up, put it to the back of my mind mentality. What didn't kill me, made me stronger... If only.

What didn't kill me just made me my own worst enemy. I hate everything about myself and I struggle to think positively - but I'm not depressed (yet). I became so good at numbing emotions and not feeling things that I'm just now understanding how unhealthy it is. I feel like I've been filling up a trash can inside my brain and it's beginning to overflow - and I'm not sure how to deal with it. 

What's sending me over the edge though is this - I've always tried to do the right thing and be a good person. About 8 months ago, I chose to end a long-term relationship because I wasn't being fair to my partner. She was an amazing woman and I didn't want to cheat or be unfaithful, but I no longer felt the same way or could reciprocate the much stronger feelings she had for me. I knew the fairest thing to do was to call it a day. Being in such a long term relationship and making this change made me feel guilty for leaving her and putting her through that, and it left me very alone.

Recently and unrelated also, another woman led me on (nothing serious) and dropped me seemingly out of no where. Leaving me feeling rejected and slightly ashamed/ embarrassed.

Then there's my self-esteem which is just rock-bottom. Plain and Simple.

Essentially, All these strong emotions that I never learned to deal with healthily - low self-esteem, guilt, embarrassment, rejection - are all building up and usually I'd find a way to take my mind off it, but Loneliness seems to be a great amplifier and I can't deal with them anymore.

If anyone has any recommendations, other than talk to someone (which I really don't mean to be rude...If I could I wouldn't be on reddit) I'd hugely appreciate it."
1380,I'm a mental and emotional mess,"I have no idea what to do with myself..... My life just feels very screwed up and I don't know why. I'll try my best to explain and hopefully there is someone who can offer help.  


I was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome (Autism) when I was 21 years old and struggled a bit trying to get my life on track since then. I was diagnosed so late because I didn't cause problems in school, but I still showed some signs which was caught by my mom's best friend. And after the diagnosis, we tried to get disability for myself but it was troublesome because I haven't gone to the doctor for anything like this before. We kept trying and at the same time I tried to find a job to work like anyone else, but still struggled to get hired at any work place. So back and forth through the years I have been denied disability and a job. They say I don't qualify for disability because the government believes I can work, but I can't work because of my Autism. I don't quite understand......  


And on top of that, I do have these mental/emotional breakdowns. It keeps me very depressed and have a short fuse when it does happen. I do have some friends to talk to about it, or to help me forget about it for a while...... But there are also people on the internet who take advantage of my pain. I even had former friends just abandon me after my breakdown and turn around and harass me for it even though I did apologize after I calmed down. It makes me very scared of meeting people now and even more scared of losing the friends I do have now because of my breakdowns..... I lost too many friends already....  


But that is my explanation. I apologize if it's hard to read..... This is my first post."
1381,Empathy?,"I have a hard time understanding myself. My empathy seems to fluctuate, It’s not always completely there. For example, when the bushfires were at their worst, I donated $20 and cried over it because I was so empathetic towards the animals. When I heard a story about some people in China putting a dog into a wok while it was still alive, I was angry about it. When my mom came into my room to tell me that her brother had died and she was crying I was immediately responsive and I hugged her and told her I was sorry. But then there are days where I am sort of empty and I don’t feel any empathy. Those days are lessening overtime because I am being medicated with mood stabilizers so I am more empathetic than I used to be. But there are still days where I seem to not quite understand myself. when I was younger and when I was a teenager, I had some kind of conduct disorder which I’m sure a lot of you know what that means. I don’t want to talk about it though since I feel a lot of guilt over it. I feel actual guilt, this is not me thinking “what is guilt?“, I genuinely feel sorrow and empathetic over it. It disturbs me to think about it. I still have my days though, where my empathy will fluctuate and I worry about myself. But those days as I said, are lessening overtime. Does anyone know what is up with me? is this a disorder?"
1382,"My story of how my new lifechanging hobby of sculpting clay is therapeutic for my ADHD, depression, and anxiety. Creativity and the mind is powerful. Stay strong!","I thought this would be something to help inspire those who struggling with ADHD.

I live with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and always searched for a way to deal with it all. It's something that never really goes away, but finding a positive outlet to express myself has been a huge lifechanger. I recently learned that creating art with polymer clay is extremely therapeutic for my mental health. It gives me something to focus on and allows me to share my creativity with others. 

It's kind of scary because I've never made a video showing myself and talking about personal issues. So, even though this was very difficult to record (and it took me over 20 times to finally get right), I feel good about using video blogs to stay focused, inspire others, AND to share my polymer clay creations.

I may not be the most camera friendly or smooth with my words.....but hopefully a few people will still enjoy. 

Thank you for your support to raise awareness for ADHD! &lt;3

1383,I’m Feeling Paranoid that my Mind Created a Memory,"I was on the way somewhere today and I remember bumping into someone I know but during the conversation I felt tired and hazy (probably due to my lack of sleep last night) so now I’m feeling paranoid that my mind made up the conversation. I’ll find out on Monday (when I see the person I bumped into) so I can find out if it was real or not. I definitely think it was real but asIve got a nagging thought telling me otherwise,  just a quick question: do false memories usually line up perfectly with the rest of a memory? Or are they usually separate events you remember? I’m only asking as I don’t want to strike up a conversation with the person I met on Monday about our conversation only to find out it wasn’t real."
