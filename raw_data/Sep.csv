0,I'm tired..,"I'm physically tired. I'm mentally tired. I'm tired of wanting social interaction, but feeling emotionally too drained to be around people. I'm tired of people showing up in life and leaving. I'm tired of having to be there for people, but not having people to lean on in return. I'm tired of my mind going to worst case scenario all the time. 

I'm tired of trying to hold myself up and when I really just want to fall into a million pieces. I'm just really fucking tired."
1,I don't feel like I deserve to feel the I feel,"It's funny, most of the time I just long to feel something. Not that I think I feel truly numb or empty, but I feel flat, I guess. And sometimes all I want is to just feel something that's real, something that's strong, something that's certain. Even if it's crying. I long to cry because I welcome anything that will make me feel something. But whenever I do cry, whatever sadness or self-pitying bullshit that I'm feeling is immediately replaced with anger. Anger directed towards myself because I know that I don't deserve to feel sad because I'm just a lazy piece of shit who doesn't confront any of his problems.

Does anybody understand what I'm saying?"

3,on the brink of exploding.,"Ever since the pandemic hit, my acne has gotten worse and it is now my main insecurity. I have acne prone skin and have always had it since high school. The main cause of my acne is stress and lack of sleep. 

Never ending assignments and running on 2-3 hours of sleep everyday has become a norm for me ever since I started college so I'm not surprised that this ridiculous schedule has got my skin fucked up. I know this and acknowledge this but I really can't do anything about it if I want to get through college. 

The issue for me right now is how my skin problems from college stress completely transcended from bad to undeniably ridiculous  during the pandemic. My classes are fully online. So that means staying at home. I live with my family and extended family. This means I get a whole package of most relatives and absolutely no privacy. 

My acne never really bothered me because having acne is normal and it shouldn't be something that we should feel ashamed of. But being at home for the past 5 fucking months and having people yapping in your ear everyday about how bad your face looks has caused my mental health to decline so bad that it shows on my face. 

I've never been this stressed about my face in my life, I've never been this insecure about my face. I've never felt like the world would see me as a dirty human for having acne until today. 

""You have such smooth skin but look at your face, no one will want you.""

""Do you not wash your face?""

""I get so angry when I look at your face.""

""Why don't you take care of your skin?""

""Does your face look fatter?""

*Stared intensely at my face while I'm doing my assignments* ""omg your face""

.

.

At this point I just want to peel my face off and frame it on the wall so my family can stare at as it it was a piece of art."
4,Day 2 of doing 60+ push ups a day because I’m depressed.,I just wanna see where it takes me. I’m 23/M currently ab 185 - 190lb
5,Help please,"I need someone‘s advice who knows what it‘s like to deal with depression and bpd.
My boyfriend has the above two and it‘s really rocky between the two of us. He is sleeping the whole day and really absent in total. We haven‘t seen each other for almost 8 months (with covid) and it‘s killing me. I don‘t know what to do anymore. I try to be as supportive as possible but i‘m drained. I don‘t wanna leave/lose him since i really care about him and still want to experience so much with him but he has completely checked out it seems. He always says he wants to fix it but he doesn‘t have the energy and that he doesn‘t really feel anything anymore. I‘m really worried for him and me. He doesn‘t call me, no facetime, not even an hour of seeing me.
Right now he is looking for a therapist but can‘t find one and he is convinced that with pills it will get better. Which i do also think but he and me both know the deeper problem.
In the last 2 or 3 months i‘ve been really mean to him, not always on purpose, but sometimes i can‘t keep my anger and frustration in. All i want to do is help him and show him that he is worth everything and deserves everything and that there is still so much there is to see and do. Everyday i feel like losing him more and more and i don‘t know what to do eanymore. Everyone is telling me to leave him since it‘s useless but they don‘t know how it is to have those illnesses. I mean i don‘t even know.
I‘m just at a crossroads and don‘t know what to do anymore. I love him so much but i do!‘t know what to do. If someone has sone insight/tips please tell me"
6,Major Depressive Disorder with Bouts of Euphoria and Obsessive Interests,"Hello,

  \[19F\] I was diagnosed with MDD several years back.. Up until recently, it's been a typical depression (Low energy, emptiness, overwhelming sadness, etc.) 

  Around January of this year, my mood has been generally lower than before, and it feels like it's getting worse. However, there will be days where I will feel unbelievably euphoric with no cause. I'll get obnoxiously talkative (I'm usually a quiet person,) bursts of energy and motivation, and while normally when trying to focus on something, my mind can't quickly process what's happening. During these euphoric ""episodes,"" I can't focus because I'm processing information too rapidly for me to keep up with. When I come down from the high, I'm entirely drained of energy.

  I don't know if this is related to the last paragraph, but I've also noticed that in the past few months I'll get fixated on random things (Songs, hobbies, animals, people, etc) and OBSESS over it for 2-14 days, suddenly get totally bored of it, and never touch it again. While I'm engrossed in whatever it is, I want to be doing/learning about it 24/7 and it's almost all I can think about. 

  I know that not everyone on this sub is a professional, but maybe someone knows what's going on with me or if it's normal? 

I'm sorry if this post is all nonsense, I tried my best to articulate my thoughts but I'm not always the best at that. 

Additional Info:

\~ I was prescribed 250mg(Or around there) Wellbutrin daily

\~ I have General+Social Anxiety Disorder

Thank you for any thoughts on the matter &lt;3"

9,Things aren’t really great at the moment.,"This morning was rough. It’s currently 1:20 am and I cried from like 00:30-1:00. Just crying. Sometimes I wish me and my mom could always get along and not be at each other’s throats. And that she didn’t give out to me for struggling because that affected me pretty badly. I’m really jealous of people who get along with their mom all the time and like to do bonding things with them. I wish we were like that and that I didn’t always fuck things up like the screw up I am. 

I have like no one to talk to about things that bother me because I’m meant to be the funny one and even if I mention I’m struggling people respond with laughing face emojis like they don’t think I’m serious. Times like this that I feel so alone. I’m carrying so much weight, whether that be my friends secrets or my own, my strained relationships or past experiences that have messed me up. I just really want to be okay again. 

I don’t cry much at all but today I just needed to release some built up sadness. I’m in a better place than I was a while ago so I’m grateful and trying to be proud of my progress but when there’s no one to be proud of me it never feels like I did much. I feel like an outsider a lot, even in my own friend group. I could be in a room full of people and still feel like the loneliest person on earth. 

I just needed somewhere to vent because it’s been a crappy few months."
10,I feel myself spiraling into depression... what do I do??!,"I want to skip school again. I cry all night. I feel distant and can’t talk to my friends the way I used to. I make up sad scenarios in my head all the time. I feel useless and unwanted and I want to stay in bed all day. My motivation is fading away. I cant sleep and then i sleep too much...?

I was just getting better. A week ago I told my boyfriend about how happy i’d felt in the past couple of months. I’m keeping my job, getting my license, i finally have some nice savings.

Why am I still sad then? Does anyone else experience this? I dont know what I did to get out of my depressive state before, it just sort of happened. 
Please help. I really cannot afford to go through this hell again."
11,I feel mentally unstable?,"I really need input. Kudos if you have the patience to read! haha

Since early high school, I (24f) haven't felt mentally healthy. I believe I became depressed a bit after my parents got divorced when I was 12. I have always been someone who gets extremely attached to things, and it was really hard for me to accept the changes. (i.e. super sad every year when school would end; would cry when my parents would sell their car; would randomly cry about my grandparents dying although I was only 5 when they passed). I remember being suicidal in high school, secretly binge drinking, &amp; having sex with guys out of self-pity.

My second-year of college, I decided to move out of my parent's house(s) and live on campus. This is the year I remember truly being happy. Since I was working toward a degree, it felt like I was really working for something. I met a lot of friends, still drank a moderate amount, attended a bunch of dance classes, and met a new guy. Things were great.

I graduated college after my third-year, and was pretty down about graduating. I was graduating with a degree in finance, and I was sad I was going to spend years of my life in a boring field. I ended up dating the aforementioned guy for about 2-2.5 years (he was fairly toxic-- cheating, hid me from his family, judgmental, superficial, etc.).... we broke up 2 years ago &amp; it took forever to get over-- I had to take melatonin &amp; several glasses of wine to get to sleep for months. 

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT DAY (IN A NUTSHELL): It took me 8 months to find a job, and I was pretty down in those months as well. I have been at my current job for 2.5 years (accountant). I am very thankful for my job..it's easy &amp; I make decent money-- I honestly can't complain. I adopted the best dog ever a year ago. I have been with my sweet boyfriend for a year (although the feelings aren't as strong as with the last one) and he is my bestfriend/adventure buddy. I have days where I feel clear, fine, &amp; happy...and then I have days where I am very sad, cloudy, and odd. My emotions shift quickly. I feel unstable-- like life keeps passing me by in a very strange way. I am tired all of the time too and have trouble focusing.  

Things that may be contributing: my dad disowning me multiple times for trivial things in the past few years (currently not speaking), insecure attachment in my relationship (I am overly needy), birth control?, occasional adderall use (it helps my focus and fatigue), low self-confidence, feeling stuck in my career, feeling stuck in where I live (same place forever), drinking 4x a week, not eating the healthiest?, not having a lot of friends, overthinking everything, fear of doctors/therapists, and I also have moderate social anxiety (which makes me fear leaving the world of accounting-- imagine having to actually talk to people!)."
12,Is this psychosis?!,"So, I’ve experienced brain zaps for over 20 years now. I am almost 100% positive that they first appeared as a withdrawal symptom, from stopping my SSRI cold turkey. Since then, though, I have experienced them intermittently, both when on prescription meds (or withdrawing from) and when I’m not on any meds. There’s little to no research on them but from what I gather, they aren’t dangerous. The only thing that somewhat concerns me is that occasionally they cause possible episodes of psychosis for me. 

This only ever happens when I’m having brain zaps while just drifting off to sleep. It’s really, really hard to explain but somehow I end up seeing two of myself and I’m unable to determine which body is actually my body. So because I don’t know which body is mine, I lose the ability to control myself and I go into this like sleep paralysis. And it’s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. And during this, I’m imagining myself moving and it’s so realistic that I “forget” about my actual body, laying paralyzed in bed. And then it becomes scary again when I remember that part. This cycle occurs several times, until I can overpower the hallucination enough to will my physical body to open its eyes. 

Is it even possible to be aware of your own psychosis? Or does the fact that I am aware of these episodes automatically reduce it to something less than psychosis??"
13,I would kill someone without remorse but the law 'stops me',"I will not kill anyone. The thing is that if I had the chance to kill someone without they law knowing I would and I wouldn't care. People I told this find it weird. Is this bad? Should I get I checked?

14,Mental/verbal abuse,"Dating a girl(21), me (22, my birthday is Wednesday) for a year and 8 months now, recently I made the choice to leave her cause she doesn’t just get mad. When she gets mad she yells,and blows up, calls me names, and I finally told her I can’t do it anymore and that I need to help myself out. 
She is playing the guilt card and saying “you are throwing away a year and a half” and in the midst of all this I told her that I just want time to figure out what I want to do cause she apologized and asked for a chance for her to change and that we could get through it together. And I just don’t know what I want to do, I want to stay with her cause I have love for her but I also want to help myself grow, and keep sanity.  Minutes ago we finally just ended it, I have to walk away, I told her I don’t want to confuse her and I don’t want to be a bad or mean person
And now I’m left with my thoughts, i know break ups aren’t easy or fun or pretty, but I just feel dark and I feel anxious. I’m gonna run a mile or 2 to try to just be with my thoughts. Any advice would be appreciated."

I’m trying so hard to be happy and make everyone happy, and build relationships with my family again but it feels like nothing will ever be good enough. I hate this feeling I fought so hard to be rid of it and I feel like a failure. I’m just so done."

19,Omnipresent memories,"Hello, guys.
Recently, and when I say recently I mean like since a week ago, ive been living such a bad experience  that's taking away all of my joy and overall wont let me live a comfortable life, as I had been living. Somewhere about a week ago, I remember a very painful event of my life, which was caused because of me, completely my fault, i hadn't thought of it for so long even though it was such an impactful event. Now I cant clear my mind and just enjoy things, my subconscious only focuses on that thing, all day long im thinking on all the possible outcomes that could have happened if I did everything as I should have, and it just hurts so much that what hapoen can never be fixed, and it keeps haunting me. I just want to live without it, as i had before, if I try to embrace it and try to redeem myself, no matter what, it will always be the same, i just wanted it to not be like that, but there is nothing i can do to change it. Its not like I have ptsd, like i drift away and get flashbacks, it is just stuck in my head, i try thinking on lther things but soon or later (pretty much always very soon) I remember it again and so on. These days have been a complete torture for my mind, not even working, distracting myself will work, everywhere, everytime, when studying, when sleeping, in my dreams, it just cant get away and my desperation is inmesurable. I just wish it somehow fades away, and I can just carry on with my life as I have before, im not going to kill myself, I just need to be free again from this, please, if anyone who reads this has experienced this and overcome it, please help me, thank you for reading all I had to say, wish you the best 🙏..."

23,do we belittle other people's problems?,"everyone feels special. everyone feels like they are more aware of this world than the others, that others are just living without ever questioning why they are here. but we all question it.   
but I think that there are some people whose life is just made to be different, chaotic, restless. I don't believe in god, so perhaps is just a consequence of certain behavioural characteristics, coupled with certain contexts. But is there, I have met some, I am one.

  
I'm 22 and I have seen way more shit than I probably should have, but i am OK with that because with everything bad, something good came. I have been fat, anorexic, depressed, happy, alone, loved. I have been everything and the opposite of everything. I have seen my father almost dying in front of me twice. I am helping him to recover from something that kills many people, I had five jobs, I lived in four countries, I had many girls, I had a one year toxic relationship while living together and working at the age of 19, I lived in the poorest and in the richest regions of Europe.  


I have seen more shit than I should have seen and I hate when people belittle this and don't understand my behaviour in certain moments. I hate it but I don't want to be understood because I know that the last thing that people want is other people's problems. But why do we do this?  
I hate when they try to minimize what I have been through . Because saying that I brough my almost dead father to the hospital and waited 5 hours crying outside sounds devastating, but not even half of how devastating it actually is. And losing a friend in a motorbike accident two days after that sounds like a ""bad period"" to some. Being born poor and having to work to pay your studies and living expenses sounds like ""just"" 5 hours a day of working more than my classmates, but who did it knows that is much more than that.  


This can sound arrogant, maybe it is, but I have reached a point in which I no longer fit with most people of my age. It sounds superficial, but all the problems of my friends just look so unimportant to me. Anxiety for exams, No money for a phone, self-image issues, a girl or a boy. What the fuck are those problems. How are they even problems.  


I think that there is a simple reason behind why suicides are higher in richer countries than in Africa. People in Africa have no time to think about this nonsense bullshit because they must fucking survive. Guys in Sweden are being called pussies and thats their worst day of the year.  
I know I am not the only person suffering in this world, that there are many people who are having a more difficult life than me, but why do we try to minimize other people's issues?

Idk that was it what u think bout my rant

24,Am I on the verge of an eating disorder?,"Basically I already know I have body dysmorphia, a lot of it triggered by the pressure of my mom to lose weight. She recently told me to lose 20 pounds. I am currently sitting at 118 pounds at 4'8"". I tell my doctors my goal weight is 100, but my real weight is 90 pounds.   


Today I only had one meal, which was during lunch. Most of the time my meal regimen is skipping breakfast (unless I get caught), eating a small lunch, and then eating a normal dinner. I feel like I definitely need to exercise more, but I am counting my steps and how many calories I lose everyday. I have a calorie tracker and I base my meals on that.   


I just don't know if I'm going off the deep end soon. I know my moods are shifting and I feel more tired."
25,Treatment Hurts More Than Helps,"Hi guys,

I have a long, long history with mental health issues and treatment. My mother was in and out of mental hospitals all of my childhood with paranoid schizophrenia. The amount of abuse that I encountered, combined with organic mental health issues and being years ahead of my grade level in school, landed me with a child psychiatrist by 7. I don’t know if I’ve ever gone more than 12 months without seeing a mental health professional in 20+ years since then.

As a kid, it was always critical to not disclose too much about our actual situation to teachers, doctors, cops, camp counselors, etc. CPS got involved with my family a couple of times. Right or wrong, I was convinced my little brother and I were better off outside of state systems and institutions. While our home lacked stability and security, we had considerable economic comfort, and I was able to put together my ticket out with scholarships that I wouldn’t have had access to without support for lessons, tutoring, etc.

I’m grown now and I’ve been struggling with my depression and anxiety intensely for about 6 months. Since COVID everything has gone to shit and I don’t believe that the doctors are really capable of helping someone like me. I’ve been playing this stupid game longer than some of my providers have been alive. When I’ve been in genuine crisis, thinking that a provider will be there to provide meaningful assistance has caused more harm than good. I just want them to write the meds I need when I need them and fuck off. I am so tired of having SSRIs shoved down my throat. They don’t help, have never helped, and no matter how many times I tell that to a doctor they are always wanting to give me more.

Part of me doesn’t want to give up on treatment because it means giving up on the idea that this can make me better... but if that’s the truth, that it’s not and never will be beneficial for me, then I feel I should be staying away and that’s that.

Tl;dr How do you keep your optimism about treatment? Have you ever been convinced treatment was useless and changed your mind? Do you have any advice on finding a provider worth seeing?

Thanks, I really look forward to learning anyone’s stories."
26,"Instead of working, I'm posting on reddit to complain about my life.","Literally the title. Keep in mind that I am not an english native speaker, so writing this is twice harder than my actual work. TL;DR at the end, this is not worth your time anyway.

It's 4.00 AM right now, I have three texts to submit before 6.00 PM. On of these texts is a group work so it won't be difficult, but the thing is I didnt even check what they were talking about on the messenger group and now I realised that they got it all wrong. But It's too late, only stupid people are awake at 4.00 AM on an open day, and they definitely won't change their part because they guy who never answered on the chat disagree with the plan.   
Then the overthinking began. Why am I so condescendant ? We're 7 on the group and we are 2 new writers. They were cool and so friendly when i checked all the discussion and I didnt want to bother 'em at all. But now, our result will suck compared to the other groups. Why didnt I warend them? 

In two words : Social anxiety. ""I have this low self-esteem that makes me hate myself but I still think I'm better than everyone else"". I've been enrolled on this project since september 2019 but I dont feel I'm a part of it yet. So insitead of telling them my thoughts, I'd rather shut up and follow their plans. Now I regret it cause i have to produce something that I dont like at all AND I CANT BREATHE AT ALL. godammit

That's not my lisonly problem. I also have abandonment issues. Dont get it wrong, I have formidable parents, tho I'd like they were cheering me up instead of forcing me to be like ""the other kids"". Since I'm the elder kid (how d'you say the big bro of 3 girls), no one taught me anything about life. Dad is busy at work from 7 to 18, also busy on rapport at home; mum is the kind of ""dont make too many friends, focus on work work work (she isn't rihanna)"", I don't really remember any meaningful conversation with 'em. I even thought that we make babies by kissing when i was 10.  At the same age, I was the ""brilliant kid"", I skipped two classes because i got the perfect marks then i fell like trash. On the same time, I discovered video games, my lack of social skills, and how to make babies. Thanks to the science teacher and my ""friends"" who introduced an innocent guy to porn. 

But my parents never knew anything about it. It came to a point where I skipped class for 2 weeks, I even wasted my school fees one day. I was hit, blamed and other things till i finished high school. I wanted to learn informatic but my grades were too low to get admitted; Dad couldn't pay private universities fees, so I went on a public university. I failed my first year, I tried music but it didnt work well (and parents kinda forced me to give up by not giving me money anymore), so I joined my actual university (management and other things). I only study to pass the year so dad and mum let me play video games, yet all the teachers say I can be THE best. This is where my condescendant self woke up. 

I tried to learn programming, unity, 3D and other graphism, drawings, music, but none of 'em went well. I dont have patience and I suck at creation. I barely can copy when it comes to graphism. I tried some jobs but the university takes sooo much time so I can't really be independant. I'm lucky to have a job by these very though times tho and I'm grateful I can help dad and mum, yet they dont want it because they still consider me as kid. But I dont have to behave like it. Yes, i'm 22 and I'm still living with my parents and 3 sisters. 

Now i dont know what do anymore. University asks us to prepare a project for the 5th year and I dont have any idea of what to do. I suck. at. everything.

But hey, weren't we talking about abandonment issues? In the meanwhile, I asked out only 5 girls. They were all my ""bestfriend"" before that. We used to do everything together, they even realised I'm a better bf than their bf (their bf became their ex as soon as we were close, everytime. I guess I'm a curse), but they eventually chose another guy because I'm not the kind of guy with whomo girls go out with. I've complained a lot about that, but now i do realise I dont care about it anymore. Relationship is way harder than that and I dont wanna argue or talk about it. I just know i have abandonment issues because : 

* the first one cut ties with me and went out with my best friend (that's another whole story)
* the second had sex with a random guy. She appeared 3 years later with 3 babies.
* the third realised I'm not  emotionally stable so she blocked me
* the fourth wasn't interested in relationship at all
* and the fifth was only playing with me because... that's fun, as she said. we never kissed nor had sex. yes, 22 and virgin. 

Right now i have another bestfriend. I'm about to do the same stupid decision again. But thanks to my overthinking, I dont think i'm in love with her. Best part is, she deosn't consider me as her bestfriend nor someone important at all so I can control my stupid ass from asking her out. But hey, I'm about to lose my mind everytime she ignores me. 

I nearly covered everything. Yes I thought about counseling but it costs too much in my country. I'm joking about suicide everyday but I love dad and mum and my sisters too much to inflict them my stupidity. In fact, suicide itself is so stupid. There are many things to discover in this world. Like aliens, space, the asteroïd that will destroy our world, the revolution of bots. If you're thinking about suicide like me, forget about it. Go out and appreciate the aire, guy a chocolate, eat a whole pizza by yourself. Life is too beautiful to lose it at the end, right? 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

TL;DR : I have abandonment issues, I didnt achieve anything by 22, I'm thinking about suicide but suicide is stupid so don't do it, I have work to do but instead I'll write an useless text about my life that no one will read, I coudln't fight my social anxiety so now I have to follow someone's plan which is totally wrong."
27,Short term anti-psychotic for depressive episodes?,"Are there any anti-psychotic meds that can be used short term (~up to a couple weeks) for something like double depression? I have dysthymia but I also get relatively severe depressive symptoms on a somewhat regular basis (4-6 + times per year) and often during those episodes I get extremely agitated, irritable, struggle with impulsive thoughts, have serious suicidal thoughts, self-harm, my OCD gets worse, and I have a very hard time with work (I’ve quit jobs due to mental breakdowns during these episodes), etc. 

I’ve already tried several different antidepressants over several years and they really just made my life worse. I’m prescribed benzos to take as needed for anxiety but if I take them more than a few days in a row I think they make my irritability and depression worse. I don’t want to have to take a medication every day. So right now I’m just curious about short term anti-psychotic meds. Thanks."
28,Taking the first step for help is the hardest,"I (17F) personally have found the first steps to help the hardest, I haven't yet taken the plunge. I know people say ""If you need help, then go for it."", or ""You need to speak to someone about this."" But it's just not that easy.

I don't feel like I deserve the help, or I'm faking it to myself, but I do know I need it. I just loose all motivation as my thoughts direct me away from it.

I'm anxious, tired, sad and sometimes lonely for no reason. I have no idea why I feel this way. At the time, those feelings make sense, but later when I try to sort through it it just doesn't make sense.

I have talked about it to my older siblings and my dad,  but I just can't bring myself to book an appointment with my GP / Doctor, I don't know how it works, what I should say, or if I do really need it. I just don't know.

I do know that I have some form of depression, undiagnosed, as I show symptoms and my sister when through similar things and has it herself. 

My Mom seems to be some of the problem. She berates you for doing something differently or not doing it at all. She guilt trips you after spending your own money, going out or leaving her alone. Eg. ""Hope you enjoyed yourself, I've just been sat here. But you know... whatever."" So you're stuck no matter what you do.

I just wish I could talk to her, but I can't. She can have problems but anyone else can't. I makes it difficult for me to seek help.

I'm sorry for the length of this post,  but I needed to get it off my chest."
29,My voice,I've always hated how deep and monotone my voice because it makes me feel like a fake woman. Sometimes at points it gets even deeper and raspy and for some reason my mom can't help but pick on it. It makes me want to stop talking at all or at least to her.
30,The insanity that has been the past months months. I just need to vent.,"It probably won’t make much sense but I need to get it off my chest before I explode. If you read this whole story, bless your heart.

At the end of 2018 I moved from very small town Canada (as in, from an island) to Australia for school. It was an international vocational training for youth work which combined academics with actually living in that environment for three beautiful years. It was my miracle and actually yanked me out of the anorexia and depression that had gotten me kicked out of uni a year and a half prior. Needless to say, it was an answer to my nineteen year old prayers.

It was amazing. I made friends from all over the globe who I did life with for that time and got to know so intimately as people. Coffee dates, wonderful chats, trainers that doubled as life mentors, people to pick me up the second I started slipping, etc. I had never experienced connections like that... truly lifelong friends that I still can’t believe God gifted me. 

Cue early March. I was working at a women’s conference and I guess you could say my conference crush stole my heart. We started dating, my first ever boyfriend who ticked every box on the list.

Fast forward to literally the NEXT day. COVID restrictions were put in place and on our one-day-versary we went into lockdown and could only go to each other’s houses. It was nice but it was boring, especially for my first ever dating experience! 

About two weeks into dating we are told we are not allowed to see each other at all because we were in full lockdown. We honoured the rules, of course. But my house was very cold and everyone was much older than me so I felt very isolated, as many others did I’m sure. Classes went from in-person to online over the course of two days. I struggled with the unknown, to say the least.

Literally five days into full lockdown (so three weeks dating) the Canadian government sends a message saying for students to come home. The Australian government told us to get out because the state of the economy was at stake and students without finances would likely not be able to survive. I panicked. 

I couldn’t get home because my island was closed. Yes, closed. No access. I panicked more. 

His mom, who I had met for about three minutes via FaceTime, told me she’d take me in. I do not agree with living with SO’s before marriage (I know, old school) so I panicked at that too. We’d been dating for THREE weeks, how could I move to a random place in Canada with this guy I hardly know this far!?

That week my very best friend went back to Norway without being able to say bye, my other one moved to another part of Australia, and my South African friend also left. Literally 15+ of my closest friends left without notice. We didn’t know we’d never see each other again the last time we saw each other and I still can’t even process that level of pain. 

Anyways, things got very dire very fast and I had about 48 hours to pack up my life, sell everything I owned, and get on a plane with my bf of three weeks and my one suitcase. I was devastated but refused to process anything.

We arrived in Canada 48 hours later. We isolated in a trailer in the driveway for 14 days, in the frigid cold. I have anxiety already and I cannot describe what all these rapid changes did to my mental health. The social anxiety and general anxiety from being in a totally foreign place with ALL new people was crippling. 

I was terrified and dreading life. Two failed degrees for reasons outside of my control... I felt (and still kinda feel) like a failure at life. I feel like a free-loader and an incompetent adult. I left home at seventeen for uni and I’ve just failed everything since. 

About three months in we had planned a trip to my home thinking it would be open by then... Eight days before our flights I got notified that it was cancelled. That was devastating again. I still haven’t seen my family. All I want to do is hug my baby sister. 

My boyfriend has lived here his whole life and settled right back into pre-Australia life (with COVID restrictions, of course.) My lifestyle back home was so different and I’m a busy body, so I struggled massively. I relapsed with my ED and I’m slightly worried I might have to go back on anxiety meds. 

Now I am working 55 hours a week. I still can’t look at photos from Australia and I haven’t cried about any of it yet. I don’t know how to process that feeling of loss, and feel dumb for even feeling at a loss when so many people have lost so much more. 

Sorry if this made no sense but I needed to acknowledge all of these things that have happened."
31,Feelings,Does anyone just not know how to love? Like I grew up in a family where I never knew what real love is. And no I have attachment issues where if you show any sign of attention to me I’ll get butterflies when I think of them. And they will be all I think of until it fades away....
32,Has anyone taken FMLA/disability leave for mental health? Should I? I don’t know if I am unwell enough to justify it.,"Hi everyone. I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but I’m spinning a little bit.

I am in therapy, dealing with pretty severe depression and anxiety. My therapist doesn’t know how bad it is because I’m an idiot, but that’s beside the point.

I’ve reached a point in my depression where I can’t force myself to do the most basics of my job. I lie and fake shit but more often I just accept that I’m shit and make excuses. I used to be good at my job and a really hard worker so I’m being given a LOT of slack, but people are very confused and annoyed. 

Sometimes I’ll try to force myself to do things but I have a full on panic attack. I can’t focus on anything. I’m stupid, forgetful, incompetent even when I am trying. I’m addicted to marijuana somehow, although I’m just as useless and stupid sober anymore anyway. I’m not suicidal but I have passive suicidal thoughts constantly, like a soundtrack in my head. When things go wrong I reassure myself with the reminder that that is an option. It’s not really an option, so it’s hollow comfort, but it’s what I have.  Sometimes the thoughts are so overwhelming and I can’t think about anything else. Every time I have to call someone it takes me like an hour to psych myself up, if I can get away with not doing it I don’t do it. Every time my phone rings it takes me so long to get my heart rate back down to normal. 

My life is a complete mess but the pressure from work is making everything impossible. It’s pretty high stress work with long hours and lots of difficult decision making that I used to be equipped for but no longer am. 

I want to ask for stress leave, but how? Are my problems big enough? Will my employer look down on it? Will it ruin my reputation? I’m slowly ruining my reputation anyway so might be worth it. I’m so lost, anyone have any advice?"
33,Hi y’all,"Hey guys I recently started have some mental health problems about 2 months ago. I’ve been very anxious, depressed, and disassociate frequently throughout the day. I feel like a passenger in my life rather than the captain. I’m on week 2 or 3 I think of zoloft. Hopefully it gets better. A reminder to everyone that you’re not alone :)"

35,Im freaking out,So i started school today and holy shit this is bad. Since my psychotic break my cognitive function is not very good. I don’t understand anything about doing school anymore and can barely type the notes. I’m considering dropping out and going back to work for a year to let my brain heal. Is that reasonable or am i just freaking
36,I don't know who to talk to so here I am,"To start off, I'm a 20 yo female i was diagnosed with stress and depression, took meds for approximately  a month and then i never went back to my doctor because :
1. My mom refuses the idea of me needing mental help.
2.the lack of therapists in my country and me not liking the ones here because I can feel that they don't really care.
I don't know when my mental health issues started (TW) I was sexually assaulted when I was younger ( it was a family member and child on child abuse) i grew up to being threatened by that abuse by my mother saying she'll tell my father whenever i made her mad, as I've grown up I didn't know how to deal with it so I just feel numb about it now, truly i don't know how to deal with it , and as a teen i was touched by men in a sexual way men who were my  principal or people i was supposed to trust, then almost got raped by a bus driver if it wasn't for the actions I've made i don't know where or what was he going to do to me and  what he had planned, and as time went by i seem to be emotionally unstable, having trust and authority issues, building up so much anger, always stressed and always trying to  make people happy, and since last year I've been finding out that my dad is emotionally abusive to both me and my mother and that has caused me to have more stress and more anger towards him, at this point i can't trust myself I'm always doubting my feelings , I don't even know my feelings anymore , am I depressed, angry, numb ? It's all very unclear I have moments of happiness and thankfully I'm not suicidal at all but all of this is slowly getting to me and it's getting harder to deal with, most times i feel like I'm a burden to people and feel unwanted even by the slightest things, if anyone cares about what I'm saying it rattles me and I start shaking and talking faster, i have authority issues and basically have no power to say no to anyone .
I'm sorry this is too long i had to let it out somehow 💕"
37,Today I was in psychology class.,"I was taking my AP course in psychology today when my teachers started talking about kids that killed animals. When I was young kid, I killed four birds and various insects. I will not deny it I didn't feel bad when I did this as a kid. My teacher said that kids that did this as kids could have a type of mental disorder. Got me curious so I kept searching, it told me I could have sociopathic disorder. A lot of the symptoms are very aligned with myself specifically how I tend to shift my personality to get things from other. I may need to get this check but I don't know, I doubt I will ever hurt someone."
38,"My weird change, brain problems and I don't know what to do.","Hi. I'm 17 years old female and finally I decided to ask someone what's wrong with me. So basically my school starts in 5 hours (first day, second year). I feel tired but I don't want to sleep, because I know that when I go to sleep I will have to wake up and prepare. I haven't left my house in weeks. I gained weight and I stoped taking care of myself but today I finally washed my hair, brushed my teeth and planned that I will start again to exercise (did it for month in July).

Except this little problem I have more. I was wondering why I have problem with a memory. Like 4 years ago I suddenly started having strong depression episode. I cried a lot and did self-harm but that's different story. I don't know quite well when it had happened, but I'm having problems with concentration, understanding language, like what I am reading, meaning of words, grammar and stuff like that (never had this problems before - I was pretty good in school and learning was easy for me). I have also memory loss, and sometimes I need someone to tell me twice so I can copy that. I've lost ability to estimate, I can't really remember how those years had passed. 

My depression is gone (?) but at the same time I don't feel very well, I waste time on Internet when I want to do something productive. I can't cry anymore. When I compare my condition before - crying, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, histeria and not understanding what is happening to me, sometimes even a hallucinations - to present condition - empty, unconcerned, hopeless, some kind of calmness, neutrality etc. - seems weird. I forgot to mention that sometimes I feel kinda dissociated but not like that disorder, but more like I'm an observer through my eyes.

I'm not crying anymore like I said. I lost that ability long time ago, even when my family member died I didn't. Sometimes I even start laughing when I should be sad. 

Rarely, but sometimes I'm getting a superpower formed as a hope and en energy to create and dream about future

I kinda coped with all of that myself, psychologist only helped with my ""social-persona"" I like to call. I attended to therapy for year and a half, after my self-harm session my parents sent me to psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety neurosis (I don't really know how, because I had only 2 meetings with her). That's why I was sent to therapy. But anyway, I didn't talked very much about my mental problems. Got medications which helped me with sleep (my sleep was more solid, but I was insomniac so it didn't helped me quite tho).

I have problem with naming my emotions, I don't know what is love, happiness and all that stuff. I have a boyfriend, but I was concerned if I really love him. I always was the person that helped everyone, care about them, expecially when someone needed that help and couldn't ask for it. My empathy and will to help were so strong that I cared more about others than myself. Now I am more careful and less naive.

When I was having a mental breakdown and suicidal thought few moths ago I said to myself that I will be done when I finish helping my boyfriend with his life. I also planned to study geography and become scientist, but I have doubts if I could do that. I'm artist and want to create music, write a book, paint, discover so many things, but I can't find any motivation. Whatever I start I stop and can't finish or I'm very critical to things I create.

I am not good enough as a person. I hate myself and my life. I only feel like myself in those late evenings when I'm numb and overthink everything. Aside from that I'm pretending that nothing is happening and just ""survive to another day"" and go on.

I could talk about other symptoms I have, but there is so much that I don't really remember them and this post is too long. Anyway, if you are here, should I be worried? Can someone tell me what is wrong with me? I don't know what to do and even I don't know if I want to change that.."
39,TW: I'm not sure if I'm experiencing new symptoms or not :(,"Hello all. I can't afford therapy or to see a Dr at the moment. I was curious if this happens to anyone else.. i have PTSD, and i have been experiencing new symptoms. Im not sure if its related. 

At night sometimes, I get extremely paranoid. I feel like something or someone is going to hurt me, and that something bad is going to happen. I see human figures when lying in the dark and i panic. Itll last for over an hour till I become exhausted. I also get super dizzy, when I drive sometimes it feels like im driving drunk and turn around to go home. I fell a few weeks ago, its like my mind blanks for a second. I feel like everything is surreal. I have no idea what's going on :("

43,Childhood Schizophrenic turning 18,"My birthday is on the 24th. And I’ve always have had a hard time dealing with my birthday. “Passive” Suicidal ideation has been a major issue with my disorder. Where I’m in the gray area of wanting to die. Like I don’t want to die but who would want to live like this yk?!? But that can be universal. Usually people get a chance to see a pre schizophrenic version of themselves. And I never got that, never will. I’ve actually have found peace with that though. Not that I fully accept my diagnosis because I still have bits of doubt and thoughts of “I’m still just faking it” but I realize the universe doesn’t owe me an explanation as to why any of this happened at all. Honestly seeing my schizophrenia as neurodiversty has helped a tremendous amount. Schizophrenia is obviously one of the most stigmatized and demonized disorder to this day. And I can only speak from my experiences since schizophrenia presents so vastly for each individual case. But I’ve made a difference with myself when I think of my brain and neurology as something to be explored and understood and not something that is inherently demonic, broken and in need of fixing. My therapist suggested today I research more into the brain chemistry of someone with schizophrenia since I seem to be stuck on wondering how this came to be in the first place which is a loaded question I repeatedly ask myself. A lot of good progress when it comes to self acceptance. Tho I acknowledge two truths can coexist. Because while I actively work on my acceptance of disorder. I can’t help but feel as If I’m running out of time. I’ve always felt old and I think I attribute that to the schizophrenia it’s aged my mind up way pass numbers. But now I’m turning 18 and I’m forced to realize how behind I am. When I got diagnosed I was 15 and I dropped out to pursue treatment but my doctor who was working with me at the time moved. So I was left to find another treatment center that’d take me. But nobody would take me because of my age then it was my diagnosis. Then it was the fact that i had been experiencing it for more then 3 years. They only took cases that had just started showing signs and I’ve been showing signs since I was 5. I eventually found a therapist I liked and was comfortable with. And I’m still with her But she even knows she can only do so much for someone with schizophrenia. So she referred me to the first treatment center I heard of in my area that focuses on schizophrenia. But they didn’t take me because of my age again. But now I’m turning 18 and I get to reapply. I’m very honest and blunt about the fact that I’m frustrated and tired as it is. And no part of me wants to continue any of this but I will because I was always going to. And there’s no stopping me. I thought of positive rage today and I think I need to implement that more in my life. Yea this sucks and I’m angry and frustrated and tired. But I was lucky enough to come from love. And to be loved. And to BE love. Everything else is just noise along the way. I am
Going to be okay even if I don’t want that lmfao. I am going to find my way I am going to pave my path there’s no running from it. I will make this nowhere my home. And I will write about it till my hands get numb. Because tho the human language of words is limiting in ways beyond thought. I can atleast have a civil conversation with myself on paper to read and reread when I eventually feel that reoccurring loneliness that knows me better than most folks. And tho it’s another form of talking to myself so are dreams. I’m universal baby. And I feel least alone when I remember I am a whole being. YES, my ability of perceiving, thinking, and feeling is different from what you know but again that is UNIVERSAL. I am an experience that will die out might as well try to make peace with it."
44,I feel I am never doing enough...,"Hello everyone! This may be long it may not... I am unsure at this moment. I just wanna vent some!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so now onto the story:

I feel I am never doing enough... I always have this feeling of whatever I am doing is never enough. I could have worked for 10 hours doing heavy lifting helping people in need -- like I was just deployed to do -- but at the end of the day I always feel what I did was never enough. I get noticed for doing good at times but even still... I feel what I have done was not worth the notice because it was not enough... It is never enough. I could have helped 30 people in time of need and each and every one of them be grateful but even then... It does not feel enough. I always have this empty feeling because I always say ""I could have done more"" and ""that was not enough"". I could have been extremely exhausted while doing it and wanna give up because the amount of exhaustion I have... but at the end its still ""not enough"".

Example: I went on deployment for a week because of a natural disaster in X state. I helped a good twenty or thirty people and some of the jobs being major. I was exhausted and tired while doing it but always had this energy to go out and do more. We did more and more for a week straight. We did a lot of work by what others have been saying. I just feel like what I did was not enough to warrant the credit I got this one day. I got credit for doing hard work and before getting the award I was telling myself ""I should have done more. This was not enough. I gotta do more""... Then this award comes and I am shocked because I felt I genuinely did not do much of anything. I could get many people telling me I did positive actions and I will believe this but if anyone or even myself say ""you did good"" I will never believe it. I always have this empty feeling. Like what I did was good for others but to me not enough.

I get this feeling with literally everything. I can see a car accident and be like ""someone probably died"" but I would never think the damage is ""severe"" even though I know its not normal. It could be me saying a speech to my class for school and people telling me it was really good but I feel like I have always missed something and so it was not ""good enough"". I can see someone in a severe situation but I can never grasp onto the actual severity of said thing like shootings and or accidents, etc.. It does not need to be positive for me to feel like it was not that ""severe"" or like it was ""not enough"". 

Example: I see a car accident and this is said to be a very terrible accident. It could be said to be a accident unlike anything anyone has ever seen but to me... I have this weird feeling of ""well... I do not think this is *that* bad."". A example of a positive one would be like the previous. I see the impact it did on people but I still feel this feeling of ""this is not enough"" or ""this is not really *that* big of a deal"" or ""why are they so excited? I only did X thing"". It could be helping them clear their yard of debris from a storm or helping a older person cross the road. It could even be clearing a clustered area so that people who are handicapped could park in front of their home instead of a block away.

It is kinda demotivating for me because no matter what I do or see I always think of it as being ""light"" or ""not enough"" something severe is not really all that bad feeling to me and something very impactful feels very minor. I am unsure what it is or how to change. I want therapy but in my area I can not find any - they are all therapists that only work with you for like two weeks and then leave.

My family has been telling me how proud they are of me for volunteering to help others in need with a organization but to me it just feels like a minor thing. It does not feel ""impactful"". I am happy they are happy of what I am doing but I do not see the world like they do... and it makes me feel different. odd. off. abnormal... and I do not like it."

48,Finally getting help after a long battle,"Hi everyone!! I’ve struggled with waves of depression and anxiety for several years (around 17 to 24. Off an on). I hit one of my lowest points last night/this morning and finally spoke up to my family about needing to see a therapist and possibly a psychiatrist. 

This is something I never thought I’d be able to say. Telling my family I not okay always scared me. I’ve always been the “perfect” well rounded one and I’ve felt guilty for many years for having these emotions. 

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t terrified. I’m investing a lot of hope into this and I’m worried I won’t get anywhere. That’s my biggest fear. But I figure little breakthroughs are better than none."
49,Brunt out from everything,"Hi, 

Basically I’m a very big try hard. And I’m only saying this because everyone calls me that. We recently had trials at my school and for those who don’t know they are our last exams before our big big one which is the HSC. And I honestly feel burnt out and after receiving my marks I have been so u happy that it’s making me want to cry. Not that I haven’t already. I passed 4/6 of my courses and it’s annoying me because I gave my best effort. And it’s not that it’s just be out of the two courses I failed the class average was 40-30 and I was above it. 

My concerns lies, because I have a lot of parental pressure that I’m scared of telling them. My dad already commented last night and after that I wasn’t sure if I’d tell them. It’s just eating me alive tbh. I really wanna be able to score 90’s as an ATAR, but every thing seems far fetched right now. 

On top of that I was in top five for biology but now I’m top 10. The news shocked me.  Not trying to flex or anything. I’m genuinely scared. 

My entire motivation deflated ages ago. My current run is to make my parents happy, they keep pulling up reputation and how they’d me affected if I got a shit mark and I’m trying my hardest sometimes I feel like they don’t understand especially because there schooling system was different to mine. My dad always says that it was much harder for them. What annoys me is that his pressure is making me cry, and if I cried in front of him instead of comforting me he says it’s not the time to cry. 

I’m finding it extremely hard to cope, I have talked to my teacher just yesterday and even he said not to stress and that I’ll get into the University and ATAR i want. But I feel like he is only saying it to keep me at peace cause he knows I overload. He also stated that he knows that the pressure I’m under is immense and that if another student was to deal with that shit they would have been broken and that he doesn’t know how I deal with it. And I’m happy he understands but I’m just at a stage where I feel like a worthless loser who can’t get anything right. I can’t make everyone happy I can’t even make myself happy. I feel extremely lost and I don’t know how I’m gonna cope."
50,I can't get rid of the obsessive thoughts.,"When I told my dad about how I was feeling lately he's been treating me with a bunch of kind things to try and make me feel better. I didn't ask for it but he just keep insisting. So my sister think of me as the spoiled one, and that I'm just using my depression to get things. Earlier this week one of my sisters made a joke about not having to go to Mexico. She said ""just break or cut your arm so we don't have to go"" and my other sister pointed at me. It hurt that she thought of me that way. Someone with depression who cuts to get out of things or get what they want. I have been clean for about 2 weeks before she said that and now I can't stop thinking about starting again. I feel horrible. The feeling of feeling like I'm alone came back. I lost all motivation when she said that. I told her that my arms were clean and after she acted like nothing happened. I can't stop thinking about that and I just want to cry.  I have been feeling great but when she said that it brought me down, it feels like I'm at my lowest point again."

52,My mom got pissed at me and im angry but i also feel bad.,"My moms been hammering and getting mad at me for months to the point of me crying over my choice of university. I chose one out of state because my friend goes there and i like their programs. Due to costs (live in US) i couldnt attend this year. Mom got mad at me again, saying my degree choice will not pay my bills. And it hurt. It made me mad. Because my mom is a woman who at 18 moved to england to live with friends she met online in the 90s, went through so much strife, and yet has a job she loves and a home. A car, a phone, and family that loves her. I take a look at her life and think ""if she can do it, i can do it."" 
She got pissed about how much debt i would be in. I said that i think she came out okay. She BLEW UP talking about her debt and how it would be okay if she didnt have rent or pets or kids to pay for. I apologized. It hurts that i hurt her feelings, but it also hurts that she doesnt believe ill be okay in the end."
53,Nothing feels real,"I've been fine my entire life but something clicked this month and I'm having longer and longer dissasociative episodes. Nothing feels real. I'm starting to forget how I felt when I was ""normal"". Now that I think about it, I don't know how I felt before. I'm afraid I'll never be able to look at the world in the same way."

55,I need to stop comparing myself to my younger brother,"I'm the oldest child in my family (26). I work from home, in a job that doesn't really have an hourly wage or annual salary. I guess that's the trade off of having flexible work. 

I have a younger brother, he's three years younger than I am. This fall, he'll be taking a placement for a job in IT, basically school where he'll be getting paid. This is something he really wants to do. 

I meanwhile, have not found what I'd like to do yet. I feel like I'm in danger of becoming my family's black sheep. And I feel like my worth will be tied to how much money I make, and it feels like he may make more. 

I realize this isn't a healthy way to view life. That is why I'm asking for advice on how to deal. Thank you."
56,I need help with closure,"Country: Guatemala

So, I've been struggling lately with some issues and I would like some suggestions about how to bring closure and move forward.

I (36M) was in a relationship for 3 years that ended with her cheating on me. This hit hard since I completely fell for this girl and helped her on her own family struggles (without giving too much info, she had it really bad). At the time of the harsh break up, she intended me to continue being present in her life, and expected me not to find out about her cheating on me for the longest time possible. We were already been talking (prior to the break up) into moving in together and settle down, so this one really hit hard on me.

I was in therapy for unrelated reasons (I noticed that I had a behavioral change while at work and I wanted to address it for me to get better) and I continued when all this situation unfolded.

The whole breakup and everything has been ongoing for almost a year now, and I would like to move forward, but I've been having problems to do so due to the fact that I have been constantly thinking on her. Don't get me wrong, I've had enough improvement for me not to be in a continual state of insomnia, anxiety, fear, etc. The way I see it is that I've already move past the point where I loath myself to the point where I want to just move forward and start being happy once more.

My therapist (God bless her soul) has given me really good advice and I've never expected to get out of the dark place where she left me (and for anyone reading that's in a similar place in their life, it does get better with time and the right help) but this last bit of the road has been the hardest of them all because of the aforementioned reasons. I've relied on getting out with friends, and having my mind occupied by playing video games. Both of these have lost its appeal (or rather its effectiveness) as COVID's lockdown has made everyone I know unable to get out and video games aren't simply cutting it.

Now, I would like to know, do you have any tips or suggestions on how I can finally put the final nail in the coffin of what happened to me and completely move forward? How can I finally get my brain to let her go (like, make my subconscious understand that she will no longer be in my life as she decided that I wasn't worth even a clean breakup)?

Thanks for any help you can provide.

P.S. I've been thinking on writing a journal and use meditation to try to handle this, but I don't know if it would be a good idea."
57,How do I help my brother accept his bipolar diagnosis?,"My 23 year old brother has been diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia disorder but he’s in denial. He has a history of abusing alcohol and has tried cocaine before. He has self harm tendencies when he has an episode of rage. He will try to literally split his head open. 

My parents try hard to help him but I feel like they enable him more than help him. My dad pays for everything and my mother basically raised his son before his mother decided to leave him due to abuse. My nephew is nonexistent in my brothers life now and my brother seems like he’s not interested in being in his life. It’s really sad that I don’t get to see my nephew. 

I feel like a way to help my brother is to get him to accept his diagnosis. I have no idea how to do this. I am a Registered nurse but nothing in school could prepare me for this. I love my brother. Please help. My advice is appreciated."
58,One-sided Conversationalist complains of no one wanting to speak to him,"Can anyone help me understand my father-in-law? Some say he's mildly autistic, some say narcissistic, some say it's from his head injury, and some say it's because he uses and is never really sober. You can't talk to the guy. It's like his brain is incapable of stopping and listening to other people talking to him. He doesn't show interest in having relationships or connections with people. But sometimes laments about relationships he never formed with his grandkids. He group texts random thoughts to us, but doesn't respond back if I reply. He doesn't want to hold a back and forth conversation. He just wants to say what he wants to say, have you hear it and that's it. It's not for me. But I'd like to understand why he's like this."
59,Memory Impairment Tests?,"I’m scared I have a problem with my memory. I’m apprehensive of talking about this with my therapist, as I know there are a lot of tests involved. Are drug tests one of which? Thank you."
60,"I was taking a drug that helps but now I have to quit, what do I do?","I was taking a drug that really helped me out during this pandemic but the side effects are too much and I have to quit.

61,I’m depressed but I don’t even have the will to get better or do anything about it,"If there was a magic pill that would cure me I’d obviously take it, but I’ve given up. Don’t know if ever really tried in the first place. So if I know this about myself whats the point of going to therapy if I know I’m not willing to put in the effort? The insights are interesting sure but I just feel like a massive time waste. I don’t want to change, not because I don’t want to get better but because change is just too fucking hard and I don’t give a fuck about anything anymore. People can just do whatever. I just sit and wait around to die. Not proud of myself but putting in the work to become who I want to be? I won’t even take my meds when they are right in front of me. For absolutely no reason other than that I genuinely don’t care about myself or anything much at all. 

Maybe if I had a husband/kids relying on me I’d be motivated enough to get better for their sake (though I’m probably just saying this to make me feel better about myself, who knows if it’s true?) 

I know this not how I SHOULD think. I know that’s “irrational” and I’m not proud of it. I know it’s my own fault and I do not feel sorry for myself. I’m just tired of pretending it’s not how I feel just because I’m not supposed to feel this way. 

As unsatisfied as I am and as much as I kind of hate myself, I’m too tired, too lazy. I don’t even feel like I have a choice about feeing this way, it’s just what it is. Whatever."
62,My Insta reflects when I started losing my happier side.,"I was scrolling through my Insta feed, looking fondly on my old photos from Fall of 2016 - Current day and I noticed something interesting...my insta post show when I started losing a lot of happiness in my life and became more depressed. 

From the Fall of 2016 until about Spring 2018, I was doing awesome in my life. I had a great partner, awesome friends, was enjoying school , exercising and just overall feeling great. During that time I would post goofy, funny and fun pictures on my insta, with longer captions that were also similar. 
Things changed in 2018 from a few events, and I starting feeling very low in my life. Now I was depressed in 2014/2015 as well, but then it was a lot of crying , binge eating and feeling sorry for myself. This was becoming something different. I was more numb and didn’t care about anything anymore and just do not feel much joy in life. 

Anyway, my insta post since then are much more to the point, and have a line of two of caption. There’s no extra thought, or any jazz in it like it used to have. I couldn’t even imagine how I would try to post something like I did back a few years ago now.  

But currently I’m in therapy, and trying some new things to hopefully help me get my spark back to life. I just wanted to share a random thing about me that I noticed this evening."
63,Why do I feel so lonely,"I’m a 20yr female, I have a 2yr old daughter and I wait tables as a part time job. I’m living with my mom, my sister (26) and her daughter who’s 3. I know I’m not alone just feel lonely inside, I feel so isolated from the world, I have no friends, I never go out or do anything Bc I always have my daughter And I don’t have a car so I hate asking people to pick me up. All I do is go to work and come home take care of my daughter go to bed and start all over the next day. I have no hope in finding someone who will truly love me for who I am Bc there’s a lot prettier girls out there and My personality is unique, I’m a pretty shy person at first so it’ll take a special someone to break that barrier to get to know me. I just feel so awkward with myself, idk what to do to make myself feel better."

65,Why does it feel like everyone feels sad when I feel sad?,"I have been having relapses for the past few days, why do I see the world full of sad people suddenly? Is there scientific explanation for this?"
66,I'm (20) feeling better now after dealing my anxiety but someone came back.,"A month ago I've been dealing with my anxiety badly. One thing that also triggered me was the guy I dated for like 5 months. Everythings really good. He's been understanding. I sometimes treating him like a crap or me showing an awful attitude. He never gets mad. Although I feel like he is mad but he never upfront about it.

Tbh, I was diagnosed with depression during highschool. I was seeing my family doctor for a theraphy once a week (currently not anymore) I'm aware the fact that I'm not capable to handle complicated/confusing situation or being emotionally in pain/distress.. The last few weeks were rough. He didn't do anything but his presence in my life was making me feel insecure, like I'm nothing and I was scared anytime he would probably ghost me. I'm never pushy. Whenever he's like out of contact or I could received late replies I never asked him why because I don't wanna be the clingy one. 

Something happened I didn't text him for like two or three days then I just text him again as if nothing happened I didn't apologized. After that I thought we're all going fine, cause I just came over to his house. I would text him in the morning and he would reply me at night which I'm already asleep. That was the routine for like two days then he got completely vanished. I tried to move on. I decided to focus on myself now. I'm really doing great cause I feel better. I could breath. I'm not throwing up anymore whenever anxiety attack because I haven't experiencing it anymore. Everything is really better.  


Two weeks I've been good. BUT, He texted me back all of a sudden that he is sorry that he got busy with school.

What should I do?

TL: The guy I dated triggered my anxiety the last few weeks we've been dating. Every night I throw up or cry because I'm so confuse with everything. I'm aware the fact that I'm not capable of handling emotional distress situation. When he didn't respond, I didn't bother to text. I decided to focus on myself again. But all of a sudden, he texted me. What do you think I should do?"
67,I want to call an ambulance to pick me up and admit me..,Idk 2hat to do but I am suicidal and I have been clean from self harm for about 6 months now.. my life is falling apart and I just want to admit myself.. but I'm scared.. and I feel like my family wont understand or like I'm in no place to do so..
68,Help!!,"Ever since I was 7 I began having symptoms of OCD I think. I'd have to touch things a certain number of times to feel safe or I'd convince myself that my family will die or God will send me to hell or kill me. I convince myself of crazy things and fantasize about going on adventures or just making up cool characters to cope. I'm adopted and my mom found a noose in my room I think and did nothing about it. My dad has also caught a razor in my room and know I self harmed before and just asked me to give it back without asking why I had it. Iive been to a mental hospital before but only for like two weeks. They seem to ignore any signs of depression which I even told them I was depressed they just said it's because I don't talk to anyone. I don't fucking know what to do anymore. They ignore everything. They don't care. I don't really see any point of living, no one seems to care about my mental health and I've even been told to kill myself once by a family member."
69,"Got into really great shape lately, but it is having horrible mental health consequences...","So background is that I had an awful childhood. Grew up in an abusive, neglectful household. Was forced to take care of my siblings (who I didn't have a good relationship with either) and not allowed out of the house much (greatly inhibited any friendships). Parents always fought and had to deal with a severely disabled child who made the household a living hell.

I was always a pretty chubby kid 5'11 200 at my biggest.  I was never popular in school either. Was kinda weird from my lack of socialization and being gay was a kicker.

Anyways, once I became an adult and hit college... I excelled. I became SGA President at my school at one point and am months away from finishing my master's degree. I still struggle to make friends and have health problems that have hindered my sex life some (though I am trying haha) but am in a much better life situation.

During COVID, I had more time to myself and capitalized on this from going from a ""skinny-fat"" build to an extremely toned/cut body type (Down to 135). I have hated my body for years and now I love it...too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Not having anyone who cared about me as a kid means that now I use my body to get attention all the time. I have gotten really bold about what I post on social media almost like I want to get in trouble with what I post because it would get me more attention? I know 100% it comes from never having built self-esteem and still having close to none. This would be fine if I was 14, but as a 23 YO young professional, it scares the shit out of me knowing my mind is so desperate for this.

Any advice (IK I need counseling and will try to get it at some point)?"
70,I cannot understand why my mind works the way that it does.,"I'm in my last year of school and today was the first day back from summer. Completely virtual. But the minute the day ended, it was like this huge wave of anger and sadness and fear hit me. I've always had problems with school. I have skipped school a lot in the past because the stress just always felt like too much for me. It makes me wonder how others have been able to keep up, or maybe it just isn't such a big deal for them as it is for me-- and why I can't work like them. 

I moved to U.S., a few years ago and so my first year here, I was able to go to school continuously for a short bit without any skipping, but my problem started again in the second semester of that year, and since then it has just been getting worse. I just feel like I cannot keep up with the work. It's not even like it's a lot, but I don't know why I am not able to take it easily. My anxiety has been worsening and I feel like I'm just a few more steps away from getting a full blown panic attack. 

I think that I'm depressed. I have absolutely no interests in anything, I don't sleep good, I have a really low self-esteem, there are a lot of irritation and anger problems, and my appetite fluctuates a lot-- I could eat just one meal or snack a day or I can end up eating a lot.  My mind is just empty most of the day and lately I've been questioning my life.

I want to see a psychologist or a therapist but my family always makes me feel guilty for thinking of seeing one because they tell me that they would say the same things that my family is telling me, which is to get up, go to school, and repeat and that there's no escaping that and it's just how life works. I got, literally, one 'B' last year, and my family still finds ways to taunt me about it and they know how much I struggle with keeping up with school considering I used to skip a lot before quarantine. I had skipped the whole one week right before it was announced that my school would be closing down for the rest of the year. 

I cannot afford to see a doctor on my own either. I will turn 18 in less than two weeks, but I'm not sure if that opens up any kind of options for me. I want to get a job so that I can get away from my family, because they've been a huge part of my problems since I can never please them and they have expectations that I could never fulfil, but I don't know if I'm in a state where I could maintain a job and be consistent with it, unlike school.

I feel so helpless and I don't know what to do. Everyday, my mind seems to be getting just a bit more crazier. I don't know what I'm asking here for either-- maybe it's just a vent. I'm terrible at expressing myself and I don't know if I was able to say what I wanted to in here, but thank you for reading. I would appreciate it if you had any advice for me either, but thank you either way!"

72,Random announcement I felt the need to make,"I’m not sure if this fits the sub but um
The credits theme from that Pixar short “Loop” sounds like the music form of that autism friendship euphoria"
73,I can’t control my emotions lately,"This mainly involves problems from one of my best friends from college, let’s call him Evan. Evan and I became pretty good friends pretty fast when we met. He was a very cool guy and was someone who seems to always be down for anything. What caught my eye when i met him though was he was so extremely hot, and there’s a certain feminine side to him that made me think just maybe he might be gay. But if not he’s a great friend nonetheless. Turns out he’s not, but i kind of couldn’t shake the small feelings i had for him away; but they’re nothing drastic. I love my guy friends and all my close friends are straight males, i’m not the flamboyant type i just like a good bromance with the bro’s. Adding to that however, i sometimes accidentally fall for my guy friends. I don’t want to! I keep trying to shake it and shake it but it just doesn’t fucking work. I hate it because i just want to be normal, one of the guys, shit like that, but sometimes you accidentally fall for people and you can’t help it. Ive beat myself over the head with this shit for as long as i could remember. Ive never had a boyfriend because mainly all the guys I fall for are my straight friends, and sometimes it causes complications. It’s made me depressed, i always feel like i have to walk on eggshells with myself about what i do or say in front of my friends because i don’t want them to get the wrong idea. Anyway, flashback to Evan. He’s a great fucking guy, ambitious, strong, tall, beautiful hunk of a man - never seen someone more perfect in my life - and we’re good friends. Flash forward some time and I see him less and less because he gets a girlfriend. Luckily it’s one of those friendships you can go not talking to for a while and then act like nothing happened when you do. Anyway toward covid and everything i see him a bit more and he goes back home in another state, i miss him a lot. I’m a type of guy to miss people a lot, i care for my friends. But with him... i missed more than normal. He comes back down a few weeks later and stays with his girlfriend for the rest of the spring school year and i come visit them as they come visit me. But every time i saw him it wasn’t just him anymore, it was him and his girl. Not that I have a problem with it but I want that 1:1 bro time sometimes. On top of that, every time I saw them it made me depressed as it does now. They’re a cute couple and that’s something i’ve never had. In due time I started to really actually fall for him. I started to think about him constantly, wait for his next text, call, anything - and since he’s a guy who sucks at texting or calling it made me hurt more. I know he’d never love me the same way, but I still just wanted to talk to him but also not annoy. I hate how, every time I hang with them it makes me sad. I feel kind of like a third wheel although they see us like a friendly trio. I see him loving her and no one loving me. I don’t want to like him, i want him as my friend and that’s it, but my fucking mind won’t let that change. I want to be normal and not like guys, i want to be one of the bro’s, why the fuck do i have to live like this all the time always a prisoner in my own emotions. What do I do? Sorry this was kind of ranty; my thoughts are everywhere. If any clarification is needed lmk in the comments. 

tl;dr: Im gay and I hate it. I want to be one of the bro’s. One of my best friends is a cool dude; my bro. We hang a lot. I fall for him. I don’t want to. He gets a girlfriend. I get jealous. I don’t know how to cope. Seeing them together makes me sad. Fuck the gay life."
74,Can someone please give me real advice?,[removed]
75,Looking for advice,"I don’t know if I’m in a situation to seek out help or not but let me know if anyone has had similar experiences or has advice. I have had always had some anxiety I guess. I don’t know if it’s more or less than usual because I feel like everyone experiences it. Though, In the past two years or so, I’ve begun to think something else is happening here. I don’t want to diagnose myself by any means because I know that’s a serious claim to make, but I’m starting to think I have a personality disorder such as NPD. I love to be the center of attention when with other people and monopolize conversations when possible, and eventually I start to realize I’m an asshole and isolate myself for a few days to a week. Then I’m back at it again. It’s a shitty feeling. I also can’t take much criticism but give it out freely (obviously unwarranted). I am obviously aware of these behaviors and tell myself to stop acting that way, but I continue to do so. I don’t know if these behaviors are out of the ordinary or if I’m over analyzing normal behavior. I also notice a trend of meeting friends, loving the time I spend with them, then dropping them after 2-3 years. I find it hard to reach out to people and maintain contacts with old companions. I also have sometimes severe health anxiety which probably cripples me a few hours, one/two days a week.  Let me know if this is normal or I should be concerned! I am anxious about my physical health more so than mental but at this point I’m more concerned about my mental health affecting me physically which has brought me here."
76,Everything is too fucking loud I can't stand it.,"Any time I look at anything now its like a celebrity is canceled for one reason or another with waves of people telling them how they're horrible I can't go a day without hearing some bullshit about cops or racism or cultural appropriation. Everyone is so offended about everything and its too loud. My best friend keeps talking to me about another pedophile in Hollywood and I know I should feel something but I only feel annoyed to be hearing about it again, I know ""imagine how the kids feel being abused"" I get it it sucks but I go on the internet to read interesting gbjistory facts and get away from the things that are wrecking my depression but that's really hard when the things wrecking me are always being talked about. I just want everything to be quiet again. I want a little controversy here and there but every single day I just can't deal with it and its not even focused on me I don't even know what's wrong with me but everything precovid was good but everything after is just negative after negative and the media eggs it on. I just want to go to sleep."
77,How can I turn off this anxiety,"Please help! I need serious advice

There is a group of people at my college who have never particularly been fond of me. One student even took the time out of his day to tell me he would pick out my insecurities one by one if I didn’t stop “talking shit about him” aka expressing my fear and irritation about him having gatherings and meeting strangers on dating apps. 

I go to a university and I am doing everything I can to have us not shut down, as a junior in college I am preparing for my senior year and the importance that comes along with that. As a singer it is ESSENTIAL for my training to be in person. Despite the current global pandemic I was aware that these people have been partying. But have not said anything, I have told friends about my irritation but nothing beyond that. 

This past Friday there was a party thrown, admits this pandemic... I was informed of the party but did nothing to report, or retaliate against this group of people. 

Saturday morning I woke up to a conversation between my roommate and the student who had accused and attacked me earlier this summer stating that they think it was me who reported then even though I didn’t, I don’t care enough about them to do that it’s not my problem (even though I should care bc they’re putting the community in danger) but IT WAS NOT ME... I think I would remember calling our schools public Saftey and reporting a bunch of people. 

I messaged the student defending my innocence and he said “okay I believe you” but in the past this student has been aggressive and has threatened me socially. These kids know that I smoke weed and sometimes party NOT DURING A PANDEMIC THO... I’m scared they’re going to try to ruin my life. How should I proceed to protect myself if their behavior becomes aggressive or gossipy? I’m afraid these kids are going to tell the school I have sold an edible to another student or smoked at a party... I am having so much fear and anxiety i can’t sleep. I just need a reality check like a reminder and help on what I can do.

Please help"
78,I feel like I'm being to losing on all fronts,"I am a 22M pakeha Masters student studying Educational Psychology.  
I've been very fortunate, I've achieved every goal I've set in life, and by all measures am doing well. I completed a double major in Education and Psychology, averaged an A-. Got a job as an early intervention therapist, and got accepted into a MEdPsyc programme at age 21 and averaged an A in the first semester. I also work a second job as a supervisor at a swimming school. I have been in a successful relationship and live with my partner who I've been with for coming up five years. But I'm beginning to lose. 

In the Early intervention job I'm not producing the results I should be, and I am now under a lot of pressure from supervisors to perform better. I feel like a failure, all other therapists have achieved far more than I have and have bonded far better than I at work, I feel like an outsider, and the only reason I'm still there is because they've invested so many resources into me that's it'd be a huge waste to let me go now. I know get super anxious before every session, and it's making it harder to perform.  

I also feel like I've entirely lost feelings for my partner, we've been through troughs before and it's nothing to do with her, but this has lasted longer than it normally does and it's making me far less happy. I constantly fantasize about what it'd be like to be with someone else. 

With regard to my masters, because of all the stress, I've been putting off work until I absolutely have to do it so that I can relax for a day before I have to meet more deadlines. The masters' programme I'm in leads into an Educational Psychology internship, which is extremely selective, I have the grades to get in- and as it's a female-dominated field, being male and an early intervention therapist makes me a prime candidate, but failure or resignation in my role as an early intervention therapist would entirely tank my chances.   
I no longer give a flying fuck about the swimming school job and sent in my resignation letter two days ago. 

Because of all this, I have been drinking way too much and taking way to many drugs every weekend, I've started smoking- which I have to hide from my partner, and I feel like I could meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder, and possibly depression.

81,What is wrong with me,"i’m 17f and i think there is something genuinely wrong with me. Ever since i was around 14 or 15 i’ve started to become completely disassociated from the world. i can’t feel anything most of the time and when i do it’s usually a strong strong strong amount of sadness or anger. I feel like a drone. and quarantine has both made it worse and helped me realize how bad it is. i feel stuck in my own head most of the day. I don’t think i’m depressed, i go to work, hang out with family, walk and play and hang out with my dog who is my best friend. But also along with the not feeling real my eyesight always feels blurred, like the world is just hazy. what is wrong with me? i’m scared, and tired of feeling so out of touch, numb, and hopeless. 

I also was wondering if this is normal: i can’t remember any memories unless something sparks it. I can’t randomly think of memories, especially in the last 2 or 3 years. and when i do it’s pretty hazy."
82,Boyfriend has OCD. How do I help him during attacks?,"My boyfriend has OCD. Trying to help him cope.

TL;DR - Boyfriend with mild OCD had first severe attack last night, wondering how I should be responding when this happens. 

My boyfriend is 18 years old. We’ve been extremely close for 2.5 years, dating for a year and half. He was diagnosed with OCD when he was very little, but it was always very mild and sometimes even nonexistent, according to him and his mom. Last night he had what seemed like a severe OCD attack for the first time since I met him and I barely knew how to help him. I feel so bad. How can I help him in the moment? I know that treatment is important and we may look into medication if this persists, but how do I help him and deescalate while it’s happening?

If it helps, the attack he had was because he was cleaning/reorganizing his room (not because of OCD - he just needed to tidy up) and he was organizing his pens. Suddenly he was panicking saying he couldn’t do it right and he kept rearranging them over and over, getting increasingly distressed. He kept doing it for around ten minutes until he managed to “fix it”. He’s usually really grounded so I wasn’t sure how to respond. I tried to hold him and I spoke soothingly saying that it was okay and that nothing bad would happen if he didn’t fix the pens. He said he wouldn’t be able to sleep if he felt that things were “wrong” so I just stayed with him and said, like, affectionate/calming things until he managed. After he had organized it correctly, he said it was still bothering him and he kept fidgeting with the pens for a while. 

I really want to support him in difficult times. Hated seeing him so upset, and I don’t have OCD or know anyone else with it so I’m not sure what I should and shouldn’t say. Any help is appreciated."

I’ve started seeing things out of the corners of my eyes, but there’s nothing there. I’m fine in every other room of the house, but not my bedroom. I have NEVER gotten this paranoid over nothing! What would cause this sudden onset of paranoia?? Could it be a new symptom of one of my disorders?"
84,Do things really get better?,"I’m 17 and I just feel like I’ve been dealt the worst luck possible. It feels like my life has been cycle after cycle of emotional abuse from my mother, culminating in her kicking me out, while my dad, also a victim of her abuse, worked in another country. I was also molested on a weekly basis by a horse riding instructor when I was 11-13. I was hospitalised in January because my grandma had found a suicide note in my room while I was at a debating competition. My dad’s business has been ruined, which has caused him to have a mental breakdown a little over a week ago. I had to rip blood thinners out of his hands as he attempted to OD. I’m back to living with my grandparents. 

I don’t know if I’m venting or really looking for an answer. Everyone tells me things will get better. There are good things in my life, and I appreciate them - I’m a good student, I’m politically active and do a lot of work in my community, and I live in a good area so have been afforded privileges that others don’t have. I’m grateful for all of this and try to look for the good in my life but it just feels like so many bad things happen all the time. Everyone always tells me that things will get better. Do they really? When? I’m just a kid, I don’t know how I’m meant to make things better. I try my hardest but I feel like every time I try to get up I’m beaten back down. I’m semi-functional at worst, although there are some days where I can’t even get out of bed. I just feel so alone all the time. I go to therapy but it’s provided by the government so due to end soon. We haven’t got the money to continue doing it. I don’t even know if I can afford university. It’s always been my dream to go, and I’m applying for the best schools in my field, but it all feels like it’s a useless charade. 

And the worst part is that I feel like such a dick for complaining about this. I feel like I should just weather it all. I also know that’s illogical and that my feelings aren’t invalid, etc etc. There’s some disassociation between what I know is logical and healthy and what I know is affecting me negatively. But there’s no recourse, no break. Whenever I think things will get better, they get worse. I don’t want to live my life like that, but I also don’t want to die. I feel so hopeless all the time. 

I’m sorry for making this so long. I don’t know if this is the right sub or anything. I just didn’t know who to talk to or what to say."
85,need help!!,"so i’ve never had any experience with this, and i don’t currently have access to my therapist or a doctor. i don’t want to self diagnose but i think i’d feel a bit more comfortable if someone had similar experiences and had advice. basically i can’t tell what was a dream and what wasn’t but my body would lock up every time i closes my eyes and i’d have to fight hard for like 30 seconds to move but then my eyes would shut again and the process would repeat over and over and i’d randomly go into dreaming and out each time i locked up and to wake up i’d have to use all my energy into kicking my legs then the rest of my body please help!"

87,"28(F), sinking fast.","I feel like my life is already over. In the beginning of the quarantine I moved back with my family of five. We got along fine but then resentments built up and my siblings and I had a terrible fight, which resulted in me leaving and coming back to the city I'm based in for work. It's been over a month to the fight and it still hurts because they called me a loser, and they're right. I'm single, my last relationship ended because the logistics didn't work out, I don't know how to meet someone during this pandemic. I haven't gone to grad school yet, couldn't get in and I feel like I'm too old to go now. My career was great before the pandemic but right now, because of a slowdown it's all in a limbo as well. I feel hopeless and lost on most days. I'm trying to motivate myself but I just can't get anything done. I feel like my life is always going to be this shitty and I'll never be able to get out of this city and go out into the world, travel abroad, find love.

88,Where can I get quality counseling PhD level if I am uninsured? TN,"I have my Masters

The field doesnt matter

It does include counseling Psychology 

I am well read

But my situation is complex 

I am middle age

I am atheist 

I do not qualify for medicaid, medicare or disability 

I dont qualify for sec 8 or low income housing

Please if you suggest something, check it out before you do.

I get the ""call 211"" a lot and that is bogus

I've called sliding scale places, and they sound young or less informed.

Culturally they would not relate to me because I am middle age, unmarried, born in NJ, and am in the South, stuck, broke, no work, need a hysterectomy that I cant get because I need housing post op care.

I need money to get an apartment in order to work and then have my surgery. No employer will let me work then take time off for a surgery. Employer health plans are costly to use. My savings is gone, so how would I afford no income during a post op recovery period

Never mind its not possible 

Cant get surgery without housing

Need a job to get housing"
89,Am I depressed?,"So I think I'm depressed but I'm doubting it. So my day will go like this I get up do what I need to do for the day then I just sit on my phone for the rest of the day then at night I start to think of how worthless and how much of a burden I am and go to bed. And knowing that doubting if you have depression is a symptom makes me more confused. But at the same time I don't want to waist peoples time helping me, if I don't need the help."

The past few weeks I've found myself just smiling to myself like an idiot, and I eventually just start crying/laughing. Happened in my car today while working. I try to analyze the thoughts I have during this but really there are none. I just start to get this super excited/happy feeling that leads to me just crying and laughing. It feels cathartic kind of, it's a lot of emotion to experience in contrast to the overall numbness I've felt the past few years."
92,Are less experienced therapists necessarily bad? How to know?,I finally grew up the courage to make an appointment. I called up a clinic in Dhaka and set an appointment for an assessment.

93,"I might have ""autophobia"", which is the fear of being alone, meaning I cannot stay single...","Hello everyone,

I am a 24y old female and was before married for 2 years and for 7 years in a relationship. Broke up/divorced because he cheated on me. I have been in a new relationship for over 2 months now...but I am not sure of loving this person. I have tried breaking up with her 2 times already and I keep coming back and she keeps taking me, even though I am not sure of loving her. The first time that I broke up I had the worst panic and anxiety attacks because I felt lonely and saw myself alone and unloved...Before meeting her I was single for \~9 months, and it was a living hell. It got so bad that I had to call the help hotline. The second time it was the same...there was a moment when I thought I was going to die. I am considering therapy. Does anyone have experience? I know that I should solve this issue so that I do not depend on people...but I think the fact that I am alone in a country with my family being far away is contributing a lot to this since I've got nobody here.

What should I do? Exposure therapy would basically destroy me because I've got nobody except friends."
94,My mom says I choose to be sad,[removed]
95,Am I depressed?,"So I have been having a lot of concerns with my mental health lately. I realized some feelings I had weren't normal and could be associated with metal health problems (mainly depression). I decided to take to Google and multiple tests said I was mildly-severly depressed. I wanted a final answer before talking out about it, so I'm turning to reddit. About 2 years ago I noticed how sad and unmotivated I was getting. I wasn't exactly sure why, but it didn't concern me enough to look into it. My happiness kept decreasing and more problems in my life started to overwhelm me. In 2019 I was at an all time low. I didn't feel like ever getting out of bed, I hardly ate, I began hating how I looked, acted, and much more. Thats when horrible thoughts flooded in. I wanted to end my life more and more with each day coming, and I started hurting myself too. Scratching my wrists and legs until I bled became normal, and thoughts of leaving the world became more appealing. This continued on until the end 2019. In 2020 I felt less stress and the suicidal thoughts seemed to be less common. I still often hurt myself and struggled with accepting how I looked, but things seemed to get better. Until one friend, one person, one comment, had ruined it. The friend knew all about my problems, and I often complained to her about them. But in early 2020, she texted me one thing before cutting me out completely. She said ""You'll never be good enough. I don't care about your problems, just give up."" I couldn't handle it. Again, I spiraled down into my emotion madness. That's were I am today. Now the question is, am I just sad or is this something I need to talk about? I've always been taught that because I'm young I cant be depressed, I'll be sad for a bit then feel better. I live in good conditions and have a caring family yet I feel distant and get horrible thoughts. Should I be concerned or just grow up and stop being such a baby?

96,Anxiety question,"For people who actually know about mental illness or even have it, what symptoms does anxiety show and at what point should I see a doctor about it"
97,I need help... please... I'm very lost,"Sorry if this vents a little bit I'm new here by the way.

I just needed to get something off my chest her someone to hear me... I've kind of discovered how hard covid has hit me. I was laying in my bed and was thinking about my mental health. And as I stared more I could see the cracks. Now I can't discredit my girlfriend she's helped a lot. but I keep carrying on like this. I'm not thinking of committing suicide or anyting I just need someone to hear me to hear my voice.  To be honest I was in a pretty bad place... I have no social contact other than my mother, my girlfriend, and my grandparents.  I feel trapped like I have nowhere to go. I'm trapped in my room every day waking up the exact same four walls. I'm dreading School my classmates are less than let's just say the best. I'm basically in solitary confinement other than the occasional trip to the store. Helping out my grandparents, or the occasional trip outside my room for some food.  (Which I got into a little bit of a problem with earlier tonight but I'll get to that.) I have no social contact outside of the three people I mentioned, and maybe discord and Twitter but but other than those three people, no human faces. Because of my severe lack of social contact I started getting more depressed. I can see the cracks in my persona of mr. Nice guy who can help everyone. When someone asks me to do something I can feel this twinge of anger, and hatred, and rath building up inside of me. But I push it down and put on a fake smile asking what's up what do you need me to do. I've noticed that then more and more someone asks me to do something the worse and worst my feelings get, and the more they start building up and getting worse. I fear that I'm eventually going to reach your breaking point. Not to mention I'm going back to school which I'm terrified about. Because of my emotional state I fear that my breaking point will come with one of my classmates. Not to mention I've had anger issues and homicidal thoughts in the past. Pretty severe homicidal thoughts to the point of me making a plan, and very much contemplating killing someone. I feel like I'm getting more fragile and the slightest little tap on the glass will make it break. Not to mention let's just say my classmates are less than ideal... Basically oblivious to their actions and severely juvenile and incredibly annoying. But with all of that with fear and anxiety I isolate myself more. That comes with depression, and depression comes with stress eating and stress eating comes with well weight gain. I'm not too much of a fan of my figure right now I've tried dieting along with everything else. Though unfortunately tonight I got to the point of contemplated cutting off my food supply entirely, and just relying on exercise and water to sustain me... Borderline Anorexia. I just, with all of this coming towards me. With school me being terrified of going to school hoping to God that I don't brake and try attempted murder. Along with contemplating cutting off my food supply and everything else. I'm lost I need help I don't know what to do. I want to find people just like me with my own interests and everything else... But I don't know where to start. As well because of covid-19, I can't go out and meet people and join clubs and stuff. So yeah I'm lost. and it doesn't help my mind is going to bad places. I've stared into the void for too long and it's stared back, not only that it's pulled me right back in and I'm feeling like I'm drowning. So please I need help I just need someone to listen to me... to give me advice... please... I'm begging and pleading with anyone who reads this please just give me advice I kind of need it right now..."
98,not sure whats happening,"im a US marine and am most likely at my lowest point in life. a girl i cared very very deeply for has left me not too long ago and my aunt whom i was very close with passed away 2 days later. lately ive been feeling like im losing my mind in a weird way. im drinking much more than i usually do and ive been making reckless decisions. things feel like they dont really matter anymore. im constantly angry, i dont bother listening to music anymore and i just dont care about anything anymore.  every day work drops a new stress on me and i dont feel the urgency to care about it anymore. i feel like im just sort of drifting through the days. i dont know how to talk about things or vent even though i suppose im doing that now. but i know how depression feels and this cant be it. i still have an appetite and i still keep up with my fitness, my mind and myself just doesn't feel like its all there. i was hoping to see what my problem is here on reddit in fear that i could lose my job if i saw someone on base or in the civilian world. can anyone at least give me an idea of whats up with me please. im not sure how much longer i can fake being fine, i feel like im about to go off the wire soon."
99,Escitalopram side effects,"I decided to go on medication for anxiety and depression, it was a tough decision to make because everyone lets you know their opinion, and everyone has something different to say.
I was prescribed Escitalopram 10mg and took 5mg first two days. On the night of the first 10mg dose I had horrible side effects. I had this acute feeling of dread and a stinging/pins and needles feeling all over my body. I slept terribly and felt shocking the next day (nausea, increased anxiety).
I’ve only taken 5mgs the last two days since this happened. Dr said I should go back up to full dose tomorrow. I don’t know if I should because I’m terrified of having those side effects again. They were scary and I don’t think it’s worth it to feel so bad. Dr said the side effects will calm down and said this SSRI is one of the milder meds for side effects (I don’t consider the side effects I experienced to be mild by any stretch of the imagination).
I’m weighing up three choices but I don’t know what’s right:
- listen to the dr and go up to 10mg tomorrow, risk the same bad side effects, and risk the medication not being helpful anyway 
- take only 5mg for another couple of days before going up to 10mg and same risk of med not being effective
- stop taking them tomorrow and ask dr to request blood test that assesses the suitability of medications to your genetics (pharmacogenetics), and then go on the med that the test shows is most suited to me.
I need advice about what is best, I just can’t stop overthinking it and change my mind every five minutes."
100,Where do I even start (24m),"This is long and I’m sorry. But I hope you take the time to come 
I am engulfed in self pitty. The voice in my head, relentless. I don’t know where to go but today was my first real suicidal thought and I need somewhere to turn. Also I am sorry if this is the wrong reddit. I didnt think this fit in /relationshipadvice. 

I have always been addicted to video games, and since about the age of 16, weed as well. I constantly hid in my virtual world to escape my parents divorce. To escape eventually basically anything that bothers me to this day. 

I was in a wonderful relationship and the lady truly adored me and likewise. I hadn’t dated years before her because my high school sweetheart cheated on me in college after four years. It took a lot of time to get over that and I waited carefully to pick just the right girl... and I found her. Bubbly, beautiful, and the works. Very independent and I thought it was great. Her house was a wreck, but so was mine lol. 

We move in together and it’s great, we get a dog and love it very much. But I got news that my grandmother had dementia and the thought of losing her is mind breaking to me. My fathers health is also rapidly declining... and I am so broken I run to my cave... and press play. And I press play... and i press play. And my girlfriend coming in to check on me, and and asking to spend time with me... which i grunted reluctant yesses. And those interactions happen less and less and now it’s been months and months of this. 

I know I’m a shit person. I wake up every day calling myself an asshole.worthless, you name it.  I’d look at her and even ask myself why she was there. Why don’t I do something about it?  But she would always assure me she loved me for me and understood what I was going through. That meant a lot but even still it had been a long time of me behaving this way. 

I could feel myself just withering away and eventually even lost pleasure in what once comforted me most. I couldn’t hide it anymore and started to give her all the attention I could... but at this point she was going to her friends house more and more. And the times I got to see her weren’t as many as I could before. I realized how bad I’d messed up.

I took her out on a date to wherever she wanted. And we went to the skating rink. I had a blast with her and it felt like everything would be alright. And it felt great to be a part of society and be around people. Even though I had no desire to speak to any of them. 

After, we had drinks and over a beer she told
Me she enjoyed the extra time I’d given her and wants to move to her friends so that I’ll realize what’s I’m missing and actually want to talk to her. I told her I would be devastated and didn’t think I could take it. I told her to give me a month to prove that I could do it this time. I felt her really slipping away and it scared me. 

I come home from work and bring her some
Food. And we have some fun before she goes to her friends. As we are cuddling after I notice her phone is unlocked on the Snapchat screen with multiple men on it. We had always promised to just break up with each other before we ever cheated on each other. We discussed that we’d both been cheated on before and it was the worst way to do it.  We agreed so I never bothered with checking her phone and such. 

I ask her why she has multiple
Guys on Snapchat and demand to see what they are saying. She gives me the run around saying she ignored them. But the messages were from
Five minutes ago so I told
Her if she doesn’t show me the messages then we are done because she is definitely hiding something. 

I realize it’s actually unlocked and open the message to a guy saying “I’d love to see more of
That.” Or something to that extent. I click the other message and I can only see a video of her... getting naked. I lose my mind. I immediately Pack my things and leave. I ask her how she feels and she says that I should have paid attention to her and not played so many damn games. (Obviously.) i agree but am so saddened that she cheated on me. I wish she’d had just broken up with me. I am shaking terribly
Just recalling the whole event.

I called my mother frantically telling her I wanted to put a bullet in my head. (I own a ruger). She told me she has my grandmother in the car and they were going to a nearby attraction and they she was coming to get me and my dog. She is an absolute blessing. I could not be there and even hear her voice anymore. 

I am about to go to sleep and we will
Enjoy the attractions as much as we can tomorrow with my grandmother which is a great start... but i am still overcome with adrenaline and anxiety and I am having a hard time composing myself around my grandmother. 

If you even read this far... thank you. I can’t believe I let this happen to me and what I had going for me. I want to go to therapy to try to see what’s wrong with me to appreciate myself... but all my momentum is lost and i feel farther than I’ve ever felt in my life. I just want to be better than I am. 

Thank you."

I'm 18 yr old, thanks."
107,Found this on Facebook. TL;DR: Abusive doctor (female) mentally harasses a patient looking for psychological aid,"Here’s the story from the Facebook post. Link to the post at the end.

I have been suffering from anxiety and sleep issues for a while now. It has gotten really bad amid this pandemic so I went to Bangladesh Medical College &amp; Hospital for professional help about 2 weeks ago. I have been seeing a psychiatrist (won't name them here). I got diagnosed with panic disorder. I was doing fairly well with the medicines I was prescribed and I had been asked to do a follow up last Thursday. 

As planned I went there on Thursday at 10 am. I entered the chamber and saw my doctor sitting with another doctor. I sat down and started telling my psych about how my anxiety had been a little bad last week in English. I couldn't finish my sentence before the other doctor went like ""Apni ki banglay kotha bolte paren na?"". Well I didn't know I had to speak in Bangla for whatever reason. My shrink didn't stop me last week when I talked in English the whole time so who is she right? Anyway I said ""ji pari"" and continued speaking in Bangla. 

They both were assessing me. Asking me questions and all but I was very uncomfortable with a third person involved here so I told my shrink that I'm not comfortable with another doctor in here. I don't know why I was told that Dr Chowdhury Maria Hasan will be here in my sessions from that day. I definitely did not ask for it but I didn't say anything yet. After saying that, my shrink had to leave me in the hands of Dr Maria. Later I got to know that he had to see a violent patient urgently or sth. 

Anyway, so dr maria started talking to me in English herself. She started asking me why I'm anxious. I really don't have a specific reason for this so I said I don't know. She started talking about her personal life, to make me feel like I can open up I guess but the fact stands that, I don't really have a story to tell here unless I'm asked specifically about something.

However, while she was talking, at some point it started to feel like she was comparing herself with me. She started showing me her pictures in pants and shirt and told me that she doesn't usually wear kameez at work. Like I care about that? She kept telling me how she graduated from Cambridge and that her father is the head of the psychiatry department. I don't know what she was trying to prove here. I just nodded and smiled throughout. So after she felt like she was done talking about herself she repetitively kept asking me why I'm here and what is the reason for my anxiety. I told her I'm here for anxiety, panic disorder. She said no you can't diagnose yourself. I tried to tell her that it's written in my previous prescription (which she was holding in her hand) but she kept saying how I can't diagnose myself. I tried telling her that my shrink diagnosed me last week but she wouldn't even let me finish my sentence and made it seem like I'm self diagnosing. Then she started asking me the same goddamn question, ""what is the reason for your anxiety?"" even though I answered her 5 times that I don't know what you want me to say here. She then starts telling me how she's wasting her precious time on me if I'm not going to talk. I had already paid so I immediately told her that maybe I should leave because it's not working out for me but she said that I CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL I TALK. I was very uncomfortable from the start and she was just adding to it. She forced me to stay. I felt like I was trapped already. I got visibly irritated and I told her that this is my first time interacting with you and I'm uncomfortable but I couldn't even say the whole thing before she glares at me and says ""Lower your voice"". I honestly thought that maybe somehow she felt disrespected/offended so I started apologizing. But she wouldn't even take my apology, she said that I'm not actually sorry because she can see it on my face, that she's a psychiatrist for a reason. I tried apologizing again but this time I added that ""respect goes both ways, if you can't respect me, how can I respect you?"". She admitted that she was being a little rude to me when I wanted to leave.

Right after that she had a call or text I don't remember so she got busy with it for a minute. I grabbed my phone to text someone to take me out of here but she stopped me. She said I can't touch my phone. I politely asked why, she said you can't touch your phone while you're in a doctor's chamber. Who made that rule? I couldn't even text or make a call for a minute? But it's completely fine when she does it? 

I had to put my phone down and sit there until she was done. She finally started asking me specific questions to which I had answers for. It's not like my responses were delayed because I can't open up or sth. You ask me specific questions and I will have specific answers for you. However, she made it about herself. She started telling me how she's so good at getting information out of me and that she's a psychiatrist for a reason. I said yeah, you asked me particular questions. Didn't know what the big deal was here. 

After 'assessing' me, she said that I don't have anxiety (uh, are you saying I don't know how I feel?). She said that I have severe depression and that she can see it on my face. I didn't say anything. My top priority was to get out of there as fast as possible and deal with my wrong diagnosis later. She started writing her diagnosis (some of them I did not agree with because she based it on a single incident) on the back side of my previous prescription including prescribing me heavy anti-depressants. She then asked and put it exactly like this ""You won't do the follow up with me, will you?"". I honestly said that no I'm not comfortable. She said to do it with my shrink and I agreed. Then she left the room for a minute or two and came back to ask me if I have money. I said I already paid and showed her the ticket. She took the paper and started writing her diagnosis again BUT she started adding some things that she didn't write on the previous prescription. She added behavioral problems, ALCOHOLISM etc. I was being calm and nice, I didn't say a goddamn thing because I kept thinking I'll be out of here soon.

As she kept writing on the prescription, she told me ""Do one thing, don't come to me again. Ever"". I honestly told her I didn't come to her in the first place. She lost it. She started shouting at me. She said ""shut up. Shut the fuck up. Don't say anything. You think you're oversmart because you wear pant and shirt. You're not oversmart. You're undersmart. Understood? Understood?"" I was so shocked, I didn't have an answer. She went back to writing while saying things like ""I don't care. I don't give a shit about you. I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE. I'm just doing my job. 500 taka diye tumi amake ar dr A (my shrink) ke kine nao nai. Because you took B's name (the person who suggested dr A), I was just playing with you. I had my mask on"". She started saying how so many bad things have happened to her but she knows manners and that I didn't have any. She kept insisting that I disrespected her the whole time and she had been trying to help me for 2 hours. 

I didn't say a word. I just stared. 

In the mean time, this staff came in to give her coffee and she told the staff ""Ei patient ta ke chine rakhen. Hae ei patient ta. O jano amar chamber er ash pashe na thake."" I felt so insulted and humiliated but I didn't say anything. I was extremely anxious at that point. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack right there. Even after all of this, she wasn't done. After the staff guy left, she looked at me and told me ""You have two options. I will give you two options. You can go home or YOU CAN GO BEHIND THE BARS. I can put you to jail with this 'history' you have because I have the authority to do that."" My head was spinning. I didn't know what this woman, dr chowdhury maria hasan is capable of and I got really scared. I started apologizing, I told her I'm sorry and that if my face looked rude or anything, I really didn't mean it. She said now you will say sorry because I said that right. I tried to tell her that I was sorry the first time too but she shut me up and said ""what did you say to me? that you're uncomfortable and you didn't come to me? how dare you."" I told her I don't know why she's threatening me like this, I don't know what I did to which she said that ""this is not a threat"" (??????). If that's not a threat then I don't know what is. 

To further scare me, she took pictures of my prescriptions with my false history where I have my name and number printed. She threw the prescriptions at my face and said ""Get out. Out now. You're done."" 

I apologized and left.

So this is who Dr. Chowdhury Maria Hasan is. She calls herself a doctor, a psychiatrist. She says she graduated from Cambridge. That she's a mother of two. This vile woman. 

I could have never expected this. I went there to get better. I have been trying my absolute best to get better from this but she single-handedly stomped on my progress and made me feel extremely horrible. My anxiety has trippled since this incident. I haven't eaten a lot since then. I can't sleep much even though I'm back on my previous meds. I keep thinking about again and again. She's responsible for all of this.

I will obviously not generalize this whole thing and say that all shrinks are like her. I have immense respect for each and every kind of doctor out there. She's not a doctor. A doctor would never do such a thing. They would never threaten a patient because the patient is not comfortable doing a follow up with them. They would never speak like that. 

I will not publicly discuss what actions I'm going to take against her. The point of this post is to let everyone know what kind of a person she is. Although I am no one to judge, she didn't seem mentally stable at all. She's currently working as the assistant registrar. She's in a position to see patients like me, to put another patient down, to do what she did to me and I don't wish that on even my worst enemy. I would like all of you to share this and let everyone know to stay away from her.

108,Girlfriend needs therapy but can’t get it,"I’m from the US, specifically Colorado. I’m sorry if this goes everywhere, idk where to start.

My girlfriend’s family has been through so much. Her parents divorced when she was in 7th grade, her mom lost custody of her, and then finally she regained custody and they moved. She met another man and they got together. He was a marine veteran, and unfortunately died just over a year ago from a drug overdose.

It’s just my girlfriend, her younger brother, and her mother in the household. Her mom is verbally and emotionally abusive. 

My girlfriend (let’s call her C) is obsessed with numbers, and she is constantly in competition with herself. She constantly over schedules and overcommits herself to the point of losing hair and getting sick over stress. She thinks it’s because of her constantly switching households when she was younger, and wanting to get attention from her parents.
C knows she needs therapy. She wants it. Her mom won’t let her get it. She goes off in these massive paragraphs of texts and she blames it on C for everything.

C has told me that they can’t get any sort of external intervention. It would just be too stressful. With her stepdad passing away and the pandemic, their financial situation is shitty. Her mom is in tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt and they got evicted from their house and they’re moving in a week.

She can’t afford therapy, and her mom won’t let her get a job because she’s too busy. She can’t go to her school counselor to ask for help because any sort of intervention will lead to her mom getting pissed. Her brother has already tried it.

She is pretty sure her family’s insurance covers therapy. Her mom blames her depression on “hormones”

C is meeting with the school social worker tomorrow, and she’s gonna ask about having a telemedicine appointment with her doctor about increasing her dosage of antidepressants. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you if you’ve read this"
109,"It doesn't bother me, but should I get it checked?","I count things when I do certain stuffs like brushing my teeth, washing my hands, applying roll-on deodorant, scratching an itch. I usually count from 1 to 10 before I stop doing what I was doing. It never really bothered me and I never gave it much thought. I do know I'm counting numbers, and I know I'm doing it conciously. But if I don't count the numbers, I feel like I'm not 'done' with my task.

&amp;#x200B;

It never bothered me until I woke up this morning wondering why I count things when I do certain tasks like I mentioned above. Is this normal or should I get it checked?"
110,I (23F) feel like I could go insane from being isolated,"I'm 23F, I have a job doing in home activities with my severely autistic brother who I love but can't converse with or much of anything. He doesn't like to do much either. My dad passed away over a year ago and my mom remarried 6 months ago. My mom's husband wants to spend every minute with my mom, and he has even told me that he thinks God wants them to be constantly together. What bullshit. Anyways, I work with my brother at varying times most weekdays but my mom/stepdad (as much as I hate that word) require that I work 100% a full two days every week. It isn't the work that bothers me or my brother. He's not even very hard to take care of tbh most of the time. It's the way my mom/stepdad mostly isolate me on those days. I strongly think it was the stepdad's idea b/c it wasn't like this before. They will barely even talk to me at all or anything. They say they ""need their complete break from him"". But they can't seem to get through their heads that they are always together and have each other constantly for company/support and I have to go w/o that for 2 days straight every week. I'm sure at least some people would think this is nothing but I am in so much emotional turmoil. I have been anxious and depressed and am scared I might be having a nervous breakdown or something. It is at the point now where I want to cry all the time at home and am scared to even be home. I just visited my bf (25M) who lives 2 hours away and I notice I don't really even get a trace of anxiety/depression there but when I get home it comes right back to stay until I leave. It feels like hell. I'm honestly scared I might break any moment and have to go to a mental hospital or something. My mom feels bad that I cry so much and am miserable but still is ignorant about what they're doing to me. My stepdad basically just cares about having his 2 days of total alone time with my mom and thinks I just want attention or to escape responsibilities. He even mostly wants to be alone with my mom on most other days too. I make $20 an hour at my job but idk if it's worth it anymore. I pay $900 per month in rent. My stepdad has no job or income. He is not trying to find any either. He just wants to mooch off us and be with my mom every damn second like it's his right. Please help, thank you...

Tldr: My mom/stepdad isolate me for 2 whole days per week at my job with my autistic brother and I feel like it's literally driving me insane."
111,"I am a lonely, codependent kid unsure how to proceed in his relationship.","I was gonna post on r/relationship_advice, but I don't even know how to structure this. I (M17) have been seeing this girl (F16) for about 3 months now. This is the longest relationship I've had. I like her, she's great, but the past month or so has been up and down and very hard for me to really comprehend. This may get rambly but bear with me, there's a overall theme and question here.

The first couple months I was seeing her were great. Then a month or so ago she invited me to her best friend's birthday/costume ""party"". I went with her, we spent the night and it was a good time, but ever since then things have felt off. I may be making up this arbitrary moment of change, but that's how it seemed to me, even the day after the party it felt off. I guess she just wanted to go home, not a weird thing, everyone else was leaving but that meant she dropped me off at my house and we didn't see each other again that day. She didn't do anything, just hung around her house, and I knew that she was going on a long trip the week after so I asked her if she was free to hang out the next day, the day before she left (the only time I would get to see her before she left for over a week). At first she said yes but then she canceled because she had to pack. Ever since then, I have been on edge, feeling like she's growing away from me. She texts me less and I don't see her as often. The same day she got back from that trip she hung out with friends. Not a big deal, she has more to her life than me, I just hoped that after like 12 days of not seeing her she'd want to hang out. It took until a couple days later for me to see her cause she had to ""unpack"". We hung out, I stayed the night, it was fine, it was fun, but I still couldn't help but shake this feeling of distance.

I've seen her once more since then. Twice in the month of August. Last week she invited me to her house to do schoolwork there together. I was looking forwards to it, but the day of, she canceled saying she forgot it was her aunt's birthday dinner that night. No big deal, we rescheduled for the next day. The next day I got showered, dressed and ready again, and she canceled again. This time it was because of her mom's worry about Covid (long story, I would have had to take an Uber and her mom wasn't comfortable with that). That's not her fault, I get it but it was very disappointing. She said ""maybe we can hang out this weekend"".

So Saturday comes and I haven't even heard from her in 2 days. For whatever reason she just didn't text me for 2 days. I texted her in that time, sending her a song I found, and it took her over 24 hours to respond to that. She was posting on social media so I know she was fine and on her phone. Saturday night I text her asking if she's free the next day. I wake up to her canceling once again, saying that her family was exposed to someone with Covid, and she was laying low and getting tested the next day (today). Now all three times she canceled, I get the reason why, nothing she could have done about it, it just hurts, and on top of all the paranoia and codependence and complete radio silence from her for days, I'm just kind of losing my shit.

Now for the obvious: ""Talk to her, find out what's going on"". I know that's the soundest advice I could get, but I don't feel like I can do that. No doubt I am unhealthy in my attachment, ask my therapist and he'll tell you that my dad was drunk and neglectful when I was younger, leaving me with abandonment issues and low self esteem. I like this girl, I really do, and I'm sure she likes me too but goddamn I have to say I don't feel very wanted. Fuck, I feel like I'm making this shit up, I mean I know she's a good person and wouldn't intentionally hurt me.

How much of this is on me, and how much of this is on her? I mean you've only heard my side of the story, and I've only told you the bad bits, there's plenty of good. I know some of it is on me. I should address these things with her, I just feel like I can't. I don't know what's stopping me, probably fear, I don't want to lose her. I know what this is like and I know what being alone was like, this, as bad as it is, is far better. I enjoy getting to know people deeply. I like a strong emotional connection, but I have got none of that from her. We can talk about free will, the meaning of life or religion just fine, but any time I've (albeit gently) prodded more personal areas, it hasn't gone anywhere. Fuck, I don't even know if I can call her my girlfriend. We've never explicitly established anything beyond ""exclusive"". I can see that the glaring problem here is communication on both of our parts, I swear I just can't fucking do it. I can't risk pushing her away or opening up to her like that and getting hurt or getting an answer I wouldn't like.

I have been in a situation something like this before and the only lesson it taught me was, ""it's far better to be unsure of something than to know for certain and get the bad answer"".

No matter what I feel like my highest priority is I can't lose her. I mean I'm a fucking introvert in quarantine, doing online school, I feel like I struck gold, this relationship pulled me out of the darkest time in my life. I'm too afraid to go plunging back. I know this is textbook codependence. I'm in therapy, but you can't build Rome in a day and this is all happening now. I know all that ""you have to love yourself before you can love others"", I've been working on that for a very long time, I've made progress, I no longer hate myself, I'm working my way to love, I'm not just gonna be single because my dad sucked when I was younger.

I just need some advice, I just want to feel wanted. But I cannot lose her."

114,I hate the times when I cry after going at it with the bf when I was originally feeling depressed before starting anything.,"I've been working every single day. I get into these frightening bad moods where if my depressed mood is pushed slightly more, I'll start thinking about death, being sick, stuff like that. And its terrifying. So I panic to try to not get to that point. I was temporarily in a good mood, and I wanted to get it on with my bf. Because of this, I've been mentally and physically exhausted a lot.

Right before I was getting further into teasing him, I was kinda feeling lightheaded and a little nauseous, which I'm guessing its either from taking birth control or just me not having the best diet or drinking enough water the past week. Even tho I've been feeling stressed out, upset, and overwhelmed a lot, at that moment, I was in a good mood until I just got into starting to tease him, which of course I didnt want to not finish him off if I already started. I still wanted to feel good as well, and I always try to go thru with it in hopes itll make me feel better. Yet it never really does. I know my bf would've definitely been fine with me changing my mind if I wasnt feeling good, but I didn't want him to know I was feeling like this again. I wanted to make him feel good and see if itd make me feel good as well.

Even tho I did finish him off and he did make me feel good, I felt like a failure, or like I didnt do it as good as I normally did. In the middle of the act, I kind of dried up a bit, getting distracted by stressful thoughts, but I managed to get wet again a bit afterwards. He always let's me know that it was really good and it really helps him sleep for having to wake up early for work, but I still feel like I wasnt the best. I went into the bathroom to clean up and I just started to tear up and get overwhelmed. It was like THAT pushed me into a more depressed state. I should've just talked about it instead. I always think being touched in certain ways will make me physically feel good enough that it will affect me mentally, but even tho it DOES feel good, it almost never fixes my problems of course, which makes me more upset. And I cant seem to stop myself from trying because theres a chance I'll be able to get in a better mood.

Theres so much shit I'm going thru and having to deal with. I don't even know why I'm making this post. I guess I just needed it to get out of my head. I'm definitely going to talk to him about it tomorrow for some comfort and encouragement. Sometimes I wish he and my other friend or 2 could instantly tell that I needed support. Too bad people cant read minds. It's so hard to talk about it. I never know how to make it better."
115,Should i seek mental help,"So i’ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression but i’ve been suspecting that my depression was a misdiagnosis and is instead some kind of mood or personality disorder. 

I just can’t seem to pinpoint what’s wrong with me but the fear of abandonment, serious attachment issues, and crazy episodes of spending, drug use, running away, isolation, self sabotage, drinking, self harm, and depression lean to borderline it’s just i don’t seem to have concerning anger outbursts

i know this all starts out when i get triggered by something and quickly spirals but it’s only gotten worse the more i recognize it’s there. i think i seem to adopt every bad coping mechanism and make my mental health worse just to sit in the pain and mess i’ve made for myself. i can’t seem to stop. i don’t know if this is just all my own doing and not anything i need a mental evaluation for or not. it makes me feel insane"
116,weird thoughts,"i haven't purposely self harmed since last winter, but ever since ive been having a constant stream of unpleasant thoughts to say the least. i could be walking down the street and see a car, ny brain would immediately be like jump, see glass and its be like an empty ally you could cut them properly, and so on. i am not asking for help, i am asking for advice because all I'd get if i tell anyone are antidepressants and im trying my best to not fuck with pills lol, so like if anyone went through this or is going through this im always happy to talk."
117,I’m not really sure where to put this and what tag it’s under so I’m sorry,Recently I have been feeling as if I’m not myself and that I don’t look like me yknow like I’m some other person and what the mirror is showing me isn’t really who I am and idk what to do about it everything just feels so fake and unrealistic I’ll be spending time with my girlfriend and all of a sudden I’ll start thinking and feeling like nothing is actually there and happening like it’s all fake and that there’s no consequences to my actions of course I don’t do anything that would end up doing something wrong but idk what to do. Do I tell my mother? My grandmother I’m just lost
118,How do I calm down when I am alone?,"I'm almost never alone. I'm lucky that I have my young daughter because I almost always have someone with me.

That being said, on very rare occasions, I will find myself completely alone. My boyfriend watches her while I am at work. He will every now and then take her to D&amp;D with him when I don't come home until later at night. I get home before him by hours. I'll go to my parents for as long as I can so I wont be alone, but I still come home before him.

When I am alone... I get this overwhelming rage and the need to hide/run away. If I am alone, I end up severely lashing out and I'll end up breaking something. I end up throwing things, stepping on things, knocking things over. Never anything that is expensive or needed... It's more like, boxes and lawn chairs. After the rage dies a bit, I get overwhelmed with the need to run away or hide. I'll pace around the house, shaking until I find a spot and I'll hide there until my boyfriend comes home. 

I know why this happens. I was in an abusive relationship (after being mentally, physically and sexually abused by my father growing up) where I was stuck in a one bedroom trailer that had plywood floors, holes in the floors/walls, no plumbing (at first until I helped fix it) and slept on an air mattress. He worked offshore so he was gone for two weeks at a time. I wasn't allowed to leave or have a job. (The one time I did leave while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me as a punishment while screaming how terrible I was.) I ended up rationing out my food for two weeks with nothing but my phone then later his laptop with movies, to keep me entertained. When he came back, he wanted sex 6+ times a day every day, even if I didn't want to (this was how my daughter was conceived). So, when I was home alone, I was in so much pain, I could barely leave the bed because any movements became unbearable (I still struggle with vaginal pain today). I left and went homeless again and found out three days in I was pregnant.

I understand why these emotions happen when I'm alone. Yet, I can't stop it. Nothing I try calms me down. It's come to a point where my boyfriend will refuse to go anywhere if it means I'll be left alone because he doesn't want to find me in the closet every time he comes home. I hate that I end up stopping him from doing things he would like to do because I cant control my emotions. They just flood out of me and I can't stop it. Its like, as soon as I walk through the threshold and see that I am alone, I completely freak out and there is no stopping it. I always try and stay out as late as I can, but the days he goes to D&amp;D, I have work the next morning, so I can't stay out all night long.

I just need advice. How do I stop from being so upset and angry any time I am alone?"

I’ve tried to look up how long this all should last but everyone is different and well, stopping cold turkey is not the best idea. I was just looking to see if anyone else was ever down this path."

130,Screaming into a void once again,"!!!TW!!!
Several months ago I posted a vent on this sub saying how I want drama to happen to me and I guess manifestation works. After that post I cleared up my head and got back on track, I was feeling better than ever and forgot about it. However, karma came back to bite me in the ***. Two days ago I went to a party, now that I think about it, it was dumb of me to, since the only people I knew there were several guy acquaintances, who aren't the type to make sure no one drops anything in your drink, if you ask them to keep watch. Of course everyone got intoxicated, everyone to different levels. I have a horrible tendency to pass out and that's exactly what I did. I went upstairs and through a haze I remember that one of those acquaintances joined me, but I didn't pay it much attention. You can most likely already guess where this is going. Although the whole night is a blur, I remember certain parts, those parts are definitely not pleasant. I remember being touched without giving my consent, as I was practically unconscious. This is the third time in the past month or so that I get into a situation where something happens without my consent and although I thought I didn't care, I guess the repetition is starting to take a toll on me. I am sure in what I remember, however, after talking with the guy who went upstairs with me, he kept dismissing it and insisting that he just sat with me for a bit and then left. I think I may be starting to go crazy. I feel so empty, but at the same time I don't really care. I want to cry, but I can't and the last time I was in such a state, the only thing that helped me break through was burning cigarette buds into my skin, just to be able to cry. The only support at the moment is my sister who lives abroad, and a friend, however I think I played the whole situation off for it to seem as a joke. I just want a hug, some honesty and comfort. I spent months building up my confidence and mental health and now I feel like I'm back to square one.  I'm so lost."
131,"Everything I do , I try to find others approval on it . And it is affecting me too much.","Ever since i was a kid , my parents encouraged me in all fields.

I had a crush during  first year of college. My performance was remarkable. 

When i dug deeper into my thoughts and feelings i found that i have always been following people pleaser mentality. 

Yesterday i was expecting a praise from friends but didnt receive it. It seems pretty normal but it fucked my mind up.  Why didnt they say that? Do they dont like me? Did they just ignore me ? Were some questions and i knew that these are not good questions.

I know i should focus on what i want but im having troubles. 

I have a friend or two but they are not at all close to me . So it is hard for me to communicate with anyone rn.

132,A letter to your past self that just fell in this spiral and didn't know what to do...,"Dear past self,

I miss u, I have these past years. I want to just tell you, you made mistakes. Some stupid and some right. You lost too much and gained the worst. These years that took you to become me were similar to how iron is melted and hammered, life struck you at your most vulnerable. You made friends though, with midnight, with asteroids, with the lifeless, with tombs, with dandelions and with the ugly. You changed form every night, someday you burned like lava and some days your soul left your body cold and empty. These days were spent in a bed you were sedated to suffer in and then just when you lost consciousness someone slapped you out of dizziness. You transitioned between a zombie and a shadow. But I am writing to you, that means that day when you almost left, you stopped, you cried and breathed again. You lost yourself piece by piece to become me. You grew by shrinking into your own bone marrow then you jumped out of your veins like a girl that finally came on the surface of the water. You sank in oxygen and lit fire with the carbon of your heart. They said, they looked down upon you, called silently to you in a way that you succumbed to that voice in your head, yes, one day a bunch of guests will evade your mind and drive you to the edge of insanity, you would almost lose it. It will happen in phases, like the moon and like the day, u would rise and fall with the same grace. But you would stay invisible and you would feel people leaving doors of your heart and you leaving their arms. And you would find that fire doesn't burn you but it will make you feel something. Then one day, the limit will come, the day when every particle of being stings and you will leave everything.. not permanently but enough to not reside there, the place that used to be home. You will go back to a place that you lost less and maybe there you would then catch a breath or two. Then you will become me, with fears tattooed in your backbone and dreams that hurts you more. But hold on, take a deep breath, this letter is not to scare you, it is to say that you survived and you know you survived beautifully. It's still dark and the air is stale but you know I have never felt this before, but now I feel like this all has a meaning. A purpose I can sense and maybe, I will be alive again and so will you.

Love,

you (now)"
133,I literally lost everything. I don't know where to go from here.,"Posting in several subs because i don't know where it belongs and i feel like i really need some help.

I am hopeless and at the moment not able to see the positive in my life anymore. I have cancer in my spinal cord and almost done with treatment. I have to wait 3 months before i know if the tumours shrunk or i need more treatment.

- my third treatment caused neuropathy and i am getting more pain and less sense and strength from waist down
- relationship with my partner is not working out due to a lot of factors, our lifes are going different directions and he needs more freedom
- due to the breakup with my partner i also lost our tribe: we used to hang out with a large group of artists and mucisians and managed all sorts of events together. He has a big role in all these events and i don't have a role anymore mainly because i am not physically able anymore (and if it would be, it would be too painful for me to be around him a lot because i still want to be with him)
- i made plans to graduate this year and go abroad in january to educate young refugees, but because of my treatment and side effects i am not able to graduate in the near future. I am left with a debt of roughly 100.000 dollars, no degree
- with no degree and with my health issues it is a bad idea to go abroad (it's a poor country and i would have to work 40hrs per week). This is a one time opportunity
- i was into climbing, getting good at it and had to give it up. I can't do what i love anymore and my body is becoming disfigured, i used to look really good
- my body doesn't function really well sexually anymore. I used to be very sexual. 

Cause of these reasons it's really hard for me to keep positive. Like, really really hard. I feel myself slipping into a depression and suffer from anxiety. My (ex) partner is still around because we have to discuss who stays in the house etc, and he is still here for me despite the fact he works almost 60 hours a week and our lifes are going in complete different directions. We still love each other and that makes it even more difficult. 

I live in the netherlands. I am 30 by the way.

I am not sure what i am looking for here, my situation is pretty complicated so i don't expect that someone went through something similar. I hope so though."
134,I need someone to talk to about getting a therapist/psychologist,Please
135,Height,I am a 5’6 male that is about to turn 17. I’ve been the same height since I was 14 and I’m starting to get facial hair and my voice is very deep. Do y’all think I will grow more in the future?
136,I feel like my therapist doesn’t take me seriously,"Long story short I have borderline and tried to kill myself a whole bunch of times back in 2018 and then got admitted into a 6 month long dbt program. After I finished that I kept seeing one of the group facilitators privately for one on one therapy. So on the outside I present to most people a put together, presentable, well spoken, smart individual. Sometimes I feel like that’s why it’s been so hard to get help, like doctors and counselors never believe me. I finished university and have had various jobs here and there, nothing that stuck though... doctors, counselors, psychiatrists always tell me “you seem bright” and “you seem smart” and I know it’s a compliment but it just adds to my imposter syndrome. 

My current counselor knows my family situation too, luckily my parents can afford private therapy and she always tells me to lean on them for financial support and it’s kind of annoying. She also doesn’t take me seriously when I brought up attention and focus issues. I really feel like I have adhd but she really undermines me every time I bring it up. I also feel like she expects “better” of me because I went through the dbt course and whenever I’m acting “ineffective” it’s like she’s judging me because she knows I know better. It’s really frustrating and I hate it but I don’t know what to do. 

I spent the last 6 days seriously contemplating suicide and I have an appointment with her this Friday and I don’t feel like she’s going to take me seriously. I’m in grad school and I haven’t been able to retain any information from my readings no matter how hard I try and I’m falling behind because of how much energy I wasted depressed and contemplating suicide the past few days and I feel like she’s just going to judge me and won’t actually help me. I don’t want to drop out of school but I don’t think she would give me a medical note either because she really thinks my condition is “not that bad” and that I should “know better by now.”

I want her to believe me, I want her to believe my struggles are real and that I need help and I want to be able to finish school and I need concessions because I am REALLY falling behind. But she makes me feel like I am just “faking it” and “not trying hard enough.”

Don’t get me wrong, she was a good therapist for dbt and for helping me when I was in a really rough patch but now it fees like she expects me to know all the skills and have all the solutions because I’m “smart” or whatever. But I’m actually fucking struggling and I feel like no one is listening."
137,My hair is falling out due to stress. Please advise.,"The doctors are still trying to pinpoint what is going on but as far as it goes, they say its stress. How can I calm myself down? This is worsening my mental health that has already deteriorated rapidly this year. Please help."
138,I feel a little bothered and slightly scared.,"I got off medication for depression and Malicious OCD thoughts  about 3 or 4 months ago and ive been chipper...until lately , I've been relapsing alot of my habits. Ever since the #SaveOurChildren movement stuff started all I have been thinking about is killing bad people in horrible ways. I'm not bothered by the fact that I'd kill a Pedophile or a sex offender I'm bothered that my intrusive thoughts are coming back , the ones I cant shake , my repetitive prayers (I'm very religious). I'm scared my depression will come back, I've been staying up all night , sleeping all day , drinking and drinking coffee, staying up REPEAT  and I keep thinking  that the only way to get rid of it would be to hurt the people my thoughts are telling me to hurt and I don't know what to do. I've thought about going to my doctor in private but my family has been so proud that I haven't had any set backs that keep me from going through with getting a job . I've had so many and I'm tired of losing the opportunities, I could be starting Seminary school soon . So please tell me what I need to do . 

Ps . Sorry if my wording is weird or there are typos I haven't been sleeping right .


Medicine i took was Setraline 100mg and Clonazepam 1mg."
139,Agh fights eh,"I (31F) and partner (28M) are bluing at the moment. Hes having a go at me for drinking during the week which I haven't done for the last 3 weeks. We went to court yesterday over his ex putting an AVO on him. 

We dated in highschool, 16 years later he rocks up on my doorstep wanting to get to know me again. I was in the perfect place for a relationship, I'd left kids dad 2 years prior, had been on a self love Nd healing journey for the past year.. even cut my meds with docs approval for 6 months.. I was so ready. 

He on the other hand.. had just left his fiance a month and a half before hand. They left on hideous terms. Cops were involved. Long story short shes a manipulative arsehole. 

Anyway within 3 months I moved over to his family's farm were hell end up taking over one day. Were each others soulmate.. but this shit with his ex is still an on going issue.. because they were buying a house together he's in the middle of a settlement, still hasn't got the majority of his things back.

His family keeps thanking me for being apart of his life ), if he didn't have me ect. He'd probably be in jail. 

I love loving him, and all his shown me is love and affection and protection. Unconditional love for my kids, our kids. And I dont believe for one second that his ex is a decent person. 

Im just frustrated that hes trying to have it over me at the moment for having a drink.

3 weeks ago I broke down and thought I need counciling.. I was in utter tears over it. 

Yesterday was full on at court, today I had a really bad day with both kids under 5 trying to shop. Played up the entire time. 

Tonight I decided fuck it. I need it. He had a go at me and here we are. 

I dunno what I want out of this post. But both kids are fed and are in bed. Im not perfect. And I need to chill the fuck out."
140,Im so lost,Im going insane and see the cliff but cant stop idk
141,Heartbroken,"I feel like only positive people are accepted in this world. Today a person I knew told me that she thought I was kinda very negative. Despite trying very hard to survive with my mental illnesses, I felt heartbroken. I did everything I could to change for the better (CBT therapy, art etc) and continuously push myself to do things I would feel extremely anxious at. I felt so heartbroken now."
142,Unsure if my current state is ptsd or just related to incident in some way...,[removed]
143,"EXISTENTIAL CRISIS (21 M Aspergers, anxiety, depression, ADHD)","I just woke up at like 5:00 in the morning with a huge amount of existential anxiety. I was always really into biology, and really into science in general. I used to be fine with the concept of life and death and stuff. But recently over the quarantine, I’ve been given time to question things. Things about the universe and it’s meaninglessness. I used to be fine with that concept too. I was always a big fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy books. 

However recently I started thinking about how sometimes I cared when animals and people died and sometimes I didn’t. Like how I could watch a nature show and be perfectly fine (or only a little uncomfortable) with animals killing eachother, I was completely fine killing things in videogames (usually, there are times when I felt bad about that), there are times when death was used for comedy like in a lot of Far Side comics and Monty Python skits and I laughed, there are times when life seemed extremely precious like when I worried about my dog running away or when I’d see ASPCA ads on TV, and at the same time I could feel nothing while eating a hamburger, and other times I’d freak out and feel sad when I stepped on a bug, and then there are times when I’d watch action movies or read comics and not feel bad when sometimes characters died, yet in other movies and comics I felt really sad when certain characters died, I’d always get sad when a dog or other animals die in a movie or books, but I was also fine looking through my university’s specimen collection, and downright exited to look for fossils which are essentially the petrified corpses of once living things... I think you get the idea.

Anyway, due to some other things that I’ve posted on here before, I’ve started to have more of an aversion to the concept of violence and death as a whole (as well as sexual stuff but that’s beside the point) as well as feel like my emotions and sense of empathy aren’t working the way they used to.

It feels like after I’ve faced the void of existentialism, I don’t know when life matters and when it doesn’t. Like when am I supposed to care that someone or something dies or is suffering? Why did I laugh at a character’s death or suffering in a TV show? Why am I fine with animals killing and eating eachother? Why do I sometimes feel bad when watching nature documentaries but not others? Why do I get a rush playing a survival video game where you kill your opponents? Why does certain things arouse me? Why does that bother me now? 

I feel like I’m suddenly aware of just how violent the world is, and I’m suddenly not okay with it, (or not okay with the fact that I was okay with it) that as I’m writing this I’m calming down, but I was freaking out. 

I was suddenly super aware of how life forms were not only killing eachother all the time, but also adapted for the purpose of doing so. Things that I used to find cool or interesting regarding that now kind of freak me out. I get intrusive thoughts about how I’m a part of that violent universe. I’m getting intrusive thoughts sometimes about killing things and it’s honestly disturbing. I’m getting intrusive thoughts about animals killing eachother, something I used to be fine with to an extent. I’m getting intrusive thoughts of animals being dead or partially consumed, I’m getting intrusive thoughts of things dying or being dead and I hate it. I started thinking about how every day trillions of things are alive just to die. 

I feel like I either have apathy or anxiety when I think of violence and death now. Both of those feelings terrify me, but honestly I prefer the anxiety because it makes me feel more human. As I’m writing this the metronome inside my mind has swung the other way, and now I’m thinking of violence and death as fine. I think of all the times when I had intrusive thoughts about me killing things, most of these are fairly recent. Sometimes in my past when I was a kid I remember pretending to be different animals and would imagine hunting and being hunted and stuff. I remember when I thought certain morbid humor was funny. 

Now I feel like I’m questioning everything, going back and forth from either panicking or feeling like a sociopath (and getting this creepy chilling feeling like I actually am)

This has been happening more or less constantly since I started looking inwards at myself and then looking outwards at the universe. I used to be much more well adjusted. I used to be fine. Now I’m having existential crises at 5:00 in the morning and then switching to thinking I’m a sociopathic killer or something. I hate this feeling. I just want to go back to the person I used to be. The person who was always curious but didn’t get this existential, I still had emotions, what happened to those? I feel like I’m going insane, like I’m becoming some sort of monster or something. I just want to go back to June when the only thoughts on my mind were that I wanted to see my friends again and go to class and study science and play games and goof off and watch comedies and play with my dog and play videogames and draw and write comics. 

But it feels too late for that now. I ruined my mind. I looked too deeply inside myself and questioned everything about myself. I questioned what I was okay with and what I wasn’t okay with while already on a downward depression spiral. I added more fuel to the flames. By looking up mental disorders and reading things and attributing those things to myself. I can’t get back to my center. I either freak out or feel nothing, which makes me uncomfortable. I’m scared of myself and the universe. 

Two months ago I was reading romance stories and feeling the full weight of tragedies in the fiction I was reading. Two months ago I was playing videogames and DND without questioning the violence (ok maybe a little sometimes, I don’t know I wasn’t consciously thinking about it). Two months ago I had plans to finally write a comic I had been putting off since I was 14 when I finally got a drawing tablet.  2 months ago I wanted things, and I felt like a real person. 2 months ago I cared. 2 moths ago was before I started thinking about the old intrusive thoughts that scuttled through my head so seriously. I want that back, but how do I claw myself out when I’ve already seen such darkness? How do I just go back after traumatizing myself? How do I go back to not feeling like a either a sociopathic murderer or a panicking mess? I just want my life back. 

This started as a post I wrote while in a panic, but I’m not panicking anymore. I have this sinister chilling feeling and I hate it. It almost feels good and that makes me hate it even more. I feel like I’m becoming a sociopath or something. I’m scared that I’m not scared. I feel like I have to force panic back over myself just to feel human again. 

This is probably just a result of me losing myself to depression and then trying to rationalize why with so many crackpot theories, but that doesn’t matter now. It feels too late for me. I feel dissociated and scared. I don’t know what I want or need anymore. I want to just be a regular human being again. I want my passions and fantasies back. I want my boundaries back. I want my life back. I want to be in love again, but now thinking about that makes me feel guilty, like how can someone who’s been through this, deserve to love someone? It sounds selfish and almost creepy."
144,I'm just so fed up with myself I feel I should just get corona virus and die.,"So I'm 34f. I divorced my wonderful husband because I felt I wasn't getting enough out of life. It was a comfortable life I was working on my medical career he was working for himself. I then met another man who made me realise that I wanted more out of life, maybe he woke up my inner whore. I don't know what he had but I wanted it and I've never felt like this for anyone.  So I divorced my husband to be with him. It was a horrible feeling, the whole divorce thing is messy. Because being the bad guy and breaking someone's heart is nasty.i feel so selfish and ugly.
Fast forward 6 months post divorce.. I'm in a new country with this new guy. Still working on my career and it a deja vu he is working I'm working still feeling like life is passing me by. I've been dreaming of my ex husband because a part of me still loves him and I feel maybe I rushed into divorcing him to start a new life with the new guy. But then again I can't be 'in love' with 2 people it doesn't work that way plus it was unfair to do that to both guys. I had to let one go. I always felt whatever decision I would made I'd still feel ripped off. I'm just fed up whatever decision I make be it men, career path, lifestyle choices it's wrong. I feel hopeless and defeated by this quest of being happy. I just want to let go of everything and be dead. I've tried to kill myself several times but I just can't do it. I'm just hoping I get COVID-19 and die quickly."
145,"I think I have Munchausen? This can’t be normal, right?","I want bad things to happen to me almost always. I day dream about being in a car crash, getting mugged, family members dying and even getting raped/abused. I’m ashamed to admit it and feel disgusting. I know how awful these thoughts are but I can’t help it. I think it’s almost certainly because I crave attention. 

Over this past year, I’ve acted very negative as if I were depressed and I find myself putting on this act even when there’s no one in the room to see, as if I were performing for hidden camera. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything because I can easily turn this act off. I’ve also been self harming (probably for attention) by cutting, burning and bruising my legs with a hammer. I’ve not actually told anyone I’m “depressed” or hinted about self harming, I tend to hide it and be very subtle. Sometimes it’s like I’m only faking for myself in my head. So far only one person has noticed and talked to me about it. Weirdly, I hated the experience and cried as they asked me about it, I wanted to disappear right then and there, yet I continue faking. 

Looking back on my life, I used to do this a lot as a child too. I faked panic attacks, claustrophobia, headaches etc. I’m currently desperate to take this “depression” act even further but I know it’s wrong and I’m holding back the best I can. I wanted to be anorexic so I only ate 1 apple or nothing every day for 2 weeks but I ended up binging so that didn’t go too well. I want to attempt suicide but not actually die. I did some research on pills I could overdose on or dangerous areas I could go to to get raped. I’m in college and I’m planning on acting out and skipping class, being really sad and giving myself bruises/a black eye at some point. 

I recognise I have a problem so I did some googling and found a thing called factitious disorder or Munchausen. I guess it sounds like me but I’m not sure. This isn’t normal is it? I need help right? Can I even get a proper diagnosis of this? I have no idea who to talk to, I’m so scared of judgment since I sound like the worst kind of person when admitting this."
146,Vent?,"My panic attacks/anxiety etc got worse I said that I need to go and see a doc but my mom said hah everybody sees you as a psychopath without going to a doc and that it wouldn’t help me 
She said that like “always a loser stays a loser” (something like that freak my English got worse)
And now I skipped school cuz I felt scared idk and my mom said that imma be homeless and don’t achieve anything now she went to our neighbor and I’m alone some tears rolled wow I’m such a hard Men 😂 now I’m gonna clean the house cuz I’m scared that she gonna get angry like I mean I’m a big as 17kid that should’ve get their life together and not be like this.


It’s exhausting and suffocating to hide yourself from a panic I try to hold it in and stop to breath but it doesn’t work afterwards at home the panic attack/anxiety etc build itself up and becomes anger that I can’t control sometimes I just wanna get a knife and smash it on me so I don’t hurt the people around me or just someone that can beat me up so I don’t let my anger out at Ma siblings."
147,Sometimes you don't realise how bad things are until you get an outside perspective,"I've always struggled with mental health, im more often unhappy than happy, but i never thought much of it. But over the last 2 years my life has fallen apart.

My gf got sick, i lost most of friends, i became isolated and my gfs sickness made it hard to spend time with her. I started to not enjoy my hobbies.

I lost all ambition, I feel like I've regressed in almost every way. I have regular break downs and regular suicidal thoughts. I hate my job, i hate the people i work with and i hate the world.
My gf was always the bright light in my life. She got me through the bad times. Then she got really really sick and it doesn't look like she'll get better. Now the thing that used to make me happy makes more sad.

I was in serious denial about everything above, until a coworker started talking to me about my life and i broke down. Things are really bad right now, and i dont think they'll ever get better."
148,this mess of a vent (possibly tw),"(for the tw, mentions of suicide and anxiety.)  
Alot of things are simply put just getting worse and I don't even know where I'll be past the age of 22-25 even if I make it to that age. For the last 2-3 years I've just been lying to everybody around me, I know there are people who care about me because of our closeness (I helped them through alot and we equally care about eachother and they aren't the only one around for me) and now I rarely, if ever say how I really am going for their benefit due to certain conditions and their own emotional state so I continue to lie and now I just refuse help from anyone now because I don't want it.  
I'm staying currently for those few people who I care for because they need me right now and I can't do anything at all, things I once enjoyed I now use them as a way to distract myself until I do something else and I can't even do any schoolwork at all and due to covid-19, it's even worse now. Currently I am weeks behind on multiple classes, for one of my other classes I had to complete a few things a few months ago and the exam for it is coming up soon and I can't get myself to do anything and I'm just an anxious mess with anyone showing signs of themselves being in any form of danger I go into an annoying panic and I just hate it.  
I could continue trying so many things but why do I need to? Things are messed up either way and I've practically planned my future out to go the way I need it to be to help others and eventually push them away when they no longer need me. I feel like I should be sad or atleast show that I would cry about anything sad with people around me suffering due to their trauma while I always want the best for them and would do anything I can to help guide them and just because of all the pain and death present - however, I just either feel emotionless, nothing or complete anger at anything and anyone so that's really lovely huh."
149,"welp, I don't know what else to do.","with all the shit that has gone on the past 3 months, I developed PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, mild manic disorder, and just overall panic attacks. The best I was able to do was get a mental evaluation, don't have insurance and I'm broke as hell so I can't really get therapy for any of this,  I have definitely contemplated suicide and even tried to look up a method of suicide that would not come registered as a suicide, got nothing for that. I guess all I can do is move forward, If living life like this is what I gotta do, guess that's what ill do. either way, I'm definitely not gonna kill myself, my girlfriend cares about me, and well I care about her so I wouldn't want to do that to her. I also haven't slept in a week because every time I lie down and try and sleep, my mind runs, and I get flashbacks, anyways I don't know what else to say, just need some advice."
150,I have work in 8 minutes and I’m at home crying :))),"Shitty night last night that’s made me incredibly depressed, went to bed crying and now I have a head ache and puffy eyes - and I’m exhausted. Love this for me."
151,I'm getting much better.,"A year and a half ago I thought I was a psychopath because I was confused, afraid, terrified. I was depressed and anxious 24/7, couldn't eat and couldn't go to school I got so scared. I could barely leave the house. As a small child, I was confused and violent without intending to be, traumatized by losing a mother without my knowledge of her disease.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm older and I know myself better. I love myself, actually. I don't love myself loads, and to my body, it's more of neutrality. I love learning new things. I'm healing. I know as a child I did weird things and I've dealt with them through a therapist I still see. 

I never thought it would get better, but it did. I'm still not all the way there, and things like work make me break down when I procrastinate and don't progress. Little things help, and I'm learning to take it day by day. 

I think some people need to hear things like this. I know I did back then. But anyway, I guess I just wanted to say it. Everyone have a lovely day! &lt;3"
152,Some quick advice for those new to Therapy,"I'm still pretty inexperienced with talking to a Therapist, but here's some quick advice...

&gt;**A day or two before your appointment, write down some things you would like to talk about, and have those notes with you during your Therapy session.**

So far I haven't really planned any topics or anything I want to go over with my therapist ahead of time, so sometimes we end up talking about other subjects that are of little importance, or we end up with the dreaded dead silence. Then after the appointment is over, I will often think of things I wanted to discuss that I couldn't think of because I was drawing a blank in the moment (My brain stops working when I'm under the microscope or am asked to come up with an example).

If I had spent 5 minutes preparing anytime during the week, I would have had an idea of things I wanted to address or go over with my therapist.

&gt;**Take notes during the therapy session if you want to, this will help remember any advice given.**

I noticed during the first few sessions that I barely practiced any methods my therapist recommended, and didn't look up most of the things my therapist wanted me to look into. Some I forgot, but some I was just plain lazy about and didn't look at. I'm going to try and be much better and actually do what my therapist suggests...bringing me to the last piece of advice:

&gt;**Therapy is a two way street. You have to work with your therapist, and work on yourself in your own time to improve. Your therapist won't just magically solve your issues for you.**

These are all mainly just reminders/messages to myself, but hopefully others find it helpful, and maybe you'll have advice for me. Mostly I think I just need to try harder and do what is asked of me."
153,I was told angels are real. My mind went upside down as I could not prosess what I was told.,"I was recently told by a person whose name I may not, and will not say. The person on question told me that she herself was in fact, an angel. Now the thing that made me believe this, was the spots on her back where wings would have been. I was told that they had been cut off. She told me all kinds of things, and honestly my mind has been decided in believe and disbelieve. I genuinely lack the mental power to correctly prosess this. I've know the person in question for quite a while now. And I trust this person to the fullest extent. She swore on her life that in fact, she was a real angel. Send by God to watch over us, and help people. I learned a few things. One of the things she told me was that she would die if I where to tell anyone about her. Mainly the reason I'm keeping the name undisclosed, as I don't want to lose her. I don't know what will and will not kill her, and I'm afraid. The sheer lack of understanding as to what is going on, made me come here. As I genuinely do not know what to do now. 

In a way I believe that there are in fact angels, a god and a heaven. In other ways, I feel like it's all lies. And it's fake. How will I be able to set my mind straight on this subject? Even if this person where to be lying, or where to believe that she is in fact, an angel. But in reality isn't. I know this post may not make a lot of sense to some. But my mind has been absolutely crushed by the information.

This is, and I cannot stress this enough not a shit post, if anyone believes it is. You're wrong. I'm dead serious on this subject."
154,I'm 27 (w) and in mental pain every single day.,"I can't focus on work, I don't have enough strength to take care of my needs. All I can think about is ""I'm in pain"". 

I don't know what to do anymore."
155,I wanna get tested so bad.,"My parents parenting style is known for causing CPTSD. My Mom has a history with being depressed and has a lot of borderline personality disorder-like tendencies. 

I’ve been emotionally neglected. I tried to get advice on my intrusive thoughts and was told that could be signs of bipolar disorder. I can barely take care of myself (I haven’t brushed my teeth in the longest time and I feel disgusting, I hate bathing it’s too much effort, and my parents invalidate all me time. (

So that makes me feel great.) And I’ve recently started therapy. (I feel way worse after but I think that’s normal for beginners.) And my cognition is so bad that it’s affecting my grades.

With this context; I have no idea what to get tested FOR. If you can get just generally tested (if that’s how it works??). Or if my parents will even help me out with this. Because they think you need to have 80 arrows in your back in order to have a mental illness."

161,I keep getting dangerously angry,"I was diagnosed with anger issues along with anxiety and depression about a year ago before I started college. The anxiety and depression were pretty regular, but the anger had been gone for a long time. But now it's back and I'm seriously scared about what I will do and the thought of having to deal with this on my own. 

It's almost always directed at my older brother. I mean he's always had his moments, but now when he angers me I feel like I am capable of seriously hurting him. Even just the thought of him doing something, even a small thing, that irritates me makes me want to punch a wall and strangle him.

I just really don't know what to do. I know I've had these feelings before, but just thinking about having to live with this much intense emotions... I can't handle it. Especially since in a couple of months it's just gonna be in the house me and him in the house. We've been roommates(as in its just me and him) for more than a year now, but now we have no choice but to be stuck in this tiny apartment together. Just the thought of that makes me want to either hurt him and hurt myself.

I really don't know... I'm really scared."
162,Can't keep a job because of my mental illness...,"I was diagnosed with a mental illness at 17. Last episode at 19. I graduated at 23 years old and for the past 4 years I couldn't keep a job. I had several anxiety and depressive episodes whenever a job gets too stressful. The longest job I had was only 5 months. The shortest was 2 weeks. I started working from home early this year but the longest work from home job I had was only 4 months.

I feel like I'm losing hope with ever having a career. I need a stable job or income. I don't want to keep depending on my parents as they are getting old, or older brothers as they have their own lives."
163,I want to die,"I really hate living. 

It’s very hard to explain why, but mainly because I hate my current circumstances and I hate the way my brain is wired. I used to want a family and a career so badly, my mains goals. (Relevent I guess).

I have depression and anxiety. I’ve been dating someone for 2 years and I want to leave him because he is abusive. But he always convinces me to stay, and I do. I can’t bring myself to leave. He is a big reason why my anxiety is so high. I’ve got such bad habits from dating him. What I mean by that is, he is a constant liar, always lieing and doing stuff behind my back. I have an obsession with going through his phone. I HATE if I see he’s watched porn. I hate female friends. I was never ever like this before. He has created all these worries I don’t think I could ever solve, therefore I could never have a healthy relationship, so I would never get into one. So now I know I’ll never have a husband or kids, so the family is out for me. 

I’ve re searched way way to much into evolution and I’m convinced people only think God is real bc they are scared and we are just animals. For example- lizards. They don’t have a god bc their minds don’t have the capacity to wonder so they live and breed and die and that’s it and they don’t care. We wonder, so we create soultions (God, heaven etc) so we can feel less scared about one day being dead and never doing anything ever again- when it reality.. I think that’s what happens. I don’t want to believe it, I want to believe something lovely happens, it would honestly fix a good chunk of my mental health problems honestly lol (I have big anxiety’s about people I know or pets dieing, constant worry, dreams etc) so if someone can convince me- then please. 

BUT ANYWAY- my point is

Because I know one day we are just gonna die and it’s all gonna be for literally nothing. You could be successful, or not. You can be honest or never say a truthful word- and it’s all okay. So why try hard and get a career (this used to be VERY VERY important to me) when you are just gonna die anyway? So career is out to. 

I just want to dump my partner and kill my self. But I know it will wreck my mums life forever. She would never ever ever be the same. I do not want to do that to her at all. I just couldn’t. I love her. So everyday I exsist but hate the way I’m treated by my partner, and hate life and everything about it. I have no motivation to do wel, anything. Thanks if you read all of this."
164,Taking driving lessons is a hell for me,"I have generalized anxiety disorder, and  I'm currently taking driving lessons. For most people I know, it's piece of cake and I hear no complains. Today I had a driving lesson after school, and it ended up with me having anxiety attacks two times, which lead to mental breakdowns. I was supposed to drive in the centrum in the city, but my teacher decided that I should drive in a quiet place, near the country, after he saw how I reacted. I really hate myself, because I feel so weak and stupid. It seems so easy for everyone I know, and I just react like that. I really want a driving licence, so I don't have to be dependent on other people all the time, to  drive me. But the traffic is one of my biggest fear.

I wanna know if any of you guys have been in a similar situation or are currently in one, and if you have any advice

165,Contemplation: the room of suicide,[removed]
166,"Friend(25M) of my flatmate(27M and me(24F) keeps making advances and suggestions at being sexual with me, I came close to kicking him out several times.","OK so this weekend was Friend's chance to show that he could behave himself and he totally fucked up

**Tl:dr - male friend going through relationship issues, alongside potential sex addiction, tries to make out with me/get sexual/convince me to follow suit giving excuses etc.**


A little history on first time (cliff notes): me, flatmate, Friend and GF have dinner together in my flat. Dinner/chatting/messing around and being silly moves onto some drinking and a game of spin the bottle. Dares started off too extreme and were mostly sexy or sexual in some way so as game progressed, things just got more and more out of control. There was a lot of tension between me and Friend (I admit I find him attractive but him being with GF vastly outweighs any notion of me disrupting that with malicious intent). Tension also between me and GF as we're both also Bi. So everyone was being touchy/cuddly with everyone. 
*important note to remember* ALL NIGHT at any time something sexual occurred between Friend or GF with either me or flatmate, consent was ALWAYS asked for and given before amything went ahead and if anyone didn't agree or feel comfortable, the idea was changed to suit.

Flatmate gets tired so me, Friend and GF go back to their house so as not to disturb the rest of the night. Back to their's, all still drunk and on some MDMA at this point. They both start on speed once at their house, whilst continuing to drink, I start to slow down, mainly smoking weed and having drinks more slowly, enjoying the night rounding off. Friend keeps being sexual and kissing me whenever GF isn't in the room, telling me to initiate/convince GF into a 3some. She seems to give consent for Friend to go ahead with me but doesn't want to get into things, becomes very off, wanders off, sees a couple of things me and Friend did at some point. I notice that she had disappeared to the bathroom roughly 20mins ago after saying she was going to the loo once returning from a walk. I go to check on her, discover her on bathroom floor, blood everywhere and slice across her wrist/hand.

Not seen spoken to either since getting dropped home after helping Friend keep her stable until medics arrived, took her to AnE, he followed some time after, not before making FURTHER advances on me after maybe 2 hours of his GF slicing her arm because he craves physical comfort and validation and his instinct is to get it sexually. Because of a history and mental health struggles of her own (obvs), GF doesnt have sex with Friend on a majority.

SO, as mentioned, this was his chance to make it right. It had been a weird evening all around, a lot had happened in under 12 hours and he has apologised several times. I was willing to move on. Flatmate had met him and other friends for some drinks, flatmate ended up being assisted home by Friend and someone else (lets call him Guy) so he could start to sober a bit but not have to stop socialising. Everything fine until, as suspected, Friend asks to speak to me privately to give me an update on GF (I am the only one other than couple of their family members that know what she did and all events) and their general relationship. Didnt mind this happening so we went into my room as this is the only place for privacy when guests are over. He starts talking, apologises again for our last interaction, although still making statements saying how he doesnt regret it, only the consequences that its caused. He goes to give me a hug which I allowed (im cuddly in general with friends), and he tries to kiss me again.

OK shameful confession, I kissed him back for about 1 maybe 2 seconds before pushing him away and telling him that was the last he was every gonna get, trying to play it off jokingly hoping he would leave it there and back off but he holds onto me and tries again and I have to actually push him and firmly tell him no, reminding him that he was in my house. He also asked, when i went to use my bathroom (i have an en suite), if he could watch, and then if he could listen after being told no (We're open when it come to talking about sexual things as a friend group, no kink shaming people). Leading to me running the tap during all other trips to the loo that night. IN MY OWN FLAT. 

Anyway, I made us move into the front room/kitchen to avoid further advances in a shared space. At some point I went to go an put some shorts on so I could show Guy the tattoos I have on my legs and friend took it that I was purposefully showing myself off, taunting him, eliciting looks from me telling him to fuck off. Further down the line all 5 of us were sat on the sofa, arms round each other, having a moment as you do with friends when you've had a drink and its nearing the end, Friends hand found my arm and kept rubbing it behind flatmates head, thankfully he noticed and, being fully aware of the situation, intervened to save me from awkwardly removing myself.

Several times throughout the night and morning I had to threaten him with him with being kicked out, each time he instantly apologises and backs off. I know he isnt an arsehole as a person but every time he gets drunk (and he was blackout drunk but on coke so holding it together and not staggering all over the place) any and all self control and will power he has vanishes. He isnt aggressive or loud, but he gets emotionally vulnerable and will seek out physical comfort and validation anywhere he can find it. Each time he tried something he would be trying to convince me, ""just one come one, i can feel this tension between us"", even went he left, i walked him to the door, he asked for a hug and i said no, i had to grab his hand as he reached to pull me in.

Flatmate works with Friend and has passed on the message that he is no longer allowed in the flat whenever he's had a drink or is on anything else, which he has openly agreed to. Im just so angry at him and I have told him that he needs to pick a day to come over so that I can have it out with him and he can apologise to me. No response, so i asked flatmate this morning to give him a subtle reminder at work today. I am not letting this go.

Rant over, thanks for listening x"
167,My father terrifies me... Again,"I am posting this to several subs because I don´t know exactly this belongs to...

Today was once again one of those talks with my father that happen every 3-4 months or so for around past 7 years (I turned 22 a month ago).

'Talk' would imply its a conversation between me and him but really, most of the time, it's just a monologue of my father. He almost always talks about how lonely he feels, how he needs me and my brother, how I should come to visit him more often (or rather how I should visit my grandfather more often with whom he lives now), how he feels we don't care about him, how he wants to do more things with us more often...

This talk has always been to me an alarming sign of possible (emotional) narcissism and extreme neediness but today he said something that for me, gave him away and seriously makes me worried about his diagnosis, and myself too.

He said that no matter where I end up studying or working in the world he wants me/he needs me to come back and to work and live in my hometown because he didn't work and live all his life to see his grandchildren on a skype and to grow old not surrounded by his family.

I hope I pray, I am wrong about my assessment that my father is (and possibly always has been) a severe narcissist.

Look, I said to him, and I genuinely believe that in our relationship - both sides are at fault. Me and him. That's almost always the case in a relationship.

But in this situation... I really have no idea what to do about myself to adjust to this relationship besides, leaving it. If this was a good friend of mine and told me only once what my father has been saying to me for years, I would just let that relationship go - immediately, no question, no matter what I am getting from it. If you want to bring people closer to you in a certain relationship, telling them only what and how much you need out of them will achieve almost exactly the opposite.

For most of my life, I have never been close to anybody, I never had stable, close relationships with people, not even my close family members (mother, brother, father...), I never had a stable group of friends for which I genuinely care about and trust. Except for the past 3 months... I might have found them and I am finally trying to build those relationships. And now I can see how empty, lonely, and selfish my life has been and how insane and worrisome is relationship with my father.

Now I maybe see the reason why I have been this way for so long... Because I have been raised also by my father. That's maybe why I always had trust, security, self-esteem issues and such issues with creating relationships. Why I never had even a close relationship with a friend, let alone a romantic partner.

I had been raised also by a deeply scared soul. My father had a possibly distant, cold mother who raised him almost alone because my grandfather has been home only on weekends - if that. To this day if you ask him about fathers presence (my grandfather) in his childhood, you'll see a 55-year-old man turn into a sad puppy...

I really need to hear someones opinion on this, there is still a possibility that I am blind and shortsighted to many other aspects of this situation, including my own faults... Thank you."
168,i dont know what to do, mirror mirror cant you see? what you show is killing me you show my body and imperfections the dark circles under my eyes the sadness in my eyes the sense of struggle  mom? you know how i always wear a big hoodie? and why whenever you tell me to eat i say im not hungry  because i cant bring myself to eat i wear a hoodie to hide my body why do i always look sad? because i am but its much worse than that oh i look sad? sorry karen ill try and not be depressed it didnt fucking work karen your essensial oils didnt work
169,I'm genuinely sick of it,"In the past year I've had a bunch of shit going on (lost job/lost family member/hate current job). One of which has been the breakdown of my engagement with my fiancée which was caused due to a whole lot of stress. For the first time, I decided to take antidepressants and initially they destroyed me. I couldn't sleep, I was vomiting, confused, sweating profusely and incredibly anxious.

I am still with my partner (of 7 years), but I really don't know if it is the right thing for both of us anymore. I can't stop thinking about all of our differences (race/religion) and I think I struggle with relationship OCD which makes it even worse.

I'm not sure if it's time to end the relationship or if I am just battling with the depression and anxiety which has given me a negative outlook on everything. A couple of years ago I never pictured this happening and I always saw us being with eachother forever, maybe I was naive and ignored our values?

It's got to the point where I genuinely would rather be dead than feel like this and I am stuck and have nowhere else to turn. I need support.

TLDR: Depression, anxiety and relationship problems have made me start to give up on life."
170,i feel like i have to be perfect and am sensitive to every mistake. also correct if wrong flair.,"i feel like i have to be perfect with everything, especially in school. i've always been the smart kid, and when i make a mistake as little as not knowing a meaning, i feel stressed and overwhelmed. today i didn't know a word for reading and i burst out into tears, calling myself stupid. i always try to be positive, but i get anxiety and stress very easily. i've never had anyone to talk to because everyone just says ""itll be okay, there's nothing to worry about."" and let me tell you, that is awful advice. it just makes me feel worse and feel like i'm even more stupid. any help appreciated."
171,I just wanna flipping cry,[removed]
172,I am abosolutely terrified of any kind of change.,"I(15M) will start high school in 2 weeks from now. At first it seemed really exciting especially since during middle school I had awful classmates, was bullied a lot for being gay and most of the class was rude, but now I am so afraid of high school. And it's not about only big changes either, a few days ago I change my tongue posture and I cried because it seemed so unnatural to me and I had a sort of a crisis because I am changing my lifestyle...

This sound stupid but every time something changes I am emotionally destroyed, when I changed my room for privacy reasons, even though it was for the better I was depressed, when I went on a trip with my friends I was depressed because that's not usual for me. And thinking about the future, being in a relationship, getting a house of my own and having a nice job, even though these are great things, thinking about them makes me feel horrible.

This affects me a lot socially, I have a hard time making new friends, I have a hard time leaving friends that don't match interests with me anymore. I have a hard time picking up new hobbies and visiting new places, I don't think I ever felt good on a trip. The worst thing that can happen to me though is someone dying, luckily not many people died around me, but when a distant aunt of mine passed away even though I didn't know her much, just knowing that she's not around anymore made me suffer.

I cannot get professional help, my parents are both working on minimum wage and it's also a very taboo subject around here. I started reading the DSM-5 and am certain I suffer from general anxiety disorder and a milder form of borderline personality disorder, but neither said something about this. I calmed down a bit while writing this text and it might come of as vague, but I don't want to wait anymore to ask for help."
173,Overwhelmed by Complex PTSD," I am a 21 year old male student in Australia. My biggest problem is what I strongly suspect to be Complex PTSD. I have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, severe Misophonia and severe Depression. However Complex PTSD is my biggest concern.

I have no conscious memory of these events, but I found out, after asking my mum last year, that I was physically and sexually assaulted by three much older students while I was in kindergarten. This happened repeatedly, every recess and lunchtime for several weeks. I didn't know how to explain what was happening, so when I cried and refused to go outside for recess and lunch, the teachers forced me to go outside anyway, assuming I was just being badly behaved to get attention.

For as long as I can remember, I have never felt any inherent value to life. I do feel that there is value in experiencing pleasure and in avoiding suffering, but no value in being alive in and of itself. I don't gain any positive feeling from being alive, and if I found out I would die tomorrow, I would be indifferent, I wouldn't really care. Life isn't a special thing or a good thing in my eyes, and never has been.

Overall so far, life has been mostly a negative experience. When I'm just sitting on a bench doing nothing, or doing an emotionally neutral task like brushing my teeth, I feel mildly sad. Mild sadness seems to be my natural background state, with ups of mild happiness and downs of severe sadness, but always settling back down to mild sadness most of the time. So far, I would say that life has not been worth living. It has felt bad, and I haven't achieved anything that matters to me. Though I feel like whatever I achieved, it wouldn't matter to me, since I don't feel there's any inherent value in anything, I don't believe in any ideology or religion, I don't feel a sense of belonging with any community and I feel I have no purpose and that the world wouldn't be any different regardless if I was born or not.

I feel disconnected from other humans, and often when I bring this up people dismiss it as ""oh, that's normal when you have autism"", but no, I have a lot of friends who are also on the autism spectrum and the disconnection they describe is a different feeling. The disconnection I feel is on the deepest, most spiritual level imaginable. At my core I do not feel any affinity with the human race. When I look into a human face, I do not see myself any more than I do when I look into an ant face, or into a rock. I feel compassion with humans, I have friendships with them, but I do not feel I \*am\* them. I feel that everyone else has some indescribable essence of ""human-ness"", and I have an empty hole inside me where that human-ness is supposed to be. 

I feel slightly repulsed by the appearance of human faces. I feel that animal faces look pleasant, but human faces look unnatural, like some kind of weird, stiff melted spoon. Humans kind of gross me out. I don't like touching them, even though I am perfectly comfortable touching animals or plants. Humans just have an inherent ""gross-ness"". I have never felt sexual attraction to a real life human. I have felt sexual attraction to animated characters, mostly animal characters, but also some human characters which spend a lot of time around animal characters, or have animal like features like pointy ears and a tail. But I have never felt sexual attraction to a real physical human being. 

Sometimes, the environment around me will just stop feeling real. I can still feel, hear, smell, etc. It's just that it all feels ""fake"". It feels like I'm walking around inside a computer game in a digital body. Like everything is hollow or made of plastic. This feeling that nothing is real occurs randomly, and lasts about 10 minutes before quietly fading away.

It usually takes me 2 or 3 hours between getting into bed, and actually falling asleep. Generally, I have to do a single, repetitive task for hours, like alphabetically sorting files on my computer (with blue light filtered out to stop it keeping me awake), until eventually I finally get lulled into feeling sleepy. Once I do feel sleepy, I pretend to be one of my favourite fictional characters cuddling with their loved ones, and I'm able to fall asleep. When I wake up, I never feel rested. Even when I get a solid 8 or more hours sleep, it makes no difference. I still feel groggy and completely out of energy all day, every day. Caffeine helps, but only if I use it once a week, no more often than that. And it only lasts a few hours.

I have a deep fear inside me, which often manifests as rage, anger, grief, sadness or fatigue on the surface, but I think that deep down it is fear. I think that deep down I am scared that because people exist in the world with more power than me, that they could hurt me if they ever chose to, and nothing could stop them. I managed to keep this fear quiet for many years by convincing myself that willpower was the strongest force in the universe. That as long as I wanted something more strongly than anyone else wanted the opposite, and I put 100% effort into it, then I would have my way. And therefore I would always be safe. However, this belief was undermined last year when I campaigned really hard for months for my favourite character not to be removed from a long running video game series, and he was removed anyway. That proved money and influence outweighs willpower, and so, I'm not safe.

In the immediate aftermath of that, I felt the most intense emotional pain of my entire life. Extreme anger, extreme sadness, extreme self hatred. I would randomly break out crying in class, there would be days where I physically couldn't force myself to move and I would stay in bed all day, curled up as small as I could make myself. I was in so much emotional pain all day, every day, that I made plans to kill myself at a specific time, and had the means to do so, but I was talked out of it by an online friend, and went to hospital instead. At the time I thought I was childish and weak and fundamentally degenerate beyond all repair for feeling so upset over a video game. But I've since realised that I wasn't actually upset over the video game, I was upset over being sexually abused, and the video game simply undermined the defence mechanism I was using to keep my fear of the world out of my conscious life.

I am not in that intense pain anymore, thanks to a very high dose of Effexor, but I am still very tired, and mildly sad, all day every day, and life is an overall unpleasant experience. I don’t want to kill myself, but if I were to die today, I would say I didn't have a good life, and overall, life wasn't worth it. 

I desperately want to stop feeling like this. Somehow, I want to feel like I AM human. I want to feel like life IS worth living. I want to NOT feel uncomfortable with the fact that people exist with more power than I have. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help. And the key word is ""feel"". I don’t need to THINK life is worth living. There are plenty of rational reasons life is worth living. But no matter what I think, I don't FEEL like it is. Somehow I need to make these feelings stop. All I want is just to have the same sparkle in my eye as everyone else. I just want to be able to be glad to be alive. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help to learn how.

I have been trying to see psychologists through the public health system, but both the psychologists I've been assigned to have not understood what I'm telling them at all, and have either not given me solutions at all and dismissed everything as being due to my autism, or they have given me completely useless solutions that didn't change anything and have interrupted me when I try to clarify what I've said or try to describe my feelings. They keep assuming I mean something else and won't let me explain what I'm actually feeling and it's so frustrating. They end up making me feel worse than when the appointment started. So at this stage, I've given up on the public system, I just want to get better, no matter what it costs."
174,What could be causing this?,"I dont know how else to describe this, but i feel like my main problem is almost always feeling sad and lethargic and hopeless, but when im with someone, either be it one person or a friend group, i get very energetic, 'happy', loud and fast, basically bouncing off the walls, but the instant im alone again i feel drained and suicidal. There is a possibility that my anxiety is causing me to have this much energy, but it just confuses me and makes me think i might be bipolar. Ive 'researched' (basically just googled and read other peoples research and experiences) a lot of possibilities of what this might be, but havent found one that really clicks. I go to a psychiatrist and currently searching for a therapist, but id like to have at least a little idea of what this might be so the sessions go more productive. Im not searching for a diagnosis here, just for other peoples thoughts and ideas of what could be causing this, since its really draining and i want to learn to cope with it better."
175,"I keep seeing the numbers 9 and 11 and every time I see them I feel a sense of dread that fades quickly, does this mean anything?","So I’ve been seeing 9 and 11 everywhere recently and they are always together one way or another. I have an appointment on September 9th and September 11th, when I read something on the Internet 9 and 11 is somewhere in the comment, when I checked Instagram just now for my notifications “this person liked your post 9m ago” “this person likes your post 11sec ago” THATS WAY TO FUCKING COINCIDENTAL

176,I’m breaking.,"Yesterday I was 466 days clean (of SH) and something triggered me and I relapsed. Everyday starts out okay as in I’m numb but then by 7:00pm I am very low. I feel like end of summer is when I start to get depressed (actually it’s been happening this year since March but technically last December) and it lasts until February (sometimes January). The homework load is overloading my mental health and I feel like I’m back to where I was two years ago. Two years ago I wasn’t doing so great because the sport that I was in at the time was causing me anxiety. Now I’ve been clean for 5 minutes. I’ve also have been starting to dissociate. I’ve probably shave had 3 ish episodes in the last 4-5 days (they each last a few hours). I haven’t been able to focus on my school work because I feel no motivation and I have to force myself to act normal. I haven’t really have had time for myself in two weeks. I mean I’m sometimes dissociating while doing my school work and I am still forcing myself to do it just do I can turn it in on time. The other day I had two sticky notes full of homework. I still haven’t had time to turn in one thing (it isn’t late) but I’m probably doing it today. I mean and now I feel bad. I’ve been almost spamming my friend but then I found out about an hour or two after that, that her close friend passed away. I sent her a text saying if you need anything such as a place to vent I’m here for you. She’s the only friend that I have that checks in on me. I check in with her too. We both struggle with mental health and we kinda feel a bit better about ourselves responding to a text. 


If anyone is reading this please check in on you friends. Please please do."
177,Why does interacting with people cause me to loose control of myself?,"Interacting with people amps up  all my emotions and makes me feel jittery and out of control. Not in the sense that I have zero restraint but my thoughts start racing, my heart beats like crazy and sometimes my hands start shaking. I say things that I wouldn’t usually say and it feels like the world is moving too fast. I don’t feel like myself when I interact with people for an extended period of time.

The worst bit is the come down. After I stop interacting with people it takes a while for the high to wear off but I feel drained, dizzy and sometimes I feel nauseous. This used to happen far less frequently but now I can barely have conversations with most people without feeling faint afterwards.
 
The only exception to this is my family. I have to interact with them on a daily basis so talking to them doesn’t feel intense. However, when I have an argument or a conversation that causes me to feel very angry or happy I feel just as erratic in those moments and just as exhausted afterwards as I do with other people. 

I’ve tried to figure out what’s going on but I’ve haven’t found any explanation on what this is. Could I be suffering from a mental health issue or am I just really emotional?"
178,Love daydreaming but i forget im me a lot,[removed]
179,Anxiety or truth?,"I have always, My entire life, Felt like no one truly likes me. Of course except for my family who obviously cares for me. My SO I know cares for me as well as my best friend but I feel like everyone else couldn’t care less. From “friends” that blow me off and never come to hang out like they say they will. To classmates and teachers that don’t talk to me unless they have to. I know when I was younger I was very energetic and silly and that may have been a factor on people not wanting to be around me but I still have the feeling. It’s never gone away and it breaks me so badly. I’m usually a very happy and giving person. I love spending time with people and I’m always up to help. But I feel like no one likes me or cares about me aside from those who make it obvious. For example. One of my managers came up to my coworkers and I while we were at our desks (four people including him) and asked how our weekends were. After he got responses he went from person to person and asked for details about their weekend. He asked both of my coworkers but didn’t ask me and just walked off. I know I’m newer but it still made me feel awkward. I’ve never had coworkers try to hang out after work even if we get along super well. Another example are “friends” who make plans with me to come over and hang out and then never show up without saying anything but when I go on social media they’ve all gone out to eat. Everyone that was going to come over. Just not me. I always feel completely out of place and I hate it. I try so hard to be nice to people because I don’t see a reason not to but I feel like no one likes me and is too nice to say anything. I hate feeling this way and it makes me feel so alone."
180,"I can’t stop, psych ward?",I am a college student who is severely depressed. I can’t stop thinking of wanting to not exist. It’s my first thought in the morning and I just think of killing myself constantly. I don’t think I will because if I was going to I would have already done so. I feel like a shell of a person. I could just lay in bed and stare at my ceiling all day and be fine. I am filled with just an immense sadness. I have no motivation to do anything. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing. I saw a tweet the other day that said if you had an hour left to live who would you spend it with and what would you do. My answer was no one and just stare at the ceiling. My days are just endless loops that don’t end. I don’t even look forward to sleeping because I know I will wake up and it will all begin again. The only time I laughed was when I was high the other day. God I just wish I was dead. I can’t see this ever getting better. I see a therapist and I am on 10mg lexapro for 20 days. Do you guys think a psych ward would help? I don’t know what to do. All I do is cry. Being around my friends doesn’t help. Nothing helps.
181,I constantly feel empty.,"I’m 16 years of age and I have been plagued for 2 years with this constant feeling of emptiness. I’ve been crying I don’t know if it’s loneliness, regret, fear, dissatisfaction or lack of love I just feel empty and hollow. I would like some advice or suggestions on what it could be so I can triangulate the reason and hopefully fix it."
182,Weight of Gold - Athletes and Mental Health,"Hi all,

I (25M) recently watched a documentary on HBO called ""Weight of Gold"" looking into the mental health of Michael Phelps and other Olympic Athletes post competition. As a former athlete myself, I related to this video because my own Athletic career was cut short due to reasons beyond my control leading me into depression. My identity was being an Athlete. It was what I was best at, what I loved to do, and what I was known for. The years following the conclusion of my athletic career, I felt a lack of direction, motivation, and purpose heading into College, after having to forgo my dream to play college football. I played team sports (football and baseball) and missed the camaraderie, brotherhood and push to be better that I experienced being a part of these teams. There is so much that sports provide that you can't find in the ""real world"". 

Applying the athlete mentality to the real world has been challenging for me to find a place that I feel like I fit in. It's taken me years to find an outlet for my competitiveness and drive. I'm posting this here to get feedback from you all and see if others have experienced some form of mental health struggle during/after competition as well, no matter what skill level. 

If any of you are going through this currently and don't want to share your story, just know you aren't alone. If anyone would like to share their story and how they cope with/overcame their struggle, I encourage you to post and maybe together we can help someone move forward and overcome their struggle.

Hope you all have a great day."
183,I feel so overwhelmed,"Sorry for bad formatting/grammar/anythung. I'm crying and on mobile.

I go to an all year round college in Florida while littlerally everyone else I know is back home or living in another state. My mom has been hounding me because I've been failing my classes because depression in the pandemic is really hard for me to deal with. On top of that I've been feeling really low key suicidal. 

On top of all that my cat just had a blockage and nearly died. He's back home now but he's leaking and my apartment and self are basically covered in cat pee and medicine. I'm all alone because my roommate is out of town with her parents and I honestly think the only reason I haven't kicked the bucket yet is because I don't want to leave my cat in such a vulnerable state. 

Idk what to do its all so overwhelming, i can't sleep or eat, and my apartment is a disaster and I have no energy to clean it. I found a ant swarm today too after a fight with my mom and littlerally had a breakdown over it. I told my friends and we scheduled a video call tonight but I feel so shitty I wanna cancel"
184,Fmla for bipolar?,Has anyone ever gone on fmla for a depressive episode? I’m having a very difficult time getting out of bed much less working and my coworkers are noticing. I’m going to have to disclose my mental health if I want to keep my job. Not sure how to go about it. Any advice is appreciated
185,"I just realized that I genuinely enjoy working unskilled jobs more than anything else, but I feel incredibly guilty because of my upbringing.","Hi! I feel like I need some unbiased perspectives on this... Wondering if anyone else relates, too... Here goes: I'm 27F, second language English speaker from Europe, have been struggling with depression and anxiety symptoms since high school, and I suspect I might be on the austism spectrum (undiagnosed). I feel like I've come to a sudden realization recently, after 7 years of failing college multiple times, going back, and working odd jobs in between. 

Genuinely the happiest time in my life so far was when I worked simple, routine manual jobs, such as a clerk in small retail stores or taking inventory. I love the clear rules of such workplaces, peace and quiet (I was often alone on my shift at those stores), low levels of stress, counting and organizing rows of things oat my own pace. I even enjoy cleaning. I managed to develop a customer service persona and not freak out when I had to talk to customers, even though I normally have social anxiety, especially on the phone etc. I would probably be totally content for the rest of my life if I could get a full-time job as a cashier or janitor or something along those lines (but even those jobs require years of experience at this point, so I've only worked on grey-area part time contracts so far - the chaotic shift planning and unfair conditions sometimes stemming from that are the only aspect I don't enjoy).

Here's the problem, though: every single person who knows me in real life would say it would be a ""waste"" for me to ""settle"" for these kinds of jobs instead of a ""real"" office-type career. I was the typical case of a ""gifted"" child in school, but I started failing the moment I went to college and stopped having a structured life pushed on me from the outside. I never found any marketable skill I would be passionate about long-term. My family has always encouraged me to go to college at any cost, they don't even really mind me being financially dependent on them for however long it takes until I finally get a diploma from \*something\*, anything. I'm dependent partly on them and partly on my partner, who also has his own mental health struggles. I do feel bad for ""betraying"" him, my family, and my supposed ""potential"" by failing in almost everything I try to do.

Of course having a middle class job would be better financially, but I don't see that in my future at this point, and I'm afraid I'd be constantly overwhelmed and unhappy about it anyway. I know that ""intellect"" is about the least important part of getting a ""good"" job if you struggle with basic social relationships and have weird quirks, because that's exactly the case of my father. He would discourage me from unskilled jobs because he feels like his physical health was impacted by decades of night shifts, but honestly... he would have had the opportunity to do re-qualification courses or even go to college later in life if he wanted, and he never did, so I kind of suspect he didn't truly want to. Mental health has unfortunately always been a taboo topic with my parents, but some things were pretty obvious even to a child...

Anyway. Sorry if this is too long. I feel like I'm at a crossroad in my life and all the options are scary. I can't take the constant anxiety of college and feeling like I'm failing everyone around me. The relationship with my partner has been in shambles ever since I went back to college. I want a peaceful life, but I feel like I might regret that for the rest of my life too. Anyone relate to this? Or at least tell me you've read it? Thanks :)"
186,suicidal thoughts,"I’ve been having very bad suicidal thoughts recently. They have been very convincing, I used to always say “Yeha but i know i would t ACTUALLY do it.” but now i don’t know.

i see my therapist in two days just for weekly appointments. should i tell her? what if she tells my mom? i don’t know I have had suicidal thoughts for months now since i got diagnosed with depression, but they have never been this bad. i am afraid i am going to hurt myself.

i don’t know what to do. i know if i tell my mom she would just not really know what to do and probably just tell me to get some water and calm down. I know i can last a few more days of these thoughts until they get to a point where i need actual help. should i just wait it out? i really don’t know what to do.

sum: Suicidal thoughts, therapist later this week should i tell her? afraid no one will help me or i will already be too deep into them to get help.

I am a 15yr Female Btw

187,Falling into old patterns again 💔,"I have a history of trust issues and paranoia. I spent the last 3 years working hard to get over them and I was actually in a good place..then I had some difficult days and the paranoia is back. I feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me, I feel like he's into other girls, my mind is making up irrational situations. I spent so much mental energy getting over this, I can't afford to go through this again. My paranoia triggers suicidal thoughts and much more. I don't feel like bringing this up with my boyfriend because we have already had many discussions and heated fights over this. I can't believe this is happening, I can't believe I'm gallon into old thinking patterns 
again. I need help, please help me 💔"
188,Is medication worth it?,"OK, so firstly I have usually always been an advocate or medication and believed how if it makes you feel any better then surely its worth it.

Secondly, I'm in the UK and I am truly grateful for the NHS, especially during this corona crisis and I largely believe they do good work.

However, I am taking Fluoxetine for depression and Propranolol for anxiety and I have had nothing but trouble dealing with my doctor and the system to have these sorted and available. I've ran out on multiple occasions, not been able to get tablets when I them and had times where they'll say I need a checkup, then I can't have the checkup till a time where I'll be without tablets for days before they'll give it to me. Basically I am fed up and I really am done dealing with them, it makes my anxiety worse and I don't want to rely on the tablets in general, but especially when it's such an unreliable system and not to mention the fortune I am now paying for them.

I get pms bad anyway which Fluoxetine doesn't help with and I did think the beta blockers were helping my anxiety but I end up having times without them which isnt healthy and I end up just scared of everything until I have them again.

I know everyone is different with medication but I never hear of people not having meds or finding they're better without after trying them. I just don't want to deal with it all anymore but of course I don't want to make my condition any worst. I'm struggling most the time anyhow but I guess if the meds make it any easier then I need them but argh idk if it's worth it"
189,seeing friends together makes me remember that im not good enough to have any,"So today, I got dressed, did my makeup, felt confident, got into town and just didn't feel that way anymore. And I remembered why.

I dont have friends that aren't virtual. I've never had a reletionship. I've only ever been wanted to quick sex/hookups. All my friends that i've had for 5+ years have all ghosted me out of nowhere, including my best friend who was very dear and important to me. Clearly I'm not somebody that people want to have around. I'm not worth it. I dont know why and its eating up inside

I've never gotten closure from those friendships that ended out of nowhere. The lonliness has kept me awake at night crying. ""Did I say something?"" ""Did my best friend kill herself? Is that why she hasn't called?"" ""Is she dead?"" (my bestfriend, suicidal and on meds, suddenly stopped replying) Why doesn't anyone want to be my friend? Ive always wanted to know what is genuinely wrong with me.
Deep down I know it's just because they weren't great friends/people and were just to lazy to put the effort in. But I blame myself and my faults regardless and try to fix them, because i cannot take anymore heartbreak. I don't want to lose anyone again and have to cry at night thinking they're possibly dead for months. You have to understand that the lonliness at night is painful. I can't do it again.

Its become so overwhelming that I think everything is wrong with me

"" Its because i'm a size 8 and not a 6. It's cause i have too much body fat, it's my hairstyle, it's my voice, it's my clothes, it's my smile, i need to cut no i need to bulk I'm not smart enough, not skinny enough, not social enough etc etc. ""  I can't risk losing someone again so i'm trying to fix everything i can about myself. But its so hard. 


In quarantine, i was so happy mentally. this mindset was slowly fading. But I saw a group of friends today getting boba together in a cafe. They all made plans to do this together. They looked so happy and everything. I just turned around and went home ashamed of being me."
190,I feel like my mental health is an inconvenience for everyone,"I called my doctor’s office today to request a medication change. I was there in June, but this anti depressant wasn’t helping me at all. Unfortunately I’m in college and I don’t have $50 every month to just pay a co pay for my doctor’s office. 

The secretary was so rude. “Why didn’t you come in before you went to college?” Maybe because I didn’t have the money or time to go in because I also work at a hospital? And that I had to isolate before I left for college because I got tested for COVID? That I wanted to wait and make sure this medication wasn’t working so I didn’t feel like I wasted $70. 

“Now we have to play phone tag because the Doctor probably wants to talk to you.” Okay? I’m sorry my mental state is an inconvenience for you."
191,I’m not ofuckingkay.,"I haven’t been legitimately happy since I was a baby when my dad left. Yes I remember all of it. He had called the police on my mom once for dropping us off at his house with his girlfriend at the time while he was at work and my mom had to be at work in half an hour. She didn’t leave us there, she took all 3 of us to work. She works in a grocery store. We had to sit upstairs with the security until the police came to talk to my mom. We spent her entire shift upstairs with the security. When I was just about to turn 2 my dad was caught buying crack. He was a user before but he had promised he would stop for us. My mom went to work the next day and took us to our grandpas, we got home and our home was completely empty, with a note saying he’s gone. All my toys, my clothes, my BED, the food in the fridge, the tv, the couches, everything was gone. Fast forward to 3? Years later my dad got custody of us over the weekends. Those weekends where never ending with “SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING TRUCK” “YOU ACT JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER” “YOU DRESS RAGGEDY LIKE YOUR HOMELESS AND YOU DONT BRUSH YOUR HAIR” “IF YOU WANNA CRY GO TO YOUR FUCKING ROOM AND SHUT THE FUCK UP””YOUR STEP BROTHER HAS MORE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WHAT THEY HAVE” I could go on for mother fucking days. I was always around booze and cocaine, so when I started running away that became my go to drug. Then it was acid and mushrooms, Then it was meth. Then it was cocaine and Xanax mixed together and that’s when I thought I finally reached my goal. Death. I was having a seizure when my heart had stopped for 5 minutes. I was so longer breathing or responsive. I woke up out of my seizure to the medics trying to give me water. I asked if I could sit down on the couch and they’d let me. I had another seizure on that couch. I was refusing to go to the ambulance but since I was under age they had the right to force me under form 4. On the ride to the hospital I had 2 more seizures. Then one more before I got treatment. Note these weren’t small seizures, my heart stopped every time. And fuck do I ever wish it didn’t start back up. Fast forward 5 years later I got back into cocaine and molly and Xanax. My boyfriend had threatened to leave me at the time because he knew I died from my last overdose. I got clean blah blah blah blah blah. Drug urges are still there. I had gotten arrested when I was 15 for a home robbery. I was the get away driver. I was put on probation till the day I turned 18. While I was on probation I got into a horrid relationship. He was abusive, in every way. He threatens to kill me then himself, he asked me if I wanted to watch him die, he smashed my windows which caused me to move 2 hours away, he caused 3,000$ in damages which my landlord could sue me for now that I’m over 18 but I haven’t heard from them. Fast forward to now. If you made it here. Good ass mother fucking job. I now have to go to court because he murdered his ex girlfriend. He murdered her. And I have to go testify the fact that he tried to do the same shit to me. I’ve had PTSD since I can remember and nothings helped. Nothing. I fucking give up. I’m on so much medicine I can’t afford to pick half of them up. When I go to the pharmacy she ask which once’s I need the most. My boyfriend questions our relationship because I cannot work right now. COVID took away the only job I was comfortable working at. I don’t have any friends, I’m not kidding when I say that. At all. I wish I was fuck. I’m scared. I’m scared he’s gonna come back. I’m scared he hasn’t been put in custody yet and he’s still out there. I try to explain my anxiety to my doctor but I have to much fucking anxiety to say anything right. I can’t support myself in anyway, I can’t buy food, meds, coffee, cigarettes, anything. My bank is at $1.82 and collection agencies and my pharmacy will not stop calling me. I took double the dose of my anxiety meds while writing this and I’m fucking tired. I want to take more so I don’t just wake up. I’m tired of explaining myself. I’m tired of telling everybody what’s wrong just for an “awwww” I’m fucking tired. I’m done. I’m done. I’m done.

192,"As someone with autism, I'm scared to express myself","People with autism are often bullied on the internet for liking ""cringey"" special interests such as Sonic, anime, or other cartoons, and there's a study liking anime and cartoons as being comforting for people with autism. I've been struggling with accepting myself for years because of my autism, I was bullied a lot as a kid and I sometimes feel like a burden on my friends and family. I'm afraid to love things that make me happy such as cartoons and anime because I don't wanna get bullied for it. I'm just afraid of being alive, I'm scared that the world hates people with autism."
193,psychology vs neurology,"hey guys I was thinking about mental health last night, and how interesting the brain is. that I decided to do some research over on the difference of neurology and psychology. I was quite surprised on how indifferent and similar they are.

194,My mental health deteriorates since school started again.,"I don't know what I have. Ever since school started everything felt grey. I was always someone who had social anxiety but it never was this bad and for some reason the ""grey feeling"" comes after school and goes away in the evening. I can't describe the feeling. I feel like I want to cry but cant. I don't know why this shit started. I have a healthy amount of social contacts and everything."
195,I never want to do anything social (ie go out with friends) yet I feel immense jealousy when I see other people in my life being social...why is this?,"I can and do usually have fun on the rare occasion I can actually push myself or be persuaded to go out and do something social, but I almost always feel dread at the thought of it. At the thought of going out and interacting, whether that be with one friend, a group of friends, or even with visiting family members. 

I don’t know why I am like this? It’s not like I don’t want these interactions or relationships, because I often feel quite jealous of others I see engaging in social relationships. For example, my brother. He is a few years younger than me and far more social. We both live with one of my parents for the time being and every time I hear him say he’s going out to meet up with x or have lunch with y I feel so jealous and sad inside. I then think to myself how I could be like my brother and cultivate these kinds of relationships if I tried and then the apathy and dread about doing anything social comes sinking back in...why? I don’t understand."
196,Incompetent Doctors?,"Does anyone have an issue with doctors who seem to want to ""wrap up"" and appointment as fast and easy as possible? I have been going to three diffrent docs over the past year and I cant really say I have improved to much. Everytime I call in, I will list my symptoms in hopes that everything will be noted and acknowlaged. However, upon my visit it seems that they pick the least difficult symptom to treat and then prosceed to talk ""at"" me, rather than let me speak my peace. It seems every visit is getting more and more bleak, I am losing hope that I will ever get the help I need. Not to mention that all counciling is over the phone, which I can't stand. I made an appointment for face-to-face and its a whole month out. All is not well in waffleville :/"
197,Job affectting mental health,"Guys I need your advise here. My job I've noticed is really affecting my mental health. I've noticed that I'm semi dead insode and today paniced once my boss shouted at me. 
The pay isn't that great so its not to much of a material loss but I'm kind of worried with the current economic situation I wont be able to get another job very easily. That kind of CV gap would look really bad especially since I started my current career path later than some of my peers (I'm 30 with about 2 years of work experience). 
Could you just advise what I can do?"

When it happened we had dogs and a cat in the back (There perfectly fine we had belts for them"" I went and forced my door open and my sister stopped moving i ran to her side slammed her door open and tried but she was okay and i got her out the whole time i was thinking (Please dont leave me please dont leave me) and thats to summarize i have a concussion of sorts im scratched all up but just im not feeling thankful for life and i dont understand why. There are so many others who didnt live and im here just existing not really for a reason as its just (wrong to kill yourself) something of that sorts not saying i want to just. Life is plain im always doing the same thing and just its boring even before covid i was like this just stay at home play games and talk to like 2 people everyday. I guess im undeserving of life. But regardless this shit hurts and im glad my sister and dogs are okay but as for me just wish it would go away or just put me in a sort of coma as life for me is already seeming to be a dead end"
199,Roommates make me depressed,"I am renting a room in a house and there is this new housemate that moved in two months ago who is very bold and inconsiderate. Previously, all roommates will mind their own business and stay in respective rooms. But this guy is always at the kitchen and living room. Always an obstruction for us to cook, etc. he is always slamming doors and cupboards. Always leaves the lights on and wasting electricity. I told him to turn off lights when not in use and he got angry. How am i going to tell him to stop with other bad habits? 
I told my landlord about this and all he did was send a general email to save electricity, bla bla bla.

I cant rent elsewhere because currently i am on a month to month basis and I dont want start a contract renting elsewhere. Because i may have to move to another city if my job requires.

I feel so depressed everyday and I dont know what to do."
200,My best friends roommate killed himself and she walked in after she heard the gunshot.,"My best friend is my cousin and the roommate who killed him self is also my cousin. I spent a lot of time with him especially growing up but she was extremely close with him. I just feel sick to my stomach after hearing this news. Clearly she is going through intense trauma and I don’t know how to be there for her. I reached out to my aunt (her mom) and she said they need space. I absolutely understand I just don’t know what to do. I’ve started to feel guilty that I’m affected by this too. It happened yesterday so I just found out this morning while getting ready for work, my boss told me to take the day off but I feel guilty about that too, I feel like I don’t have the right to take a day when someone I care about is going through something so much more intense. I wish I could put all my energy into being there for her. Are these feelings normal? And how do I support someone who has been through something like this when she is ready to be social again."
201,Became an uncle today and I couldn't care less.,"My brother became a dad today, and i cannot be happy for him, nor do I want to know as I simply don't care.

Me and him have had a strained relationship for the last few years, but it came to a boiling point just over 2 years ago. February 2018, I went off sick from work with what turned out to be (after 3 months of testing) a severe panic attack (I had never had one). Doctors signed me off for 2 weeks and to be fair, my work were really good about it. 2 days before I am due back into work, my brother returns home from a whole day of drinking. I could hear him mouthing off to my mother about me so I walked downstairs, he saw me and attacked me, in front of my own mother. My father had to pull him off me. My mother took pictures of my injuries in case I wanted to go to the police (which I didn't end up doing). The next day, he tried apologising, but i ignored it because he was only doing it because he was told to. 2 days after the attack, I was in hospital, and after tests, confirmed I had concussion and bruised neck/back muscles so had to go off work for another 2 weeks. Because of this, my absence rocketed and I almost lost my job. In addition, I had to beg my university lecturer not to fail me; I ended up breaking down to him and told him everything, he was very sympathetic.

A few months pass, and i am still awaiting my apology (a proper one). My mother is now trying to push me to meet him halfway. I refused as I stood my ground and told her if he was really sorry, he would come to me on his own. He refused to deal with his drinking problem and refused counselling, stating that it was pointless for him. Meanwhile, I am still suffering with flashbacks and nightmares of the event that took place. I should probably add at this point that he is a teacher.

Just after Christmas, a big argument took place between me and my mother, and because his partner got involved, I packed my bags and left, crying the entire way to my partners house. I stayed there for about 2 months before I had to go back as work and uni travel was costing me a fortune. Eventually, he moved out, with his partner. This was 16 months after the event and still nothing, no remorse.

My parents at this point are furious at me, and begin taking his side, because he didn't know how to fix what he did and didn't know how to approach me, to which I replied, not my problem, he did what he did, now he suffers the consequences. Because i refused to relax my stance, my parents have a better relationship with him, than they do with me. They also have a better relationship with his partner than me, and his partner covered up the paedophilic acts of her own father (she is also a teacher). There was also huge uproar when i didn't want him at my graduation. My reasoning was someone who almost cost me it doesn't deserve to be there to celebrate it. I caved in once and sent him a birthday card and a present, which my parents found lovely of me. But come my birthday, I received nothing, not even a card, to which my parents said ""well what do you expect, you don't talk to him?"" So they make rules up to ensure he is happy but change them to make me miserable and angry.

It has been 2 and half years and this is still not resolved. I have cut ties with my mother and my brother. I have been to counselling, still on medication, still get nightmares from time to time of what happened, and i can't see a way back anywhere unless my parents actually see things from my perspective and stop treating my brother like the victim. I have no feelings towards him and my feelings to my mother are mixed at best. I am happy to wait for my new nephew to come and find me and i am happy to give him all the answers and truths he wants, but i simply cannot let my guard down and let him back into my life, as my brother is toxic and negative. His actions, combined with my parents, pushed me to self harm, almost wanting to end it all. I am better for not having them in my life. Am I a bad person for ignoring an innocent child?"

206,I've never been diagnosed with any metal illness but I know I have a lot of things wrong with me. (Need some help with just everything.),"Sorry if this is all over the place, I guess it's a bit rant like but I really just need some help.

Ok. To clarify, I haven't been to the doctors in years. I know it's bad. I've been told by ,y college's consular (and basically everyone else) that I do have metal problems and that I should go to one.

(The doctors make me really anxious and panicky.)

So I know I have depression, anxiety and OCD but I've never been diagnosed by a doctor. I don't really feel safe saying that to people though because I don't want to sound like those people who think being neat is automatically OCD and I don't want people to think I'm over exaggerating even though I have very public break downs in my classes. (Every teacher I've had in college they have had to deal with me having a breakdown \[I don't know what to call them but they were much worse than a panic attack.\])

I'm too afraid that people are going to say something like 'everyone has anixity and/or depression get over it.'

I guess most people on here know what having depression and anixity is like on here so I'm not going to go into detail about it but I do think I have OCD (even if it's not extreme like over peoples.)

I have to do certain thing a certain way or I'm going to break down or have a panic attack, like I get so scared that if I don't touch the fridge door to make sure it's closed or wiggle the drippy tap to make sure  the water gets out or make sure all the taps are off I can't to next thing I need to do.

Like when I'm going to bed I can take up to half an hour just walking around the kitchen making sure everything is off and even then I can go to bed and I think 'the tap is still on' and I have to get out and make sure it off. (Thus starting the cycle again.)

And there's just small things like when I take my glasses off I have to fold them then unfold them, then fold them again (how ever many time I feel the need to do it) before putting them on my face.

And there's the 'normal' things like how I like my stuff to be placed in a certain way.

Maybe I'm overthinking and this isn't OCD.

Also lately I've been going weird around loud sounds. 

Like today I had like four different sound all around me and I just froze, like I couldn't carry on with making some food. (It's been happening a lot lately, just many different loud sounds all around me just makes me feel off, I don't really know how to describe it.

Basically I need everyone opinions.

I'm going back to college next week for a new course (so last thing I did was A-levels which is you don't know are separate subjects.) This course is an art course aka something I'm into. And because it's just art I feel like my stress will be lower (for a-levels I did very different subjects that were more writing based which wasn't the best idea.)

But ther's till the whole thing that there's going to be completely new teachers and people around me.

That paired with my 'OCD' is mostly to do with touching stuff and covid. And how I can't sit still in my chairs and how I need to fiddle with something.

Basically there's a whole fucking lot and I haven't even properly talked about my depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm and anxiety.

I don't know. It's all messed up and I really needed to tell someone and I really need some advice."
207,How to get a prescription to fight insomnia?,"I’ve been struggling with insomnia my whole life. It gets in the way of me focusing and being ready for school and work. I’m in college and I need to do well and it’s hard when I have to go to class on no sleep every other day. I have no experience with mental health facilities. 

Who do I talk to? How do I get it? How can I make it the easiest? I don’t necessarily have time to talk to someone every week being a full time student. Of course, I don’t have the unlimited funds either. 

Any help?"
208,A spiritual individual spoke to me about a possible solution.,"I generally don't think psychedelics are the key to a healthier mind, but from the conversation I had with this person, I can tell they are in a way improved. Do any of you believe that ayahuasca is the answer I've been seeking?"
209,Do you ever reach a point in your life where you evaluate your surroundings and realize how little people care?,"The other day at work we had a going away zoom party for one of our older employees who was retiring. There were so many people saying so many great things about him (and rightfully so he's an awesome man). He's worked here for 3 years though as his old company was transitioning in changes and he didn't want to leave just yet, so he can and worked with us.

I'm not sure why but during his call I just stopped and thought, if I were to leave today there wouldn't be a zoom call. There wouldn't be speaking my praise, it would just be me leaving and nothing more.

It just got me thinking about life in general, how every relationship I have is a result of someone thinking I'm a great husband to their daughter/sister/friend or because I'm a great father to their grandchild/nephew. 

I don't have anyone in my life that genuinely knows me for me. I love being a father and a husband and those are really the only things that have given my life purpose to other people in the 30+ years I've been alive. They're new feelings. I didn't get married until I was 30. I didn't have kids until after I was married.

I'm just so used to being alone for my entire life that it feels fake if anyone says they care about me or they love me because they really don't even know me. They just love me because of how I treat the people they actually love. 

It's so hard to separate myself from being a father and husband. These are the things I'm most proud of in life, but at the same time it's also feels like I'm not ME anymore. I'm just an extension of someone else. I wouldn't trade my life for anything. I love my wife and my son more than anything and the life we've created is all I've ever wanted. It's heaven when we're together and we're a family. But in the nights where my son goes to sleep and my wife is doing something else not involving me I just feel empty inside."
210,Just empty,"It’s been a little over a year now since things ended with the person I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with and I just can’t get this empty feeling out of my chest. I don’t know how to explain it. It’s not that I’m sad anymore it’s just empty. Along with this, I just hate who I am. I don’t do anything that’s necessarily bad or off I just don’t like the person I am . It just sucks haha"
211,Has anyone stories of improved mental health after quitting smoking cigarettes?,"Or has stopping another substance or activity notably improved your mental health?

I'm looking at the latest Public Health England data (an official government body here in England) that states over 1 in every 4 (26.8%) of adults suffering with a long term mental health condition are cigarette smokers in England.

This compares to the average smoking prevalence rate in England (as of 7th July 2020) being at 13.9%.

(data here for reference -  [https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/smoking](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/smoking))

I've also read on the UK's NHS website that ""stopping smoking can be as effective as antidepressants""

(also for reference -  [https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/stopping-smoking-mental-health-benefits/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/stopping-smoking-mental-health-benefits/)) 

 I'm interested to hear about people's stories for how this might be the case, and what effect this ultimately had on your mental health...

\- How much did smoking cigarettes impact your health - physical and mental - directly? 

\- Did you find there was an indirect correlation with increased financial pressure? 

\- Would you recommend other smokers who are struggling with mental health issues to quit smoking before all else?"
212,Recently emded 2 friendships.,"To start off with, i dont want sides picked or anything like that, i just meed to get my thoughts out. 

I recently ended 2 of ,y closest friendships. Ive been dealing with a lot of stress and mental health issues to do with psychosis and memory. Ive been thinking and being prompted and have come to realise a lot of my cherished as well as less pleasent memories never happened. My voices were telling me that everyone hated me and i should end my life, and at that point i couldnt help but believe them, so i abruptly cut ties with them. Ill admit i was slightly agressive when questioned about it, and thats on me, but afterwards the overwhelming guilt that i did it took over and i nearly took my life. The friendship with one of them was always rocky and i did this to protect myself from doing something id regret and toprotect them from doing something that could harm them. They took it as an offence (which i cant understand) but my voices amd hallucinations as well as how bad they took it refrained me from telling the whole story. The guilt is just overwhelming and i feel like i will never get over this. But i get small breaks of “this is the best for everyone and i did the right thing” but then is comes crashing down again. Im so lost and confused. And yes i have other friends, but im questioning if i am any good for them or if im just a burden that should just distance myself from everyone i know until they forget about me.

Sorry bit of a rant and trying to get something of my chest"

214,I dont know what to do i want it all to end,"At first i want to say sorry for my english, it isnt my primary language.

I had no easy childhood, my parents divorced and due to the missing father i wasnt easy to handle for my mum, she lost her job and got very ill so we always just had enough money to survive.

I was always a misfit, i gained a couple friends when i got to my second school in 5th grade but even those friends disappoint me very very often.

Those friends don’t live close to me and me and my family can’t afford a car for me and i don’t have friends in my town.
I cant buy one because i can’t work, I’ll tell u why: 

When i was 14 (I’m 18) i got diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and this illness controls most of my life and it hit me pretty hard, i have nearly every symptom you can get through this illness.
The illness and the side effects of my medication are limiting me a lot.

I missed a lot of school because i was always ill, people started to talk trash about me because my body is ill on the inside not on the outside.
Even the teachers made fun of me and gave me worse grades than i should’ve got, even if i i wrote the exact same things in tests as other students i got less points, the teachers always found a way to justify their behaviour.
Since October 19 i wasn’t in school because I’m never in a stable health condition, i have to take opioids to get out of bed in the morning otherwise i cant stand up due to pain.
Now i have to redo 12th grade, i did 2 years in school for nothing, i still don’t have any more than i had after 10th grade.
School makes it really hard for me, they never understood my health situation and they never will, even if my doctors tell them im in a bad condition they still want me to do a lot of work and just ignore everything they get told and they keep giving me bad grades due to that.

Due to getting ill i isolated myself since the end of 2019 and covid makes everything worse.

The only people that loved me in my life are my family and even there i always was the outsider.
If they weren’t there i would already be dead but i don’t want them to find my dead body.

If i meet a friend it is because i ask him, never the other way around and I’m always Plan B for them, i never get preferred about other people.

I never got loved by a girl, i never got attention and that hits really really hard.
I just want to be loved and feel closure but no girl ever was at least a bit interested in me.

All those things made me really introverted,
I can’t start and hold a conversation without it being weird for the other person and i can’t even tell my mother that i love her but i really do...

I always try to make it right for everyone,
but no-one recognizes it or me.
 
I’m getting more and more depressed every day

I was rejected my whole life

I just feel empty and worthless

No-one ever took me serious

I think every single day about overdosing my pain medication

I’m just done with life"
215,Does anyone have any insight on different kinds of therapy?,"What I mean is that I’ve seen therapists (2 for an extended period of time) over the years and all anyone does is just talk with me. I’m not looking for a person to ONLY vent to. I’m wondering if there is more that can be done to help me than just talking through my past and current problems. 

I’ve heard of people doing things like hypnosis or discover ancestry trauma, cognitive behavioral therapy, healing inner child. Etc. When I’ve asked my last therapist about it she was like we could do that too but then we never did so I stopped seeing her. (Because I lost my health insurance but also because she wasn’t really helping)

I’m in the US and don’t have health insurance."

The guy who invented that saying probably had a special talent which led him to fame and fortune. Why do I bother praying? God doesn't listen to me. My enemies have it better of them me. I don't know why I'm full of self loathing. 
I don't have any dreams for the future anymore. I have no plans for the future. I don't think I'm capable of having a girlfriend.
The more my insecurities deepened , the worse my rational thinking got. I stopped thinking about, what career should I follow? And more like, I'm gonna be superhero soon.
I just feel imperfect. Prayer does nothing. People do nothing. I feel sad always.
I don't see what's the point of anything anymore. The real word sucks. I hate the real world. I also hate myself, because people make it so easy for me to do that. I'm not a superhero or a supervillain. I'm just a guy who's super power is incredible self loathing.
I don't even know if what I'm writing makes sense anymore. I feel hopeless. I just want to quit and restart everything."

I just want it to end but I am too much of a coward to do anything about it, I just want to die suddenly like can I please be struck by lightning because I can't do this anymore, how can people say life is a gift it's not a fucking gift everyday is a struggle"
219,Every time my mother raises her voice at me it physically hurts and I want it to stop,"I feel like I’m over sensitive but my family environment has always been pretty toxic.  I’m 21 (F) but I had to come back to my parents’ due to the lockdown. 

When I was a child my mom wanted to live through me and she wanted me to be perfect. There’s just so much criticism and I feel like I’m never good enough. She and my dad criticize me all the time and my self-esteem is already real low bc of my childhood, I feel worthless most of the time.

I cry every time I tell my therapist about her. Sometimes she’ll raise her voice out of the blue and it’s physically painful for me, every time I feel trapped and want her to stop.

I’ve tried telling her about this but she won’t really have it. I’m working hard w my therapist to get my self-esteem up but this it’s really difficult in this context. Do you guys have any advice on how to sit down w my mom and tell her about this ?"

223,I needed this anonymous app in my life right now so I can feel judge-free,"I was searching for some mental health stuff online and came across VentSpace App. It was presented as a social networking app so initially I passed on it. Came back to it a few weeks later and decided to download the app.

I really like it. Mostly because it's 100% anonymous. At first I was thinking hell I could just use a twitter and not have my real info. But then I noticed there aren't any profiles. They took away the whole fame and influencer BS like on other apps.

It's for ""mental health"" and allowing people to get stuff off their chests, minds etc and many of the posts are very interesting. As expected there's a lot of posts about the pandemic, racism and cop issues of what's going on today. But at least it's not hate posts and it's mostly people wanting to understand more.

Looks like they just launched the app last month. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of traction it gets because it's not the first anonymous app that's been created.

The biggest thing they probably have going for them is that it's super simple and it's really good timing because so many people are losing family, friendships and even jobs for expressing themselves. Mind you some of them deserve it because it's hate but there's some that's just a misunderstanding.

Anyone else come across this app? If so, what'd you think about it?"

 I hurt all the time, I envy other people who can be in mutually loving relationships. I feel like I’ll never be able to have one of those because of the way I am. I feel subhuman sometimes. I want to run up to the nearest person and cry for help right in their face.

229,Why We Should Avoid the Term ‘Mental.’,"  

Language generates and supports perspective. Language influences thought and action. Not only is the word 'mental' inaccurate in describing a disorder, but its negative perspectives and implications promulgate perceptions of incompetence, unworthiness, and undesirability. It is the dominant source of stigma, shame, and self-denigration. Realistically, we cannot eliminate the word 'mental' from models of healthcare. Still, we should utilize it sparingly, and only to differentiate a disorder from a physical injury or ailment.

You guys only get to see a glimpse off the full story and I can guarantee you that you are gonna give wrong advice if you comment on my story. Just see this as a “rant”. I have therapists that try there best to help me out. They know the full story.

I’ve been diagnosed with autism and a dysthymic disorder, my therapist call it the little brother of the real depression.

I am stuck. Since my burn-out 3 years ago I made very little progress. Sure I changed for the better in thinking. I’ve recently started to do things on my own, I’ve started with kick boxing, which I really enjoy, I’ve started to contact places to “work” so that I can build up mental strength for school and been really working to be a better person and to create more self awareness en to reflect on negative situation. But the situation mentally and around me never gets stable. I’ve been feeling like shit for the past 2,5 years now. I’ve been pushing myself to work at the place that I don’t like working at. I am not giving up as easily now. But all it brings me is being angry and sensory overloaded. I am very uncertain about my future, I am pretty capable of being a hard and good worker. But in the state that I am in now I don’t know if I ever get the full potential out of myself."

236,Advice on dealing with mental health services,"CW: Mention of self-harm and suicidal thoughts

I live in the UK and I have been having ongoing issues with my local mental health team and I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice/ any personal experience with this.

Firstly, the mental health team are refusing to formally diagnose me with BPD. Multiple GPs and mental health nurses have stated that they are very sure that I have BPD, and my current Senior Practitioner said that she couldn’t think of anything else that it could be. Their reasoning for not pushing through for a formal diagnosis, is that I am too young (I am 20 and have had symptoms for nearly 8 years now). I have asked to speak directly to a psychiatrist to discuss a diagnosis and a possible change to the medications that I am taking. My GP has sent a letter to them asking for this to happen, as they do not feel comfortable with changing my medication and they would like to seek some expert advice. The mental health team replied saying that they were not considering a formal diagnosis at this time and ignored the request for a psychiatrists input regarding my medication.

Secondly, I spoke to one of the GPs in January who referred me for DBT, he explained that it is preferable to access DBT rather than adding in more medication. After waiting and attempting to get an update on what was happening due to the pandemic, I was told that someone would be in touch. A few more months later, my case worker explained that because I was actively self-harming and had suicidal thoughts, they could not provide DBT, and so it had basically been cancelled without discussing it with me first. They have said that I need to stop self-harming and having suicidal thoughts before DBT can begin, but won’t provide much assistance in the meantime. This is particularly frustrating as through my own research I have found that the first things that are covered in DBT seem to be how to cope with self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Thirdly, my case worker claims to understand how BPD is affecting my life but she is only discussing emotional sensitivity, and advising me to work through the workbook that she has provided. I have told her that I am getting worse and worse and that I am really struggling to cope. She said that I should work on the techniques in the workbook when I was feeling calm and just use the techniques that I am already familiar with in the mean time, but those techniques aren’t helping me get better and I just seem to be getting worse.

Finally, I feel like I am not being taken seriously. The crisis team usually tell me to call back during working hours to speak to my case worker. Liaison Psychiatry at the hospital usually just fill in a report and send that and a message to my case worker, asking them to speed up any referrals and to contact me about the support that I am requesting. This doesn’t really help me make much progress. My boyfriend has been trying to look after me for a long time now and he is struggling to do so, he called them a while ago and begged for some support for me, and I still seem to be receiving the minimum support that they can offer. 

I just feel like i’m hitting a brick wall at every turn and I wanted to know if anyone had any advice or tips on what I can do. I’ve looked at going private but I simply can’t afford it."
237,Why do people feel the need to comment on scars from self harm??,"Why TF do people feel the need to point out scarthat your have from cutting yourself. In what world do you think it's ok to walk up to a stranger point at their arms and make comments and ask questions?

Ah yes let me tell you about the years of bullying I received, my extremely anxiety disorder, my depression, and my constant fight with suicide that I had to endure.

Scars on my arm"
238,My Friend attempted Suicidal.,"I am a bi male age 20. I met this guy in March on Grindr. He is 21 years old bi. We met in mid March right before the covid crisis happened. I went over and we ended up hooking up and we had fun. From then on we were talking, texting, FaceTiming. He lives alone with two dogs and works at the same time. He told about his past life. At the age of 17 he had meningitis where he was hospitalized and in coma for 1 week. Sadly when he woke up he lost some percentage of his memory. I felt so sad when he said this to me and it put a heavy weight on my chest to be there for him no matter what. During his early teenage life his mom and dad was in a toxic relationship and they had to break up. His brother is in the hood and doesn’t care about anything. Which this shows that my friend has a very tough life. July 31 was the day we decided to meet up again where cases were dying down in Canada. That week I messaged him for a follow up and he didn’t reply. I got a message randomly at night where his cousin past away. I was shocked and speechless. At this point I felt hurt and confused with this friendship. When ever we would talk it would be once a week. Sometimes he would say he’ll get back and call me and never did so I started to get emotionally exhausted. So after his cousin passed away I decided that It was time for me to step back and tell him how I’m feeling for the best for us both I told him that, “I’m just going to be totally honest here, I’m emotionally exhausted I care a lot about you man. I’ve just been saddened. Since the first day I met you we had many similarities with life problems and this just bonded me so close to you. knowing you’re a hard working man trying to stand on your own feet which I’m proud of but I think the loss communication has affected me so hard that I feel hurt. I’m not a person where I bitch about my emotions to anyone. It’s all my fault to even begin with, entering into your life and make you communicate which is what you hate the most. The unfair life stories you told me growing up and your time of recovery at The hospital has put a heavy weight on my chest. I didn’t want to leave you. I needed to be there for you where no one was or will be. I felt I needed to just say hi or check up on you. I don’t want you to feel sorry because it’s not your fault! Dude I might have to leave your life because I’m getting really hurt here I’ve tried to see you and it’s like the universe doesn’t want us together. Please put sex aside because If I was only here for sex I wouldn’t be here in the first place” after this he didn’t message me so I thought he ghosted me. Couple days later I got a message from him saying that he was at a metal hospital and that he couldn’t take it anymore and that his mother made him check him self in. Coincidently this day I got into cardiac arrest and I couldn’t breath and I was rushed to the hospital. So I woke up in the recovery room and checked my phone immediately and he said that he wishes I feel better as well. After couple days I came out and started to check up on him if he was doing well I started to message him day to day to see if his okay. He told me he was at his moms for a couple days because the doctors wouldn’t let him say alone. I told my mom about what had happened as she seen my rapid change of mood. she got a hold of one of her friends that is a psychiatrist and they recommend us to buy him LEGO to make him feel better and clear his mind. Last week on Wednesday I went over to his work to surprise him not letting him know. I went over and the receptionist told me that he was doing half days now, so I left the gift over at his desk and decided to head on to his apartment. Thinking him seeing me would make him feel better after 7 months of not seeing each other, I nocked on his door and he didn’t open and I nocked on his door again and he opened it. He was sleeping because of his medication that his psychiatric prescribed. When he opened the door he was shook and he was talking weird because I accidentally woke him up, anyways we spoke abit and he started to hug me randomly and talk again and hug me again then he gave me a kiss on the neck. I told him to head back to sleep because he was tired and he asked me when he I’ll be free and I said Saturday so he agreed and I told him to promise me that he’ll see me. So I left his apartment telling him to head back to sleep. Friday comes by and I message him a follow for the meet up. I was feeling excited and happy that maybe I’ll try to make him happy and confront him. He replied saying that he’ll be calling me. I waited and the phone rang so I was positive and happy I asked him how his day was. He told me he needed to say something and I asked him by all means he can tell me. He said that he was feeling overwhelmed that I was caring about him. He told me that we were two different people and that he wasn’t the type to have Constant conversations and friends. He said he appreciated everything and that I was a nice person. He told me that we should stop talking for awhile. I obviously told him that I’ll be here for him and that no matter what I’ll always love him. He told me that he didn’t know what to say anymore. He said that when I came over to see him that day it hit him how serious I was caring for him. He was thanking for faltering him but we should stop. He told me that we can talk here and there and that we can try again in a couple months. The one thing that he said out of his respect was to not ghost me or block me. So I was feeling sad on the phone and I needed to wrap the phone call up. So I told him to promise me one thing and he said what? and I told him that I don’t want him to do anything to himself. He didn’t reply for couple seconds and I re stated the sentence saying I don’t want you to hurt your self. He said promise in a weird tone. My emotions were kicking in and I told him that I needed to head out. After the phone ended I started to cry.  

I am left wondering and hopeless after this day. I feel psychologically exhausted and hurt."
239,Had my fi at panic attack in April and my anxiety has been really intense ever since,"So I’ve always struggled with my mental health (mainly depression and anxiety) but I had my first panic attack in April and it’s absolutely ruined my mental health. I was really anxious over graduating college and not being sure what I wanted to do for grad school or my life etc. The pandemic probably didn’t help my anxiety either. Anyways I was smoking weed one night and began to think of all of these things and spiraled into an absolute panic. It lasted for about 4 hours and I ended up having to have my mom sit with me at 5 am to calm me down so I could sleep. Ever since then I have been in a constant state that gets worse and better randomly. 

I find that almost everything gives me anxiety now or makes me feel off. (Music, TV, friends, etc) I don’t feel like myself and haven’t since this panic attack. I don’t necessarily know if I’m experiencing depersonalization or something but I know something is wrong. I constantly feel on the urge of an anxiety attack and it’s impossible to relax. I’ve never been so on edge in my life and I feel like I’ll never get back to normal. I’m on a waitlist of a therapist and I’m considering asking to be out on medication but I’m not sure. I don’t know what to do anymore."
240,I'm losing my mind,"Ok so I have A LOT going on right now...

Ok so I'll just list what I got so everyone knows what I'm working with..MDD, PTSD, bipolar 2 disorder, panic/anxiety.

Anyways, so I got all that shit going on and I do have medications prescribed to me. Problem is, I had surgery 3 months ago which prevented me from taking them. 

I had weight loss surgery back in June and I developed what's called a stricture. Basically the opening of my stomach was smaller than an eraser tip which made me throw up any pills I took. I got really sick. I've been cycling due to my bipolar disorder. It's been really hard for me because I was living alone at the time. 

I also had MANY complications after surgery. I developed nerve damage. I now cannot walk or take care of myself. I had to move out of my apartment and I now live with my cousin... she's my caretaker now. 

I got my stomach dilated (they stretched the opening of my stomach) so i can now take my meds again. 

My problem is I am just dealing with sooooo much shit right now, I feel like I'm going to explode. I'm pretty much bed ridden now, I can barely walk with the use of a walker. I just found out that my dad has liver cancer and I'm also trying to figure out what's wrong with me. 

It's just too much to handle... my mom died of cancer 2 years ago. I was there with her when she died. I saw the color drain from her body. I have PTSD from this. I'm so scared that I'm going to have to see my dad die as well. Idk I just have to be with him, I can't let him die alone. 

I've been having flashbacks of my mom and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to take care of my dad (when he comes home he in the hospital) from a bed...i am not physically able to take care of him.

Idk I'm just freaking out. I have no friends to talk to, only people I talk to is my dad and my cousin. I have a boyfriend but he hates my dad so there's no point in talking to him about it. 

I'm scared that I'll be this way for the rest of my life. I'm in constant pain from the nerve damage, I'm cycling, I'm super fuckin depressed and I just know my dad's gonna die soon...i am an only child, so there goes my family. 

I just need to vent, sorry this is so long and kinda all over the place. I wish i had a friend to talk to or someone. I lost my therapist and my psychiatrist because I moved so now I have nothing. 

Anyways, thank you for reading, I appreciate it a lot🖤"
241,Anxiety affecting relationship,[removed]
242,Lonely but my fault?,"Okay so. My friend of about 3-4 years has stopped being friends with me and i’m conflicted because I feel like I’m right but I don’t want to just assume. About a year ago, I started dating my current boyfriend. He’s the best person I’ve ever met and makes me truly happy and at this time, I wasn’t doing too good before he came along. My dad is kind of strict about me going out on school days (i’m still in highschool whoo) so I got to see my boyfriend at least once or twice a week, maybe more. I still made time for my best friend though (especially since my dad made an exception with her and i was able to see her whenever and wherever) and my boyfriend even brought her along with us and that’s how she met her current boyfriend. The anger towards me for not making enough time for her ended kind of but then she would start asking if she could come along on our dates to see her boyfriend (my boyfriend and her boyfriend were good friends). But the thing about relationships is doing stuff together. Like alone. Just the two of us. We didn’t mind bring her around a few times but slowly, we started getting zero alone time. And when I would try to tell her we wanted to have a day where we hung out alone, she would get angry because it wasn’t easy for her to get rides to see her boyfriend. This lead to my boyfriend kind of developing negative feelings towards her. He’s told me he doesn’t like the way she treats me and normally if someone I was with said anything about my best friend, I would be pissed, but. I understood? Since all that happened, our friendship was just kind of weird. Then covid happened and we weren’t hanging out as much. Due to me being home, my mental health was all over the place. I was crying everyday, I wasn’t able to leave the house, I felt lonely as fuck, it just sucked and I wanted to just be alone. After a few months, she unadded me on snapchat and instagram and I didn’t want to start an argument by asking what happened and I honestly just didn’t care. But then my sister told me she got in touch with her and told her she was upset because I didn’t reach out to her? Like that’s my fault? But I don’t know. Does this situation even make sense? I just need some advice. There’s a bunch more information that would probably make parts of this story make better sense so just let me know if you have any questions."
243,My partner is scared of everything,My partner has anxiety but does not take medication for it. He thinks the worst in almost every sinario and at times I think has to be the main focus in every situation. He is kinda and loving but at times his fear of every activity is draining.  How can I help him without getting frustrated.
244,Cycling between extreme anxiety and panic attacks and derealization/emotional numbness?,"So, on August 8th I went to the emergency room because I thought I was having a stroke, turns out it was just an incredibly bad panic attack on top of some dizziness from an inner ear infection, and since then I’ve been cycling between being very very anxious (to the point of having multiple panic attacks a day out of nowhere) to pretty much not caring or feeling anything at all, to the point of things that usually would make me anxious not making me anxious, but making me feel “off” while calm. This has never happened before and I’m pretty concerned; Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this, and if so, did you ever figure out what it was/how to relieve it?"
245,ESA letter questions!,"I finally got an ESA letter from my doctor recommending and supporting the ownership of an emotional support animal in my home. It doesnt go into detail on what animal I have or their name. When requesting the letter, I mentioned that I have 3 cats but they didnt talk about multiple pets in the letter. Although they did include a number my landlord can call with any questions...should my letter be good to cover all 3 cats?"
246,"Anyone else find themselves unable to reply to messages as fast as other people want? (excluding work, family, emergencies, etc.)","I take days or even weeks to reply to messages depending on the urgency, level or effort that will be needed in the reply, etc.

Everyone seems to say you should be able to reply every few hours or at least within a day. But I just can't bring myself to reply more frequently than every few days, unless it's urgent matter or rly easy question. Is something wrong with me? Am I the only one?"
247,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,I need help understanding why I do and say the things I do. I want to know what’s wrong with me. I need help but don’t know how or where to look
248,"Please help, I’m panicking and overthinking a lot.","I’ve been overthinking everything and anything there is to think about for this past week and it’s driving me insane. It’s led me to feel like a horrible disgusting person and....I have this one current thing I keep thinking about. So like when I was younger we were on a family trip and we stayed in a hotel, I slept in a separated section from my parents. And well my parents were having...intercourse. I could hear my mom and basically got horny (I think by the idea of sex??? Idk) and I kinda masturbated. But I’m very scared right now because I didn’t know what I was imagining at that time and I have fully convinced myself at this point I have committed incest and I feel very horrible."
249,I feel like taking out my spine and grinding it and siknning my body i also want an axe thrown on my neck,"I really don’t know why i feel like this but i do all the time, it isn’t about suicide it’s like an itch I can’t stop feeling this way because in my brain that’s how I’ll be relived.
I crack my bones my wrist and fingers and ankel i push my neck in a weird position and stick my spine out as hard as i can 
Can someone tell me why do i feel like this and if it’s a mental illness or i need to go to the doctor"
250,AIs from AI Dungeon 2 to sexy to funny and one based wholly on Reddit!,[removed]
251,help!,i need coping mechanisms for severe anxiety i’m loosing my mind over here
252,"Is this normal, or a disorder?","I'm not a doctor. There. 
However, my gf of 1 year this month, has shaken me with some of her behavior. 
I simply want opinions on whether or not I should seek professional help, or she's just a typical woman.  She isn't my first long term relationship. I've had one other long one. And the woman was just as crazy but in different ways 
Now the behavior.
-She often forgets what she says. And then states she didn't say that, with a total look of conviction and confusion.  Then when I quote her exactly,  she remembers. 
-She rambles when arguing and just says nonsense.  For example she was listing things that she doesn't like that I do last night, and then she says, ""what's our dog doing"" as one of the things she thinks is controlling of me to ask. I said how is that wrong of me to ask, she then said ""I just said it cause I saw him sitting there."" It's nonsense and happens a lot.
Ok now the real crazy stuff. 
-She once threatened to jump out of the car as i was driving because she got upset at me. 
She often will leave and walk out into the night when we have arguments. With no money, car or anything. Just walking out in the city at night crying, as a 125lb girl. I often have to put whatever argument we had aside just to get her home safely.  
Just yesterday I had to drive up and down the freeway begging her to get in the car,  as she had left the house and just started walking.  To me no matter how mad you get, this behavior is high risk and it troubles me that she just puts herself out there like that with no regard for her safety. 
-she's an admitted alcoholic.  Which she only admitted after lying for months and being caught finally  
Few weeks back she's begging me to let her go so she can drink
-she has violent outbursts where she'll throw her phone or hit a wall or knock something over.
says she fears nothing constantly 
--shes always saying she'll be better off dead. She'll get into a shouting match with me and say, ""do it, hit me, just kill fucking kill me"".
That's a direct quote from about a week and a half ago. 
-She accuses me of lusting after every woman I see. 
-She forms scenarios in her head of me cheating and believes them. 
-She has a very high sex drive(her parents had sex in the same room as her when she was old enough to remember,  regularly)and every time she drinks she blacks out and ends up having sex/raped. This is not currently happening.  
However her begging to go back to alcohol again makes me think she's okay with those results.  Which again is reckless.   
-She cries constantly over small things, is extremely sensitive,  and takes everything to heart, has serious trust issues with me, although I've never cheated on her. 
I'm mainly concerned about her safety, the walking out into the night or up and down a highway is just so bizarre to me. I can't rationalize the behavior. 
This all sounds mild I guess, but I promise you it's a rollercoaster ride and much worse, I just can't put it into words. I think she is bipolar or has some anxiety disorder. Along with depression.  
But I'm just a dummy on reddit. So asking for opinions"

255,Sleep Paralysis and Mid-day Exhaustion,"I don’t know if it’s a symptom/side effect of my depression, but I’ve been getting really bad sleep paralysis nightmares more recently. Like to the point I have multiple back to back. A couple nights ago it got to the point where I had to INDUCE a lucid dream to check if I was asleep or awake and when I realized I was still sleeping I forced myself awake.


I sleep around 10pm~5am then 5.30am~8am (the gap is due to waking up from the sleep paralysis cycles) so I still get a good amount of sleep. Even without the nightmares I get exhausted around 3-4pm and have to sleep or else I feel sick but then I nap for an hour or so and wake up even more exhausted.


I don’t drink caffeine, except tea, but even then I’ve been drinking tea since I was a baby so the little amount of caffeine doesn’t bother me.


I don’t know what to do to fix the exhaustion and stop the nightmares. Any tips for either would be appreciated. Mostly for the sleep paralysis as with the mid day exhaustion I might just try drinking coffee or an energy drink when I get exhausted to see if I crash or if I wake up.


So, any tips on stopping sleep paralysis or even lighten the effects. I usually know when I’m in that state because I can’t move so I shut my eyes and try to sleep but then I “wake up” into another sleep paralysis cycle and it continues about 2-4 times to the point I’m questioning whether I’m actually asleep or awake."
256,I can’t stop saying “I hate myself”,"I’ve been dealing with depression and self hate for so long that its became a habit. Whenever my mind wanders to past occurrences that involve me just being myself, I keep saying things like “I hate myself” and I don’t realize that I’ve said it until afterwards. It’s as if it’s drilled into my head.
I don’t know how to stop it or if it even could be stopped at this point."

Now, I can barely get out of bed again, I'm falling behind on my homework, my room is a mess, I'm late to work, and I'm so tired and I feel numb. I wish I could just fucking pick one, you know?

Anyway. Thanks for listening."
263,Little brother addicted to video games and it’s taking a toll on his mental,"TL;DR : He’s (14) sad all the time, has started having bad mood swings, watches a lot of gaming content. I try my best to help him, but I’m holding it all by a thread and not sure how to help him.  

I (21m) honestly don’t know what to do.  
He’s 14. A few days back, he broke the computer monitor in anger because he was arguing with one of his classmates online (apparently that classmate used to call him names for a long time but I never knew about it, more on maybe why below); he felt immediately guilty right after and cried for a good hour straight. I did manage to console him and get him to feel okay. And I think I managed to get his situation with his friend sorted too (he’s chosen to not talk to him anymore which I think is a good decision).  
But his mental has been all over the place ever since, maybe even before this.  

I feel like it might help to provide some relevant background, I’ll try to keep it as short and concise as possible -  
1. He didn’t have the best upbringing. If anything, he had a very rough and bleak upbringing. He was almost always with at most two people growing up (me and mom).  
2. My parents are textbook narcissists and emotionally abusive towards both of us.  
3. As a result of which he has a very hard time socialising. He has friends but it takes him a great amount of effort and ‘faking it’ to make friends, so much so that once he’s made friends in a new place he’s exhausted and will do anything to keep them (even if they don’t necessarily treat him right).  
4. He’s become addicted to video games (battle-royale games) during this pandemic. It used to be controlled gaming before, but now he plays 5-6 hours a day and it’s very very hard to get him to do anything else.  
5. It’s not hard to tell that he’s just trying to fit in wherever he goes and has very little self confidence.  
6. He cares more about what people think of him, than what he thinks of himself (not a whole lot).  

I make it a point to spend a few hours with him everyday even if he doesn’t like it and just wants to get back on that computer. But since he’s broken the monitor, he seems very -  
1. Unstable, ticky, fidgety.  
2. One moment he feels like laughing and the next he feels like crying.  
3. Wants to be left alone all the time (this was since the pandemic, when he started gaming a ton). It’s very hard to enter his room without him starting to get annoyed and just tell me to get out of the room in the first few seconds (I deal with it very very patiently and try my best to make him laugh or divert his attention so that I can trick him into spending time with me, and not be alone).  
4. He watches a ton of gaming content in YouTube now that he can’t game anymore. And it’s worrying me a lot.  

So, I guess I have a few questions to help me deal with this. If anyone had a good suggestion otherwise too, I’d be more than happy to listen cause I‘ll take all the help I can get at this point.  

1. Is it a good idea to essentially force him to play something like Stardew Valley instead of Apex Legends? Or allot a certain amount of time where he HAS to play a relaxing game instead of these crazy mind eating battle royale games, just to get started? Force him, because he’s said no to playing Stardew Valley or Abzu already. (I never tell him gaming in general is bad, I know it’s a bad idea to mention that cause he’ll be repelled even further).
2. It takes a massive chunk of my energy every day to spend time with him (I never ever let it show of course). I attend uni from home right now and keeping up with coursework and helping him could turn out to be difficult. If I could choose one I’d definitely go with spending time with him all day, but I also have to get that degree to get him out of the house and situation he’s in. Is there anything I can do to make him okay?  

I’d appreciate any feedback at all. Literally, any."
264,Feeling hopeful about recovery,"TW: Self-harm mentioned, feelings of despair, recovery, relationship.



I have been depressed and anxious for 7 years. This has also involved periods of self-harm. I’ve always felt like my life was going to be like this forever and I’d never get better.

I met this guy on Hinge and we have gotten along so well. When I’m with him I feel so happy, happiness I’ve not felt in a long long time. Feeling this happiness has given me hope that maybe I can recover.

This has given me the motivation to actually work towards recovery and today I made that first step. I phoned the local mental health service and will have an assessment in the next two weeks.

This has made me feel like I’m on the road to recovery and I’m so hopeful. Obviously there will be bumps in the road but I’ve started down that road."

266,Advice on finding the right therapist?,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was a kid and have always had a hard time finding someone who is a good fit. The few times I have found a great therapist who I feel like I'm clicking with and having productive sessions with, they move away. 

I'm back at square one again after a bad experience on one of the telemedicine mental health sites and I just want to be super intentional and careful about pursuing the next therapist I see. I want to make sure to find someone who not only focuses on the areas I need help with (anxiety, depression, loneliness, attachment issue) but shares my worldview/ethics/politics. 

The ""areas of expertise"" bit is pretty easy to find, but I'm scared of getting matched up with someone whose worldview is wildly different than mine. The last person I saw basically told me to find Jesus and told me that single people have it easier than parents during the pandemic. :-|

Any advice on methods of searching, services that narrow therapists down, or things like that would be helpful. TIA!"

I forget everything that made me feel bad and I end up with horrible feelings with no reason.."
268,Depressed but not sad? Maybe?,"I think I’m going through an existential crisis.  I feel that I have many symptoms that on paper appear to be depression, but in truth I just don’t really feel depressed.  Like I’m not sad, but also I’m not really happy either most of the time.  I’m getting out of bed and forcing myself to do a lot of things that typically make me feel better (daily exercise, painting, playing with my daughter), but the things that usually fill me with joy just kind of make me feel hollow.  It’s like I’m very aware that I’m just going through the motions trying to feel something, but it’s just not there.  What am I supposed to do? There must be more to life."
269,Why can’t I grasp my interests anymore?,"I don’t feel like writing the same thing over and over so I’ll keep this short: over the summer in July I got really depressed because nothing was going on, and noticed I was engaged in some more deviant adult media, but couldn’t get aroused by the more vanilla or even tamer vanilla stuff. I still had interests and was always fantasizing in my own head. Especially fantasies about love. I was planning on maybe one day writing a romantic comic or something. I also had other plans lined up but kept putting it off. I had plenty of interests but was too “ehhhh...” to really engage at the moment. 

Anyway, I saw an article on overexposure causing ED, so I decided to go cold turkey. I also decided to look up withdrawal symptoms to prepare myself (not good of you’re a hypochondriac like me). 

Anyway I noticed my already depressed mood worsen a bit. I tried to do things, but there wasn’t much to do. Also I started noticing sexual stuff more often and for some reason it started making me uncomfortable. I noticed how a lot of the things I watched or looked at may have had elements of my deviant side in them, and that made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. 

I called my therapist after a few days of this. I could still do things like fantasize and watch nature documentaries and read comics, but something started to feel... off. 

I spoke to my therapist about the stuff I was into, which led to me thinking about EVERY questionable thing I was into. When my therapist said “it’s okay to be into that stuff, just enjoy it for what it is” I felt like I couldn’t go back. The dilemma of what’s okay what isn’t started forming in my head. What was I even into in the first place? I found myself with intrusive thoughts (first just about the fact that I was gross for being aroused by that stuff, then about being some sort of sociopath for being into that stuff, then just being some sort of sociopath).

I started feeling even more not myself and started to panic google mental disorders,, which sealed my fate. For the rest of the month I felt myself get further and further. I stopped feeling interested in videogames, movies, TVshows, and even nature. I found that I couldn’t connect or empathize anymore. Also my intrusive thoughts were getting worse at the same time. (Which caused a viscous cycle of panic and google.

I got really existential too, when I thought “I might X thing maybe partially because of a perversion” followed by “why does that matter” followed by “why does ANYTHING matter?” “Why does life or death matter?” 

Now I’m back up at school and it’s my senior year. I chose the classes I did because they fit my interests. But now those interests are gone. My humor, shaped by things like Portal, Hitchhiker’s Guide, Marvel movies, anime, and a bunch of other weird stuff, was suddenly gone. When I look at my interests, I don’t feel connected and instead just see intrusive thoughts and a lack of emotional connection."

277,How can I stop being so irritated and annoyed all the time? It’s literally destroying my mental health.,"Hey all, 

As I write this I’m incredibly irritated and just flat out annoyed. For some reason, it’s getting worse for me. Everyday I wake up I just get more and more irritated with everything. I suddenly hate everything and everyone. I can never be happy with anything. I currently hate my job more than anything. I’m a beginner auto tech and where I work, there is literally no chance for improvement. It’s basically another dead end job. I get frustrated just going to work. I hate where I’m at in life. I’m only 20!! I shouldn’t be stressing about anything. Why can’t I just be happy with things? Why can’t I just be naturally calm and let things happen?? 

My step dad was an angry a**hole my whole life until he recently started controlling his anger issues. My mom has anxiety issues which irritate the f*ck out of me because she can’t stop overthinking everything. Surely their parenting has affect on my mentality.  

I sound like some whiny 20 year old. Which is true I feel, but it can’t all be because of me. Surely there’s an underlying issue with me I can’t figure out because I’m so blinded by anger. I wish I can just cheer up more often. The only times I cool down is when I’m just mentally exhausted from being irritable. 

I don’t know, I need help. Any and all advice is appreciated. I will gladly answer any questions."

279,"Mom, your home-remedies are unwelcome and you don't need to treat it as a personal attack when I reject them.","I'm in the process of getting set-up for getting my teeth ripped out for dentures.  My mom knows that I've been shedding fillings and bits of teeth for about a year.

I mentioned that I feel like a tooth is getting ready to break, just as a warning that I might be grumpy about it for about 16 hours, she asks me if I tried the dry-mouth mouthwash she bought me.  I say no because it won't help and she gets all huffy about my irritation about her getting in my business like I'm not some fucking adult that doesn't need her force-feeding me saltwater at every complaint.

I can't even remember all of the points of the argument, but G-dammit some OTC mouthwash isn't going to fix a broken tooth and she didn't need to get so huffy about it."
280,Please give me hope. I am taking Sertraline and the side effects are hard for me to bear.,"So this is the third day of me taking sertraline as per prescription of my psychiatrist. Its 24 hours since I last slept. I also have frequent hunger fangs, insomnia, jitters, palpitations and intense panic attacks. I don't know how to bear it anymore. I am afraid to use xanax either because it is addictive.

I always read that sertraline is having a major side effect the first two weeks. But is it worth it? Thank you. I badly need some sleep."

282,any personal experiences to share for getting yourself out of negative thought loops/spirals?,"Hey guys. I have a lot of issues with grounding myself and practicing mindfulness to slow down the train of negative thoughts that just seem to wash over me when certain thoughts/memories pop into my head. Very hard to stop thinking myself in circles, and is extremely upsetting at times (I can feel what to me is reminiscent of the urges I would get to self harm, etc. Currently have not in years, though!) It is difficult to talk about/explain to my bf or friends sometimes, because it sounds irrational to them (feels irrational to me too!) and they are not experiencing the pain I carry with me, because they are not me. 

I am not quite at a point in my life where I have healed enough to sit with and let go of all the old guilt, shame and self-loathing of my past. Would love to hear from anyone who may relate. The journey to figuring out how to take my life back and move on from shit that is not relevant anymore, sucks. 

Peace and love to you all c:

284,stupid rant,"TW: selfharm

I have had kinda shit mental health for a couple years. It started with self harm and I’m always quite anxious. But I feel like maybe there was nothing wrong like a fraud. When I went to camhs the lady said there wasn’t anything wrong with me and I know it should be a good thing but it haunts me and I told my friend about self harm but she said she wanted to talk about it later and then she never did. And none of my friends have ever brought it up or offered help even though they know. Even teachers knew but did nothing. Maybe there wasn’t anything wrong and I’m just an attention seeker and I know I should be happy but I can’t even remember anything froM that year. Was it all fake. And now I don’t sh so there’s nothing wrong and I stopped without any help or anything I don’t really know how but if I could just stop there was nothing wrong it was just for attention. 
TLDR I think my mental health problems were fake because no one around me ever acknowledged it and I stopped sh without help."

His family believes it was an accident while cleaning his gun but he had opened up to me recently about some pretty severe depression so there’s so much going through my mind right now. Being 5 hours away from home for college is so hard right now I wish  above anything I could’ve been there to physically check on him instead of phone calls and texts. I hope it was an accident but I don’t know if I’ll ever know for sure. I’ll always cherish those times we had together, rest in paradise brother."

290,How to obtain medication with unwilling parents.,"I have a friend who lives in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. They have extreme anxiety and depression, self-harm and have attempted suicide. Their parents are against the use of medications, but they desperately want and need them. They have a therapist, but not a psychiatrist. What options do they have to acquire medicine?"
291,i want to enjoy life more but am struggling a lot,"i was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and autism around age 16, but had (obviously) been showing signs all through my childhood. i honestly haven’t felt happiness in many years, i’d say my mental heath began rapidly declining around age 13, which lead to years of self harm, binge eating, and just discomfort and pain of being alive. i’m now 18, and honestly things haven’t changed despite many different support systems like counselling. 

i’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts through this time of low mood, but never actually gone ahead as i’ve always had hope that life will improve and i’ll enjoy everything more one day, but i’m sat here with no aspirations for my future, no plans for a job or further education, and i honestly cannot see a future where i’m happy. the only thing keeping me alive is knowing that i am loved and will be missed by my family if i go. i’m not blind to that. i just don’t know how to make living bearable any more.

the only friends i have atm arent gonna be around much longer as they’re going off to live their own lives, and i just feel left out with no idea of what makes me happy. dealing with my mental issues caused me to miss out on a lot of school so my grades were not as good as i would’ve liked, and going to uni isnt really an option for me. i just don’t know how to go out and live my life. making friends or any kind of relationship is difficult for me and i hate forcing myself into things i don’t like. i’m just very lost."

I’ve been hospitalised for a suicide attempt before, after taking an overdose. 
I’m struggling more than I was when I took that overdose. 

If I go to my GP and say I don’t want to be alive, what’s gonna happen. 
Uk mental health care isn’t great so I genuinely don’t know what they’ll do. 
What if I said I had a plan to end it all? (I don’t, but I didn’t the first time either. It just kind of happened).

Genuinely don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t want to feel like this. 

I’m just worried they’ll put me in hospital and my family will just be left with no explanation of what’s going on. Or not understanding. I think they’ve noticed I’m depressed but they don’t know how bad this is at the moment."
295,I'm really tired,"I live in Nigeria, I'm gay. I come from a really traditional and religious Christian family and so I'm not out to anyone of them. I can sometimes have feminine mannerisms and it's something I try to hide because it has earned me a lot of physical and verbal abuse from family, friends and classmates. I do have some safe spaces were I can vent a bit and express my self to an extent, but these days with corona virus I've been stuck indoors with my family for a much longer time than I would like, I'm becoming emotional exhausted, on a daily basis, I sometimes imagine writing a note coming out to them and telling them how much they've hurt me over the years then killing myself. I probably would have a long time ago if not for the fear of hell that has been drilled into me since childhood, I have some other shit going on but this is probably the biggest one. I feel so alone and misunderstood, I just want to stop living so bad. I need help, anyway possible. Does anyone know a therapist or someone that I can talk to?"
296,"I'm 26, I grew up with a narcissistic father and a codependent mother. I was bullied from middle school to the age of 22. I have anxiety, depression, and narcissism. I think negatively all day every day. Can I fix these issues? Are these issues resolvable this late in life? What can I do?","My father has been a narcissist my whole life. When I was young he'd beat me with a belt and spank and do all of those things that I'm sure many other people went through as well. He seldom interacted with me and when he did it was usually him being upset with me about something and yelling or trying to intimidate me. He was never proud of me, and I think this lead to me having validation issues and I've always felt the need to be validated by others. He abused my mom a lot. I've had to call the police on him twice because he was choking my mom. He blames her for his cheating on her and tells her all kinds of terrible things to make her feel bad about herself. He takes no responsibility for his actions. He always used to tell me ""I can't wait until you enter the real world"" because then I'd know how hard it is and he expected me to fail. I feel like he was right. 

My mom has always been an incredibly kind person. She's always tried really hard to stay positive despite all of our struggles. A consequence I believe of that is that she's always kind of turned her head to negativity and when terrible things happen she tries to down play how bad they are. She has good intentions I believe, but I think that this lead to a distinct lack of discipline in my life and allowed my abusive father to stay in the picture. She's only just now moving away from him and getting her own house after being with him for 33 years.

Well, now I'm 26 and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. I realize I've been a narcissistic asshole for at least the last 10 years and I've harmed people by being that way. I have a lot of regret about the kind of person I've been for the last 10 years and I really, really hate that I can't go back and change it. I have anxiety and depression that I've been struggling with for at least 10 years as well. All day every day I think negative thoughts about everything. About myself, about others, about all kinds of things. I dwell on the past and worry about the future all day to the point that I don't enjoy the present. I love playing video games but it's pretty much all I've been doing during this time and I believe this is in part because it is escapism. It allows me to run and hide from my problems, problems I don't really know how to fix. 

I want a good life for myself and for the people around me. I know my negativity and mental health issues are ruining me and harming the people around me. How can I resolve these issues? Can they be resolved at 26? I've started trying to see a therapist in these last few months, but I have kaiser permanente and I've only been able to see a therapist once every month and a half and when I do see them I can only talk to them for 45 minutes before I have to schedule another appointment a month and a half away. I feel like I'd need to talk with a therapist at least once a week and for several hours, but I don't know how to get therapy like that.

Can I fix these problems?"
297,"Life is average, not bad nor good","Hey all, I'm a guy(29) living a okay life. I'm fit and healthy, No money worries, a stable job which I'd even view that as blessing considering there are lots of people out there worse off. Even with all this going on I just feel numb and empty. 

My job is okay. Management believe that I'd make a good  manager though it's not enticing they expect you to travel etc with a rather small pay increase. At the end of that day it pays the bills. I'd say Im not particularly skilled at much. Or I am I just don't have enough drive or passion to chase something right now. Neither do I have a job to aim for.

I'm single, most of the time I'm happy with that, then on occasion I just feel really bloody lonely I'm human at the end of the day I guess! I've tried dating apps which aren't the most productive thing, they generally make me feel a million times worse. Sometimes reinforcing my own self image that I'm not good enough. 

I have friends. Mostly people I work with, yet outside of that I'd probably say I have 2-3 friends which has diminished massively since I was much younger. I have never been much of a party goer, that type of thing is my personal sense of hell. 

Family wise my parents are divorced, I get a long with them both. I'd say I'm the closest with my brother and regularly weight lift together at the gym. My sister(27) on the other hand is a whole different story itself we barely get on.

Outside of the work place I'm working out, I'm not in the best of shape, my view is I still need to loose a bit of fat from around the waist and I could be doing better, but I tend to comfort eat quite a bit with sugary foods etc. Which in it's self is my bane, sweet tooth and all. Other than that I'm usually relaxing watching films or playing video games.

TLDR: Even though my life is quite comfortable. I just feel empty. Plodding along life, turning 30 with what it feels like little to no purpose. It's a odd feeling to have.

Thanks for spending the time to read my vent! I guess it's time to try get some sleep to prepare for another day."
298,How can I put myself in the right mental place for learning something and maintain focus?,"I have always struggled with focus as my mind likes to frequently take me off into random directions all of the time. Sometimes I'll just be 100% focused and then suddenly think about a random event and start making up little scenarios. I catch myself doing it and try to rip myself back to reality sometimes but it's annoying how frequently this happens. I had trouble in past relationships for ""zoning out"" but whilst to other people it seemed rude, to me it was just uncontrollable. Another thing I have noticed is that if I get something wrong straight away which I knew I shouldn't have then I will immediately feel like everything from that point onward is an uphill struggle; sometimes leading me to give up completely. If I had the right mindset to begin with then maybe I would be more consistent and less worried about messing up (since when I worry about messing up I will be more likely to mess up as well! I love my overthinking brain.)"
299,I just scheduled my first therapy session,"I've been very depressed and anxious the last few days. I relapsed on my self harm and nicotine addiction, and i decided to get help for the first time. I'm not sure how well this will go, but i hope it will help."
300,I want to talk to someone privately about my mental health,"Anybody who wants to talk to me can leave a comment and I’ll message you back, A lot of people have been saying I’m sick in the head lately so I’d like to talk to someone about it before making any decisions"
301,Why was I Happy?,"I have major depression and have for 8+ years. I would describe my depression as the cliche commercial where the person has a cloud following them. And every day has a 70% chance of rain.. 

I always try my best to do my daily chores and have a routine to ease the rain. And it has worked wonders. This routine along with meds has me at a place where I can manage my depression. Yes somedays there are thunderstorms, but I get through.

Anyway, what happened yesterday truly surprised me. I felt happy. Like a giddy type of happy a kid would at a candy store. I don't know what happened. Nothing changed in my life to spark this. I had a day with no cloud. 100% sunny skies for the WHOLE day.

This thoroughly confused me. I haven't had any day like this that I can remember and it came out of no where. What would cause this? I feel strange for asking, but it felt strange being happy. Maybe for an hour or two I feel calm (big emphasis on maybe), but not happy and definitely not for an entire day. 

Why did this happen? Should I just let it be?"
302,I saw a vivid hallucination,"I should start by saying I'm a 20yo female. I'm just wondering how healthy or typical this form of thing is considered. I do have family history of skyzophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, autism, and depression. I myself have paranoia, social anxiety, depression and mania. I think I may have narcolepsy or insomnia, but it seems more episodic. 
I have had hypnopompic hallucinations in the past, about ten or so times in the last three years. Ill wake up and right away see something that typically terrifies me, then ill scream and run for the door. Ill remember them vividly.
I've also often have had black figures that aren't really there. Say, I see a shadow move and it looks like a monster but it isnt even real. I always chalk that up to paranoia though. 
But today I saw one vividly. Full color, still feels like he was still standing there. I looked over at a chair and for a second I saw this pale, tall, blonde, green eyed guy leaning over it and grinning at me. He was young, maybe a teenager. He kinda had a cat-like face with long slanted eyes. I think he was wearing a blue striped shirt. But then i blinked and there was only a chair there. It lasted probably only a second but I'm still having anxiety."
303,i hate that people see me differently when i tell them i have bipolar,"i’ve (19f) told my housemates that i have bipolar 2. i hate the stereotypes of it and what they think of me, ive been trying to educate them on what bipolar actually is but it’s so hard i feel like my emotions aren’t mine like i only feel that way today because of bipolar and now my friends see it too. i’m loosing myself i’ve become the stereotype. i’ve been a pretty shit friend and i hate blaming it on bipolar but it’s true this is why i act that way. but it’s never a valid reason. i wish i didn’t have this, i want to be normal for once and not have to explain."
304,Five Years HRT/Mental Health Awareness,"August welcomed my five years on HRT. It has been five years since I began my journey living as my authentic self. Five years since I was given a second chance at life. Transitioning was the start of a new being, a reincarnation. Becoming a butterfly in a world full of lizards. August also welcomed a turning point for a condition that I have spent years trying to brush off as frivolous. Since my transition began I have been consistently rebuilding, always on the go. I have had to cognitively re-frame my life to fit what it means for me to be this new individual. Not only what it means to be this new individual for me but what it means for others as well, and how I present myself. My life began at 22, not at birth. Until I began my transition I was stuck in a constant state of limbo, the world passing me by while I watched from the inside of a body that I knew was not my own. I found it difficult to focus, both at school and at home. I missed a lot of time from school, there is much I cannot recall reading, studying, learning. Thinking back now it feels as if I was never really there, even on the days that I physically was. Often it feels as though my childhood was stolen from me. Since transitioning it has felt as though I have had to re-learn much that I do not remember. With family I often feel like a new member, with less time given to me to establish new relationships with everyone. In a way, I feel like a child. Still learning, still growing. And other times I feel older, having had to mature faster than those around me due to my identity. I have had financial difficulties with transitioning, spending money on things to feel more like myself. Acquiring debt to feel free. Whether it be on laser hair removal for beard growth, a new wardrobe, hormones, therapy, etc.  I felt I had to prove my identity to others, to show that these feelings were not just a phase or a cry for help. Speaking with someone yesterday he made a point that resonated with me. While dealing with depression, it feels as if once again I am needing to prove myself. Depression takes on many forms. For me it is rooted in these thoughts that I describe above. It is an unshakable and deep sadness. It is living in a world that tells me I shouldn't exist. It is living in a world that tries to deny me rights. It is living in a world where I have needed to develop a thick skin. It is living in a world where people like me are murdered for being themselves. It is living in a world where I have lost people I have not been able to fully get to know, and them not getting to know me. It is living in a world full of lizards while I am trying to be a butterfly, afraid I am going to be devoured."
305,What do you call this? Is this a thing?,"Don't know if this has anything to do with 'mental health' but I didn't really know where else to post this. 

There's this thing that happens to me that if someone names a thing, the mental image that comes in my mind is something different. So I end up confusing things and what people say a lot.

For example if someone says ""Batman"", wolverine will come to mind. And ill go on thinking they said wolverine when in fact they did not. If someone says ""blue"", a mental image of the colour orange will come Etc. The mental image that comes to my mind is from the same category but different.

I wouldn't particularly say it's a 'problem' but my sister does get annoyed at me for it. Regardless, I was just curious if this has a name or not... 

Any response is appreciated!"
306,I don’t think there’s much helping my depressed friend.,"He goes on a hunger strike because the world is fucked up, eats maybe one meal a day, complains the world sucks, then complains about being hungry, then complains about being depressed, then complains about the world sucking, then doesn’t eat, then complains about being hungry, then complains about being depressed..."
307,I dont ujderstand anymore,"Whhy....
Back in 2018 i went to a psychiatrist for the first time and said something wrong and i was placed in a psych ward for 3 days. I wasnt given any sort of diagnoses or future meeting. All that resulted in this was my parents loss of trust in me and now i am refused resources. Im a minor so i cant do this myself

I cant even get diagnosed. Theres something wrong with me but i dont know what because im not diagnosed. Every day I think could something have been different if early on I was able to get help. I don’t know how to cope with anything. The days are so useless. Every time any of my family members interact with me i get so angry. I dont want to talk to anyone anymore. I hate having a psychical body. I don’t want to be real. 
I wish there was a way so that instead of “death” every proof of me existing is erased. And everyone who knew me forgets i existed. I simply never existed. There was no me. 

Why is learning so hard? I cant focus on anything. I cant comprehend things. Something could be easy for 50,000 people but for some reason i just wont ever understand it. My brain just refuses to learn. Im always distracted by something. I feel more comfort and focus alone with my phone than anything, but then I get called lazy. I guess that’s right, I don’t want to participate in society anymore. School is horrible. Everything is horrible.  Out of 3 siblings I am the one who is used as reference when it comes to “how not to raise a child” “how to spot a failure when theyre young”    How did I turn out like this. Everything in me seems broken. I feel like I was a horrible defect produced in a factory, but instead of being discarded I somehow got sent out for shipment. 

Everything is so wrong"
308,how does a neuropsychiatrist date work?,"I have a therapist who suggested me to go to a neuropsychiatrist, since I need some diagnosis that she can't give me.

I'm a minor so my mom is gonna wait me outside, that's all I know. please tell me how is it structured because I have it in 2 weeks and I'm so so anxious, I hate changes!"
309,Advice Needed: SO not taking action or seeking support for depression,"We've been together almost 3 years. We're in our late 30's and share a vast group of friends and an entire world in common. We love each other so much. When he's not depressed, he's extremely affable, charming, FUN, weird, outgoing. But when the world catches up to him, he feels like a loser, like he's failing the people in his life, and he doesn't want to be here, and doesn't understand the point of anything.

He's always had a reason.

When we first met he was getting over a traumatic divorce in which his wife of 2 years decided she didn't love him anymore and she ghosted him and their entire community of friends. Then about a year into our relationship his mom passed away suddenly - and his relationship with her has tumultuous and fairly emotionally abusive. She was very critical of him. So her passing was very hard on  him.

Now we're living under Covid, the world is an extremely scary place, and he hates his job. They are all absolutely valid reasons to be depressed and anxious. I accept struggle and depression and not being OK. I just have a hard time watching him keep not doing anything different to support himself. 

Today he hardly even showed up for work. I found him staring out the window. Sitting on the couch doom scrolling. Sitting on the couch with his head in his hands. He barely has a word to say. It seems like during our working hours (we both WFH) he's just miserable. And cranky. Insecure and short-tempered. I'm getting better at dealing with it and so it he. But he's been this bad to some degree for the last 2 1/2 weeks.

We've spoken about therapy many times. I have always had a therapist when I could afford it as a matter of personal maintenance. He's noted that my going back into therapy during our relationship made me an easier person to be with. So I ask him to also see one so that we can both be the best we can be and have an outlet for our issues. He hasn't had a therapist since he and his ex-wife had a brief stint in marriage counseling. I understand why he's avoidant. He feels I've been pressuring him to seek therapy because I do bring it up when things get really bad. There's always been a reason why he can't go.

I do not want to look back 10 years from now and this '*When things are good, they're really great. I have this amazing partner who I love so much and who brings me a lot of joy. But when he's not feeling well, I don't exist. I have to walk on egg shells. I don't feel there's space for me.'* And of course this is deeply exacerbated by being mostly quarantined and having a very limited life right now. We spend just about every hour of every day in the same room. 

I'm losing empathy and patience. I don't understand how someone who is admittedly experiencing anxiety and depression wouldn't take some form of action that's different from what they've been doing before. It's not as though I haven't had my own bouts of depression and anxiety or lack the ability to understand mental health struggles. My own issues are present, but shoved below the surface because someone has to keep the household running. 

At any rate: I'm not sure what to do and I'm looking for some inspiration, ways of changing my own thinking, books, resources, encouragement... I'm currently reading through a list of self-help and mindfulness books to try to keep my head in a good way. But I thought I'd holler at the community while I'm at it &lt;3  

Apologies for the length and thanks in advance."

Sometimes I take a few days and sometimes I just never eat it. I’ve been like this for years and my parents still haven’t picked up on it. Wait nvm. They actually have. Because I told them about it. They simply said “It’s just yogurt” and continued to do the thing (buy me unfamiliar foods without warning) that I told them was not helpful and the to gaslight me with their bs that I’m ungrateful. 😃

But they just leave me. I would lay down my life for a friend but not a single one them would raise a finger to help when I need it. It's it because I'm ugly or fat? Is my personality so bad? Why does everyone just use me like a tissue and throw me away. What do I do wrong? I wish at least one of them would tell me so I could fix myself. Why doesn't anyone love me? Am I that bad?"
316,I don’t know what to do,"I want to be better than I am, I know I can be. There’s just this part of me that sabotages me heavily and I don’t know how to treat this side. It’s afraid of pain, discomfort, and anxiety and it’s holding me back, causing massive insecurity and stress. I don’t even feel like I can have positive interactions with people because I hate who I am so much right now. Help please. Thanks for reading."

318,Experiences with going to the GP (UK) for mental health issues?,"hi! i’ve been thinking this over and over and for a long time but in the past year my mental health has very clearly declined and i think i really want to get some help. i’m not too anxious about seeing a doctor and speaking about what i am presuming is depression but i’m just kind of curious what experiences people in the UK have had with this. 

if you went through an NHS GP what did it look like? did you have to go through many sessions/see different doctors, how long did it take to get prescribed something, what did it look like, what were they like about it, etc. just please tell me your experience! i don’t have a very good idea overall about doctor visits as i don’t often go to the doctor. thank you so much in advance.❤️"
319,Is Attachment Therapy worthwhile?,"I just left a long-term toxic relationship. Both of our own unique mental/personality issues contributed to our falling out, but I'm particularly trying to take responsibility of and understand mine so that something this painful never happens again. Either with the same person should they reconcile (having set similar goals) or just whoever else I have the fortune of falling in love with.

Their issues were more personality/mood driven (think BPD/Bipolar), but I suspect I have serious anxious-avoidant attachment problems thanks to my upbringing. What kind of therapist should I be seeking? Is 'attachment therapist' even a title? I'm not sure that I can truly fix my problems without professional guidance. Any advice is seriously appreciated."

324,IAE on remeron or serroquel? Help!,"I was led to believe serroquel makes me tired and remeron makes me hungry. I took both at bedtime to help sleep, but of course I got hungry too which led to nighttime snacking.

This is fine because I'm underweight but my therapist suggested switching remeron to daytime to help me eat more during actual meal times.

This is my second day doing that, and I've had so much trouble sleeping at night. I went to bed at 4am. Then when I take the remeron at noon I've had to go back to sleep until 6pm! I'm still snacking after both meds.

Is it possible the serroquel isn't making me tired, but the remeron is? Or is my system just not happy with the sudden change? 

If this would be better in a different sub, please let me know! I'm not aware of the best medical subs.

Of course I will tell my therapist as soon as I can. My next meeting with the actual prescriber is a bit away."
325,I need help.,"I just dont know anymore. It's like no one cares for me at this point, ive tried talking to people close to me but they just dont take it serious or they dont care.

Ive tried hotlines they never pick up, i just dont know what to do and the fact im so young is even worse. I see people my age doing all these great things and then im here..."
326,Update for my situation,"Okay so I talked to my therapist today and I told them everything. I just told them about thoughts I’ve had and about the school situation. Then I talked to my medical provider but that took a bit due to some technical difficulties. I talked to him and he said he didn’t know if it was some depression going on or ADHD/ADD. He said he would prescribe me either atomoxetine or some other medication that helps focus and anti depression. I forgot what the other one was called though. I chose the atomoxetine because he warned me that the other medication could make the depression worse too. He also said that he would mail a Vanderbilt scale to see if I have ADHD. I’m going to start my medication tomorrow and I will update at somepoint if I notice a difference. I’m not sure when I will talk to the therapist, but I know I talk to the medical provider in November. I’ll will make an update post at somepoint. It was so great talking talking to the therapist by the way. Thank you reddit."

329,Schizophrenic friend (28M) it's in a really dark dark place and I(25F)dont know how to help him out,"I'll try to be brief , sorry in advance for my english
My best friend is schizophrenic, that's mean that he see monsters and have auditory hallucinations telling to kill himself 24h/24 . On 5 years I know him ,he never been this bad . Since 2 months he doesn't go out anymore and leaved his job . He didnt told in detail what he feels cause he doesn't ever open up about this topic with anyone. He dont take pills you're supposed to take for schizophrenia cause he says they're really heavy and make him feel like a vegetable. Theres no cure to schizophrenia and what now medics in the world give to schizophrenic people is a palliative , a drug that reduces the hallucinations cause he literally sedate you, just for that. 
I dont know how to help him.. he helped me through a rough rough time myself with panic attacks and depression and I really dont know how to help him and I fear that he would kill himself cause it's been 2 months now he isolate himself and doesn't talk to anyone about his problems . He refuse to speak to my psychologist and I would pay for it (that is young and really good at his job , there aren't many where I live) he actually goes to a ""govt"" psychologist that is old and according to the things I ask him about their session or Julian doesn't talk of his real problems or the psychologist just give him banal answers. I dont know what to do.. I cant force him to take pills or to see a therapist ( the govt can with something called ""coervitive therapy "" but i am against this cause there are been cases in my country where total innocent person died being tied up for days without food in these places) 

Edit: I live in Italy"
330,Help with Brother,"A little background: I’m 29 and live on my own, my brother is 26 and lives with my dad, and my mom lives with her fiancé. My brother was diagnosed with depression (and ocd, anxiety, and adhd) around the age of 15 I think, was on a ton of different meds, and went inpatient for a week or two in high school. He eventually seemed to work through it, stopped the meds, and graduated, and started working a few different jobs. He was doing pretty well, had a few good friends, was gaining skills and independence, and his dark days seemed behind him. 

Sadly this was not the case. Six years later around the age of 24, he started getting into a minor funk again. Nothing major, but any sort of conflict would ruin his week (like calling out of work due to car trouble and thinking his boss was mad at him) and he also had an insane amount of energy and insomnia. We convinced him to see a therapist again and he ended up going on some meds. He slowly declined, until this past February where one day I was visiting him and within 10 minutes he laughed, cried, screamed, then was laughing again...he just seemed all over the place and he is usually a very quiet and calm person despite his issues. 

Here’s where the real story begins: he ended up willingly inpatient again, and was diagnosed with Bipolar on top of all his original issues. He got out, found a psychiatrist and has been doing trial and error on dozens of meds ever since and nothing seems to be working. Also, right when he got out, Covid hit so now he’s been isolated and out of work for 6 months which makes it worse. 

For the past 6 months he has barely left his bed. He cries and sleeps all day. He says even things like showering or brushing his teeth are too painful. He goes on and on about how he’s disabled and will never be able to accomplish anything and not to say he’s faking or doesn’t have struggles but it’s all he talks about and even with my parents and I trying to hold his hand and help him with things he has made no effort to change his situation. He’s in the mindset that one day he’ll find the right medicine and his life will be fine again. He is not willing to be uncomfortable in the slightest and is very dramatic when we suggest anything other than laying in bed. 

We’re all very worried about him but we’re kind of at the end of our rope. It seems like we’ve run out of options and we’re just hoping one day he’ll want to make a change but so far nothing has helped him get to that point. Even his medical team seems to be running out of options. 

We’re having a family meeting (minus my brother) in a few days to discuss our course of action. We feel like we need to push him more and give him some sort of responsibility and consequences, but nervous if we push him too much it might send him over the edge and he’ll do something he can’t take back. 

Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts on how to get him to be a functioning member of society and not see his issues as a death sentence? I don’t know if there’s other types of treatments or methods we’re not aware of. 

Thank you if you made it through all of this! I just want my brother to be okay."
331,Does anyone have any tips on stopping or easing obsessive/intrusive thoughts?,"I have OCD. Lately the obsessive thoughts have been really bad, it’s hard to work or think because I’m obsessing over a particular bad situation. I’ve tried looking up some tips but all I’m finding is exercise and meditation. While I’m sure those work, I don’t have enough time in my day lately.

333,I just need to rant,"So my sister has this friend. They’re both 17, and  my sister is going through a depression. Anyway, she’s gotten drunk in past, and I (15f) never told my parents about it. It’s a trust thing between siblings, but anyway this friend takes antidepressants, and overall is just not a good influence. Literally she goes 90 to 104 (fastest she’s gone) on country roads. She doesn’t have a real adult license, it’s a license where you can only drive 1 person who isn’t related to you (she drove around 4 ppl in total, none of us 4 were related to her). Anyway, she breaks a lot of rules. My sister stole a bottle of vodka from this friend’s house, and when said friend found out, my sister had already drank a ton. This friend then drank a bunch too.
My little sister (12) and I were waiting in the car, when the friend come over to me and tells me we have to talk. I ask what’s going in and she tells me that my sister is drunk and having a panic attack. I’ve never known much about alcohol. But anyway. The other person there is another friend, and I was pretty tight with them, me, my sister, and them have a group chat together. So I go to my sister and she literally can’t even sit up, she’s talking nonsense and sobbing about how she “was supposed to be fine” and how she “didn’t want to ruin everything” she was begging me every 2 seconds to not tell mom and dad. I’ve never done well with shit like this. I was tearing up just looking at her, I couldn’t think clearly and I kept getting told “Nobody can know about this”

So the other friend (he only had a permit) was told to drive to the first friend’s house. I asked this friend if my sister was in any danger of alcohol poisoning and I was told no. I didn’t know that being drunk meant having alcohol poisoning or whatever. I thought this was just “she’ll feel like shit but be fine” But anyway we drove to the house, but we missed the turn so the permit friend started doing a 3 point turn when my sister opens the car door and tries to get out. Somebody saw and called my parents bc they knew my sister. So my parents howe’s up at the house and had my sister throw up in a bag. She’s okay now I think, I had practice so I haven’t seen her in about 2 hours. 

I know that from now on I’ll always call my parents at least, because I just didn’t know enough but now I do. It’s just... idek I’m just so fucking messed up from this. She’s going to fucking spiral and spiral until she kills herself and I don’t know how to react in the moment. I freeze up and I just can’t do it right..."
334,Interest in hobbies,"Hi! i have been thinking about this topic for a very very long time and it still confuses me. To start, i have constant chronic depression, social anxiety and a few other illnesses. But the hardest side effect you could say, is having zero interest or love for activities, hobbies or skills or talents. 

I graduated highschool (i’m 20) with diplomas for computer science and game development. i was into 70s - 2000s horror movies, a few sports, trying new food, going out, finding new music. i had tons of heart for trying NEW THINGS. But this girl asked me a very simple question a little over a year ago and it will not leave my mind.
“tell me 5 of your interests and hobbies” 
I can’t. do i even have 5? 
I did but do i anymore? 

I always try to find new stimulating activities or simple things in life to look forward too, but everytime i try its as boring as watching paint dry. 

I’m not sure if anybody has suggestions for things to get into, or how to break this cycle, or what. im open anything thank you :)"
335,Help please!!!,"Hello, im going to go to the point.  I have been consuming coffee along with with L-theanine.  Since, I ran out out of L-theanine, i started to drink more coffee but today i feel so depressed like im feeling like something bad is gonna happen today.  I do suffer from mental health and due to the pandemic i have lost my health insurance and haven’t seen the psychiatrist (i used to take diazepam)."
336,Overwhelmed with life. My school officially shut down due to covid,"I can’t get a refund for it at all. that’s over 2k. I was studying to be an aesthetician so it’s not a good idea to find another school right now bc it’s easy for them to have to shut down. 

i don’t even know if i want to find another school for it. i like the work and learning about it but customer service gives me such intense anxiety. 

i have no other passions i could pursue for education. i like doing art but have hardly practiced in the last 3 years plus i absolutely abhor doing art for other people. i like science but my depression has made me dumber. i can’t do mental math anymore, my comprehension capabilities are horrible and i’m just overall not as bright as i used to be. 

i’m totally lost. i have no idea what i could do for a career. i feel like college is a horrible match for me bc the workload overwhelms me and i struggled terrible throughout high school. I’m afraid i will never be able to support myself in life. The smallest amount of stress and increased workload shuts me down. I absolutely cannot go to work and school at the same time. I feel so useless. I can’t function under the normal conditions adults are held to. i just can’t. i quit my last job the same day i started it. 

i haven’t received any stimulus checks even though i’m eligible and it’s take 2 months to get my unemployment processed and i still haven’t received everything. i’m literally living off my parents at 20. i feel pathetic. i think they expect me to get a job now that my school closed but i feel like i won’t be able to handle it. i can’t survive customer service, i’m not qualified for office jobs, and factory jobs are too demanding. it’s even harder to find part time work that isn’t just fast food or retail. 

aside from that, i just found out i have scabies so i have to wash all my linens, clothing.... everything and i have to keep washing the things i touch and wear until they go away. 

also i found out my rats have a lung infection that will never fully go away, so for the next 2 weeks i have to give 4 of them 1-4 medications 2x a day, and once they’re better i have to nebulize them for 3x a week for the rest of their lives. 

i am so overwhelmed. i am shutting down due to the fact that i have to make a decision, wash clothing and give my rats medication. if this is all it takes to break me, how am i ever going to function as a full adult. will i ever be able to live on my own? am i just being lazy?"
337,How do I learn to love myself,"Just the small things. I’m trying my best to lose weight healthily, but even in photos I still hate the way I look. I climbed a mountain today and had my dad take some celebratory photos at the top, and I look like a cow in every single one. I think I was better off forgetting that any photos were even taken. I just have such a twisted version of myself in my eyes and I want to fix it. I want to be able to look at myself and see a happy and attractive individual."
338,What do I have?,[removed]
339,I can't keep doing this.,I'm so fucking done. I feel exhausted of any life.
340,I don't know what to do,"It's 2 am (France) here. Its been like 2 hours since I'm in my bed, not sleeping. I'm just thinking about school. I'm freaking panting, I can't sleep, and I don't know what to do...
Tomorrow, or maybe this morning at 9, I'll be back to school. I don't want to though... I've cried a lot recently, and I'm crying right now. I don't want school to start. 
I can't handle the stress. Let's say I had a long day, like I started at 9am and ended at 5pm. The first I want to do is relax, chill out. But I can't. Homework will be the first thing to pop in my mind, and I don't be able to relax properly. Hell, it's so much stressful I sometimes can't do it the evening after school, I do them the next day before going to school or during lunch time. There is also the exams. I have so much hard time keeping focus while studying (MaDD).
I just can't work at home, that's it. I can't do homework. But I have to...
I am one of those who usually have high grades. Let's say I usually get between 17 to 20/20. Every freaking exam I am scared of getting a bad grade like 12, because not only the teacher but also my classmate would shame me for that, when they got 5... It's just so stressful... They expect me to be the perfect student or something like that...
Then there is the fact that this is my last year before high school (I am 14). I don't know how anything works, how to you enter a high school, what do I want to do in the future, what about the final exams before it ? So much things... 
I can't seem to relax. Not even these summer holidays. And my classmate felt like online class was like holidays, but not for me, it was more stressful. Yeah, I didnt got my classmate's pressure. But there is so much thing that can distract me at home. My phone, my laptop, mangas, drawing... things that are not there at school. I can't work from home. I don't want to work. During the little holydays break, I can't relax because of homework, during summer holiday, I can't relax because I keep thinking about when I'll be back to school next year, and also because my parents keep bringing me somewhere else when I just want to be at home. 

I just want to calm down, I can't. I can't sleep, it's too hard because I keep thinking about school. I don't want to go through another year being stressed all the time. I don't even feel like I'm gonna make it until next year, to be honest. I don't k ow what to do. I've talked about it to my father just hours ago, but he couldn't do anything apart from hugging me and trying to calm me down... Please, what should I do ?"
341,How does a typical GP appointment in the uk go?,I finally got the courage to book an appointment with my local GP about my mental health. I’m just super super nervous and get really stressed when I don’t know what to expect. I know every GP is different but are there any routine questions they ask? How many times do I have to go? Do I get diagnosed straight away? Can they prescribe medicine? Any info will really help me out
342,How exactly do you schedule an appointment?,"Basically, I am ready to go see somebody for help, but I don't know who to go to or how to schedule an appointment. I guess I could call different offices and ask them what I'm supposed to be doing, but the nature of my anxiety that I have a hard time in situations where I am unsure what I'm supposed to do. Unfortunately I just can't make a move unless I know pretty much exactly who I'm supposed to be calling and what I'm supposed to ask for.

I am on medicaid right now and do not have any doctors that I have any sort of relationship with where I can just pop in and get things started. I called the PCP on my insurance card because I read that you can go to them and they can refer you to wherever you need to go, but they told me they are not accepting new patients. I used to have university health insurance at my college and was able to schedule an appointment with a general practitioner there and get started on medication and therapy, but now that I'm out of school I am out of that system, and have since stopped taking the medication and haven't seen any other doctors.

So yeah, if anyone has any pointers that would be rad. A couple more details, I'm looking for help with anxiety and depression issues. I'm mostly interested in trying to find a new medication, I could do therapy but honestly from my limited experience I just don't feel like it is helpful."
343,been self isolation to avoid confrontation,"Not sure if this is the place to post about this but I just really need someone else’s take on the situation bc I know what I should be doing but I just cannot fucking do it. I’m (F19) currently dating this girl (F18) who’s recently joined my close friend group (two other girls my age and me) which in theory sounds great but I have bad anxiety and my brain chemistry makes me desperate to please people so I might have manipulated myself into dating her not necessarily because I ever though I’d want to be her girlfriend but because I was sexually attracted, she was there and I wanted to please her by being with her?? I’m pretty sure that’s the exact same thing that happened with my last relationship but was somehow convinced this time would be different. So now on to the actual problem. I went on vacation last week so I didn’t see her or my friends during that time. Distancing myself from her made me realize this is actually reality and I might have really fucked up especially since my other friend asked me before if I could see myself entering a relationship with her which I enthusiastically said yes to (there’s a 99% they’ve talked about it the girl I’m dating is aware of this) and every convinced my not girlfriend and I have had where she asked me to reassure her I told her I was definitely romantically interested. Now. Haven’t seen her while I was on vacation. Problem is I’ve been back home for about five days and haven’t texted her or my friend or met up with them when we usually see each other daily. She’s definitely aware of something being up since she asked me if I was mad at her but since I’m definitely not I said no. I know I have to sit down with her and have a conversation about all of this but I can’t. I don’t know what it is but there’s something in my mind that blocks me from doing it even though I know I HAVE to. The thought of having that conversation and hurting her, potentially making her extremely distraught and angry makes me panic to no end and makes me feel so fucking bad that I’d rather keep self isolating and keep her oblivious. I know it’s incredibly egoistical but this is really weighing down on me and taking a toll on me mentally bc I’m reaching a point where I can’t even keep up the self isolation without causing some major problems for myself since I can’t even properly explain why I’m doing it since the reasoning is fucking ridiculous and looking at it from a rational point of view and absolute asshole move (even worse I’m the person in a friend group who always stresses the importance of communication and being open about your feelings since my friend group is usually pretty open abt mental health stuff...)"
344,Ay on a real why tf we here?,"Like for real idk wtf to do...what is the point 
Quarantine has got to me I think. I thought for so long that if I did one thing I would feel better but it didn’t help so now I’m officially out of options and slightly lost? Jus wondering if some1 cld help Cus idk wtf to do"
345,past trauma is coming back in nightmares,what do i do. it sends me into a depressive episode every time. its so terrifying to have to relive it. what do i do to help get over it. or process it better.
346,I don’t know what to do about college,"First a backstory: I’m 21 and after a few years of just working and not having started college, I finally started college this fall. None of my siblings besides my one sister have gone-Deep down I really only started classes because I knew my sister wanted me to, and I felt like I would disappoint everyone if I didn’t. A part of me does want to go to college because I want to find a decent paying job eventually rather than just working at the coffee shop I’m at, but I also really don’t like school and prefer educating myself. Weirdly enough I’ve never felt like I needed an amazing job, and am sort of happy with just living a simple life. 

So I started taking 3 classes just this week, and only 3 rather than the full course load because I have really bad anxiety and I didn’t want to get in over my head. I’m already stressing myself out and am so anxious in academic, social, and just in general aspects, that I have barely eaten in the last few days and I’m overwhelmed by constant anxiety. I so badly want to drop my classes, but I also hate quitting things. Does anyone have advice on what I should do? I’m thinking finish these 3 classes, and then see if I want to be done, or pause, from there. So overall, I want to be done after these classes because school is causing me to feel miserable, and I also want to be done because I really don’t even know if I want to go to college.

(This post isn’t very well organized because my brain and mental state is currently a mess.)"
347,The Human Toll of Flat Earth(an ex conspiracy theorist's perspective),"To start off I'm sorry if I am in the wrong group but I felt this may be useful here

I recently watched the documentary Behind the Curve on Netflix(yes I know I'm a few years late) and was struck by several things that were mentioned. They even made me reevaluate the strategies of the  channels that are dedicated to debunking the movement. Now I know that the whole Flat Earth movement is dying out by now but I think that what was said in the documentary is still very relevant in today's climate.

Before I continue I want to give some background on myself so you guys have some context about where I'm coming from. I have been diagnosed with fairly severe ADHD since I was in 2nd grade(I'm now in my mid 20s) and recently I was also diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety. I believe, however, I have been struggling with those for years before they were officially diagnosed. Going through private catholic school in the USA was very hard for me. The class structure is not conducive to abnormal students and most teachers until I got to college were completely unequipped for a student like me. Even as early as middle school I had teachers who made no secret of the fact that they hated me. I was singled out, called lazy, and yelled at by teachers. When I got to high school it became even worse, my first semester of freshman year I was in a non-AP class taught by an AP teacher. The first parent teacher night she called me lazy and a terrible student to my parents faces in front of the other students even though she was well aware of my issues. My sophomore year I had a spanish teacher(also an AP teacher teaching a non-AP class) regularly take me and a few under performing students into the halls every week or so and scream at us. The stories go from there. When I got to college the professors were actually fantastic but the damage had been done and I ended up failing out after 5 years. The effect this had on me was huge even in middle school I had almost no self esteem and I felt like I didn't belong in society. So I started isolating myself never really made many friends and just tried to get through it. I just felt left behind by a world that thought I was lazy, stupid, and worthless.

That is where conspiracy theories found their way into my life. They made me feel special, like I knew something that no one else did, that I was apart of something big and exciting. I found a community that wouldn't judge me. Sadly this acts as a siren song, luring people like me in with what they crave most while subtly destroying your perception of reality in the background.

Luckily for me I had people in my life who deeply cared about me like my parents who didn't quite understand but tried to help, some close friends, and a group of absolute angels who ran my high schools disability program. I finally got the help I needed to deal with my depression this year.

Ok, that was a lot back to Behind the Curve. From a lot of the YouTube channels that popped up in the wake of that documentary I got the feeling that most of them missed what was actually said in that documentary. They missed the human part of it, the speech about how Flat Earthers were potential scientists who fell through the cracks, that they were people who had already felt ostracized by society, people who just want to belong to a group. It is my opinion that the Earth being flat doesn't even really matter or figure into the equation, it's pure luck that it became the rallying flag. I honestly think that anything halfway convincing could have done it. The documentary also covered confirmation bias both in the flat earth camp and the science camp. Confirmation bias is starting out with an assumption and finding evidence only supports that assumption and ignoring all else. I want to focus on the bias in the science camp. A lot of these flat earth debunk channels start out with the assumption that to believe that the earth is flat you have to be an idiot. Most never go beyond that and I don't think they realize that their actions further entrench the hardcore believers. By insulting them and their idea that society does not want them and they only people they have is their community. This does not change the fact that they are wrong but it is not the way to change their mind.

Huge disclaimer

I know not all flat earthers or other anti science people are like this. Some really need help and others are just con artists preying on people like me. However I think a change in strategy would be far more successful in helping people who feel like outcasts rejoin society

348,Saudade in it’s most natural way,"I’ve been longing for the life I have always dreamt of and now when I am actually much closer to it than ever and on the verge of a major shift; emotionally, mentally and physically... i don’t think i can or i am ready.
I have always dreamt of living on my own, go to uni and just have friends i can chill with but now when i have the actual chance, it’s not like i don’t want it, it’s just that i am scared and comfortable here.
I have always felt my dream and imagined every aspect of it that i would celebrate but when it’s time for me to do so i am getting panic attacks like never before where i feel extremely melancholic and week. My abdominal muscles are cramping, body hurting, voice shaking, self doubt in everything i am even trying to do.
I am so scared of what if it’s not how i imagined, which quite honestly it won’t be. I am so scared of having to talk to newer groups of people and hangout with more socially outgoing people.
I have major social anxiety and I am scared.
I was very tired today after work, almost dying, took a nice long bath and ended up feeling relaxed but soon the thoughts took over.

351,am I about to do a dumb thing?,"So, I'm literally going to try to give myself nightmares. I know it sounds dumb but hear me out, OK?  I've spent the last few days really on edge, and I cant figure out why. Nightmares normally derive from your actual fears/anxieties, so, I'm hoping that if I get nightmares, and They have reoccurring themes, that might narrow it down? Idk, is this a terrible idea?"
352,Is it ocd?,"I am constantly thinking that i might have ocd and i keep searching for symptoms. 

This started after a bad trip from weed like a month ago when i tought i was going schizophrenic(that was the trip practically)..

 The next day i questioned myself if i really have it. Since then for a week i was very scared because i might have it even though i had no halucinations or delusions. After reading many symptoms i tought i had dpdr. 

 After a couple of days of research and  being convinced that i had dpdr, i decided to get over it by ignoring it, knowing from different videos and posts that that is the best thing you can do and everything is going to be all right. 2 days in and i was feeling good. 

Thia good feeling lastet for almost 2 weeks when i somehow came back to the question wether i had schizophrenia :/... and i started from 0, by searching on google once again, but this time i think i might have ocd. This tought bothered me for almost a week.

  I have practically no physical compulsions( at least i dont notice them, neither did anyone ever say that to me), but i have this constant fear of having ocd. 

As for intrusive toughts like killing a loved one, i had none of that until i did read that on forums and i accidentaly reproduce them.(because this tought of having ocd is constantly in my head, when i saw a dog for example i would imagine that dog killed or smth). This did not happen to me at all during the two weeks when i ""felt good"" sice i did not research on ocd.

And here comes my question: Is this fear coming from ocd itself, or am i just very anxious and hypochondriac. 

I can basically do everything i want (i started doing chalistenics 2 weeks ago and i enjoy it, i cannot stay inside the whole day without meeting my friends as always, so i have no symptoms of social withdrawal or losing motivation or stuff like that).  

While playing in pc, i recall this weird pressure in my neck that i relieve by taking a deep breath, but comes back after a short time, making me aware that i am not totally fine.

Yesterday i had to stay at home to babysit my sister, and what did i do? I researched on ocd constantly. 

By the night i somehow calmed myself down by thinking i might have just some anxiety centered on my mental health(hypochondriasis).

 This made me feel ALMOST GOOD.  I practiced some mindfullness by concentrating on my breath to stop my consciousness from talking which helped me and i was like whoaaa i feel so good, but after that i started worring again.

Today i was good again but still not as i wish i was. Even though yesterday  i said it was just some anxiety, in the ""background"" i still had this ideea of having ocd or some other disorder, until 30 minutes ago. I started researching again and i did read again some reddit posts that scared me again."
353,"I’m always inside my head, is this normal?","I’m a 26F. Since I left home to go to college 8 years ago, I’ve had what I would consider various episodes of depression, I’ve never gone to a doctor for it which is why I say “consider”. Over the last 4 years or so I’ve started wondering if it’s normal for me to spend so much time inside my own head, and by that I mean that I’m always having conversation with myself, daydreaming of some alternate life, or just going over and over something that might had happened that day. I’m always doing this whenever I’m not busy doing something else, and I can’t shut my mind down. Over the years I find it more and more difficult to make friends and to keep in contact with people. Over the last year I’ve only gone out to see friends once or twice, and I’ve had about 4 telephone conversations. I also find it very difficult to be social around people I don’t know, I get very anxious and I almost always need someone else to help me navigate these new interactions. For a while I thought that I was just getting more selective with friends and who I spend my time with but I’m starting to feel that it may be something else because everyone else around me has a way more social life than I do and whenever I share the amount of time I have spent with other people this last year people are often surprised. 

Is this consider still normal or could I just be slowly going deep into depression? If it seems that way, should I make an appointment with a therapist, a psychologist or a psychiatrist? I’m not suicidal, I just constantly feel unhappy even though I know my life is objectively a good life (nice family, safe home, good health etc)."

You know, the whole ""being alone with my thoughts"" thing.

It can feel really shitty though when I reach out to casually start a conversation and get no response. I don't want to be like ""hey I'm feeling super lonely today. Could totally use some socialization about literally *anything* to distract me from my sadness*""* but I guess by not saying that, it can make my messages easier to blow off. I know my friends all have their own lives/styles of communication and I don't want to put anything on them or be clingy. But sometimes I don't know how to not feel anxious when all I want to do is talk, I message multiple friends, and no one responds.

There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who don't wanna read all of it

So I just started college online, and when we have zoom class discussions, I usually don't speak a lot, but my little brother came on my mic and started saying weird stuff and pretending he was me while I was in the bathroom. He called people gay, skanks, and bitches, and other mean words, then he said I'm a furry. I tried explaining but the teacher muted me. My class made a groupcuat on snapchat and added everyone besides me. 

The next day I had that class, I tried explaining and apologizing but I got shy, scared, and humiliated and almost began to cry, I forgot to go on mute and I walked away and started crying and everyone heard. It's been a few weeks and I haven't spoken in that class since then, and I know they all make fun of me because I always hear them laughing and saying ""eww"" and ""check the groupchat"" when the teacher says my name.

And when the teacher puts us in groups, no one wants me in their group and I work with one other kid who can barely speak English. I feel left out and hated, and like I said it's been a few weeks, so I feel like there's no way I can be added to that groupchat or forgiven. This is my first college class and I already have no friends. I really like the class, but I want to cry and scream whenever I join because they all think I'm a homophobic furry who hates skanks. There's really no chance to apologize either because there's not really time to speak, and I'm too humiliated and sad to. How do I make my class stop hating me and accept me?


TL;DR:
My brother came on my zoom class and called people gay, skanks, and bitches, and said I'm a furry. I tried apologizing but I started crying and everyone heard. My whole class started a groupchat without me and they all hate me and make fun of me and leave me out of stuff."
367,Finding mental help,"I recently moved into a new town. It is very small and not much around.  I've been trying to look therapist to help me but the closest one I can find is a 2 hour drive.

 I don't know who to go to for help. Would I be able to go to any doctor and they can help me, or does it have to be a doctor for mental health?

A lot of people said I can do online therapy, but I dont like the idea of it. For some I feel like it will stress me out more them I already am.

Another problem I have is a lot of doctors are not taking new patients.

I'm afraid if I dont get help now I might seriously injure my self or someone else."

369,I don’t want to constantly be living in fear that my brother would take his own life.,"TW// anxiety, suicide (not graphic), school

 my brother has never liked school. but for the past couple of years it’s been more than just not liking it. idk what it is.. I think he has a massive amount of anxiousness and depression suppressed so far down because he doesn’t want to seem weak. everything that comes from his mouth is cocky, smart-assed, or angry. We ask him if he needs help, he says no, and then later he’s mad because we didn’t help him. Sometimes we try to help him without asking and he just gets really mad and spews hurtful words that don’t even sound like it’s coming from him. Sometimes he has threatened suicide, and i spend all day worrying... if we help him, he wants to kill himself. If we don’t help him, he wants to kill himself. If we offer to get him a counselor, he wants to kill himself. He doesn’t want any help, but he needs is desperately. It’s stressing my whole family out and w have to walk around on eggshells because we don’t want to say the wrong thing. And now school is online because of covid and it makes it even worse. School hasn’t been in for a full week yet and it’s already like this. He wasn’t like this all summer. I don’t want to constantly be living in fear that my brother would take his own life."

372,Avoid Betterhelp and Regain.us. You will NOT get help.,"I have previously used Talkspace and had two counselors. They gave me daily responses, provided targeted replies to my messages, and recommended books I could use to help myself when my subscription was over.


When I needed to try therapy again, I heard many ads for Betterhelp. I read it was cheaper than Talkspace and it came with a video chat included, so it was actually a better deal. With promo codes, it seemed worth a try.


SAVE YOUR MONEY. Do not use them!


At Talkspace, my counselors asked a ton of questions to make sure they knew what I wanted to work on. My first matched counselor didn't send me anything but a copy-pasted ad for herself plastered all over the internet. When I shared what I wanted to work on and asked where we would go next, I had no reply for two days, then got a notification telling me I had to arrange a video call. I asked if she wouldn't be communicating with me outside of the video call (a week later) and she straight up told me no, because she had real-life clients to deal with but I could ""journal"" my feelings and we'd talk later.


I immediately applied for a new counselor, and demanded my subscription be extended after I had lost two weeks to a woman who wouldn't even talk to me (which, to be fair, they granted). My next therapist was a minor improvement. He wrote back somewhat more often, though nothing in his replies felt like he was actually touching on anything I had written. It was more like a newspaper horoscope that could apply to virtually anyone's situation. He also gave me two ""worksheets"", though they didn't really seem to fit my situation or address what I had expressed as concerns. 


If you or a loved one is in need of counseling, especially urgently, DO NOT use Betterhelp. You won't get anything."
373,am I bipolar?,"so I have always thought I’m depressed because I really just have days where I feel like shit, as in I literally look back at the past days and be like “how the fuck was I THAT happy and productive?” or sometime i’m like “why the fuck did I buy that” “why did I sign up for this activity” but I always invalidate myself being depressed because again, after maybe like a week, i’m giddily happy and productive. 

I also feel very bad because most of the time I snap and can’t control my anger, I would yell and scream because of little things and feel like shit afterwards. 

I also suffer from a lot of panic attacks too. I have been dealing with all of these things alone, I have never had therapy or anything but the school counselor 

i’m 16 and I live with my mom who I wasn’t with for 10 years because she had to fend for us. (in those 10 years, i lived with my aunt who abused me very badly, my mom didn’t know about that because I know telling her would make my aunt angry and would cause more problems. )

I applied for my first apartment and with my incredibly fucked credit I obviously didn’t get it. I now have 30 days to move with no prospects. I had such bad panic attacks yesterday I blacked out and came to outside with my dog, I don’t know how I got there.

She has a completely new life in this year. This entire year I have been struggling with very bad depreasion and constant thoughts of suicide. I go to therapy take meds and other things that should be helping but nothing has. The depression has only gotten worse and the suicidal thoughts have only intensified. Im a first reaponder and I have unlimited access to a gun. I dont know how many times ive sat alone with my gun my hand thinking about killing myself. I feel like its inevitable what will eventually happen. Im tired if feeling terrible every day. Everyday Im dissappointed that i wake up from sleep.

I have been on tinder every day since I first got here and have gone on about 15 dates in the past 3 weeks. I have gotten intimate with 5. I don’t know why I let them get sexual with me quickly but I think it’s low personal self control. I feel like my only friends are guys who want to get intimate with me and it’s sad. I decided to write this post because I asked a friend in my grade if I could comeover and he said “not really.” And I asked why and he hasn’t responded since. Not sure what I’ve done to make people seemingly “run away” from me. I feel like most of my interactions have been negative lately, and it just spirals into me going back on tinder. I just want a second opinion or advice on how to change this behavior."
382,Avoiding my parent finding out about my diagnosis,"**TW: mention of abuse**

So, this is me planning for the future. My therapist is increasingly convinced with every session that I may have PTSD, or CPTSD from an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I will not say my exact age but I will state that I am under 18, and so my parents have all legal authority over me, complete access to my information, etc.

Context: only my mother knows about the things that took place. I was in therapy before I disclosed about the abuse, so it wasn’t anything sudden that just picked up. That being said, my father knows I have anxiety issues, but he does not know that my ex was abusive and that I was repeatedly taken advantage of sexually. I don’t want him to know, because he will treat me differently and I don’t feel like worrying about him not seeing me as his pure little girl anymore or WTFE.

THE QUESTION: how exactly do diagnoses work? Are your parents notified? Does only ONE parent have to be notified? Will my father come to find out about it through mention? I’m aware that as my father he has access to my records, but my mom takes care of all my medical information so the likelihood that he would even see my records from now until the time I turn 18 is slim. Thank you for any and all replies. &lt;3"

394,"Recently had an anxiety attack before going to bed, came down from it and felt like life was worth it again. TL:DR at the bottom","Context; I had to reevaluate my life and how I was going to proceed with my career and education last fall because I was scared of what I was gonna do if I didn’t stop. I thankfully made the right call and now I’m going down a path I can be happy with while avoiding the overburdening that was causing those bad thoughts to occur. My issue now is I’m having some recurring episodes because I’m trying to balance night school and a physically and mentally exhausting job. I just had a very bad anxiety attack, but something (probably the fact that I write songs when I get anxiety attacks) brought me down, and within minutes of the drop off, I felt like I was floating and could do anything. I was wondering if there’s some medical term for this or if anyone can kinda give more flesh to this thing I’ve just realized happened before.

TL:DR
I had a post-anxiety attack high and wanna know what’s up."
395,i don’t know what to do anymore,"I (25NGC) have very bad depression and anxiety, so does my partner(27M). 

I felt that our relationship was doing well, despite our mental health issues and outside stress from work and family, this week has been very emotionally draining on me and my partner admitted to me that they don’t know how they feel about our relationship anymore- they still care about me a lot, but they’re having a lot of anxiety about our relationship. 

they told me that they’ve always had issues making deeper emotional connections, and that they don’t want to hurt me in any way, but they’re not sure about their feelings at the moment, however they told me that this could change.

when my partner admitted this to me, I tried to reassure them that it was okay for them to feel like this, and that I was glad they told me, but with how stressful things have been for me this week, all I could do was burst into tears and feel miserable and alone. I really don’t know what to do. 

I just feel like this is my fault somehow and that I keep screwing everything up. or that because i’ve been so stressed out and emotional this pst week that i’m just being a pain in the ass. I feel like i’m inconveniencing my partner and everyone else around me. i don’t know what to do anymore, i just want to stop feeling sad and miserable."
396,How do I stop thinking?,"A bit of background is necessary. I am a mathematics major, currently in my second year. I find it important to keep my faculties sharp. However, I can't help but overthink everything, even the simplest things, anywhere from interacting with people to details about my personal life become long lists of problems that feel they need to be solved, and until I find a believable solution I can't stop. These things nag me oftentimes for days, ideas about relationships, whether to perform a certain task. And part of me is aware that it is a simple trial and error issue, but I can't come to terms with it.
I feel alone, and it feels like I can't properly communicate with anyone, every interaction feels like a dance of shame and guilt. I don't click with anyone except for a few friends I've made online. I have no friends in real life, and my acquaintances often become bosses and coworkers, or just the same old, help them with their homework deal. I haven't had sex in two years after a very possessive relationship. All this in the end tops the classes and it feels like I can't handle it as a cause.

I hope that makes sense."
397,Welcome to my Bitter Bitch Club,"Hi everyone, here’s some word vomit. 

I(F 22) went through a catastrophic situation last year. I consider it the climax to my slew of mental troubles(building up over my life so far). Both my older brother and dad are bipolar 1. My therapist(of a little over a year) has gently said I may be bipolar(bipolar 2) as well. I know that’s only one opinion, to be fair. But I could make a case for it(considering my actions and thought patterns over the past couple years). 

I’m writing this out because I’m a bitter, fearful person. I don’t take many leaps of faith. I recently quit my first real job and I’m finishing up my last couple weeks currently. It’s the only constant I’ve had since moving away from home. I’ve never really had a good support system like people I can trust or people I can count on... including my family. I’ve been feeling like I’m about to fall apart and I have no ground underneath my feet(which sucks major ass obviously). 

So I’ve been reaching out to friends/being a little more needy/a little more honest. And the “feedback” has only made me feel worse. Knowing my friends don’t have a lot of experience with major depression... it puts pressure on them(is how I take it). They look stressed when I talk about having trouble. Truth is I don’t ever reach out. My whole life I never asked for help and the awful situation I got myself into last year could have been completely avoided if I had just asked for help. But here I am ready to be honest yet it’s too much. I wish I had someone who truly understood me I guess. 

I also want to throw myself into meditation and more mindfulness practices in general. I’m a very bitter person. I grew up poor, money was a huge stress in my family... still is. I grew up slightly neglected, latchkey kid is kind of the vibe. Except my mom was always around. Just didn’t really want to have much to do with me and my brothers. She’s an extremely anxious person. Anyway, I know now that I’m much older than both of my parents are mentally ill. And that’s abnormal, I guess. That living in filth and never taking care of yourself is not everyone’s way of life. Even as an adult I feel like I’m still catching up to silly routines that people learned as children... like brushing your teeth, getting out of bed at an appropriate time, eating, etc. Most of my friends have their family’s support, emotionally and financially. It’s frustrating. Especially when they can’t meet me where I’m at. I consider myself very open and available to help my friends when they need it. Always makes me feel cold when they don’t do the same. 

All in all, I’m okay. I have a therapist. I am medicated. I’m thinking of getting back into an IOP. I’m just scared and alone right now. But I know how strong I am so it’ll be okay. I can’t wait for the day I feel more in control of my life and emotions."
398,Violent Thoughts,"I have extremely violent thoughts. I think about beating people and stabbing people mercilessly. I think it’d be pleasurable to kill someone if I could get away with it. I don’t know why. My friends say I have a ‘switch’. My eyes change, my whole demeanor changes, and it scares them. I do not know what is wrong with me.

What is wrong with me?"

The past couple years i have had a really hard time keeping interest in any one person. I want a relationship like anyone else, i want to love someone. I go through the talking stage with guys and going on dates and everything for a couple months, and then one day i just dont feel it anymore. Even if its a super great guy and we get along really well and they treat me good, i still just lose interest. Is there any mental issue this could be related to? Any advice or things i can do to get myself to stop doing this? Im getting really sick of hating myself for losing feelings when all i want to do is feel something."

My job is okay but I feel like I’m slowly falling to depression because of work in general on top of my school work, it stresses me out and I either want to hurt my self or go smoke weed and I know both are not good options, I just don’t know what to do, I want to be happy and healthy, not sad and down all the time.. someone please give me some support I can’t do this on my own"

I have actually been a straight A's kid since school and am maintaining a good GPA as well... However I know that it's not enough. I look at people's profiles on LinkedIn and how proactive they are being and I know I must do those things as well. But tbh I don't have the energy to do those things. I can't put so much enthusiasm into doing things like the others. I know I am limiting myself and depriving myself of opportunities and the possibilities of the future, but I simply can't. I am doing the bare minimum to get a job next year and am hoping that will be enough. Am I doing okay? Is it okay to focus on the little energy that I have and try to keep myself happy?

404,i don’t know where else to go,"hi i 20f am having a tough time with my childhood trauma. to make this not such a long read i will spare the details, but in short; i am struggling with fear of abandonment, depression, bipolar disorder, forgiveness, and self acceptance.

i’m not sure if inner child healing is discussed here, if it’s not i would really appreciate some direction as to which subs would be able to help me further..

i feel like crying when even the smallest things happen, even if they’re not sad. this might sound super edgy and dumb but it feels like something inside of me is always crying and screaming so it just comes out randomly. im hurting inside because of things that happened when I was younger and I can’t articulate what they are exactly or how to fix them.

my 20 M boyfriend does his best to understand but it’s understandably really hard for him. i don’t trust him because of a few things that have happened in the past, so im constantly (and i mean constantly) anxious and secretly angry at him for what i think he might be doing. i cry about how worried i am all of the time because there’s nothing that i can do to reassure myself. i am so fearful, and it makes me so miserable. i feel like im going to be sick when i have pangs of jealousy hit me. i feel like there’s fire inside of me and i don’t know how to put it out.

at this point, i am either feeling too depressed to go to work or get out of bed, anxious and worried, or in a manic happy state. its causing a rift in my relationship, my boyfriend keeps saying that i have seemed distant and depressed and it’s now affecting him :( 

i feel like my inner child needs help but I don’t know what to do or where to go for help. i was just wondering if any of you would know what to do"
405,Today is a bad day,"I just know today is a bad day. I can feel my mood dropping and my mind is going down the rabbit hole again. I'm just wondering why anybody would even want to be my friend. I feel like I'm unapproachable, but that's my own fault."
406,I need to change.,"Well. I just found this sub and never have gone to this side of reddit but after some evaluation and talking to friends, I realize I need changes.

(15M)

Let's start with me opening up too fast. My friends already told me this, I open up way to fast leading to sadness more that it should. Every time I met a girl I guess is cute, I start getting to meet her. I sort of instantly start thinking of a relationship which leads into it always ending bad for me.

Entitlement. I've come to realize that what I sometimes think of as ""protecting"" someone is more like being entitled to something I shouldn't be.

Whenever I met a girl, I also feel threatened by my friends. Specially my best friends. Here's some backstory, I've had 2 girlfriends that lasted between 1.5 - 3 months. All of these relationships ended because they were in love with my best friends at the moment, while dating me. Same thing happened with a crush I had some time ago, she liked my best friend.

Now comes the present. I met a girl which I think is fun, about a week later, I introduce her to my friends, she is instantly talking more to my best friend than me. Note, I'm attracted to this girl, I like her, my best friend knows. I know that he doesn't care if they're a relationship or not, he says that it'll be cool if they are but he's not chasing anything. But yet, I feel so intimidated and uneasy. I've come to the conclusion that this is me not being confident in myself because of my past experiences but I'm not even sure of that.

Any and all help is appreciated. I genuinely want to change for my own sake."

&amp;#x200B;

I knew the canon ages of some characters, but I didn't really care about the canon itself. All I saw was some anime boob and thought it was nbd because grown women and anime girls look the same. I just ignored the canon ages apathetically.

409,"Run from counseling, run to Yahoshua, Jesus","I spent years training to be a counselor. I thank YHWH that he softened my heart and saved me, so that I might share the good news. And bad news.


You are not crazy. You are oppressed and/or oppressed by demons. You need Yahoshua, YHWH. You need deliverance.

I used to struggle with addictive behaviors. I used to have compulsive sex. I used to need the ""love"" of others. I used to need pornography that got worse as time went on. I used to be queer, and trans. I used to have severe anxiety and depression. I was abused all through my life. I had PTSD, triggers, flashbacks.

And then in a moment, He made it go away. He woke me up from my complacency, my complicity in indoctrinating people into a system that abuses and confuses them. Satan's system.

I repented. I got deliverance after He first saved me. But somehow I still see Christian counselors, and no one is telling people - 'These are demons. No you don't need someone working to implement Satan's system, you need YAH.' Because it's too simple and it doesn't destroy you and your finances.

Try it out. There is hope. He loves you.

He's coming soon and we are running out of time. I hope you accept Him as your savior. He is faithful.

God bless."
410,This year destroyed all of my progress,"TW: self-harm, eating, suicide mention
I was doing so well 6 months ago. I had finally started to heal and was in a great place. I had done so much work to get to a good spot and I was full of hope for the future. This pandemic took away all of my progress in just a few months. I haven’t seen my friends in months and everything I’d gotten used to is now gone. I relapsed after 5 years without self-harm. I feel guilty if I eat &gt;1000 calories and also occasionally binge and purge, likely as a result of restriction. My mental health is reaching new levels of shitty and tonight I wrote a note. It’s just in case, like it’s not plan a or anything, but it’s on the list. I just started seeing a new therapist but I don’t know where to start with all of this shit. It’s just too much"
411,Hello I'm straight up not having a good time right now :D,"Today was one of my worst ""hey kiddo you should hurt yourself days"" since I stopped cutting myself. I almost relapsed a few times today, but I didn't so that's good. But now idk what I'm feeling but it not good (I have a hard time explaining my emotions property I'm sorry) 

I had 3 people venting to me at the same time about rather serious and draining issues they were having, Which is fine if you need help it's my job to be there, but it's hard when your already drained from a day of cleaning and telling yourself that stabbing your arm with a knife is a bad idea.

I also came out to my friend today and I'm not happy about that either I want to take it back I don't want to be bi in her eyes I want to normal, a normal Heterosexual person, but I thought her knowing I was bi would bring her comfort as she has recently (A few hours ago) realized she is Ace.
Im just in this weird fog of stress and anxiousness. It doesn't help that my mind is filled with:

""hey you did a terrible job giving advice""  

""Your a disappointment anything positive you contribute to anyone's life can easily be done by someone else""

""You should just cut yourself, stab yourself with a knife and with each stab say something that you fucking hate about
 yourself, till you've run out of arm to stab or words to say"" 

Anyways that's my vent, thanks for reading if your read this far, I really appreciate it :)"
412,Feeling unsupported by friends,Over the last couple months I’ve been realizing that I don’t feel supported by my friends. Whenever I try to talk about something I’m dealing with I feel like they don’t want to hear it and that I’m being a “burden” by talking about myself. My friends always look uninterested/ annoyed in what I’m taking about and never agree with how I feel. I don’t expect my friends to always agree with me but I do want to feel supported by them. Every time I end up asking for advice I feel more confused than before and like my thoughts and feelings are “wrong” or “bad”. I can’t tell if I’m just being overly sensitive and expecting too much or if my friends just aren’t that supportive. Feeling like I have no support is making me more depressed and I could you some thoughts about this.
413,I'm losing my mind and my identity,"I used to be a very confident person, someone who got back up despite being knocked down a million times. 

A little bit of background: 

I don't have a great relationship with my family, it got worse when they invited the guy who assaulted me as a kid to inaugurate their office early this year. I moved to a different job and found out about it on my second day at work. My country went into lockdown after that and I was stuck in a new city without a home (I was put up in cpmpany housing). I moved in with a friend for a few months and moved back when office resumed. 

I don't want to go to my dad's place because of what happened (that bastard was my father's friend) and I don't want to live with my mother because my grandfather made multiple remarks about marrying me if I didn't find anyone else. 

Work gave me a reason to stay away. But off late, my work is getting affected and I'm making multiple mistakes. If I lose this job, I won't find another job in this industry (Aviation industry in times of a pandemic). But at the same time the worry and the stress over my job is making everything much worse. This is the fourth time I'm making a mistake at work and it is something that has never happened to me. 

If I lose this, I'll have to go live with my parents. If I keep this, I'm afraid I'll lose my sanity. 

I've been living alone and I have no friends in this town nor do I know anyone. I have nowhere to go and no one to talk to and all I can think of is how pathetic I've become. 

I don't know how to get back up this time. I'm not sure I want to. I just want this to end."
414,Am I having feelings of self-harm? TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️,"⚠️ SELF-HARM TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 

Okay this may sound obvious but for some reason it is confusing me. So I have severe OCD, anxiety, and depression (diagnosed) and they have been rearing their heads for years. I’ve never had many problems with self harm - other than a year timeframe where I would bang and hit my head when in a bad state. So I don’t know much about it or how to deal with it. Also, I am not having suicidal thoughts currently so there’s no need to warn me about that.

Ever since I was a kid I have liked the feeling of bruises. I like pressing them and seeing the colors on my skin. I also like the brief pain that comes from getting them. I never purposely inflicted them but always enjoyed it when I did get them.

A few days ago I got a bruise and ever since I’ve been VERYY tempted to try and inflict more bruises on myself to reproduce the feeling/pain/colors. I just want my arms covered in the feeling of a slight bruise. I guess what I’m confused about is if this is possibly connected to my mental health or if it is normal-ish? Cause it’s connected to a sensation and not emotional release? I’ve been really stressed lately but I don’t really think bruising my arms would relieve that stress, just make me feel happier about having the option to press them and feel the pain. Also how do I keep myself from doing it? 

I know technically no matter what, bruising yourself is self-harm, but do you think it is inherently an indicator that my mental health is rough or that it is inherent that I am doing it because of my depression? 

I’m in the process of trying to get a good therapist in the area but they are all expensive or badly reviewed so it’s been hard. Is this something I should mention?"
415,Life is so trashy,"How do I get rid of these feelings tearing at my throat. It feels like I'm drowning. My ex just hit me up again, and I've started to like him again."
416,My Emetophobia is Ruining Me,"For 10 years now, I’ve had severe emetophobia, as well as general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, and possibly OCD. and this year it’s gotten to the point where I feel like I’m on the edge of breaking. I feel like the whole world is falling apart around me and I every time I try to grab onto something to stay up I end up dragging it down further with me.

It’s gotten from the point of a passing thought when I was nauseous to something that pervades my life every day. I have to force myself to eat just to stay alive even though it terrifies me. The days where I can actually find pleasure in food are some of the best days, and they’re few and far between. I’m 6’2 and 128 lbs (1.88m and 58kg). It’s caused me to hate my body because I can’t eat to gain weight, and I can’t find the energy to work out because I can’t eat. 

I get caught in this cycle where I get stressed because of my GAD, get nauseous because of the stress, and get more stressed because of the nausea, and get more nauseous because of the stress and on and on. I can’t sleep at night because the thoughts of what I ate today and whether any of it could make me sick to my stomach plague me constantly. 

I thought starting college again would make things easier, that I’d have distractions and tasks now to keep my mind away from the phobia but it’s only gotten worse.

It gets so bad that I become mortified at the thought of stepping into a bathroom or even looking at a toilet. It’s when it gets to this point that it makes me feel horrendously pathetic. Being mortally afraid of a damned porcelain bowl is one of the humiliating things in my life, and I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. Sometimes it gets so bad I freak out even when I just have to burp.

Worst of all, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. I feel like I struggle so much, and push so hard, but that’s what it takes just to keep me in place, to keep me from getting worse. It’s like I can’t get any better. I finally started therapy a little over a month ago after years of pleading for it since I was a kid, but 
even that doesn’t ease me all that much. Even on the days where I find ways to distract myself and be happy for the shortest amount of time, the anxiety creeps it’s way in. It’s not something new, it’s a demon I’ve known for 10 years, I just hate that it’s like I’m not allowed to be happy; like I’m being punished for something.

I’m just so tired. I’m tired of fighting to stay sane and alive. I want so badly to give up but I know that I can’t because I know I would leave so many people behind. That’s not to say I don’t fantasize about a freak accident that would kill me, I just wouldn’t bring it upon myself, I wouldn’t die by my own hand. I’m just so exhausted. I look in the mirror and see someone who’s tired, ugly, and pathetic. I’ve made it through 19 years of life now, but it all feels like it’s been for nothing. All because of one phobia that is tearing me apart.

I wish I could eat without a care in the world, I wish I could eat without obsessively checking the expiration dates on every ingredient in a meal going so far as to dig through the trash for the container it came in, and chewing and smelling every last bit to see if the smallest thing might be off. I doubt everyone else’s judgement and always have to see for myself but I swear it’s not because I don’t trust them, it’s because I feel almost like the food itself is my enemy that it can’t be trusted. I feel like I’m crazy, and I know everyone around me sees me like I’m crazy, but it’s things I have to do to stay sane, to sleep at night. I wish so much that I could have any other phobia because I genuinely don’t think anything could be as bad as this. Even when I first had it, I thought a fear of vomiting would only come up when I actually had to vomit, and that’s what it was like at first, but it got so much worse.

Most of all though, I feel alone. I have friends I can turn to that have mental health problems in their own right, but no one can know exactly how I feel, and that’s bittersweet. I have no one that truly understands me, but I know that none of the people I care about suffer in the same way I do. I just wish there was someone who understood, or better yet, someone who came out on the other side. I want to become that person so badly, I want to come out on the other side, but I’m just so tired now that I’m losing my grip on that hope. 

I have reasons to keep going, I have goals and aspirations, I just can’t stand the thought of this phobia being there with me, and that seems like it’s becoming a reality that I can’t do anything about.

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading this. Even though we’ll probably never meet or even speak, it means a lot to me just for someone to acknowledge that my struggle exists in its entirety, because there are some facets of it that I’m too embarrassed to tell the people closest to me."
417,What is wrong with me?,"I am constantly thinking that i might have ocd and i keep searching for symptoms. 

This started after a bad trip from weed like a month ago when i tought i was going schizophrenic(that was the trip practically)..

 The next day i questioned myself if i really have it. Since then for a week i was very scared because i might have it even though i had no halucinations or delusions. After reading many symptoms i tought i had dpdr. 

 After a couple of days of research and  being convinced that i had dpdr, i decided to get over it by ignoring it, knowing from different videos and posts that that is the best thing you can do and everything is going to be all right. 2 days in and i was feeling good. 

Thia good feeling lastet for almost 2 weeks when i somehow came back to the question wether i had schizophrenia :/... and i started from 0, by searching on google once again, but this time i think i might have ocd. This tought bothered me for almost a week.

  I have practically no physical compulsions( at least i dont notice them, neither did anyone ever say that to me), but i have this constant fear of having ocd. 

As for intrusive toughts like killing a loved one, i had none of that until i did read that on forums and i accidentaly reproduce them.(because this tought of having ocd is constantly in my head, when i saw a dog for example i would imagine that dog killed or smth). This did not happen to me at all during the two weeks when i ""felt good"" sice i did not research on ocd.

And here comes my question: Is this fear coming from ocd itself, or am i just very anxious and hypochondriac. 

I can basically do everything i want (i started doing chalistenics 2 weeks ago and i enjoy it, i cannot stay inside the whole day without meeting my friends as always, so i have no symptoms of social withdrawal or losing motivation or stuff like that).  

While playing in pc, i recall this weird pressure in my neck that i relieve by taking a deep breath, but comes back after a short time, making me aware that i am not totally fine.

Yesterday i had to stay at home to babysit my sister, and what did i do? I researched on ocd constantly. 

By the night i somehow calmed myself down by thinking i might have just some anxiety centered on my mental health(hypochondriasis).

 This made me feel ALMOST GOOD.  I practiced some mindfullness by concentrating on my breath to stop my consciousness from talking which helped me and i was like whoaaa i feel so good, but after that i started worring again.

Today i was good again but still not as i wish i was. Even though yesterday  i said it was just some anxiety, in the ""background"" i still had this ideea of having ocd or some other disorder, until 30 minutes ago. I started researching again and i did read again some reddit posts that scared me again.

I dont know if this is really relevant , but i dont like horror movies. I get scared easily and have trouble sleeping(because turning with my face to the wall is my comfortable position) but this time i feel like i can watch any horror movie knowing that this time my fear is real. 
Thank you for reading."

I can hardly get out of bed let alone make enough money to survive. I can’t even write music anymore. That’s the only thing that was keeping me going. I’m constantly replaying all the shitty stuff I’ve done in my head. I’m so fucking confusing and indecisive and cynical. I can hardly keep up in my current relationship. I have a gun and I have been heavily considering killing myself. I can’t take this pain anymore. I truly wholeheartedly believe the world would be a better place had I not inhabited it."

421,Advice about general relationship with a therapist,"Hello all. If this post needs to be elsewhere, feel free to delete and send me to the shadow realm. 

I have started seeing a councilor/therapist as well as psychiatrist after a month of severe emotional problems. I struggle with severe ADHD, which makes it difficult to regulate emotions. I feel that my conversations with my therapist are not effective, due to my inability to speak naturally about my problems. When I speak in a professional context, I try very hard to be articulate and concise. While I understand that it’s important to be genuine in a therapy context, I just can’t seem to let myself relax and be natural with someone that I don’t know, and who I know is supposed to have a professional opinion of me. I have been having the appointments since April and have now reached the point where our scheduled meeting times are 3 weeks apart, though I am still experiencing a lot of the problems I was having when we first started, potentially to a worse extent. I have no qualms about my therapist as a person or their side of our appointments at all, but feel like they loath our appointments. Experiencing intense negative emotions, feeling the pressure to figure out how to convey those emotions, and then having my appointments and feeling like I have failed in doing so has made my mental condition feel a lot less like a mountain that is climbed and a lot more like a fever dream that gets stirred up with increasing confusion as things feel worse. 

Does anyone have any advice about this or any similar experiences? I am 100% certian that this is my problem, and not the problem of the professional in question which makes it even more frustrating/confusing.


TL;DR: Can’t figure out how to talk to my therapist like a regular person and my ability to consistently evaluate my mental health is suffering as a result."
422,Turning my life around,"A few months ago, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, struggling to stay alive, hurting myself, I dropped out of school and wouldn’t get out of my apartment for months. Today, I’m living with an amazing partner, I haven’t hurt myself in 4.5 months, my partner hired me in his company for a part time job (and a great one at that!) and I’m just starting my 1st year of university again. I just wanted to share this because I’m happy and I feel like people should know that it can get better ❤️"
423,I cant tell if its false memories or not,"I feel like I might of done something that could get me legally trouble and this is one of the worst thing a human could do, obviously someone cant answer if I did this, unless someone recorded me do it. I do t remember me doing it, but I think I did and someone might of recorded it from outside."
424,How do people have jobs and families,"I wonder how people have the energy and mental fortitude to have jobs, damilies, friends, hobbies and all those other things that are a life without breaking down and getting a mental illness.
I can barely keep myself together and all I have is a job, some friends I see once a week, my parents I live with for the time being and a few house duties. 
I feel like I'm breaking, yet my colleagues are working just as long as me on more difficult tasks, doing a better job and talking about their own children and stuff"
425,"I don't know if this is the right place to look, but could this be a syndrome or illness?","Is it normal when you like that someone is dependent on you? For instance when they are sick or they're going through something hard you like that they need you and depend on you? I'm not saying that you like to see them that way, but you like taking care of them and nurturing them. Like MSBP, but without the 'making someone suffer' part."
426,Is it selfharm if the pain feels good?,"Occasionally, I'll use a lighter to burn myself. I really like the intensity of the feeling. its almost sort of nice. its hard to explain. but ive noticed ill do it more often to distract myself from stress. is this unhealthy? im not leaving any marks or getting infections. i dont think im ""addicted"" to this behavior. but is this really self harm?"
427,I just want to figure myself out,"Hello, I (24M) just want some input on my mental health.  I know this is not the best place for medical advice, and I am currently going to therapy.  Just looking for secondary input.

I often feel very closed in and trapped inside my head.  Sometimes, I just don't want to be alive anymore because my head feels like it is filled with compressed air and my throat feels tight.  I occasionally develop a strong sense of dysphoria, and although I've never attempted suicide, I have pondered it.

Social interactions are very difficult, and extremely stressful.  I feel like my anxiety pours over and infects the other person, and I find it very difficult to control my motor reflexes without doing something clumsy or embarrassing and I often notice it in the other person too.  

I have a HUGE problem assuming the issues others have that are actually my own - I am a MAJOR projector.  I cannot go out into public without stressing about the lives I imagine others have.  Like, my brain fires off so many irrelevant questions like ""Why did they get that car?"", ""I wonder if I can correctly assume their personality based on the color of their shoes"", ""No wonder they are so large, their cart if full of shitty food"", etc.  I am EXTREMELY judgmental and majorly discontent with my own self, and this persistent questioning stresses me the fuck out.

I feel jumpy all the time, almost always on heightened alert for something dangerous to happen, and in constant need to be in control of my environment.  I have zero motivation to do anything unless I am able to attach a dramatic consequence to not doing it.  Lately especially, I will zone out while watching TV or cooking and imagine awful scenarios where I experience lots of pain or have to watch someone experience lots of pain.  Like, it usually involves a car and running a red light or somehow colliding with another car crossing the intersection, or running over a pedestrian, or driving off a cliff.  It's not only cars though.  If I am using a cheese grater, I will ask myself how painful it would be to grate my skin against it, or how far I would fall if I were to jump over the side of the hiking trail.  It's like, wherever I go I have to address potential threats.  

I hate authority figures.  HATE.  And it stresses me out to no end watching the idiocy of politicians and people of influence.  I have ZERO trust that they have anyone's best interest in mind except for their own.  I think this has hurt my relationships with past employers, whom although not great, would probably have been less stressful had I known how to cooperate without feeling like I was being insulted or threatened.  

I ask this question of myself every minute of every day: ""what is wrong with me?"" 

I want to know what is going on, and I will answer any additional questions regarding pertinent personal history.  Honestly, life feels like a ferris wheel, going around and around and I am tired.  I want to get off the ride.  

These are the major things I have been able to identify, but there are other smaller things as well.  Has anyone dealt with anything similar, and what helped you?"
428,I’m thinking too ahead but it’s true,"I keep thinking about how my parents are going to die someday, they don’t even treat me right; matter of fact their assholes but I don’t even give them respect either.

I suppose you could say I’m a bad son and their bad parents, I can’t get into detail about what goes on in my home.
Despite how we all treat eachother I’m still programmed at the end of the day to love my parents, and they’re going to die someday and I’m going to be left with memories that just...I want better ones. my dad has cancer and my mom has a weak heart. I’m going to miss them so much.

I barely have any friends and the ones I do have don’t even fuck with me like that, I lost a lot of friends in school and I just play video games and vibe.
But I still feel lonely and I’m going to feel even more lonely when their gone. I lost my girlfriend, my brother moved away, my sister wants me dead (I’m not exaggerating). I miss my old ex not my recent one.

I’ve lost my bestfriend, I’ve done some fucked up shit, but one good thing is I stopped selling tree.
And currently going back to finish 12th grade.

But I’m still feeling alone, maybe lost even.

Sometimes I see the doomer guy memes and feel like “what if that’s me..what if I’m that guy and trying so hard to not believe that’s me” 

though I’m a funny ass jit who’s optimistic the majority of the time, I just have my moments of weakness.

Thank you for coming to my vent."
429,Am I just being an overly dramatic teenager?,"This is my first time on reddit, I'm sorry if this seems like a mess.

I'm just honestly confused and lost, I've been incredibly sad for several months. It has gotten unbearable to the point I frequently have meltdowns every other day if not everyday. I'm constantly tired or exhausted and never wanna leave bed. My appetite and sleeping pattern is all over the place (though I would argue irregular sleeping patterns are normal for teenagers). Plus I'm so irritable now, I get so worked up over the smallest things when I'm usually a very patient person.

The only times I'm genuinely happy recently is when I talk or hang out with friends but even then I would have to make an effort in acting happy at first sometimes I have to keep it up most of the time.

I've talked about it to my closest friends and they responded amazingly and provided me with their support. But it honestly didn't help me and just made me feel worse that I even showed this vulnerability in the first place. I feel like I'm making something out of nothing. I also can't think of an adult I would be comfortable talking about this to and school counsellors are only for school related issues.

My meltdowns today has completely drained me that I missed an interview I completely forgot about - despite preparing for it. This has just made me feel even worse about myself.

Is this just teenage angst? I'm not acting like those emo teenage vampires right?!"
430,India's poor and mental health,"I have certainly been ignorant about how mental health is not just a rich people problem. This is a narrative that I grew up with, but one I realized is flawed when I read *Poor Economics* by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Our understanding of the economically poor and their problems, especially in India, reeks of the fact that we have no interest in addressing them or understanding them.

I havent been able to sleep without waking up crying every 10 mins. Some days i just lie there and the day passes by. I have no idea what to do with myself anymore. I feel physically sick when i look in the mirror, i feel trapped in this sitch and i have no idea how to get out of it. I dont want to leave my bed, everything seems pointless now. Ive lost faith in everything. 

Ive always hated myself and ive always had to deal with depression, but right now its unbarable and i have no idea how to get over it. This time i cant just burry my trauma deep down, i fear this might be my breaking point. I cant act fine anymore. What do i do ?"
433,Obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD),"Hi,
I’m 18 y.o. and I’m a gay male. Right now I think I’m dealing with OCD. I want to explain you why but first maybe a backstory is important. So I grew up with my mother and my grandma. In my family I never had any male figure. I never was into sports, I was really sensitive and kinda slow in everything(writing in school, doing the homework ecc.). I mean I had a poor concentration. When I was 14 I discovered that I might be gay. I knew that girls don’t have the same effect on me as they do for other boys. I never accepted this and even more the fact that I was acting feminine without knowing, because I was wanted to be a real man. So I tried to suppress everything. I ended up in some depression(I was 14), at least that seemed to me because I felt nothing and every daily activity was so hard for me. I went out of it this January(7 months before I turned 18). I came out to my mum in June, but everything felt wrong, I felt no relief. Meanwhile from January to a month ago I always thought that I’m still not fully myself because I was expecting that feminine part to emerge. So a month ago while I was thinking why I still not don’t feel fully myself, I connected some point and I came to the conclusion that maybe I’m transgender. A sense of anxiety and panic took over myself. I tried to vomit and my appetite vanished. I was really scared. I tried to calm myself and fortunately after some time it worked. In the next day I was feeling sad and I had some severe anxiety. I couldn’t eat nothing or drink. From then on all my days are ups and downs. And with ups I mean moment of peace and mind clarity. I’m not being transgender but of the possibility of it. Like you know what it said about Hitchcock, his film were so successful because he knew that the only fear is the anticipation of the danger. 
Now the thing is, I will accept myself as I am no matter what gender I am, but I want to be myself, the best version of myself.
Who felt something like this in their life?"
434,I’ve been unhappy in my relationship and I’ve just realised why,"We’ve been together for 8 years. We’re both 26, I’m turning 27 soon. 

When I was a lot younger I was the type of child that didn’t take shit from people - my parents, my siblings, anyone. Maybe I was a problem child haha. 

As I got older and into my teens- I realised a lot of the time it was easier to just agree with people and move on. Unless it was something that really bothered me and I really didn’t want to do. At this time I developed depression and it took until I was about 21/22 to really deal with it and become capable of doing something about my depressed feelings as opposed to giving into them and spending all my time in bed. My boyfriend definitely helped me through this. 

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve definitely become a go with the flow person. Which is one thing I really like about myself. I try my best to help people out and support them and be kind because I want to be. And this definitely applies to my boyfriend. 

In the past year I haven’t been completely happy with my relationship with my boyfriend. And I could never really articulate why - even when I had conversations in my own head about why I was unhappy. 

I’ve just realised it’s because I let people take advantage of me. I let people treat me like shit and I let people use me for favours even though they never return the favour (not that that’s the only reason I do things but y’know, treat others how you want to be treated)

For our whole relationship, I have let my boyfriend not care about me and take advantage of the fact that, for example, I don’t really drink so I drive us out to bars. But then he’ll forget to buy me a coke when he goes up to the bar even though he just asked me what I wanted. Or he’ll ignore me all night at a part because his friends are there. Or he’ll refuse to arrange for us to visit each other on Christmas Day because we spend Christmas Day with our own extended families. 

I’ve let this go on for too long that I don’t know if there’s any turning back. 

I’m planning on writing a letter to explain this is why I’m unhappy, this is an example of what makes me unhappy, are you willing to help me fix our relationship? 

I need to write a letter so I am articulate exactly what I mean and I don’t leave anything out. 

I have this incredible feeling inside me. An excited feeling almost because I’ve figured out what makes me feel depressed after all these years. It’s exciting and scary. 

Sorry if this is just a whole bunch of rambling. I had to put this out into the world. I’m so happy that I’ve figured it out. But so scared about what will become of my relationship."
435,"One step forward, ten steps back","I ended up in A&amp;E over my mental health yesterday, only to get referred to the mental health unit, sit in a room with a woman who didn't give a fuck what I had to say and didn't ask any of the right questions, and then sent me home with a leaflet.

Now I feel like I'm making it all up and I can't really be struggling if I keep getting brushed off like this. I mean, sure, I know that the stress made me freak out  because every surface was covered in infinitely complex patterns so overwhelming that it made me feel sick, and I know that when I got home, everything sharp had to be hidden from me because I was insistent on slitting my own throat to just make it stop. But hey, since every mental health professional I speak to seems to think I'm fine, maybe I am making it happen to myself or something. I don't fucking know."
436,School starting,"School starting

School starting up soon for me and I don’t know what I should do. My friends smoke, I don’t and at lunch they go off smoking. I don’t know what I’m gonna do this year cuz more and more people smoke ever year this year I’m pretty much alone. Loneliness is a real struggle for me and I stress out about it all the time. What should I do?"
437,Disassociation,"The actual question: 

I see a lot of people online referring to disassociation but it is always described differently. Could people give some examples of disassociation for me to help me understand better? 

Further info which you don’t have to read: 

I have had a lot of mental health issues throughout my life and this is a symptom of all of them, so I am thinking it might be something I do but never knew the name for. I often sit and do nothing and stare at a wall for a long time. My mum and grandmother both always did this and had their own weird name for it. Until living with my partner I thought this was normal. Is that disassociation? 

I also have in depth fantasy worlds in my head which I escape to often and have done for as long as I can remember. 
When I feel anxious/stressed I blast music or listen to white noise and cover my eyes or curl up into a ball on my bed so I hear or see nothing and make my mind blank. 
Occasionally I have felt like I don’t exist or am not who I really am. It’s not “out of body” but it feels like someone freaky fridayed me but I have no idea who I was or am now. (This seems to fit depersonalisation more but idk the difference) 

Are any of these things to do w disassociation?"
438,I NEED HELP,[removed]
439,I don't know if I can say that I was 'depressed',"I was never formally diagnosed with anything, as I never went to a doctor, but I have been struggling with my mental health for about two years now. 

Right now I would say I have mostly recovered, (a few days away from reaching 6 months without self harm!) but struggle to describe what I went through. This is probably something that I could discuss with my therapist, but I haven't seen her in a while because of covid. 

I had suicidal thoughts, self harmed regularly, cried well into the night most days, and my grades were slipping as a result. My sleep was impacted, I pulled away from almost all of my friends, honestly I was just a mess. 

I know my experience was much milder than a lot of people's, especially on here, and I don't know if it is fair to people who do have depression to say that I was depressed without a diagnosis, or even if my experience was truly depression. 

I know that 'depressed' is not a label I can assign to myself when I see fit, and it is one that I've tried to avoid, but I've found that if I ever try to talk to someone new about it, they don't take me seriously if I say 'mental health issues' or anything similar, nor do I want to divulge details. It's just kind of painful to see people clearly flip to thinking that I'm just being dramatic if I say I'm struggling with something. 

I discussed this with my sister and a friend, both of whom were diagnosed with depression, and both of them said they thought I had been depressed and could therefore say that I was. However, I know they're both biased towards me, and was hoping I could get unbiased opinions. 

Thank you"

441,"My dear best friend now ignores me, spending time with others and telling me she's busy. I'm torn apart whether I'm an attention whore, or if she's not interested in me anymore","Hi there.  
  
The situation is basically in the title.  
I've started talking with her a few months ago (online, we live far away apart). It seemed like she was feeling alone and she probably saw me as a person who can help. I had the same feeling about myself, so we started talking more frequently, playing games and basically being much closer in terms of our thoughts and feelings towards each other (essentially she loved me as her close friend).  
  
Now, just a few weeks earlier, she started doing some online projects, kind of roleplay communities, and ofc she met new people. The more time passed, the less she did spend it with me, though I tried to not abandon her myself, since she helped me to feel better.  
Now, she doesn't talk to me, unless I express to her that I feel guilty and it's probably my fault (cause I think that my behaviour might be a problem, although not sure), or unless it's in a group chat.  
She doesn't open up to me anymore and doesn't invite to play games as well.  
  
I'm torn apart.  
- My mind on one side thinks that she simply doesn't wanna be friends with me anymore, since I see her spending time with others, her friends, while she says to me that she's busy. I don't even know what she's busy with that she can't even say hello to me once in a while.  
- On the other side, I feel like I'm blowing things too much out of the water and she is actually busy and just wants to dedicate some time to her other friends. Though I still don't understand why she's silent to me. But she tells me to calm down after those messages, it's hard when you don't know the truth and don't know what to do.  
  
Sorry for the long post. I just don't know what to do and that's not the first time this happens with me and different people."

Trigger warning (idk if these are necessary): self-harm, suicidal thoughts

Hi there! This is my first time posting on this subreddit so here goes! 

So recently, my parents found out I was cutting myself, and they understandably got angry at me. I told them about how it happened: I’ve been having suicidal thoughts since April (true) and that I began cutting myself since June (lie, I began May). 

My mother started telling me how selfish, ungrateful, and faithless (I’m in a Catholic family) I was, and at some point told me that I should have been infected with the coronavirus instead. I understand that she was really mad, but these things are really hard to forget. 

My father was supportive and honestly one of the reasons why I didn’t kill myself that night. 

Eventually, my mom’s anger faded and tried to be helpful. She made me promise to never cut myself. I didn’t think I could make that promise truthfully, but there was no way I was walking out of there alive. 

I’ve been clean for a while now, but I’m having worse suicidal thoughts and more frequent breakdowns. I’ve been tempted to cut so many times, but the thought of angering my mother again just makes me cry everytime so I just break down. 

I just feel like I’m stuck; unable to move forwards or backwards. And I’m really scared that one day, I’ll start cutting myself again (or worse). Whenever I get intense thoughts of killing myself or cutting, I just listen to my music which always calms me down— but it’s strange to think that music is what controls my feelings more than my own will. 

I just really need to let this out. I’ve been crying out for a while, and I want someone to hear me. 

Whoever you are, have a nice day, and if you’re going through something, I hope that you will find something worth fighting for.

That’s all!"

I feel the urged to find work and help my family financially and to support my small business. However, IDK why I'm not happy and felt forced. Which is something I find ridiculous. It even led to suicidal thoughts. I started to think that if I kill myself, my parents would have one less person to feed 😔 this worried my boyfriend deeply. I'm currently looking for online jobs now so I am pursuing that but I feel discouraged with baking and my small baking business 😔 I feel useless and worthless and at the same time, very frustrated because my dad imposed this kind of pressure on me to work and sell while my other two siblings don't have to worry. It came to a point that he wants me to teach at night then bake 45-75 pieces of bread per day. Now, I'm lost with my thoughts. Idk why I'm not okay mentally.

459,What ti do when you're so lost?,"So.... I'm not very good at applying myself. I hear the advice, I got the awnser I want to hear but I'm still stuck in life. For example, I've gotten bullied a lot and I want to not care about what other people think of me so I can move on, but I'm still stuck and every time I say that I will change, I don't. I now see that I have little progresses here and there so I guess something is working, I finally have ambition for certain things.

I don't know how to describe it's like this mental block in my head. Every time I hear the advice it's like it just.....I don't know it just feels very emotional and inspiring at first but you hear the advice every single day. ""You want to lose weight?, just eat less that's all"".

What I'm trying to say is I need to get self discipline cuz even though I have the spark and I'm finally woked up and I have ambition I'm still stuck. It's like being a car stuck in the middle of the road, you don't know what to do and then someone gives you gas and got the fuel but you still don't want to drive all the way, you make little drives around the block to see if it's clear and you never go on a full drive to the highway. Idk if that makes sense but it just feels like I'm always gonna be stuck in life and things been hard with my self hatred and anxiety 2 months ago and even though I moved on and learned quite a lot I still feel inadequate but getting better than 2 or 3 weeks and maybe because I'm so denial about everything. I feel like the biggest bitch in the world and I need to change that.

Any advice, man?"
460,Lowest point in my life...,"I think I’ve cried more times this week than I have in my entire life, whilst so much is going on things just keep adding on and making it worse for me. I think I finally know what it feels like to be at breaking point and not being able to continue much longer. As much as I hate to admit to myself that I have been feeling this way, I have been feeling suicidal and that hurts so much. I’d never go ahead and do it I just feel like there’s nothing else left for me and that my life is meaningless. Losing people you really care about really sucks, thankful I don’t mean death related but as in they’re moving on. 

It was only a week ago when I found out that my coworker/crush had to leave work to go to university as the cost of coming to work was too much. It broke me to the core, I felt my heart sink knowing that the girl I not only really care about and like a lot but had kept me going through the pain everyday was just gone like that. It may not seem like that big of a deal to some people but for me it’s the worse news I’ve heard for a very long time. She genuinely pushed me through such rough times and she probably doesn’t even realise it. 

Yesterday was my last shift with her and we had so much fun together. When she had finished her shift it only hit me about 3 minutes after she had left that she was gone and I broke down in tears (in front of customers too which wasn’t a good look honestly) However on that day, she pointed out that the creases in her fingers looked like smiley faces and it was so funny. We were laughing all day about it, calling her Happy Fingers all sorts of names. And so at the end of the day I drew smiley faces on my fingers to remind me of the happiness we had together and I think I’ll keep doing this as a coping mechanism incase anything gets too hard to handle. I know it’s not the end of the world, she hasn’t died or anything like that she’s just left to go to University but it’s gonna be extremely hard to cope without her. She made coming to work so much fun and I’d love to go see her at Uni some day. 

So if you have anybody you really care about and they make you smile, draw a little smiley face on the back of you fingers just as a little reminder of them and that they’re always with you 🙂"
461,I get sudden overwhelming fear for no reason,"I don't know what this is, but it's so random and I'm always getting these experiences and all of a sudden  a overwhelming thought if fear just occurs and I'm usually feeling grey and it happens for a week. I don't know what this is. 3 weeks ago, I had that experience again and I had air hunger for like 2 days or more and I was scared of death and I was very emotional. Why do these things happen to me?"

463,Follow up: I created a chatbot to help people with anxiety and stress,"A while ago I posted about a [chatbot](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/) that helps in difficult moments like anxiety, stress and panic, many of you seemed to find it helpful.

After many of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety. So we made a [comparison](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

Curious what you guys think and if you find it helpful. If there are things you'd like to know that we do not cover, feel free to reach out to me."
464,I feel stressed out and angry all the time. What are some tips on how to just relax?,"I am 28M. I have the unfortunate of having r/raisedbynarcissists for parents. I have really bad anxiety. I panic every time I have to do something really important. I also suffer from this fear of failure (probably because my parents treat me like one) and that makes me a severe perfectionist. To the point where it’s getting in the way of my everything...lol I love to draw and to share my art online. But I haven’t been enjoying my art lately, because it stresses me out. Every time I draw, I obsess over it and think it’s no good. I DO NOT want to stop drawing, as (believe it or not) it’s the only thing that makes me calm. But what are some ways I can just distress and stop feeling like someone’s squeezing my insides all the time?"
465,I'm starting to feel very unwell in the head.,"The country went into lockdown in March and since then, all the restrictions have been lifted. People are coming and going, returning to normality, and meanwhile all I'm doing is staying at home. My parents are across the country, my friends are a train ride away, I only see my boyfriend who comes every weekend and he's more 'cautious' than me. We have a week off work and I suggested driving somewhere and he mentioned how we'll have to use public restrooms and there will be germs and lots of people etc etc. Even when I want to branch out and see friends, I feel that my partner is enabling my anxiety. 

So... all I do is eat, sleep, work, repeat. On the weekends, my boyfriend comes to take me out on walks. It's starting to get me down. Last weekend, we got into an argument because we were cooking and we got the recipe wrong and he got mad and threw something in the sink and it triggered memories of being beaten by a family member. And he was triggered by a bad memory from me talking about feeling overweight, and his mom is manic depressive and tried to kill herself a lot. So, we both left the weekend in a down mood. 

Since that weekend, I have felt the lowest that I've ever felt. I haven't showered since Sunday. Lifting my arms to brush my teeth feels like a gargantuan effort. I haven't cleaned at all when I'd normally be so anal about this kind of thing. I can't concentrate on work. I haven't replied to friends and they're getting fed up. I just don't feel like doing anything except lie in bed. I worked so hard to build up my mental health. I was so good before the pandemic happened and now everything just feels wrong."
466,"Just, I need to vent, no one to talk to",[removed]
467,I feel like a completely different person outside of my head,"In my head I think in composed sentences, like how I'm writing this. I have coherent thoughts and I'm able to put those thoughts into words fairly well. In my head I'm able to express what I'm thinking and how I feel, to myself and in imaginary scenarios. But when it comes to the real world I can hardly string 10 words together. I talk so quiet I can hardly hear myself and I stumble over my words so much most people have trouble even comprehending what I'm saying, if I manage to say anything at all. My brain just ceases to function properly. And it's not just communication, the emotions I feel are often not what comes out and I can't understand why. When I'm alone I feel how I should, or at least mostly - like today I was angry and frustrated from something that happened at class, but once my mum came to see me after getting home, I only managed to hold myself together for a few sentences before I completely broke down in tears, even though I didn't want to or feel any need to cry, I couldn't stop. I don't understand why this is happening to me because I can't do anything to stop it. No one knows who I actually am, my lecturers think I'm lazy and childish. I can't even express it to the doctors and psychologists I've seen. I have social anxieties but this is too extreme. Can someone tell me what to do?."
468,Yesterday was the one year anniversary of when we got engaged but I wasn't overjoyed,"When I woke up yesterday, my FB memories reminded me that my husband and I got officially engaged a year previously, and instead of feeling happy I felt sadness. I didn't see it as a happy reminder of our then upcoming nuptials, but more a reminder that I only had 2 months left with my Dad - the reason why we got engaged when we did.

My now husband and I had moved in together 3 months prior to our engagement, and had been together for 5+ years. So marriage was on the table, we had discussed it but originally were going to wait till we had saved up some more. But once my Mum told me that my Dad had been given 2 months, I said to my Mum ""I always wanted him to walk me down the aisle"" to which she replied ""So did he"". So I discussed it with my Mum and partner and agreed on getting married sooner than planned.

My brothers, now husband and I visited my Dad in hospital, my brothers and I left the room and my now husband asked my Dad for my hand in marriage. Now I've never personally agreeed with asking for permission, but I knew this meant a lot to my Dad and he always wanted to be asked so I wasn't going to deny him that. After my Dad reminded my now husband of his two brothers, playfully tormenting and teasing him, my Dad gave my now husband his blessing. So my now husband and I got officially engaged. There was no proposal, I had always dreamt of being proposed to and my partner knew this, but having my Dad at our wedding meant so much more to me.

We got married at the beginning of October, and my beloved Dad passed away at the end of October. So the engagement reminder serves as a reminder that the time I had left with my Dad was running out. I never counted the days to our wedding like I always thought I would, because it felt like counting the days to his death... 

I love my husband dearly, he has been my rock through my grief. I feel guilty that I don't see our engagement as a happy reminder. I worry that I won't be overjoyed for our first anniversary."
469,What can I do if I cant afford to see a therapist,"Hi everyone, It's my first post here and honestly I'm not doing well at the moment. There are a lot of things on my mind that are giving me intense anxiety and depression to the point it's having an effect on my physical health as well. To clarify I don't mean in the sense of self-harm but it's making me sick. Like many people I am struggling to find work and subsequently am living off saving and what little I can get from the government each month. I live in the UK if that is at all helpful to anyone that might know of free things I could do. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of what I can do until I can afford to see someone. I would also like to say that I'm not comfortable talking to friends or family about my problems if only because I have a real concern that they may end up thinking the way I think and I wouldn't want any of them to become 'infected'. I just dont know what to do anymore and I'm hoping that someone might be able to help me if only a little, please."

471,i cant tell if this thought is fake or real,"i have this thought which i dont want to say, but on a scale out of 10 on how bad it is, id give it a 10 yea.. I might aswell just step forward to the police and have my whole life ruined, because I dont know if its fake or not and no one can answer it for me."
472,It feels like it’s too late for me,"I don’t feel like I can even comprehend feeling “normal” anymore. It’s only been a month and a half since my downward spiral, but the world seems almost incomprehensible now. I don’t know anymore. I feel emotionally detached, I got way too existential, I have no interest in anything, I feel like I broke. 

I feel like nothing is real, I feel like my mind isn’t my own. I feel insane. Like actually insane. Like I feel like the entire world is foreign to me, like I don’t know anything, but I do, and I have memories of when I felt okay. I thought I hit rock bottom before, after I drove myself insane with google and intense rumination, but now I feel even worse. Like nothing inside or outside my mind is real. Like I’ve gone completely insane. 

I don’t know how else to describe it. I don’t feel like the person I knew two months ago. I don’t feel like a person at all. I feel like I should be scared. But I don’t know how to feel anymore. 

Intrusive and existential thoughts, depression, anxiety, depersonalization, loss of emotional attachment, all these things took hold of me one after another. I feel too far gone. I don’t know what to do or who I am. I think I’ve gone off the deep end. I think I’ve gone fully insane. I kept googling things, trying to find out what was wrong with me, but all I did was make it worse and harder to tell what was real and what was stuff I put in my head. 

I feel like banging my head against a wall, I feel like running away from myself, I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m scared and confused now. And I know that it’s probably just from all the junk I’ve been googling, but I feel like it’s too late for me. 

I want to be myself again. I want to like the things I used to like and be the person I know I used to be. The person I remember being. I don’t know who I am anymore, like I understanding basic concepts feels off. Every day I feel different. 

I feel like I should have listened to my therapist a long time ago “stop ruminating” “stop looking for answers” “you’ll return to your normal self if you leave this alone” “try daily meditations” 

I feel like it’s too late now. My passions have been replaced. I feel completely detached from the world. I’m only 21 years old. I had my whole life ahead of me. I had dreams, aspirations, goals, and I was really interested in science. I was almost always daydreaming about something. Last year was the best and most real and in person year of my life. I came out of my shell even more, got to meet some amazing people, got really into so many books and stories. 

I felt really connected to the real world. Now I feel the opposite. I dissociated hard over break and couldn’t stop freaking out about it. I started questioning everything about myself in that state. I couldn’t see the real world around me anymore. I couldn’t comprehend people anymore, I felt emotionally disconnected. All of a sudden things became foreign, and the more I tried to get back to myself, the worse it got. I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t even know if I can ever be my “normal self” ever again. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m afraid of myself. I’m afraid of the permanence of this. I can barely bring up my old memories anymore, and I don’t know if I’m doing this to myself, if this is all just one big intrusive thought, or if it’s real. 

I was assaulted by depression, depersonalization, existential and intrusive thoughts, emotional and empathetic disconnection, anxiety, fear, rumination, and loss of passion. 

I feel like I just kept making it worse to the point of actual insanity. I can’t think any normal thoughts. 

Maybe I just tricked myself into thinking I went insane. Maybe I’m not actually insane but I just feel that way. I don’t know anymore. 

I’ve posted on this subreddit plenty of times before, but I’ve never felt like this."

474,I need help dealing with a sibling who is paranoid,"Basically my sibling has a history of various mental health symptoms, drug and alcohol issues, hospital admissions from suicide attempts and/or overdoses, can't control their money, etc.

They keep coming to us with so many odd conspiracy theories and I'm honestly exhausted and tired of dealing with it. We're in the midst of getting them help, but it has been a process.

Just recently they came to me with a theory about how 'they' ('they' being the government and police) have a hidden agenda to push rap music through TV, internet, etc to make it the biggest genre so that more people want to become rappers, then they will rap about their crimes and incriminate themselves so that the government can have all these people arrested, with a criminal record and to enslave them to poverty. 

I told them very bluntly I had a Zoom meeting (which was true) and I didn't have time to debate them but that's simply not true because artists like Ed Sheeran, etc. and pop acts are the biggest and people can rap about more things than just illegal activities and that police need actual evidence than song lyrics to charge people.

They also told me that just before Covid lockdowns happened, leaders world-wide had a meeting and that this is part of their agenda and they were trying to get me to agree that it was weird that world leaders would meet before a big event like Covid.

I told them that for a long time, world leaders have been meeting with each other at multiple events every year like G20, etc. even decades prior to Covid and that just because world leaders met before Covid, that doesn't mean they were meeting ABOUT some conspiracy to unleash Covid on the world.

Also apparently wearing face masks are a way for the government to judge how many of their population are willing to blindly listen and be controlled by them.  Who knew right?! They won't wear a mask out anywhere.

I'm just exhausted. This is almost a daily occurrance.

Does anyone have any good resources or information about dealing with people who are in these paranoid states? Should I just be very blunt and shut down any paranoid talk or should engage them on the topic? 

I'm just concerned if I argue too much against them, will they suddenly think I am part of some conspiracy against them?"

476,My fellow panic disorder sufferers: how is grocery shopping going for you?,"With everything going on, grocery stores are usually jam packed so I prefer to go on days in the middle of the week when there are less customers. However, a lot of the things I need are sold out and I end up having to come up with something on the fly and I get overwhelmed and stressed out. To avoid the stress, I’ll go on busier days when I know items are in stock. Unfortunately, navigating through the sea of people who aren’t staying 6 feet from me or following the one way signs is a nightmare for me. Instead of being mildly stressed because I can’t find dinner ingredients, I begin panicking due to having to deal with so much going on at once. It’s crippling. How’s everyone else doing?"

478,I don’t want to be a mom anymore,"When I was 17 I got pressured into a relationship. A couple months in the road he pressured me to have sex. I always declined and said I wanted to wait until marriage. He was very abusive and controlling and would manipulate me with suicide and such. He was emotionally and physically abusive. He scared tf out of me. Long story short, I have in and sex even when I didn’t want to. The first time I had sex I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. A couple months down the road I ended up getting pregnant while in hs. (This was literal hell). I contemplated abortion and decided against it. The whole time I was pregnant I was angry and furious at God for letting this happen to me. This man would leave bruises on me and punch holes in the wall. This domestic violent relationship left me with many emotional and behavioral problems. I ended up chasing more chaos because I didn’t know I was suffering from PTSD at the time. I am thankful enough that I had supportive parents at the time and allowed me to go to college through this. I am 22 year old single mother with a bachelors degree. I am still mentally and emotionally stuck to when I was 17. I am so so angry at what happened to me. I didn’t deserve this or what happened to me. I didn’t want to be a mom. I love my son more than anything in the world and treat him so well. But I wish I could go back in time. I want to be able to do what I want, when I want. I don’t think I ever wanted to be a mom. I always think what my life would have been like if I didn’t have a kid. I play the part though. None of my family or friends know that I feel this way. It’s like I can’t move on. I need to find peace but I don’t know how to pursue. Please help me."

481,How do I make up with my past self?,"I made some shitty decisions in the past. Well, not even shitty decisions, more like a lack of any decisions at all, caused by procrastination, laziness, and only caring about instant gratification. I had the dream life laid out in front of me and I squandered it all away and now I'm at square minus one with no way back. My life path was permanently thrown off course and even if I grind the rest of my life now, there's no way I'll ever get anywhere close to the life I could have had if I'd put in like 3% more effort.

Pretty much all my days now are spent in regret, envy, and most important of all a searing, burning, unending rage at my idiotic, selfish, stupid, piece of shit past self. I want nothing more than to invent a time machine and go back and drive a rusted nail through that bastard's skull for fucking my life up so bad and wasting it all away for some fucking Netflix and games.

I know this isn't good for my mental health. But I'm at an absolute loss for what to do. I thought about ways to fix it but therapy isn't really a concept here in the third world and even if it was I couldn't afford it anyway. I was hoping I might be able to procure some shrooms or something from somewhere and experience total ego death and have an epiphany and fix everything in one shot but none of that kinda stuff is available here either.

The only thing I can think of is maybe writing it all down. But where do I even start with that? Do I write a letter to my past self laying out everything he fucked up but forgiving him because he didn't know better? Do I write a letter to my future self promising that I'm not going to fuck it up this time? What do I even do?"

It's got to the point where I would quit in an instant if I could, I've applied for new jobs but worth the pandemic there are few jobs hiring. Every day I feel like I'm getting closer to pouring a drink over my PC and running away from everything.
I don't really don't know what to do but I'm nearing breaking point."
483,How bad is it exactly to have repetitive thoughts of suicide?,"I had a mental breakdown at the end of 2019. As a result, I found a psychiatrist and a therapist and earnestly sought help, I was diagnosed with clinical depression.

My psychiatrist always asks me if I have thoughts of suicide or self harm. And I've said yes, I do, but that I consider them annoyances. Like, wtf kind of stupid thought is that, get out of my head!

Philosophically, I have some complicated views on suicide. I'm not religious and don't buy proscriptions against suicide as legitimate, though I do recognize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. However, in caring for my mom in her decrepit slide towards oblivion, I've realized that there are situations in which I would settle my arrangements and choose to go out on my own terms, though I don't go so far as to codify them beyond ""old as hell and dying of cancer, maybe"".

But philosophical musings don't really explain the intrusive thought that repeats when I'm frustrated by the demands of adulthood, ""shoot yourself in the head"". It's so fucking dumb, I don't want to die, I just want to lay down to sleep for approximately 2 years. Moreover, shooting yourself in the head is a dumb fucking way to attempt suicide, in no way guaranteed to actually kill you.

So we return to the titular question, how bad is it for me to be experiencing this repetitive thought pattern, even though I recognize it as stupid and logically reject it? I realize ""bad"" is subjective, but I'm still asking."

492,What was supposed to help me is making me worse,"I dont know how to word this without it being a babble but I’m just so stuck. I’ve been out of the psych ward for the entirety of this year and when Lockdown due to Covid eased up in July, I got a volunteer job in a small shop to fill my time and help me start getting out of my house as recommended by my community team. 

The thing is, I hate it. It’s causing me panic attacks and it’s getting harder and harder to find the energy to exist. The staff there are one big family and I’m treated like an outsider most of the time. The managers struggle to remember my name, everybody has their own friends there and have no interest in talking to me unless nobody else is around. I do twice as much work as the other volunteers and a lot of the time I’m spoken to like a child. I just don’t know how to cope. I want to quit but I only go in twice a week for a couple of hours and leaving would make me a failure. 

My CPN basically told me in March when I told him that I wanted to volunteer when I’m feeling stable enough to do so that he expected me to give up and end up relapsing.
Nobody has faith that I can do anything with my life and at first I fought back as a “fuck you” but I can’t stop thinking “maybe they’re right, there’s no hope for me” now.

I feel like I’m either a pity case or a burden. There’s no in between."

Its more like someone told me what happened on these days, rather than me actually experiencing them.

Sometimes people will talk to me, and they'll be speaking clear English, but it judt sounds like gibberish. I can understand they're speaking English but I just can't seem to process the words they're saying. 

I don't understand a lot of things all the time and it scares me"
497,How to keep going,I feel like the earth is slowing crushing me in here by inch and I’m going to break any minute. My mom is a meth addict and I’m financially stuck with my parents. My mental health was handing on by a thread. Yesterday my boyfriend can come with lipstick on his arm and he told me that he was questioning his sexuality and nothing else happened because he realized that’s not what he wanted. As I was sobbing he was crying too and telling me how much he loved me and that I haven’t done anything wrong. I love him so much. He’s the reason I’m still living. How do I live with the fear that he’ll do this again? How do I keep going when I feel like everyone I love has betrayed me? I am spiraling

499,Girlfriend [F21] on anti-depressants without therapy. Will the meds alone help her?,"Hi. I hope this is the right sub for this.

So, my girlfriend had to move back to her parents during the pandemic. The move and re-adjusting has been though, she also lost her grandmother and got very very scared for get grandfather. A lot else has been going on too, and she got an anxiety attack a 2 weeks ago.

After this, she was given anti-anxiety meds for 3 days. She said they didn't sit well for her, she consulted another doctor, who put her on anti depression meds. 

Coming to my question, is it ok to be in these meds? Are the addictive? She says are aren't and the general course duration for these is 6 months. She says she's not ready for therapy, and upon a lot of persuasion from me, she said she'll try online therapy. Will medicines alone without therapy help?

A made a longer post about what's going on with her here - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ibfk05/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_has_been_going_through_a/

Thank you."
500,My friend and I were having a decent conversation. I said I was there for her when she felt overwhelmed...,"Then I sent her a pic that says she deserves to be happy, etc and I asked her what she thought. She can make a beautiful life for herself even if she lost years to trauma, abuse, etc.

We were supposed to have a conversation last week but I think her family is giving her a hard time about this and that. How should I approach?"
501,Just wondering if anyone else feels like this sometimes.,[removed]
502,I reached out for help after struggling for so long,"Trigger warning 

This will probably be longer than it should and I’m sure no one will read till the end. But the moral of the story is if you know something isn’t right then reach out. It doesn’t have to be to your parents. Reach out to a doctor directly. I’ve also been told that there are tons of free resources if costs is a concern. 

Let me also say that it’s better to reach out sooner rather than later. Waiting on makes things worse. I know it’s extremely hard and can seem impossible but things do truly get better. 

I’ve suffered from severe anxiety and depression my entire life. Long before I knew what those words meant I remember the sad and empty feelings. I grew up a pretty normal kid. I was raised by my grandma. My mom was physically around but wasn’t always mentally and emotionally there for me if that makes sense. I love my grandma with all of my heart and I’m afraid to think of where I’d be without her but I still wish my mom had taken more interest in me. I still love her but I wish things had been different. 

I also have aspergers which causes me to have pretty severe social issues. It was near impossible to make friends and if I made them it was very hard to keep them. I never hung out with friends and have always lived a pretty isolated life. 

Around the age of 12 it really started to affect my mental state. I began cutting further cut myself off from everyone. I’m a very private person and never shared my feelings or emotions with anyone at all. 

By the age of 17 my depression was probably at its peak. I struggled in school and was teased a lot. I had a couple of boyfriends but I was no where near mentally ready for that even though I thought I was at the time. That along with my mom moving out really led me down a spiral. 

I had a basically minimum wage job with no desire to go to college. No boyfriend. No friends. And I felt more alone than ever. When I was 17 I tried to commit suicide. I spent about a month in the ICU and a mental health facility. It was absolutely horrible. Like I mentioned I’m a private person so for my entire family and everyone I know to know how I felt was horrible. And having to talk with doctors and nurses about it was just as bad. 

I’ll be honest I lied to them. I said any and everything I could to get out as fast  as possible. I wanted to go home. A few months after I got home I stopped taking my medicine and it would be another ten years before I reached out for help again. 

I finally was able to go home but everything was different. Every time I asked to take a shower, because yes I had to ask after that, my family always had a worried look on my face like I was going to go into the bathroom and cut myself. I had to keep the door to my room open unless I was changing and even then someone always knocked on my door to make sure I was okay. 

My mom had to tell my job what happened because I couldn’t come to work. When I finally went back everyone kept telling me that if I ever need to talk they were there and stuff and it made me feel better but at the same time I hated that they knew what I did. It sucked to live life after that because everyone knew. And I could tell by the look on their face when they looked at me. 

But what hurt the absolute most was wishing I had succeeded. I still wanted to die. I still wanted to cut. But I never wanted to put my family through that again. I realized that they did care in their own way. We all expect our parents and family to be perfect but they’re not. Just because they’re parents it doesn’t mean that they know what they’re doing. I feel like most families try to do their best in the ways that they know how. It’s easy for us to point out their flaws but in reality they may be things they don’t even realize are affecting us. 

All I know for sure is that I truly broke my mom and grandmas heart and I hate that I put them through that. They have their own mental health issues and I feel horrible for making it worse. 

The time between that experience and me turning 19 was a blue. I moved out and lived with whoever would let me stay with them. That led to drinking and drugs. I never had friends but it’s crazy the “friends” you’ll make when you buy the drugs and alcohol. I was always a shy and quiet loner but for the first time I felt like the “cool” kid as lame as that sounds. 

During that time I was living life to the fullest, or so I thought. For someone who guys never looked at I was hooking up with people just to have a good time. This led me to meeting someone who was about 15 years older than me. It never struck me as odd that someone so much older who had a good career and owned their own home would be interested in an 18 year old socially awkward kid. He was a police officer so I thought he could be trusted. That was until he shoved me against his squad car and raped me in an empty parking lot. 

That moment really changed everything for me. I realized that the past year of my life really sucked. I was surrounded by people who didn’t give a fuck about me. They only talked to me because I liked to have a good time. I just so desperately wanted to be wanted I would have done anything to get it. 

I suddenly just cut everyone off. I got a new job and really focused on it. I worked 16+ hours a day four days a week. I was quickly promoted and at 19 was looking at a $40k a year job which wasn’t too bad for someone who didn’t go to college and barely graduated. 

Out of the blue I met someone who seemed absolutely perfect. He seemed to get me. My awkwardness wasn’t a bad thing to him. Within a couple of months I found out I was pregnant. It wasn’t something I was ready for but he was supportive. My pregnancy itself was healthy and fine but my relationship was rocky. Turns out he wasn’t over his ex and cheated on me several times while I was pregnant. 

Despite that I forgave him. Looking back I’m glad I did but at the time I felt so stupid. I was so afraid of having a child alone that I looked past his bad behavior and put up with things I didn’t deserve. (I’m in no way condoning this.) 

Fast forward seven years. His behavior made a complete 180. We got married and things seemed great. However my depression and anxiety were always there. It never went away. It had a pretty big negative impact on my marriage but even worse I realized it was having a negative impact on my child. 

At the time I didn’t realize that what I was doing was bad for my child. I didn’t see the harm in drinking and getting shitfaced once they went to bed. Except for the fact that they would be late to school the next day because I was so hungover I slept through my alarm. I didn’t realize that me starting to cut again was bad for them. Until it was summer time and they wanted to go swimming and I had to say no because I had to wear long sleeves to cover the cuts. I didn’t think that smoking weed when my child wasn’t home was bad until they wanted to play soccer and I couldn’t afford the fees because I bought weed. 

Once all of that clicked in my head it broke my heart to see what I had been doing. My child is the absolute most sweetest and amazing thing I’ve ever seen and they deserved sooooooo much better than me. They deserved a mom who gave them a bath at night and let them play in the tub instead of a rushed bath early in the morning. They deserved a mom who went outside with them to play instead of one who was too hungover to do anything. 

With all that being said I worked my ass off and couldn’t afford my bills and lost 90lbs in a year because I couldn’t afford food for myself because I chose to send my child to the very best private daycare I could find. My child always had a coat in the winter and shoes that fit. And I did it all on my own. They never had to worry about if they could eat or not because I sacrificed so much money and time to make sure they had a good life. 

But then I realized that I could have saved the $1300 a month on day care and I could have been a stay at home mom and spent that time with them teaching them myself. I could have let them help me grow a garden to provide healthy food for us. I could have done so much better. The material things truly don’t matter. It’s all about the quality time. And I wasn’t providing enough quality time. And I will regret that for the rest of my life. Just typing this has my crying because I hate that I wasted some of the most important years of my child’s life because I was being an ignorant, selfish, piece of shit. 

But when I realized that I knew I needed help. I knew I needed help years before that but I kept telling myself I’d try harder, I’d make changes, I’d be nicer, I’d be more patient. But in reality I was too afraid to pick up the phone and make an appointment. I kept pushing off doing what needed to be done because I was afraid to talk about my past. I was afraid to admit I needed help. I was afraid of opening up and being made to feel stupid like I did when I was in the hospital at 17. 

But it finally got the point where I realized I was at the bottom. I was not only not the best parent my child deserved but I was also a shitty wife. I laid in bed instead of doing the dishes. I got high instead of making sure my family had clean clothes. I would get drunk and fall and have to make excuses for the scrapes and bruises everywhere. I was a mess and when I realized that I couldn’t take it another second. I couldn’t continue doing that to my family because they didn’t deserve it. 

So I picked up the phone and I made an appointment. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I did have the support of my husband but he had no clue how hard it was for me. I called to make the appointment shaking. I was hyperventilating. I couldn’t breath. The lady on the phone making my appointment had to have thought I was an idiot because I could barely talk. She asked me why I wanted to see a doctor and I could barely whisper “for my anxiety and depression” but I made the appointment. 

The appointment itself was even worse. I had to talk about things that no one knew about. I had to talk about being raped. I over analyze everything I say. So in my head I was worried about saying that because honestly how do you verbally say “I made poor life choices and was raped which caused severe mental trauma” how do you say that? What tone of voice do you use? How do I word it? 

But I just talked to the doctor. I could barely get it all out. I was crying while talking to her. I was hyperventilating. She kept telling me to breath and would ask me something positive to help me calm down. She answered all of my questions even though I worded them like a complete moron. 

That appointment was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. But it was the beginning of a great change. I immediately stopped drinking and stopped smoking. I decided to completely dedicate my life to being the absolute best parent I could be. I got put on medication that helped me tremendously. It helped me in ways I never thought were possible. I no longer wanted to lay in bed all day. I no longer got so overwhelmed I went to the bathroom to cut. I no longer got so angry so fast. I wasn’t snapping on anyone anymore. Every single area of my life improved ten fold. It was honestly incredible. 

My only regret is not reaching out sooner. I hated that it took me almost destroying my marriage, fucking up at work, and harming my child to get help. I wish someone would have grabbed me and shook me and made the appointment for me. But truthfully I don’t think that would have worked. I had to be the one to see what I was doing. I had to want to change and be better. I don’t think treatment would have been successful unless it was something I REALLY wanted for myself. 

So I’m very proud of myself for finally getting help. I’m proud of myself for stopping the things that were harming the people I loved the most. I’m proud of myself for finally realizing I had a problem that needed a doctor to fix. I know some parents truly fuck up their kids lives and they never see the error of their ways. I know grown adults who still deal with the trauma of parents who were addicted to drugs or who were alcoholics. I’m proud of myself for realizing that and getting help before it’s too late. 

While I never did anything bad in front of my child, I never beat my child, and I provided everything they needed I wasn’t providing the quality time they needed. And I’m glad that I can do that now. 

I’ve only been taking my new medication for a couple of months now but I’m already seeing changes. My child is showing a lot more affection towards me that before they only showed their father. I’m able to stay on track of things at work. I’m able to face challenging situations while staying calm and being able to rationally solve them. 

I’m happy for once and look forward to the future. To anyone that is still reading this please just take a moment to think about what really matters in your life. If you don’t have anything or anyone who truly provides meaning to your life then think about what you’d like to have in the future. Do you want a happy and healthy relationship? Do you want to be a parent? Do you want to go to a great college? Do you want to have a fun and rewarding career? Pick a goal and focus on it.

It sounds so cliche and like such bullshit but when people say you have to first take care of yourself before you can take care of someone or something else that is 100% true. If you’re not first focused on yourself and your well being you will truly never be able to give some your all. Despite what you think. 

Don’t wait ten years like I did. Don’t hurt the people who love you. Don’t lose great jobs. Don’t give up on the things you love and enjoy. But overall don’t suffer everyday. Even if you think that no one cares be okay with that. Care for yourself. Care for your future. At 17 I wanted to die. I never thought I’d ever be married or be a parent. I never would have thought I’d travel to see amazing things or ever have a job where I wasn’t busting my ass for hardly any money. I never thought I’d have meaningful hobbies or really even deeply care about anything. 

But life is crazy and will surprise you when you’re least expecting it. Treat yourself kindly and take care of yourself and you’ll see the world in a whole new way. If anyone has actually made it this far be proud of yourself for everything you’ve accomplished so far. Your family and your past don’t define you. You can make a change today and be a new person tomorrow. It’s YOUR life. No one else’s. So live it for yourself in the most meaningful way possible. 

Getting help doesn’t mean you’re weak. Mental disorders are nothing more than a chemical imbalance in your brain. It can be fixed with the right medication. If you’re not in a great mental place right now just know that I can get better. You don’t have to feel like this forever. 

I wish everyone the absolute best. Much love."

506,"It's a hard time for everyone. If I plug my head into a computer, this is what I would see.","There is so much shit in my head. I wish I could connect my brain via USB to my PC and just start deleting things. Let me try something. Beep boop.

I’m in. *Welcome to Mind-space.*

What welcome? The desktop is a complete mess. It’s like those icons are in a Mumbai local, mashed up so close together and pretending it’s okay. Which reminds me, I haven’t done my weekend laundry. Let me click on sort-by-type. Ah, that’s better. The biggest folder that seems to occupy my mind-space: *people*. Double click to open.

What the absolute fuck? Who are all these people? I’ve met this many people? The introverts will be pissed if they see this.

Well I’m not surprised to see my bosses/colleagues there, or my family. But it’s a Sunday evening and neither of them are around, so why are these programs running? End task. That’s better, let’s move on.

Good lord, there are so many women here and I don’t even know half of them. Goddamn dating/matrimony apps and Instagram. When will I learn? Oh look at this one. So many long conversations into the night. \*Skims through chats\*. Damn, I was way too honest about my insecurities. We had such great times. Now my messages lie read and seen, rotting away in her inbox, just like my feelings. Here’s another. So many long..wait. This again? Oh man. How many people have just left me for dead without any reason, or even a fight? Why the fuck are they still following me on Instagram? Why am I the one feeling sorry for myself? How are they still occupying my mind-space? *“Do you want to delete these files permanently?”. “YES, computer, yes! What did I ever do to make these friends ghost me? Were they ever really friends? For life may take us in different directions, but good memories do not exempt anyone from basic human decency.”*

Ah. Matches on dating apps. Look at those chats, these should be called micro-relationships. Like fizzed-out beers nobody wants to drink. We post more pictures than share real things about ourselves. So much skin, so little substance. Tele-callers probably make better connections selling insurance.

Oh hey, Instagram. This is probably the worst part. The sheer number of people whose newsfeeds are tattooed in my head. I can’t even see my real friends anymore. In fact, where are they? When you spend enough time in there, the entire world seems to consist only of the people who post things on Instagram. Everyone else just ceases to exist. And that’s a problem, because not all your friends will be active there. So the more time you spend in it, Instagram’s algorithm decides your ‘friend’ circle for you.

Let’s look at the feelings eating up my RAM. Frustration, well that’s probably from the pandemic. Anger, of course having wasted yet another weekend, what else did I expect? Loneliness: self-explanatory. Hate. Hate? For who? \*Right click → Analyse\*. Shit, I’m spending energy, and this much energy, on hating myself? \*Click Details\*: No progress personally or professionally since forever? Says who? And since when did I start caring about progress? And where is happiness in this list? Why is the hate bar growing? End task, end task!

Okay, deep breath.

*Dear K,*

*You are simply overwhelmed. It is a natural human reaction for someone whose entire life just flashed in front of him on a computer. You know how to deal with overwhelming thoughts. Let me remind you. First ask yourself, what can you control, and what is outside it? People — the ones you love, the ones you don’t, the ones you meet, the ones you won’t — lie outside your control. Accept it, and focus on what you can control, and do so. Second, stop classifying all life experience into good and bad. The same goes for feelings. For one cannot pick and choose: welcome them all, or shut them all. Reflect, but don’t rate, because you aren’t being examined, you have been gifted life.*

*Yours mindfully,*

*Mind-space*

Wait, this feels nice. My mind is much clearer. More than it has been all weekend. Let me check my RAM again. So clean! “Computer, what changed in the last 5 hours?”

*“You switched off your mobile data.”*"

Ive gone through so much trauma from childhood to adulthood but never let it get to me academically while in school. But once I got to college, it’s like I couldn’t handle it anymore and just fell rock bottom. 

I enrolled in college to start this fall because I just have 5 more classes to graduate with my associates degree. I’ve been in and out of college for almost 10 yrs. I have a below 2.0 gpa and always fail out or drop out. And I’m just so embarrassed about my overall situation. I found who was my advisor and sent her an email using my personal email because idk how to access my school email since I haven’t taken a class in yrs. I sent her this email:


Good morning,

I hope you are doing well amid this pandemic. My name is (my name) and I am considered a sophmore student at (school name). I am emailing in regards to courses I need to finish my associate's degree as you are my listed advisor. I have been in and out of college for the last 8-9 yrs or so and have struggled with college in general due to many different personal reasons. I am making the effort to get the help I need and would like to try to finish my degree. I have continuously dropped out or failed out, my GPA is below a 1.9 and I am on academic probation. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, and just disappointed in myself that my educational goals have sunk so far below what I thought possible. I think I need about 5 more classes and would like to really finish. I have always struggled with math and have not even tried taking the last credit needed. I know I will have to take remedial courses for that and am unsure what classes that would be or who I need to speak to about that if it isn't you. Every person that I have previously spoken to at (school name) has always been rude or just made me feel worse about my situation which is one of the reasons why I haven't tried to finish because I'm to embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. I would really appreciate any guidance as an advisor you can offer so that I can finally finish. Thanks so much!

And all she responded was to email her on the school email... that pushed me over the edge and I’m just bawling my eyes out. I don’t even know to access the school email."

I mean, I question reality a lot but i’m pretty sure everyone does that, still i would say i’m quite anchored to it (reality) it’s just there are moments when stuff doesn’t seem real, I also have pretty bad short term memory so the concept of time fucks me up and the notion that it can’t be stopped is weird to me. im having a psychiatric evaluation soon just because i want to be sure but yeah, idk if this is normal stuff or if most people don’t even think about this."

516,A letter to my 16 year old self - It really does get better,"Dear younger me,

you just started to hurt yourself. You hate the way you look and can't stand looking into the mirror. It's sad, because you're actually beautiful, but you can't believe that yet. You think that starving yourself will make you happy, but even if you don't eat at all, you're still unsatisfied with yourself. In the next few years you will have scars all over your body. You will try to take your life and think about trying it again everyday. You will start therapy and it won't help. You will start antidepressants and it won't help. You will feel like drowning and whenever you hear 'it gets better' you will be annoyed, because it doesn't.

You will fall in love for the first time and have your heart broken for the first time. You will have your first real relationship and after three years it will end. It will hurt, because that was your entire life and it feels like it's never going to be okay, ever again. Years later and you're still not good enough, not thin enough, not .... enough. By now you had 2 different therapists and while there are good days, it always gets bad again. You just can't understand why you're so broken. Your mental health destroys everything.  Yet, you somehow still completed school and went on to university. You got your first apartment alone. You started driving. You got out of that abusive situation. Right now, it's hard to see the good. I know you feel like nothing you do is ever enough, but it is. You have to work harder than others, but you're so strong, you can do that.

I already went through everything. I finally got diagnosed and know why I behave the way I behave. I'm on medication and it's been some time since I last hurt myself. My SO is sitting in our kitchen right now and he makes me feel like home. I am finally in a place I can call home. It's not always easy. Actually, it's still a lot of work. My mental health gets in the way and I have to work hard to live a normal life.  I'm about the finish university and already have my job lined up.  The bad days get are getting less and less and I'm learning how to get through them. Alone. I'm strong enough to do that. If I have a bad day now, I know that it will pass. 

I want to tell you, that you are worthy of love. That you are perfectly fine the way you are and that you will get through this. You will get through this step by step. It might seem like you're barely moving, but if I look back I can see how far I've come. 

It does get better, just slowly.  I can't wait for you to see how beautiful you're life is going to turn out, even if thats hard to believe right now.

I thought someone might need to hear this, too, so i figured i'd post it here."
517,thinking my Father in law will commit suicide,"today is a sad day for our extended family. my wife mother pass, after being in cancer remission for the pass year. 

I'm feeling ok, and so is my daughter (7). my wife is taking is not too bad considering. but the hardest hit was my father in law, and it normally.

a bit of back story. they both live in our house (in law suit) 10y ago the father in law got sick, very aggressive arthritis, and a heart attack (few month in hospital) because of this he fear doctor and don't want to get treatment.

due to limited fund and a house falling apart they moved with us. shortly after my mother in law got diagnosed with cancer (making the father in law stressed).


since they move, and even more after she got cancer, he was going down hill on the mental side. some day not eating, venting out frustration on little thing. openly saying we don't want him there and that he is unwanted.

i always had a bad feeling that one day he would try to get an other heart attack. especially if something would happen to the mother in law.

well today is that day, he lost the little bit he had left. no house, no work, no partner.
 I'm fearful that he would do something. and i highly doubt that he would go willingly see a professional.

I'm at a lost and I don't want my wife or my kid to go through an other members dieing so close to the other.

anyone have something to help up."
518,"I don’t know who I am anymore, I feel like I’m too far gone","I feel empty. Null. Nothing. No outward emotions, no empathy or connections. I can’t feel my passions, I can’t find my imagination. 

I just started taking Prozac today but I feel like it’s too late for me. Like I’m too far gone.

I had a mental breakdown in July regarding me looking inward at the darker side of myself (that I’m not sure was even real anymore) that sent me on a manic downward spiral of googling random mental health issues. “What’s okay and what’s not okay?” “What am I comfortable with and what am I not?” I was questioning everything, what thoughts were mine and what thoughts were genuine? What do I like and what do I not like? Why do I like/dislike those things? Is it because of anything I don’t like about myself? I don’t know anymore. I got a bunch of intrusive thoughts, googled intrusive thoughts and then got even more. Now anything involving death or violence sparks the automatic thought in my brain “was I okay with this or not? When does life matter and when does it not? How did this make me feel before?” For some reason it’s not automatic anymore. I don’t know what happened, I think I got too deep and too existential. Now I don’t feel anything emotionally. I was looking at cute animals on reddit and felt nothing. The thought that went through my head  was “why don’t I feel anything? What’s the point? It’s going to die at some point anyway, it’s not like it matters.” And I used to LOVE animals. Nature was my biggest passion and a mixture of intrusive thoughts, depression, and depersonalized existentialism ruined that for me. 
I feel like I did this to myself. Like I’m the one who ruined my passion. I questioned myself, which turned into me questioning the world. I let intrusive thoughts take over, I let my depression take over. I’ve never lost my passion before. I used to have a great sense of humor, I used to be very emotionally attached, especially to animals, but now it’s gone. It’s completely gone. I used to know what I was into and what I wasn’t. I knew that instinctually. But now I feel like I have to rely on my memory of how I used to feel about things. I feel like I’m a completely different person now. Emotionless and uncaring. Separated from the world. Unable to connect. I feel like I’m actually insane sometimes. I feel like there’s no way to return to the person I used to be. I have no motivation to do anything. I feel hopeless. I sometimes feel like I want to die. Like there’s no way out from how I ruined myself.

I feel like I should have called the therapist as soon as I started feeling depressed. I feel like I should have done more. I feel like I shouldn’t have tried to look inwards at myself while also feeling depressed. I feel like there were so many things I should have done instead. 

I should have listened to my therapist and stuck with those meditations. I should have listened and stopped ruminating as soon as I found myself pacing the floor. I should have put down the phone instead of continuing to google things. 

But I did those things and now it feels like it’s too late. I’m either null or an anxious mess. 

I can’t remember what I used to find funny. Sometimes it feels like I’m sabotaging myself. Sometimes I feel fake, like this is who I truly always was. Sometimes my grief over not being able to connect seems fake, sometimes I feel like I’m actually becoming a sociopathic monster or something. I feel like I’m preventing myself from feeling positive or confident out of that fear that I’ll actually become a sociopathic killer or something. That was an old intrusive thought that sometimes came up when my mom watched true crime shows or when I engaged in the more deviant pornography I used to watch. 

Quitting cold turkey due to ED is what sent me down this spiral, or more accurately, telling my therapist about the deviant stuff is what led me down here. I began to question if other violent stuff made me aroused (some might have possibly done so), which made me then question why that matters, which made me question why ANYTHING matters. I became uncomfortable around violence in any form, questioning when it was okay and when it wasn’t. I dissociated with the world beyond recognition. I lost my emotions and interests and simple pleasures. I feel like I’ll never be myself again.

I used to have passion but now I have nothing. How do I come back from this? It feels impossible. It also feels like I just psyched myself out. Like if I could somehow forget the events of the past two months I’d be fine. I know I’m still in here somewhere, I know that things I like. I just don’t know how to contact that side of me. I’ve been talking to my therapist every day, but I don’t know if he’s really helping. 

I want to laugh at the same jokes again, I want to cry at the same sad scenes again. I want to be enthralled when I see a cute animal. I want to enjoy playing games and reading stories and being connected with people. I want my outward emotions back. I want my daydreams back. I want my stories back. I want to think back and reminisce over the best year of my life. I want to go outside and be fascinated by nature. I want to not question wether I should feel a certain way when I see predator prey interaction. I want to feel anger at the world, I want to care about the environment. I want to read comics and draw and write and just be engaged in a good story. But I don’t know how. I don’t know if it’s even possible anymore. How do I come back from a place I’ve never been? A low I’ve never reached? 

My mom says I give up too easily, and that’s why I’m here, but how do I get out of here? How do I go back to loving life? How do I go back to feeling like a real person again? I feel like I’ve been permanently marked by this event. I feel like I’m trapped down here. I want to care about my friends and family. I want to care about my dog. I want to care about the random pictures of animals I see on Reddit. I want to find nature fascinating again. I want to go back to listing and sorting and organizing things in my head. I want to go back to enjoying romantic stories. I want to go back to getting hyped when a movie trailer or a new game trailer is revealed. I want to get excited by my favorite tv shows. I want to be myself again. I just don’t know how to do it. How to get back to myself. I want it I need it I NEED to be me! I feel like I rejected a part of myself that I should have just accepted, but now it’s so distorted that I can’t bring myself to even look at it. I feel like a part of me died. I want to revive that side of myself. I want that feeling of passion back. I want to feel real again. 

Whenever I try to engage in my interests I feel nothing. I remember how I used to feel, how I used to be, but it’s faint. It’s the memory of a feeling, and not the feeling itself. I want to indulge in my guilty pleasures again, without feeling... well, guilty. I want my chaotic sense of humor back. I want to create zany characters again for DND and for my own enjoyment. I want to be myself. But I don’t really know how to be me anymore. Intrusive thoughts and existentialism and depression have taken their toll. I feel like I’m broken inside. I fee like even if I do get better, I’ll have to I’ve with this forever. Like I’ll be forever changed. Never to be myself again. 

I am currently in my senior year or college. I remember looking forward to this all quarantine (until I ruined myself in mid July). Now I don’t know what to do with my life. It doesn’t even feel like I’m alive. I feel like I’ve been trapped in a Hellish nightmare that I could have EASILY avoided. I don’t know how to get out when it feels like my passions might not be on the other side waiting for me."

522,I fucking hate busy places with a passion,"Stuck in traffic , or trying to get off the main road into shopping market car park . Roads layouts are shockingly bad. 

Turn off a busy ass main road to your right instantly.there is a petrol station to your left and tiny car park fitting about 20 cars to your right and straight ahead to a car park of about 200 spots . There is a set of traffic light right on that main road .and minor streets and residential roads all at that one spot .

Getting in and out is a fucking disaster every damn day . 

Who The fuck designed it needs battered. They didn't even design the place correctly to accommodate flooding anytime it rains heavy the car park and main doors to the shop are water logged.

If your an architect think about the bane you put on our lives with your shitty layouts 

The 200 spot car park at the back should have been the supermarket not right on the road with about 5 awkward entrances

Fuck my life driving in these fucking retarded layouts is going to  drive me nuts"
523,I'm sick of seeing my psychiatrist,"I can no longer stand going to my psychiatrist, I hate it. I suffer from depression and anxiety and take both medication and I have regular therapy sessions with my psychiatrist.

Everything is so sterile, the atmosphere, the psych herself is very square or emotionless, the way all these therapists and psychs have worked with me is just observing me and my feelings as if I'm something to be examined and studied and I don't like the feeling of it at all.

I don't like how they will often assume something about me and then I'd have to correct them, or they will ask me something I'm uncomfortable with answering, and then try to convince me that it's okay to tell them and that I can trust them. 

The more I go to these sessions the more I feel weird, and it just feels like I'm in a white room.

Am I the problem? 
Honestly I want to go to her one last time and ask her to give me instructions on waning myself off my meds and just stop everything else and just leave it at that."
524,How to help someone that doesn't want to be helped?,"My father always had strong opinions. But for the past 4 or 5 years he discovered the world of conspiracy theories. It devoured him completely. He doesn't have a single thought anymore that isn't related to a conspiracy theory. What is worse, he is forcing his 'opinions' onto others. 

I've had so many people in our lives come up to me asking to stop him, but I can't. I tried reasoning with him, begging him, explaining how it makes others and me feel. Nothing helps because in his mind, he is the one who knows more than the others and we are just lost and need his help to get out.  
I can't fight him on his theories because it is impossible for me to be an expert in every field he is preaching about. I still try to the best of my ability, but it is so taxing mentally and leaves me frustrated, exhausted, ashamed and overall defeated. And I know I'm not the only one who feels that way when he is around. 

I want to help him still because he was never a bad man. But these theories are making him one. It is heartbreaking to see someone who was once full of life and love turn into something so dark and hateful.

Honestly, I don't know anymore what to do or try. Should I just give up? Are there any resources I could read and educate myself on that will help me in this? Or at least some resources that will help me fortify mentally against all the hate that surrounds him?

528,Need help,One of my best friends just hours ago opened up about having bipolar and I have no idea what to do.. we are very close and know each other from the last 4years.. I simply had no idea about this.. i dont know how to process this
529,Self care for a better me.,"Here it goes. I’m on my mobile so take it easy!
I’m 31 years old. I’ve had spells of anxiety and depression in the past, however nothing to the extent in which the last 2 years have taken on me. I have 2 young children and have recently split from my partner of 8 years. I have now left the relationship and living with my mother. 

I guess my downward spiral hit me over time. I didn’t see it coming or realise I was so ill until the past couple of months. I’m always one to keep it together and care about my family and others rather than myself. 

I’ve slowly isolated myself from friends and become a recluse. It’s not that i didn’t want to see friends, it’s I was scared to. My anxiety about making plans hit me hard. It panicked me to the point I found it easier to isolate than put myself though it. When I’m out in social groups it panics me. I try to think of every excuse to leave. In a room full of people, I’ve never felt so alone. 

If I could stay in bed it would be easier is what I told myself. Nothing can harm me here. It’s my safe haven. I wanted nothing more than to stay in my sanctuary but at the same time I hate myself for doing so.

My diet is poor and rely heavily and energy drinks just to help me through the day. The effects on my has caused me to be lethargic to say the least. I don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to play with my kids. I don’t want to interact with my partner. I hate myself for it but I am so drained it’s easier to do nothing.  

I’m snappy and my temper can be awful at times. And again I hate myself looking at what I’ve become. 

Don’t get me wrong, I do take care of my children and we have good days. Days which I’m good.

I’ve distanced myself from my ex partner over this time. The one person I care over anything. I don’t talk to her or want to be close to her. I’ve literally pushed everything away. 

I don’t sleep well, I wake constantly through the night. I panic about things and they reoccur over in my head.  

I won’t eat and see my food intake as a chore. It could be later after noon before I eat anything. 

The fact I hate who I am reflects on me greatly. I feel worthless and not good enough for my family. I care about them more than anything.

I used to wear nice clothes, used to take care of my appearance. Now I’ll through on whatever is there. The only reason I get up in the morning is because I have to. When you have children you cannot be selfish, I need to be a dad. To love and care for them. 

I’ve let this me become normal. I’ve let myself think that my current state is normal. This is life now, this is who I am. 

A few months ago my partner found through my browser history that I’ve been looking into suicide. You need to understand I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t leave my children. It’s the easy way out. I hate myself, I hate who I am, it’s crossed my mind, but I can’t do it. I can’t leave my kids. 

She confronted me about it. I kept quiet. I hate confrontation and cannot communicate. In my head, if I ignore it and say nothing it will go away. This has been my logic for a long time now. I cannot speak on the phone. It’s scares me. I put off phone calls for weeks. I ignore texts and drive everyone away. 

I agreed to see a doctor. They put me on sertraline. 100mg pills. My stomaches been in knots for weeks. The are making me feel worse. 

I’ve lost all emotion. I love but can’t love. I feel but can’t feel. I try but nothing. I show no emotion. I don’t smile and see everything in a negative perspective. I don’t care for anything. Nothing interests me unless it’s handed to me. 

My partner left me last week. She can’t take how I am. I don’t blame her. I’m a shadow of the person who I was when we met. 

I don’t want to be this person anymore. Today I made a change. I’ve joined a local gym an online personal trainer community. 

I shopping today. I bought real food. No more microwave burgers. I’ve stopped smoking and haven’t had an energy drink today. 

I will do this. I will do this for me. I’m tired of who I am."
530,Am I reasonable to consider I may have been sexually abused or assaulted as a child?,"Disclaimer: I know it’s still shocking because he’s my cousin but he’s not biologically related to me in all fairness.

When I had a manic episode a year ago I was convinced of the fact that I was sexually abused and that I can’t remember it. I thought I had a good memory and I do, but there’s lots of parts in my childhood I just can’t remember.

I was sexually precocious as I started masturbating and looking at porn at a younger age than my peers. Growing up I spent a lot of time with my friend’s older brother and my older cousin. I had a crush on my older cousin that still lingers. Because of my mania it’s hard to completely stomp out those feelings for him.

Since the “realization” of my sexual abuse and the “realization” that I was still harboring feelings for my cousin came during the same manic episode I am concerned of the possibility that I may have been sexually abused.

People say that once they cut themselves off from their abuser the memories come back.

My cousin cut himself off from the family but no memories have emerged except for some good moments I had with him. I still live with my immediate family, which scares me that perhaps I was sexually abused by my dad or an uncle.

Could my feelings towards my cousin be a sign that I was sexually abused by him? I don’t feel fear of him though, if anything I feel uncomfortable when my dad touches me. Frankly I still want to be with my cousin. Perhaps those feelings are stopping me from remembering something that may have happened between us.

I know I will discuss all this with a therapist but if you all have ideas or advice please let me know. It’s a shitty feeling wondering if you were sexually abused or not."
531,Question about Short term Disability,"**cross posted 

So I’m pretty much at my last resort. I’ve been struggling for a long time and I need some sort of advice on where to go from here. 

I’m a mom to a daughter and started my job about 6 months ago. It is a large company and honestly they are really good to work for.

Since I was a teen I’ve struggled with major anxiety, panic disorder and depression. I had a traumatic childhood and that caused many issues for me. Before I was pregnant, I was also a heavily self medicated with various drugs/alcohol. I’ve really cleaned myself up in so many ways since becoming a wife/mother.

My mental health has been quite stable for the past few years, but really since starting this job my anxiety has been really bad. I don’t know if it’s a combination of being away from my daughter, or postpartum depression showing up a year later, but it’s honestly debilitating. I feel a constant panicked feeling. It’s to the point where I almost can’t get out of bed, and I have a child to take care off and I just feel suffocated. I’m so guilty with everything. 

Anyways, I’ve spoke to a nurse and she put me off for 2 weeks until I can get into see my actual family doctor next week, and I’m hoping she will put me off for a few more weeks so I can get myself in order, and also get started on some new medication. 

My company is big on mental health, and we have an amazing EAP that offers 100% of your salary for 8 weeks of leave. I’m so worried that this will look negatively on me, and also that when I do go back, they could potentially find a reason to fire me. 

This company has the potential to be a career for me. And I don’t want to loose it, but I feel like I can’t be there right now, and when I am I can be productive as I need to be.


I don’t currently have a therapist and I know I need one, so that’s going to be my next step regardless."
532,I'm afraid of walking down the street (Social Anxiety?),"Now I am not one for self-diagnosing. I won't truly accept/label anything until I get an opinion/answer from a professional. However, I don't want to turn a blind eye to the signs/feelings I've been having which could suggest something's wrong. 
If anyone has good knowledge in this field, please help. I feel like I'm going crazy.

The signs:
- I've never been good with talking to people and by that, I mean, I can't articulate a sentence without slurring, stuttering, backtracking or being completely unable to find the words. I also struggle to put them in the right order. It happens when I'm talking to people I don't know, when I'm in a public area or when I feel stressed to answer. Hell, I even do it with my family who I see time to time. It's like my mind goes completely blank and forgets it's native language. I feel scared to talk to anyone. My ability to talk is reduced to that of a toddler. It's embarrassing. 

- I can't handle seeing people I know in public or walking past a group of them. By this I mean, my legs literally refuse to work properly. I have to drag myself past them quickly as I feel such a wave of fear. I hang my head in shame almost, being unable to make eye contact, speak to them, acknowledge them. It's like some kind of submissive animal behaviour where I can't control the fear my body radiates.

- I have an inferiority complex towards EVERYONE. I think I'm worth less compared to everyone I meet. I feel like everyone is out to get me. I feel totally unable to correct people, disagree, interrupt or even oppose people as I feel like my opinion is worth nothing and they'll turn on me. It's like a game of survival everyday, everyone is out to get me. I'm scared to speak up constantly.

- I have no trust in my instincts or opinions. Though I wish I could say I was a stoic person, my opinion and believe in something can be shattered by merely a contrasting opinion from someone else. As soon as someone brings up an opposite point, I immediately feel my voice is worthless and that their opinion is higher than mine. This really damages my love for hobbies (I'm quite a comic/film nerd) as I can't take pride in my passion for things. This also really effects my ability to make decisions. I can't be the first to do something, I can't make a certain choice without second guessing it. I second-guess everything I do. It's exhausting. For once, I'd just like to know something for certain.

- My fight or flight instinct kicks in everytime I walk to school or somewhere unfamiliar (like parties.). My heart rate goes crazy, my breathing becomes shaky, my body becomes shaky, my thoughts race etc. 

- I can't stand the idea of being singled out. Just walking ahead of a group makes me panic. I used to have REALLY bad stage fright (this has quelled somewhat as I joined a drama group as a strategy to combat my ""anxiety"") 

- I feel like I'm --- not really there? I don't know, it's weird. It feels like everyone is an NPC. They're all a hive mind, a copy and paste of each other. I feel like an alien, isolated. It makes it soo hard to try and socialise because I just don't operate on the same wavelength or confidence as other people. 

- I get very irritable with people. Getting asked questions frequently (especially if I don't know the answers to them). Even worse, being asked the same question over and over just gets me mad. People constantly coming into my bedroom when I want ""me"" time (my just vibing on my bed watching whatever). Having to constantly greet people (even though I know they're trying to be friendly)

- I'm EXTREMELY paranoid. I think that when a group of girls laugh, they're laughing AT me. If someone hasn't arrived to a meet-up, my brain immediately assumes the worst (like they've abandoned me, tricked me etc). I think that presentations will always go horribly wrong, I think that everytime I walk down the street EVERYONE is staring at me. I can physically FEEL them staring at me. It really gets to my head. I feel like I'm constantly in the spotlight 24/7, the pressure to perform, to impress. 

- My social battery is none existent. Visiting the local shop gets me tired. After school, I'm exhausted (which then leads into the 8th point). The constant pressure to impress drains me daily. 

Any help will be valued xx"
533,My parents treat my younger siblings better than they ever treated me. It's really messing with my head.,"I'm the oldest of 10 kids. Growing up, we were VERY poor. My dad (Who I didn't really know) was a janitor, my step dad worked various odd jobs, and my mom was a waitress. We didnt have a working car for most of my childhood.

There were 10 of us kids, and I was the oldest by almost 5 years.

Growing up, I was constantly stressed. My parents told me every problem we had becuase I was ""An old soul"". I grew up fearing evictions and past due electric bills. My stepdad was violent. My dad never came around. My mom was an addict.

I'm now 22 and things are much different in their family. I haven't lived there since I was 17, so I dont really consider that my family or my house.

My stepfather got a better job and is making more money.

My 9 younger siblings don't worry about money the way I did... They don't fear being homeless the way I did.

My mom got 4 of my siblings braces for their crooked teeth...I had to purchase my own at 18 and got into major debt.

My mom and stepdad have 3 of my siblings in therapy...I was told therapy for ""Weak people"" and too expensive.

My step father was put on antidepressants and no longer hits anyone...He hit me on a daily basis growing up.

My mom and stepfather love and hug those children...My stepfather and father never hugged me becuase they thought I was gay.

My parents have a new working car...I walked to school.

My parents take the younger kids to the beach every year...I never left the state of Pennsylvania until I was 22.

My dad sent my younger sister to school at the University of Pittsburgh...They couldnt even send me to community college...

I took care of those kids my ENTIRE childhood...My mom doesnt let the kids take care of each other now...She has money to hire babysitters now. Thats something that wouldve changed my life. I was suicidal over that responsibility.

There are so many other instances of this happening. I grew up in a different time than my siblings. Im glad they are living better childhoods than I did...but why did I have to live the bad childhood? Why did I have to grow up before I was ready? Why did I have to be abused? Why did I have to grow up dirt poor? Why couldnt I have been loved?

It's really starting to mess with my head. Did they even love me or care for me? Or was I just a babysitter to them?"
534,What I’m going to tell my therapist tomorrow,"I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and it’s the first time I’m going to open up, it’s a lot but I need to get it out. I have no one else to talk to about this and who better than her? I haven’t opened up to her before so I’m sure this is all going to be a lot, but I can’t help it, I need someone to talk to, and she’s sweet and so understanding, so hopefully I’ll be heard. If you’re reading this, I’m not looking for advice please, I already know my situation is crappy and I do know how I could possibly fix this, advice would feel patronizing at this point. I just want to feel heard, and if there’s anyone out there whose somehow going through the same? I feel you, we can talk in my dms. With that being said, here’s what I’m going to tell my therapist. 

 I feel like I’m spiraling. 

Why? 

I’m obsessed with my boyfriend 
I can hardly get out of bed everyday
Taking a bath is hard
Eating is hard
Drinking water is hard
I promised to help my mom with my little sisters zoom classes but I couldn’t muster up the energy to do that. 
I don’t have anti depressants that work, and I’m waiting to get in contact with the psychiatrist to get new medication. It’s been months. 
For now I’m suffering. I don’t enjoy doing anything anymore and what I do most of the day is listen to music (which is the only and last thing that calms me down) and lay down in bed. 
I take walks everyday and play with my dog, so it’s not like I’m not trying. I’m just not trying hard enough. I wish I could be normal, I wish I could be like everyone else my age, I wish I was going to college, I wish I was driving, I wish I had friends, I wish I had a healthy relationship, I wish I had a job, I wish I had hobbies, I bought a $500 guitar and I don’t even play it, I buy things to try and make me happy, I want to be this person that I can’t be. And so I buy things for this super cool person that isn’t me, and I get disappointed when I turn out to not be this person after all. I bought a $900 laptop for gaming and I’ve not once been on it and it’s been 3 months. I buy expensive dresses to try and feel pretty but I know I never will because the clothes don’t make the person, the person makes the clothes. I’m insecure, I’m anxious, I’m a wreck and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t take baths for weeks and before yesterday I haven’t washed my face in a month. I don’t brush my teeth because that’s too taxing. It’s so embarrassing too because I’ve stunk up all my clothes and now I have to throw them all away and start over. How embarrassing right? I haven’t brushed my hair in nearly two months. My face is covered in acne, from puberty and not taking care of it. I walk into dangerous neighborhoods hoping something will happen. 

I’ve never had a real life friend before in my life. People just didn’t like me. And at this point I don’t know how to make them. I know college and work could do that or volunteering, but I can’t do those things. I’m disabled. The thought makes me deathly afraid and I have an anxiety attack. Everyone’s already starting their lives and I’m almost 19 having done nothing. And it feels like no one else can relate. They have friends or had friends, they’re going to college, they’ve worked or are working. They’re ahead of me, even if they’re not doing those things anymore. And I’m being left behind. My mother says I’m still a 14 year old in her eyes. And I know that’s probably a parent thing, still looking at your adult children as children, but that’s not the case, I *Am* like a 14 year old. Maybe younger! I’m immature, I’m needy, I depend on her for dear life. I can’t do anything without her. She has to actively hold my hand. I’m a child unlike my peers who are all women and men. I still call myself a girl, and it makes me uncomfortable when people like my boyfriend calls me a woman. 

I’m more interested in fixing the other issues. I think once those other ones are fixed, that last one will come into place. I feel like a wreck, because I am. I mean, my boyfriend and I got into a disagreement because I was jealous he ditched me for his friend. Which was completely my fault. The most notable thing about that is how I reacted, I had an anxiety attack and spiraled downwards. I feel like I’m toxic and no matter how hard I try I don’t know how to stop. 

So there it is, everything I’m going to open up to my therapist about. She’s such a sweet soul and I’m excited to talk to her tomorrow. We have a thirty minute session and I hope I’m able to get everything out in that time frame. I’m nervous, I’m not good at opening up to therapists, hence why I wrote it all out, but I know I can do it, I can talk to her about my pain. If anyone has read all of this, you’re such a kind soul. Thank you, and dog bless."

I think about everything so much I kind of feel like I'm talking to ppl when I haven't said anything and then I get anxious about why I'm losing my friends and am not a main friend anymore. even tho I know why I don't know how to fix this I've tried thinking positive but I feel like every aspect of who I am right now is a more boring rude and sad version of who I used to be.

538,Why is it like this,I woke up today and felt like crap like I usually do. Tried to distract myself by doing a difficult task in a game. I managed to complete it and also recorded me doing it. I was happy for the first time in forever but that ended rather quickly when I noticed the video I recorded was corrupt. Cool. Now I’ve been feeling like shit the rest of the day and of course to make things even worse I broke the stand for one of my monitors when I wanted to lift it up. Nice. These things might sound like small inconveniences but stuff like this happens all the time and every time it happens I immediately start feeling like crap. I’m so tired. My high school experience was really horrible and which only ended about two months ago so I guess I’m more sensitive because of that as well. Idk. Thanks if you decided to read my mess of text.

540,Desperately need advice for dealing with my mom’s persisting issues,[removed]
541,My mom got mad at me about the major i want to go in and now im questioning everything,"Ever since i was little, ive loved art. Its been my passion. Im not the best of course, but i dont think im awful either. My grandpa was an artist, and i have an uncle who worked with Walt Disney. THE WALT DISNEY. Hearing that kind of success story in my own bloodline makes me hopeful i could have a future. And my family supports me.... Mostly.
My mom and I were talking about college. And she doesnt understand why id go into art with it being a ""rocky field"". It really hurt my feelings. Drawing has been my main form of relaxing and finding joy since i was little, long before my dad passed, so to hear her change from ""if you do something you truly love, youll never work a day in your life!"" To ""you wont be supported and youll drown in debt over a degree that wont give you enough to sleep soundly!"" Cut deep. I love my mom, but hearing her say she never supported my decision... I wouldnt wish that on anyone. Im surprised i didnt start bawling. I dont think i could ever do anything else happily. I would rather die under a bridge. I know i should listen to her, but i just want to follow my dreams. She went into IT in the 90s but now her dream finally paid off. It took a long time, but shes finally happy with her job choice! I dont mind waiting that long to find my happiness! I just wish college didnt cost the same price of a small house..."
542,How should I go about finding a therapist given the pandemic? [USA],"For context: I'm 24 years old and a recent college grad who lives in the United States. I'm currently on my parents' insurance, which has generally great coverage.

I moved several hours away from home for my first full-time job out of school in January. It separated me from my longterm partner and was just a generally stressful experience—new job, new city, trying to make friends and network in my industry etc.—so I began looking for a therapist in my new city. Unfortunately (life was busy), I didn't manage to have an intake appointment before early March, when I fled my apartment due to the coronavirus to go back home and be near my partner/family while I worked remotely. Things have not been great since then, as I lost my job, and, well *gestures to all this fucked up shit going on*.

I would absolutely love to have a therapist right now, as I have been in and out of therapy in the past and it's always been hugely helpful. I need some advice on how to find one in the midst of the pandemic. I thrive in therapy because it allows me to just get face to face and talk to someone in person, which isn't possible right now (even if some therapists are beginning to allow in-person visits, I live with a high risk individual and can't do that as a result). Because of that, I'm generally skeptical of online services like Betterhelp and Talkspace. 

When the pandemic is over, I'd love to have someone who I could go see in person that I've already built a relationship with. While I could search for therapists nearby my hometown, I'm planning to move again in the near future (to the same city I left). Should I try to find someone there and do intake over zoom? Are fully online therapy services actually worth my time? If I try to find someone back in the city seeing as I aim to return there, what's the best way to do that search process remotely?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts."

Some people say I need therapy and meds and stuff but I don’t feel I’m really harming others just because I’m a bit out there mentally. The reason they seem to want me to get help is being I do weird things like squak randomly, and run my head into the wall, and stuff like that. I’m not really hurting anyone at all. However, I currently just want to scream randomly into peoples faces for no reason, I don't, but I have that urge."
548,I’m having a very bad day because of school,"I’m a 22 year old university student and I am very upset today because of school. I just got out of a class where our professor is pretty much useless which made me very upset. 

I usually wake up and work until I go to sleep (my major is extremely demanding) and it is making it very hard to get going in the morning, I have nothing to look forward to but work and It has been so hard to find motivation to keep going.

School is a major stressor and it fills me with nothing but anxiety, depression, and stress I don’t know what to do, I hate it so much"
549,Am I wrong for feeling happy despite doing nothing meaningful?,"I work a minimum wage fast food job but I feel useful and enjoy my work; my mom keep talking about wanting me to do more with my life but I'm not sure I want to since it's such a struggle to even keep going to the job I like. 

I've been beating myself over the head with the fact that I'm not accomplishing anything, I'm not helping anyone; I shouldn't be happy with what I'm doing but I haven't been this happy in years.

But I am accomplishing things, it's hard to see but I am making money; I am paying off my medicals bills from my last attempt on my life all by myself.

So why do I feel like shit when I feel happy? Why does it feel like I haven't done anything?

Why can't I just be happy? Is it because my mom keeps pushing me? I don't know I feel like this is mostly my issue but I'm not sure how to feel about it. I don't want to cry anymore and I want to be better, I've been taking baby steps to get there but right now all I want to do is keep working my shitty minimum wage job so that I feel even a little normal.

550,Taking seroquel and weird sense of time," 

I take seroquel from 150 to 200 (pyshc said 150 but i upgradet bc i feel more safe). Reason: intrusive thoughts and random voices inside my head. The moment I stop they all come back.

When I started: 2 years ago.

No side effects but a thing im experiencing is that my sense of time is weird, its like more dilated. short term memoroy is worse, i dont dwell on things from the past like before. Sometimes i forget altogether something trivial like at my job but no life altering things.

we had to bring this lady at the hospital, the day after they told us to bring her there, well during the day i completely forgot and when my coworker asked me ""at what hour should we go to her"" i was like, in my mind ""who? and what?"". Then after a while it came into my mind.

Why i say my sense of time is dilated. Because things that happened yesterday feels like they happened 1 or 2 years ago.

The scenes from the past seem more distant, they are still there but like i said, i dont dwell on them as before.

When i used to have social anxiety i replayed things that happened in the past days over and over. now its like im more detached.

Im afraid i will have issues with alzhemeir or demetnia even tho im 26 yo."

it amazes me that every. single. person in my life no matter how kind, no matter how “understanding,” no matter how far removed from my past, they have all managed to make me feel even more alone than i had imagined; their presence,the things they say, how they carry themselves, how they think, makes me feel so misunderstood, so distanced, like i’m driving a 7 seater car all alone...and knowing that feeling makes me want to do nothing other than isolate myself from everyone and anyone because feeling like a faint entity whose formless hands can never seem to feel anyone’s touch even when their arms are wrapped around you, it makes you feel so alone that you wanna die. there’s this one profound lyric that crosses my mind every time this deep rooted loneliness plagues me, and it says “only worth living if somebody is loving you...”; with this debilitating inability to feel truly connected to people, love merely is a dream that’ll probably never become a reality so whats the point of continuing to trudge on this long and lonely road? you tell me, because i’m running out of reasons to stay and suffer in silence, a quiet which is too violent for someone like me."
561,Just a rant,"Hey so feel free to ignore this, I’m more writing this to get it off my chest..

I just had to go into my car to “fetch something” so I could cry and shout, over a hearth for a fireplace.

Me and my wife are renovating our house, and have uncovered a fireplace in the living room, so tonight we were figuring out how we want the hearth to look, we’ve decided to go with 6 square tiles, 3x2 design with the far edges cut diagonally to make a half hexagon shape.

Sounds simple enough to do. 

Builder came to have a look at the fireplace to quote how much to rebuild the chimney stack and fit the liner etc. He off handedly remarked that we’d need to make sure we had a factory edge on all sides to make it look nice, we couldn’t just cut the two tiles in half. 

This meant we’d have to buy bigger tiles and the builder would have to cut them down to size. Not my problem, just more work for the builder right?

So why oh why has the good mood I’ve been in all week suddenly turned into nothingness? Why does the smallest most insignificant detail make me feel like the smallest, most insignificant man in the world?

Last week was one of the greatest weeks at work sales wise, my side project is finally starting to pick up traction, I’ve been on holiday the last 5 days so I’m totally relaxed, but because the builder has to do more work, all that means nothing now, I’m a failure for not knowing what size tile I need to get now"

My mind wanders and never seems to want to focus on the present, even when I'm out driving my attention is not focused and I fear I'd most likely get in a serious accident if something unexpected were to happen.

564,Should I trust them with my Social Security Number?,"Hello,

I am in the United States. Because of my current financial situation, I am being helped by a prescriber at my county's free clinic. I was told last week that I no longer met the clinic's requirements for urgent services so they are going to transfer me to another clinic. This one would be free too, but it isn't part of the county. It's a community organization that partners with Ascension, a private healthcare company.

The new clinic called me earlier today and said they needed my Social Security Number (SSN) to set up a chart and an appointment. I have never given out my SSN while getting mental health services before. I got nervous, told them I wanted to think again about whether or not I want help, and got off the phone. Before I got off the phone, the person told me that they were very secure and that I did not need to worry about how my medical information would be used. This made me more uneasy. I checked out their website and I wasn't reassured. It's format is outdated and it doesn't seem like their provider list has been updated in awhile. The clinic building itself doesn't look great.

I can't tell if I'm being paranoid as a symptom of my mental health or I'm right to be reluctant. My parents always taught me to be careful about who I give my SSN. I also don't want my SSN to be tied to my diagnosis. I don't want people looking at me any different because I need medications to get through the day. But I know I'm not in a position to be picky about who and where I get a prescriber. I should be grateful that I'm getting free help at all.

Do I give them my SSN or try looking somewhere else for help?"

568,Taking a break from Reddit is one of the best ways to improve your menta,"I know I may not seem like I have taken any breaks at all. But even a 1 week break has a tremendous impact on my health. I just feel more alive, less concerned about what someone on Reddit is saying and less concerned about having to take the need to reply to their point.

And I don’t mean just by commenting. But even reading comments and being on Reddit can be mentally draining. The world, specifically America, always seems like it’s in flames and ending. It’s tiresome, annoying, and unhealthy to be in such an echo chamber.

I literally spoke with some friends a few days ago and I was saying some “Reddit” like things and I could see I was the only one. The majority of people in the world aren’t on here. Nor do they care about what anyone on here thinks. And if they are on here, it’s probably just to read answers to a question they had asked on Google.

I closed my Facebook account a month ago to get away from the constant (usually political) comment fights and BS in general and I’m much happier. I hate that I’m back on Reddit again and I want to really stop coming on here. Like forever would be nice.

I feel sick in every way possible, with no strength to even be with my own thoughts. I use music to escape or fill the void but now I’ve come past the point where music isn’t making much sense, just some words that sound nice. 
I’ve been feeling contrasting moods for some time. Where i sit to do my work and end up googling a random thought, which then keeps jumping to different interests quickly. I am aware that most of it is anxiety, depression and an attention disorder but I’m not convinced.
How can i want something so much and when i do get it, i don’t want it?

There are days where i am fully rational and suddenly something happens and my muscles tense up and i start spiralling.
I don’t know what i am doing, where i am going.

575,"I have lost my ""mojo""- confidence - during COVID and I feel awkward and paranoid","At school I was a very shy and awkward kid. The quiet kid. In my late teens I overcame this and became very extroverted and bubbly. I spent the next 10 years not understanding how it was possible being so shy and awkward when I was younger. I didn't understand how people could be that way. 

Then COVID hit. I was not totally isolated during lockdown, I had roommates and could still go on excersise sessions with a couple friends outside my household. But since lockdown ended my social life has taken a dive. Many of my friends went home so my social circle went from being really big to pretty small. So I have spend the past 6 months or so with very little socialisation and when I do socialise it's just been in small groups. On top of that my anxiety has shot up a lot and with that comes A LOT of self doubt.

Now I am overthinking EVERY  social situation and feeling really awkward. I'm not quite back to how I was in my school days but I definitely come across a bit socially awkward or at least I am constantly thinking I do and overthinking everything I say and do. I hate it. I feel like that shy kid again. I feel everything I say is boring and everyone thinks I'm weird or annoying or unfriendly... and those are self fullfilling properties. I don't feel like I can go up to people and just start conversation because I have such low confidence and feel they don't want to talk to me. Then I just seem rude.

I was rushed in for an emergency surgery. When I woke up I was in agony. I have broken bones and gotten into life threatening accidents, but nothing compared. Touching a single hair on my thighs felt like boiling oil, and it only got worse. I got an mri and turns out the surgeon didn't do the surgery right, so I went in another time. The pain in my legs was even worse, but it slowly got better, that was mid July. I wasn't allowed to move much for a few months so I became even more overweight and my joints weakened. I barely have the physical capability to stand up. On top I adopted my 2 best friends because there parents where haroin addicts. Them and my family always have to do everything for me and I hate it. Im very independent but I cant do most things for myself, and I loved being active. My life is falling apart. I feel like such a burden and can't live like this. Im so empty and most of the time void of emotion. I have attempted suicide several times, but its been a year and a half since I've felt like that, and all the helpless feelings are coming back."
577,Why are the only emotions I experience just stress and anxiety?,"This started when I was about 14 or so and has very slowly been getting worse since.  I don’t know why but everything is just so bland these days.  I almost always have to fake laugh at any joke I hear, I have no interest in exercise or sports (I used to frequently participate in both), Movies suck, I watch the same 3 or 4 mediocre tv shows over and over, I have no desire to be social and spend time with my friends, sex and masturbation is so unsatisfying to the point where I’m considering the possibility that I’m asexual, video games are starting to feel pretty meh and basically everything else seems just monotonous and a waste of time.

The only exception to this is with alcohol, which I know might not be the best way to deal with problems like this but it’s the only thing I can find that has worked so far.  Marijuana used to help but now I’m starting to get so paranoid every time I use it that it’s starting to have the exact opposite effect.

Has anyone who has had this problem know what the source and solution is?"
578,my story pls help me if you now what to do in that situation.,"So let's start, i made friends with a guy from opposite class and we were you know we trusted each other, we played games  with some other friends.

582,I might have messed up an interview and I worry I'll never find a job,"I left my job back in March for multiple reasons, one of which being mental and emotional problems that I wasn't even trying to get any help for. Now I'm talking to a shrink and picking up the pieces and trying to turn my life around. Part of that is trying to be okay with being honest and talking about my struggles instead of just telling myself nobody cares and you're a burden if you talk about it, and shoving them down and hiding them and acting like I'm totally fine. 

I had an interview today and I thought it was going well, until the very last question. The HR woman doing the interview asked me if there was anything else I'd like her to know about me. I felt like if I said ""nope,"" she might think I was hiding something. In the moment, the first thing that came to my mind, maybe bc it's been so heavily in the front of my mind recently, was ""I have some symptoms of depression and anxiety and OCD. It's affected my work in the past and that's partially why I left my last job, but I'm talking to a shrink and getting help, so it won't get in the way of my work here. I just want to be honest."" She just wrote something down in her interview sheet and said ""thanks, i'll talk to my boss and we'll get back to you.""

I started freaking out a little after the interview, so I asked my mom about it since she's in a position where she interviews people occasionally and she said that they ask that question in case there's something else relevant to the job and your abilities and qualifications that didn't get discussed already in the interview. I kinda freaked out more and I'm still kinda freaked out bc if I'd known that then I would have just said ""nope, I think we covered everything"" and maybe still been worried that it wasn't the best answer but just dealt with it, bc now I really think I might have shot myself in the foot.

Like I already said, I think it's important for me to be honest and live my truth and not try to hide or be ashamed of my problems, bc that in itself creates more problems. I know it's not the end of the world if I don't get this job and the important thing is to keep trying, but I'm kinda kicking myself and freaking out bc I felt like I had a good shot at the job at first, and even though it's not my dream job, it would be money in my pocket and a way to pay my bills and one more step taken towards making a better life for myself. 

Has anyone else had an encounter like this? Is there something else I could have said in response besides ""nope, I think we covered everything""? Or should I just have said that, because I really thought we did? Do I have the wrong mindset about being open and honest about what I'm going through? How do you navigate the job world and the job search while you're wrestling with depression and anxiety and feelings of being so overwhelmed and inadequate?"

I dont start until next year. Im simply writing this message because I would love to talk to anyone or try to help anyone who needs it. Sometimes even just expressing your emotions through messages to someone can help. So my inbox is always open.

586,I am not able to brush my teeth/ go to the dentist,"Hey everyone. 

Today I want to confess about an issue that developed through the last 10 years. I know some of you may think this is disgusting and gross but I have nowhere to talk to about this. 

Well, as stated above, I have serious issues to constantly brush my teeth for the last 10 years. Sometimes, I don’t brush my teeth for months. 

I don’t know why I am not doing this. Sometimes I think it might be a side effect of my depression but I noticed that I have also developed a strange anxiety: When I am brushing my teeth I am afraid that I might make things worse and they might „break“ or fall out or hurt or something. So mostly I am super careful and only brush them very gentle to not trigger my cavities by brushing too hard. 

Last year I tried to make things better by organizing some appointments with the dentist. I liked the dentist but I was afraid he would judge me and when he told me that I need to improve my brushing and flossing before we could continue with treatment, I cancelled any further appointments because I was afraid he would be disappointed in me. Instead, I went to a different dentist when one of my teeth hurt who described antibiotics which I did not take (other reasons) and now I am afraid I let the next dentist down and bailed on this one too. 

I feel totally stupid and I am ashamed of myself. But this is getting a serious issue because I already lost 2 teeth to this and have several cavities. 

Did/Does anyone else experience something like that?"
587,Anxiety and Attention," Hi everyone!

I’m not great at this and I could totally be way out of line for posting it on this subreddit (so I’m extremely sorry in advance!!) 

Huge disclaimer: I am not looking for a diagnosis, but I respect all of your opinions and would love to hear your feedback on this dilemma.

I suffer from a really bad case of generalized anxiety. I have always had a really hard time with my anxiety and focusing on things. A couple of months ago I was prescribed anxiety medications by my physician, and it really helped my generalized anxiety (first time I was able to go grocery shopping by myself for the first time in literal years). While it did help with my anxiety, I did notice I was still unable to concentrate—in fact, I felt like it made it worse. I tanked all of my classes that semester (normally I’m an average A/B student), and I began to miss deadlines at work because I was unable to focus on details. This is going to sound crazy (and I am **so** sorry if it comes across as offensive in any way) but it almost seemed as though anxiety was my body’s coping mechanism to be on top of my work / focusing on details. Without it, I didn’t freak myself out into getting my work done, so naturally, I didn’t. 

I just want to know if this is normal, or if this is something I should bring to my providers attention. 

Thank you in advance!"
588,I feel so incapable that I just gave up alltogether trying to learn for my exams.,"I'm in college and... I have subjects to which I excel when I study, but others that I just suck at. I'm too demoralised, I just gave up studying and carring about my exams, even for the subjects that I'm good at. What can I do to fix this? It tears apart my self-esteem even more, I feel like I'm so weak for not being able to control my behaviour in this situation. I feel dumb, I feel unworthy, I hate myself rn."
589,Am I worried for no reason or is there something wrong with me?,"Erm Hallo. WARNING there will be horrific spelling errors and I don’t know how much sense this will make... sorry.

Basically I struggle to identify my own emotions, I’m fine knowing what others are feeling but I seriously struggle identifying my own. I can only identify a few emotions, I don’t know if I just feel a few emotions stronger than the others or what it is but it leaves me feeling empty. 
I’m known by my friends as the hyper one, the silent one or the mothering one. Bit of context I’m 15. I don’t even know how I can be both the hyper one and the silent one but best as I can explain it it’s like I’ve got this switch inside my head but it’s in a platinum box, I can’t control when it changes but it has three settings. 
1. I feel empty. The only emotion I can really sense is frustration and anger. I can’t even get stressed over exams when that happens but alas 🤷🏻‍♀️. But it give me a feeling of numbness and you kind of feel like your floating, you can’t focous on much and you just feel slow. 
2. Angry and don’t want to talk. Well it’s sort of anger sort of not. I get fought up in my head and I’ll be very distracted but I’ll be focused on my schoolwork I only get annoyed if someone talks to me but when I’m like that the smallest thing can set me off. Like someone breathing too loud. But I just get this feeling that makes me not want to talk to anyone. When I’m like this I can fee all the emotions (hallelujah) but I get irritated very easily 
3. Bit hyper. I get all happy and will laugh at literally anything, I get all antsy if I can’t move around and I start singing to myself in my head. I’m most productive when I’m like this because everything is just faster and my mind is blind with ideas. But I can’t see all the ideas their just like flashing colours and only some stand out. But I can’t control what I do too much, I mean I have to it was how I was raised but it makes me want to scream really loudly and jump up and down. Oh and when this happens I tend to talk quite fast and talk to my self a lot actually well not intentionally but it kind of happens.

More context. When I’m at school I tend to get 6-7 hours sleep and I’m not really too tired. 

Basically it’s just really frustrating to not understand what’s going on. I can’t ask my parents because I tried to explain it to my mum and she just said it’s normal but she dosent really react well to talking about mental health and the such. I would appreciate it if anyone has any ideas because I honest, I don’t know anymore this has been going on so long. I just want to know if this is actually normal or not. 
 
Also really randomly and not related that much, but is it normal to see stuff inside your head? Like I can see a whole library in my head and have done since I was little. Is it bad that I still have this at 15?

Any advice is sincerely appreciated.
Many thanks, A"

Do you think that special laws for mental health protection are possible and work practical? Are there any drafts for it?

594,An online friend left really worrying comments,"Right, an internet friend and really talented artist deactivated all of their accounts across all platforms and then on their backup Twitter account made tweets about how no one will remember them years from now. They have gone completely offline and the whole community that they are a part of of including me is extremely worried about them and what they might do. Some are trying to get hold of their family while others are just trying to get the word out."
595,I feel like ending my life soon so that no one has to worry anymore,"I'm tired of being a burden to almost everyone I know. I am beyond help because for the past two years, I've been under heavy treatment and nothing seems to help get rid of the root causes of my symptoms. I've tried psychiatry and medications, psychotherapy and treatment centers, and even several hospitalizations. My major depressive disorder is simply too much for me and other people to handle.

I don't feel like I'm worth any more resources for people to be spending on. I've taken a lot of my parents, friends, doctors, and therapists' time, and I don't want to anymore. Life is simply just miserable for me day after day, no matter what I'm doing or what treatment I'm following. 

So, I believe that taking my life is the best option for me. The pain will maybe be bad for my friends and family for a couple of days, but after that, relief will come over them. Relief that I won't be a bother anymore, that I won't be a burden to them any longer."
596,How do you become loveable?,"I've loved people all my life, without getting reciprocated. I've always been single because mostly I was afraid to confess them. And normally no one has ever loved me back truly in that way. I have given up as it takes a lot to make an effort do everything all over again just to have them never love you back. This is not a cry for help. I just need some advice, what do I do? How do I become loveable again? and how do I talk to people or initiate a conservation? I get along with people and I become friends with them. But I now need the feel to have someone love me back. I am willing to give what it takes."

598,I wish I had siblings...or a pet,"I know this is going to sound so whiny and privileged but this is actually something that makes me cry. I always wished I had siblings or even a pet. The thing is my family is too poor for a sibling and our apartment is too small for a pet. I just sometimes feel so lonely, especially now with the whole virus thing. I even developed a mental illness from just sitting by myself in my room all day and thinking without having anyone to talk to any make me happy. Idk, I just feel like my mental health would he much better off If I had someone, any living soul I could confide into. I'm sorry if this is annoying to those of you who have bigger problems right now...I just felt like saying this since my friend always complains about her siblings without even knowing how blessed she is. If you have siblings, appreciate them. And if you have any problems right now or your bond with family members arent good, I wish you the best in life from now on :)"
599,"Can't turn off my brain, exhaustion from overthinking. Seeking advice/answers please!","Overthinking at night when trying to fall asleep is normal. But lately I will have days or weeks where I can't seem to turn off my brain for even 5 minutes. It is leading to headaches, inability to work properly, inability to take care of myself and more. I know that I just need to relax and I've tried everything I can, meditation, cbd, yoga, etc. These are great temporary fixe for an hour or two but it seems to be getting worse not better as days go on.

  
Symptoms seem to be: constant racing thoughts, jumping from one task to the next when I get frustrated something isn't going well but then never finishing any of the tasks and overthinking about how frustrated I am that I can't do basic things right now, sleeping at night but getting exhausted from my overthinking and taking many unnecessary but unavoidable naps in a day, feeling generally shitty and unaccomplished, keep telling myself I can't shower until I work out because I know working out will make me feel better but instead I'll just end up unshowered for days just hating myself for not working out.

No affordable health insurance unfortunately, but willing to try anything at this point."

602,Needed to get this off my chest,"First time posting here I usually lurk. A little backstory, I've been struggling with major depression for a few years now and I am getting better, I've been seeing a counselor for about 3 years. I'm generally truthful with them, but I don't mention suicidal thoughts anymore. The only times I've admitted to having these feelings I've either been thrown into a hospital, or threatened too. Recently I had a major depressive episode that lasted about three days and I had overwhelming feelings of wanting to end it. I am fine now I spent the weekend with some friends because I didnt feel safe, but I admitted to my Mom the reason I don't tell her these things anymore is because of the fact she tells me I need to go to a hospital every time. And her reaction to this... ""Well do you need to go back to the hospital?"".  I think I know where my brother gets his autism from now -_-"
603,My anger is getting out of control.,I love to play games especially comepetive ones. And I’m always raging first it started as something small like just saying shit. But now I’m screaming I had to move out because of it. My head hurts a lot when I’m mad. And I go into my room to cry for an hour. All the advice I get is just like take a break or do something else. They don’t understand that video games are the only thing I’m good at. In real life in a loser. But in games I can actually be somebody do something. Well I just need help I’d take any advice right now.

605,No Grasp on my Emotions - Wearing a Mask,"Hi Reddit, I apologize in advance for the contradicting tonality that this post will have. Long story short, I am a 25 yo male living in Los Angeles And feel as though on the surface I look composed and confident while internally I am constantly grappling with my emotions. I feel overly volatile in most, if not all, aspects of my life and it’s gotten to a point where I’m resentful of the situations I find myself in.

I have a good core group of friends but I feel they don’t know the extent of my mental duress and to remind them so frequently feels as though I’m a burden or just irrational. I have a full time job where I make good money but endure a lot of stress, often times almost transforming my mood/demeanor in a matter of minutes depending on the day. I have one of those families that seemed fine over the years, but was very toxic during my formative years by way of emotional and borderline physical abuse (I say borderline because I was not beaten but had hands put on me more than a few times). I feel as though I resent my past for making me constantly anxious, and in the past self-harm, but I also romanticize it as if I’ve come so far.

But the truth is I haven’t. I’m still the kid who was bullied for singing in high school. Cheated on by his exes. Abused by his father and abandoned by other family members. This is not my sob story, this is my confusion: why can’t I fucking move on? 

I’ve been told I’m objectively attractive my whole life, sorry that sounds conceited. I made 6 figures for the first time at 23. I live in Los Angeles. I’m moderately successful in my free time with independent music production. I’m in a loving relationship (for the first time a healthy one). But despite all of that, I cannot keep my mental state in check. It’s as simple as crying in bed in the fetal position for hours because I feel like nobody genuinely cares about me. It’s getting drunk and breaking down to my friends about how happy I am that I’ve escaped my hometown and the toxic memories, but I feel it comes off more manic than happy. It’s the days where I’m 200% charged of energy and smiling and interactive in a way that, when I try to be self aware, I believe comes off as almost short circuiting or unstable. 

I’m sorry for the confusing nature of this post, it took a lot of time for me to justify even typing this. But I guess what I’m asking is, does anyone else resonate with these feelings/thoughts? Have you ever felt, or do you still feel, as though you can’t hone in on a mental equilibrium and it’s causing a somewhat unhealthy pattern of peaks and troughs? For those of you who do understand what I’m talking about, have you found any ways to address, cope, or resolve this feeling of having little control over your emotions/mood? Thanks in advance for reading."
606,I don't know what this is so please tell me if you know," A few days ago I started feeling like there’s something wrong… Like something is bothering me, but I don’t know what it is. I had something like an attack. It felt like there was a rock in my chest and I just wanted to rip my skin and take it out. I don’t know why I felt like that but it was like I wanted  to get something out but I couldn’t. I really wanted to scream but I couldn't . It got so horrible at some point I was just circling on the floor pressing my knees to my chest. I thought it might be a anxiety attack. But later I searched about anxiety attacks but it’s symptoms we’re different than what I’ve experienced. Mine was longer than an usual anxiety attack and it didn’t have symptoms that most anxiety attacks have. 

Whatever this is, I’m on 4th day of it now. This attack-like-thing happened on 1st and 2nd day. 3rd day morning, I also had this thing again but that one wasn’t as severe as the 1st and 2nd one. 2nd one was the worst, I had this thing and it was like 2 or 3 hours long, I was circling on the floor and on my bed, then I cried for a while to try get the emotions out, and after I cried I got so overly exhausted so I just laid down on bed and rested for 1 hour. I was so exhausted that I couldn’t even get the power to go and wash my face. 

 On 3rd day something other than attack also happened and it actually happened after the attack. I kind of started shaking and my heart started beating faster and it was like my brain was also shaking. It wasn’t really severe but still it made me kind of worried because it didn’t go right away. It lasted like 3 or maybe 4 hours long. Around 2nd hour , I searched about these symptoms and google says its either a heart condition or because of stress or an anxiety attack. But I probably shouldn't trust google on this. 

I'm having something like this for the first time, and I have no idea what it is so please tell me if you know what it is."
607,"Seriously need help, I can't cope anymore","

In April I lost one of my best friends to coronavirus. Since then my mental state has been getting worse each week and I can't fucking cope anymore. I was alright at first but just upset about losing my friend, and mentally I got worse but quite slowly until the start of August when it became clear that I would be studying from home and wouldn't be able to go out for what will probably be another 12 months. Since the start of August, mentally, I've gotten worse really quickly. On the 11th or 12th August it got to the point where I noticed I was feeling shit. In the past week I've been crying pretty much everyday, including whilst typing this. About 2 weeks ago I began to lose my appetite slightly and completely stopped snacking. About 10 days ago I started only having a couple of biscuits and 1 meal a day. In the past week I've only been having 1 meal a day and today I've not been able to eat anything - I've tried but I've just not got any appetite and no desire to eat. I'm thinking my lack of appetite is probably something to do with how shit I'm feeling, or at least I hope it's that rather than having a physical problem. I'm scared though, I have no idea what's wrong with me and nothing I do seems to help. I've tried talking to strangers on reddit, I've tried just relaxing for a bit, I've tried doing stuff to distract me but nothing is working. I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal (but even if I was I'd have no way to do anything so I guess I don't need to worry about that) but at this point I wouldn't exactly mind not waking up when I go to sleep.

I can't talk to my parents about anything like this, and I don't really have any friends who I can trust (all of my friends have shared secrets or whatever in the past, other than 2 but I don't want to put too much on them). I don't know what to do.

Honestly I think I might need to see a therapist or something, but with my situation I can't really get one unless there is one for free online that works through messaging."
608,Is that normal?,"I am 29 years old and trying to remember some things from my childhood.

Somehow I rarely have moments I have images in 1st person in my eye (e.g. just when my father hit me the first time). For most of my memories I have something like 3rd person memories (also for my father hiting me for the first time).

I have this for childhood memories but also for stuff some days or weeks ago.

I don't know if this is just the case because I want to memorize it? So I imagine what happend to me in that situation or how I looked?

Do you have this too?
Is this pretty common?

But also sometimes I get pretty emotional I experience something I experience something like depersonalisation or derealisation.
Like if I tell someone I love her, that is so surreal for me, and while telling it her and thinking at the same time this is so surreal I experience some kind of 3rd person feeling.

Pretty awkward is that, that already happend in pretty much every case I was face to face with someone and telling them exactly what I experience and while telling them that depersonalisation thing it occurs and while telling them it happens right now it gets even stronger, telling them that again made in again worse. Made me just stop talking and try to calm down."
609,Does a word exist for the behavior of my friend?,"Hello dear Redditers. TA bcuz my friend is on Reddit.

I hope this is the right sub. If I am wrong please tell me 🙏🏻

Sorry, I am not a native English speaker. On mobile.

Does a name excist for the behavior I will describe now?

I (28 f) know my friend (40m) since 9 years. And he almost repeatedly explains or tells me the stories of his 'suffer' in live. I told him constantly that I am tired of hearing his stories again and again (its always the same, nothing changes). He puts himself in a role like he has no power and he's a victim, but since today he didn't do any effort to change it. He asked me if I could help him writing a letter for an authority (its about his visa in my country), where he wants to whine about y he didn't received a citizenship after 17 years (i am a native and gave him tons of advice, but he never cared, like going to school, get a degree or job, learning the language etc). I told him I could write it. No problem. But he should be aware that the authorities might not care. And again he explained me is 'situation' and how he 'suffers'. I asked him why he constantly explains to me the same story again and again (I don't even asked, and after 10 years I don't doubt to know EVERY detail). He said he assumes that it's 'important' to 'understand' his 'situation', and he feels the urge and necessity to explain it to me again and again. I told him that there is no need. I will help him write this letter. But I don't want to hear ever again this story. Then he get mad. Most of the time he tells me that I am selfish or immature . I never met a person like that before in my life. He thinks that it's his duty to explain himself and that it's necessary to listen to his stories. And sometimes he needs an eternity to get to the point of the topic. Even when u tell him that it's enough, or that you understand he doesn't stop to talking. 

My dear Redditers... What is that???

Thank you for your time. I wish you the best 🙏🏻"
610,"Everybody knows I’m losing weight unhealthily, but they still congratulate/encourage me on my weight loss.","About a month ago I had three days worth of panic attacks and extreme anxiety that is still affecting me. I went to the hospital, saw my psychiatrist, and got on some new medications.

Within those three days I felt super sick, then lost all appetite, and it still hasn’t returned. I’m 5’8 and I’ve gone from 168lbs, to 153lbs. 
My mom, my dad, my partner, my partners mom, they all know that I haven’t been able to eat because of my mental health, and that’s why I’m losing weight. But they’ve all congratulated me on my weight loss in someway, like I’m better now than how I was before and it’s starting to get to me. I can sense them silently encouraging me to keep losing weight with the way they say some things. 


I feel awful, I wake up dizzy and light headed, I have no energy. I recently went to my doctor to talk about this with him and another issue. I told him how I haven’t been able to eat, and he just told me it’s all psychological, which I understand. That’s the literal issue. But when I mentioned how much weight I’ve lost he said, “oh good for you.” 


At first it didn’t bother me because I had weight related insecurities. A part of me wasn’t mad that I was losing weight as bad as that is. But with how awful I feel it doesn’t seem to matter to anybody, and that kinda hurts."
611,Why do I go through periods of hating everything and everyone one day and the next to being happy?,"Someone told me to post here instead 

I’m 19 Since around November last year I would notice they I would wake up and my mood would just automatically be pissed at everything and everyone. Now currently I feel like that every 2 days or so. Today was different I was really pissed and wanted my mom to stop talking to me I just wanted to be left alone but now I’m fine .

I’ve been losing motivation to do my homework I always wait til literal hours to do it before it’s due. I college now period even though this my first semester at the college I’ve dreamed of going to (I just transferred from a CC). I’m thinking I’m too dumb for my major now that I’ve been excited for.

I used to bake bread like 5-8 times a month I don’t bake anymore at all I hate it now. I just stopped caring about everything. I’m just a lazy piece of shit my room is shit.

I’m always tired I slept for 12hrs today and 2 hrs later I was exhausted from nothing...

I hate being like this because I make people mad we I have the days when I just want people to fuck off and they won’t leave me alone.

How do I get this together?"
612,14 year old girl going to mental health hospital,"Hello. My name is Emma and I'm 14. Recently I had a mental breakdown because someone was being very rude to me and told a friend that I could kill her and I told him how I'd do it. I also told him that I wanted to end my life and felt like I had nothing to live for. The guy got concerned for this girl's safety so he sent it to her. She told her parents and they got the school involved. I got a call yesterday about it and I was so scared of what my mom would do when she came home. She came home and asked me ""Do you need help, Emma?"" And I broke down and sobbed. I was sobbing so hard I couldn't speak. So I just nodded my head yes multiple times. So, she contacted a ""stress center"" for teenagers. Right now, I'm waiting to be evaluated. They're going to see if I should stay to be observed. I'm getting suspended from school but I don't know how long yet. I'm very glad I'm finally getting the help I need. Please wish me luck! I'll let you guys know how it went if this blows up once I get out of it, since I can't have my phone. Bye!!"
613,Is this still ocd or am I going crazy?,"Reposting here from r/AskPsychiatry

So, very recently I, out of nowhere, started to develop a fear of being/becoming a pedophile. It started after I read 2 reddit ama from actual pedophiles. To my horror, I felt sorry for their situation and I believe this is what started my fears. I read pretty much everything on the internet about pedos and compared myself to their characteristics in order to determine whether I was similar. I couldnt come up with any conclusion (some things appeared similar while others didn't). For example, Im relatively short for a male which is a general trait of pedophiles (from what I know) but then again Im average height for my race so idk.

Anyways, the first 2 months of this was pure hell. I couldnt help but spend every waking moment trying to determine whether I was one. I broke down crying a bunch of times during this time and just wanted to kill myself. In an effort to determine whether I was a pedo, I read the 'paraphilic disorder' section of the DSM-V and came across the 'Other Diagnosis' part which said it could be OCD. I so desperately wanted it not to be a paraphilic disorder that I started to read about OCD and found a lot of similarities. (Now, Im wondering what if I found similarities because of some cognitive bias)

I wanted to get help for this but at this moment it isnt possible for me. Anyways, I just wanted out of this mental agony so I desperately tried everything that I thought would help me. In the end, what I did was first prove to myself that I haven't shown any signs of being a pedo and from then on, whenever I questioned myself, I would remind myself that I had indeed proven to myself before that I wasnt one so I should try and stop thinking about it. It took me many tries before I was actually somewhat successful in reducing the mental agony. I basically forced myself not to think about the issue and it started to affect me less.

Some of the things that I used to prove to myself that I wasnt a pedo was (from before I started this self-doubt)- I have never felt attracted to children in my life, I never noticed children (as in I never took note of them), and whenever I interacted with children, it was a fun and happy interaction as opposed to a sexual one (disgusts me to even think about).

I am really scared that I am a defective human being that doesnt deserve to exist. I had almost overcome this in the last few weeks till I came across this study that says paraphilic disorders are similar to OCD and the author even mentions that he think paraphilias should be under the OCD spectrum. This spiked my fears and anxiety to 100. I feel so hopeless because that is the last thing I want to be. Im not even sure if what I have is ocd or not.

Just some quick facts - I also briefly had fears of being a voyeur and a zoophile but Im fairly certain now that Im neither of those. I am currently losing my fears of being a pedo as well in a similar way although its not completely gone yet. Currently, my fears are more to do with the paraphilia category in general as opposed to a specific one - as in Im afraid I have some paraphilia that im not aware of.

So if anybody has any idea, please, I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter as mine are all over the place."
614,Why would my parents tell me how hard it is to find a job in my field?,"Just anxiety? Today my mom tells me that she heard that people are not finding jobs in my field. 

I can't tell if my parents are trying to discourage me or if it's just anxiety. I also have been told that I wouldn't be able to afford an apartment. This has been my whole life. They are constantly telling me how I won't ever get this or that. Support would have been nice, but I guess I don't know how to help myself and have a lot more anxiety now. And I was told a million times that I shouldn't go back to school because of loans lol. I say I still want to and I get yelled at like crazy ""so go do it then. You're making a mistake."" I mean I'm lost and I don't know what I want. It is just hard to hear their anxieties every day when I have so much already and wish I had parents there for emotional support. Definitely not mentally feeling well and being stuck with my parents is a nightmare. Feeling so trapped &amp; so old."
615,I miss...,Having someone to share the bad days with more than the good.
616,Does this sound like OCD?! So tired of being the problem. So stressed.,"It's taken me a long time to figure out how to write this. Quick and concise? Well explained with thoughtful detail?! A mix?!?

I have depression and anxiety. I've been told by a therapist that I have BPD although I have never been formally diagnosed. I've been asked if I'm off my rocker.

Stresses:
-My husband is currently in a situation which keeps him as a stay at home dad to our one year old. He does not have access to any Healthcare at this time.

-I am the breadwinner. I love my job and try to work hard. I never feel like I'm doing enough and when asked, will always agree to do more (even at the expense of my family). I understand this is an issue. I can't help it.

-I am asexual and am learning how to compromise my husband's sexual feelings with my lack thereof.

-I have/had post partum depression. It was awful. I don't wanna go further than that.

- We recently took my sister in. A one bedroom apartment with my family, our cat, her dog, and her. She does not have a job and is a bit lazy, although she is definitely trying to pay us. She is three years younger than me (26).

- We are trying to move to my husband's home in the UK from the US this year. Still saving up but everything is underway. 

The behaviors:

- it's mostly obsessive thoughts about work or anything that stresses me from above that overwhelms me and turns to anger. 

-certain things not being how I like them (put away in certain places, things where I can find them cause I lose stuff easily, my sister leaving my car dirty) or new, different situations also spark this overwhelming feeling (my kiddo tangled his slinky and I freaked out, my husband wanted to make the bed now instead of later and wanted my help and I freaked out). 

- I am constantly freaking out that my coworkers actually hate me and I am trying to apologize and be as helpful and supportive to them as I can but lately am even worrying about that cause what if they are literally just tired of my fucking voice?! BTW like everyone is trying to recommend weed lately and I'm not in a place where it's legal! I have nothing against it but I don't wanna do anything wrong. I also don't drink or smoke. 

- all of my thoughts feel like run on sentences that won't stop and I cannot find the damn end!!!!!!!!!! 

-------

I am on Lexapro after being on several different meds in the past. I like it! Mild but effective. I suck at remembering to take it but I take it more than not. 

I'm so exhausted. So burnt out. OCD? Too much stress?"
617,"I need a re-evaluation after not going to therapy in years, and I’m scared","When I was in high school I started therapy for depression and anxiety, but I had to switch therapists twice because I just couldn’t be honest with them, and eventually I just stopped going all together because I felt it wasn’t helping. I tried multiple SSRI’s and mood stabilizers and nothing seemed to make a difference for me, so I felt hopeless. 

Now, I’m more aware of my thought processes and how to explain what I’m feeling more and I know I need help. But I think I have more than just depression and anxiety, I can’t diagnose myself but I think I have either bipolar or bpd, and I’m convinced I have a paranoia disorder and adhd as well. 

I’m scared that I’ve had these this whole time and never got diagnosed and now they’ve festered in my brain for so long they won’t ever go away. I used to hate the idea of having to take medication to feel normal but now I would do literally anything to feel like I belong with the world.

It feels like everyone is against me, or everyone is hiding something from me and I’m like some weird alien no one wants to deal with. Sometimes I’m convinced nothing is real and this is all a dream, or that something is using my brain as a trial and making me feel these things as an experiment. I’m so afraid everyone can tell I’m different and weird and they purposefully don’t tell me so that I won’t know. I don’t hold conversations very well, and sometimes I just can’t answer at all, like my mind just freezes and nothing goes in or out and I feel bad for not replying to someone but it’s either stand there in silence or try to spit out a combination of words that won’t even make sense. I can type and text people just fine, but if it’s a phone call or in person I get so anxious I avoid it as much as possible. 

I don’t know. This is mostly just a vent. I’m at the point where I’m open to pretty much any kind of drug they’d want to give me; as long as I could have a chance at feeling like the world is real and I’m real again. A chance to enjoy something again, and feel the whole range of emotions again."
618,My outcry for mental health improvement was heard....and read on the front page of my town's paper,"Hey everyone 🙋‍♀️ 

Still new to reddit but for anyone who read my post last week, ""Views from Er Room 3""(TLDR: terrible mental health treatment/recognition in hospitals) well it got the front page of my paper. People are talking about the shit I have been silenced for for most of my BPD journey.

Thanks for reading ❤


***UPDATE: My story was taken and published in the local newspaper with a ridiculous response- I feel extremely proud of myself for bringing my, very often kept to myself, thoughts to life and expressing myself by standing up for what I believe in.

619,Overthinking is killing me,"Lately I've been overthinking about small moments in my past (and I mean elementary school and sometimes high school moments) just running through my head and giving me anxiety. Thinking why I did that, how that affected my relationships back then and what people thought of me... Why is this happening now? almost 15 years have passed, has anyone else experience this? how do I make it go away or ease it?"
620,COVID Blues,"Anyone else still feeling the COVID blues?  Can’t seem to pull myself out of it.  I[early 30s] have everything going for me, but it just seems impossible to see it many days.  Been so much worse since COVID hit, having been essentially isolated with only my immediate family for nearly six months.  

Anyone else still dealing with this?  How are you coping today?"
621,support,it is said that to heal you need to open up to people. Can I just open up online or do I need to open up to real friends? I do not feel like I have anyone to open up to and I feel that coming on Reddit is a huge step. I literally kept everything to myself before opening up on Reddit.
622,I miss.....,Having someone to share the bad days with more than the good. Someone to just hold me while I cry for no reason at all without asking questions.
623,I am one of the many tired people,"Hey....
I came to the point that I can't even cry anymore and I am still carrying on every day.
I deal with ADHD+OCD+Epilepsy with a few symptoms of autism and schizophrenia on top of that.

I am not here to be felt sorry for but I need to vent.
I am always holding myself together in this life almost everything I do is blocked through a damn filter of disease.
Please be aware of when your body functions when you give it a task, try to see the thankfulness in it, because a lot of people that I see struggling can still talk without their voice shaking and cracking, sing when they want to, record theirselves, give speeches, be social and interact with others without problems.
I am thankful for them.

For me life has kinda always been like my own body working against me.
If I want to do the simpelest thing like drawing a few lines it goes like this:

1. I try to draw a line but the anxiety of me having OCD compulsions kicks in.
2. I try to stay focused on the task but it costs me more energy to push through the anxiety and stay clear.
3. Even when I fight through OCD compulsions, there is epilepsy that I have to adjust to because my muscles are pulling and shaking and it costs me even more energy to keep my hand still and it still does not work most of the times.
4. I get very frustrated because of my body not doing what I am asking it to do and I feel drained.
5. Then I try too much because I go in to hyper mode with the ADHD and after a few hours of being mad and trying, I feel even more drained.
5b. I could have a full outburst of rage.
6. Even when something works I might have an OCD thought about it and rethink and overthink if all I did was 'correct' and sometimes I need to start all over again while knowing it will cost so much energy.

This little example summarizes a small example of a structure that I have to go through daily and I had many issues and forms of these stupid diseases.

Nevertheless..
Still I am writing a book, fighting everyday, staying active and doing a lot of self improvement, trying to go out and I am on a special autism/epilepsy diet I had to figure out myself.
My life is almost impossible and it is sad, other people including therapists said that I am a very strong person. I can think and communicate clearly but I am hardly enjoying my life with so many disabilities while still having a clear head (that is hyperactive and overloaded though) I feel trapped in my body and I hate it.
I can't even use my talents like writing for my own enjoyment, music is a hell to make too with an epileptic rapping voice. Well sometimes I can but these are really small moments if you know what I mean.
I am sad and I want to cuddle😭 I am angry too because I have fought for years and years and my body lets me down everytime.
I made an album once and it took me like 4 times longer than the avarage person too.
I am going to try to sleep thanks for reading I am so so sad inside..

Heart for you all♥️"
624,Is there any way I could remove my feelings or atleast numb them from love?,"Lately I've been very depressed because my crush completely stopped talking to me and decided to forever ignore me since a year ago because I've hurt her,but I'm still obsessed with her and missing her alot to this day. You could say just move on, but I knew her since 5 years and used to talk to her nearly everyday. She was also my only female friend,the only girl that continued talking to me besides my awkward behavior. I feel like I'll be lost and depressed forever unless she changes her mind once which is highly unlikely. I wish I could just care less about love"
625,Tired of life,I was suicidal at 8 tried killing my self 3 times tried running away twice and she’s changed but now I have really bad trust issues she treats me normally now instead of hitting me like she used to but she loves to fight with me verbally and I’m getting tired of it she threatened to call 911 on me yesterday just for balling up my fist during an argument im 16 years old but man am I tired of life I’m isolated in my room my dad molested me when I was 4 my mom and dad got divorced when I was 6 my uncle who took the roll as a father died when I was 10 and he was the only person who truly cared for me I feel so alone I don’t care about relationships I just wanna be happy I don’t want to have these stupid memories of when I was younger and my mom choked me and once was gonna bring the fun so I could kill my self in front of her when I was 9
626,I feel like my entire world has collapsed and I don't know what to do (20F),"Hi, I'm currently being assessed for bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and am just awaiting my appointment on Friday.

However, the last six weeks, I have attempted suicide twice and have been in the ED three times with suicidal thoughts. These have all happened while drunk, as I don't have the confidence when I'm sober. I don't have an alcohol problem or anything, so that isn't the issue, and I am currently going teetotal to just stop it.

My doctor's think I have been in a manic phase, or something similar for the last two months, and I always find these harder to handle that the suspected lows, as I've had clinical depression since I was 13 so I feel I've just adapted to it, if that makes any sense??

I have been acting so out of character as of late, and I don't feel like myself anymore. On Sunday, I attended a house party with my coworkers and drank way too much, knowing full well when I should have stopped and yet I didn't because I didn't care. However, I turned on my best friend that evening and, (I don't remember, I had to be told this) apparently was yelling at him to fuck off and shoving him when he showed up to the party. I made him cry later that evening after throwing a drink over him, unprovoked. 

I later took off into the streets, screaming and begging to be killed by someone or something and just ran off on my own at 2am, no shoes or anything, and in hysterics. Police were called as I was reported missing and a risk to myself. 

I was found and hospitalised as I am a high risk to myself as of this current period of time, but once I was released, no one has spoken to me bar two of my friends.

My best friend has said he can never forget, or forgive me for what I've done and I know our friendship is over. My coworkers won't speak to me despite my apologies, and I know I've fucked up. I'm devastated. I want my head to stop spinning me out like this and causing this. I do admit fault in that I didn't stop, but for some reason, there didn't seem to be a good enough reason for me to. 

I feel so alone and scared, I'm being signed off work for three months so I can just try and recover but I feel like I've lost everything. I don't know what to do without my best friend, or the coworkers I called my family. What do I do? I'm still suicidal, but I can't bring myself to do it as I'm not confident I'll succeed. I just need some advice. Anything at all. Please."
627,Is there a name/term for this kind of reaction?," 

So I'm normally a pretty happy or at least content person, I can get overly anxious and stressed about some things, but not an unreasonable amount (I don't think). But whenever something happens that makes me upset, like a little tiff with another person, something that would reasonably make me a little upset, or just a little sad, I always go 0 to 100. Like outside of watching something sad in a movie, I cannot think of one time when I have had a sad/upset reaction to something (excluding anger, or any kind of bad high energy emotions in that category) and I have not automatically had a full on response to it. I am never mildly or just a little sad, I am either okay, or I am wrecked by things.

Is there a name for this? or is this a type of depression or some other mental illness? I would really just like to find tips on how to cope better with sad reactions so that I don't go all the way up to max every time and can have reasonable responses to stimuli."
628,I’m going to be doing school by correspondence next year,A couple of months ago i talked to my parents about it and they were hesitant then i talked about my mental health and current state and they agreed. I’m really really happy and excited and my current teacher just talked to me about it and how it’s going to work etc and idk i’m just super excited.
629,I finally made the phone call,"I've been wanting to see a therapist for a couple years now. I had a mental health crisis about 5 years ago, but I really pushed against therapy, and wouldn't seek help professionally or from loved ones. I'm in a stable mental space now, and would like to proactively see a therapist/counselor to talk about some issues I've had in the past and gain tools to better handle the future. After doing research and talking to my partner, I finally made a call to a therapist office and left a voice mail to try and arrange an appointment. It's a start!! I feel ready, and if they don't call back this week, I will seek out another professional."
630,Anybody else gets sudden onset of anxiety when thinking of a specific moment of their childhood because they can’t go back to that time and they feel regret of not enjoying it enough or taking family for granted?,It’s been happening to me quite often maybe because I haven’t seen my family in three years and covid hit and now I regret not seeing them. Will therapy help with this?
631,I miss meeting with escorts...help,ever since this whole thing started i stopped visiting escorts...os this treatable? i cant ser my shrink and talk to her about this i just need an answer
632,why am i thinking like this ⚠️violent thoughts,"how do i release my anger
also does anyone get angry at the littlest things?? 
the other day i was walking with my mum, she was on the phone
i moved over because someone wanted to get past and my mum didn’t hear them and they kept asking her to move
then she did once she heard and i sooo wanted to punch right in the face and rip her hair out and just jump in the river and drown myself
obviously i didn’t i just punched myself and pulled my hair

i experience thoughts like this quite often, idk why
like another example 
if someone is chewing their nails or eating like too loud i just want to rip my ears off and slam my head into the table until i’m unconscious

and literally now when i was writing that it made me feel happy
why am i thinking like this ?
 
i don’t want to die but i want to kill my self, if that makes sense"
633,If I end up in a psych ward will my boss find out why I ended up there?,"What type of letter and what contents will it contain if my boss receives a letter explaining that I ended up in a psych ward? I just can imagine all the gossip at work. People at work are gonna be like ""yup, I knew he was the crazy type"" 😢😢😢😢. I might even get fired."
634,Took medication to help quit smoking. Big mistake.,"So last week I went to my dr to get medication or patches to help with quitting.  Suggested I try Wellbutrin. Been taking it for a week. Took the normal dosage for the first few days, read the label wrong( supposed to take two a day, I’ve been taking 3) and I have been suffering since. 
And I’ve been an absolute mess. Severely depressed and anxiety through the roof the last couple days. Got out of a relationship months ago ( right move I’m pretty sure) and have been crying non stop for two days wondering if I made the right move. I wish I could explain how hard it is to go to sleep. 
Called my dr today and she said stop taking it for a week. The dosage I was taking for 5 days now is for people that are bipolar. I never want to feel this despair ever again and will not touch this medication ever again. 
The only good I can think of this happening is now I know how people that suffer from anxiety and depression really feel. I just want to go back to normal. I’m currently seeing someone else and she had a lot to deal with this past weekend. My mood swings were absolutely horrible."
635,"I know, I'm emotional mentally tried.. I just want to give up..","Everything i do is pointless and useless.. no one would care about me if I died.. yet I'm sarced of losing myself.. but I'm so tried of fighting this fight.. i been knocked out.. alot but yet i haven't give my anxiety and other problems a punch! I just want to give up.. I'm just too tried.. I just slowly losing all my power to continue.. please, i can't fucking that self hatred.. it's taking control.."
636,Where do I start looking for a therapist?,"I have never been to therapy, I probably should have started going 7 years ago, but my parents either never noticed or thought I just needed more Jesus (like they told my younger brother), or whatever. I am now a young adult, I recently moved out, got a full time job, I'm in a position where I can get one now but I have no idea where to start looking- what qualifications are needed, what I should be looking for, etc. 

It is physically exhausting browsing through therapist and trying to figure out what would be good for me (as I've heard many stories of people getting shitty therapist that made it worse before they found the right ones), so eventually I just get frustrated and give up. But, I really need this, being in lock up has destroyed any self progress I've  made personally, my mental health in seeping past late night crying and into my work, into my sex life, I've began to ruin moments and I can feel the weight it's putting on my S/O. 

I don't know where to start, what to look for, what to say....how to even begin making progress, I've gotten so lost in my own mind that I don't even begin to know what's wrong or where to start working on issues. So, just any stories on how you found the right therapist and what to expect would be really great, thank you."

639,i dont know is this is a real thought or not,"i had intentions of breaking this important crime, but then i cant remember if I actually ended up doing it, i cant tell if my mind is telling me the truth or not, its bothering me so much, because if its true I ruined my own life and a few other peoples life."
640,I need to punch something,"Hey reddit, I've got a problem

This has been happening much more and more extreme than or used to be, so I decided to ask for some help. Anyway, this is what's happening


I'm usually kinda chill about stuff, but every once in a while after something really really bad happens to me, or someone has just been a little too much of a dick to me, I snap, one time my older brother hit me while we were in a car with a group of my friends because I did something he didn't like, I tried to brush it off and keep going(I was just talking with the other people in the car) then he did an asshole move and did it again. So I snapped, well almost snapped, I got pissed but I had friends around so I waited, when we got back, I told him I was pissed and then punched him. He fought back, I did it again(to clarify, he was skinny and tall, I was meaty, not a ton of muscle, but enough muscle to move the fat at a high enough speed to give some good bangers) I, being considerably less mad, decided to instead of continuing, hide behind one of the two cars in out driveway, he took up a position in front of the house saying ""if you think you can get inside without getting hurt then you're a dumbass"" but I waited him out and he went inside and told out parents.

That was story one, but there's more and the snaps happen in different ways


Another way this happens is when I feel really overwhelmed, and that happens way too much, but since I'm usually chill about a lot of stuff and try to stop people from fighting my mom calls me harmony boy, and even after asking her to stop many times she still calls me that, and whenever she does, my rage switch starts hovering between calm and flip the fucking table mad. I try to stay calm, but it's hard. I even tried using a punching bag as a way of getting rid of stress and anger, I also basically tried to use it as a signal to my family for when I wasn't in a good state, like ""aww there's my little harmony boy"" *I go up to my room and start demolishing a punching bag* and they still don't get it, hey op do this, do that, hey op while you're doing that, why don't you do this too even though it's across the house. And recently, I've been getting stressed and worked up a lot more, what can I do? Is there anything I can try? Is there something I can buy that can help with it?(I've already tried fidget toys and a punching bag and wall)"
641,Could someone please give me tips on “fixing” my anxiety.,I believe I’m a mild schizophrenic (believe because “self diagnosing”) however I constantly run into worry. CONSTANT worry...from small things like wording things right to big things like family and friends. I feel like the worry is gonna absorb me. I’m okay with worrying about family and friends BUT constant worry is killing me and I’m feeling mentally exhausted and I feel stuck. I don’t know what to do or how to fix this issue. Any help is appreciated :)
642,Has anyone else had this or heard about this,I have depression I know that for a fact. And I don’t do a lot to help it and I know I should but I’ve been doing this one thing for years and just want to know if anyone else does this.                       I can catch myself having conversations with myself but not myself. I find myself having conversations with people but it’s more like I’m writing a script in my head. I feel like this mostly started whilst I was on the bus for school (I’m no longer in school) so now it can happen when I am cleaning the dishes or anything tbh

646,"People that have been admitted to psych wards, what's something that would have made your experience there better?"," I'm a student rotating through psychiatry in the inpatient unit right now, and the patients (obviously) seem pretty miserable. I wish I could help them out and just be there for them a bit more and as I'm a student I have more time than the doctors/nurses. I just rotate with the doctors in the am but I'm kinda hanging around the rest of the day. I'm wondering what else I could do that could brighten your day a bit more or make you feel more cared for? I don't want the psych ward to feel like a miserable prison like many seem to feel it does :("
647,"After reading a thread on fictional characters, and seeing my stuff posted here, I'm really afraid of being a creep. What, if anything, can people in my position do moving forward?","[I have seen this meme](https://i.imgur.com/5BbSmP8.jpg) along with [copies of ""creepy"" responses (which I agree they are)](https://i.imgur.com/xWZMRAg.png) to this meme posted.

Basically, it was saying if an anime character is like 16 or something gross, and you pretend like they're older (say 25), it's still gross and wrong.

[Here's the whole thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ij0y7x/does_the_anime_community_need_a_wakeup_call/) of people explaining why. And my responses got reposted here.

*I knew the canon ages of some characters*, but *I didn't really care about the canon* itself. All I saw was some anime boob and thought it was nbd because grown women and anime girls look the same. I just ignored the canon ages apathetically despite knowing them.

Obviously, I don't want to do this anymore. Am I or was I a creep? Is it too late now? What do I do?

I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm afraid of being a creep. I thought it was so obvious age didn't matter if you made up your own/didn't care about the canon or story for an adult looking character. I always only thought of characters as being 20 something because I like adults.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I don't want to be a creep and suddenly overnight I'm learning people believe I'm a creeper. I never wanted this."
648,Mental health and the school system,"

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and ADHD for a number of years now and I’ve felt that it’s important to both open up a conversation about a problem and invite others to speak about their experiences.
Being enrolled in university with these issues in an area that cares very little about my diagnosis to begin with, I believe the school systems are incredibly hypocritical and downright terrible at supporting an issue they claim to care very much about. Now the university did provide some resources, like a doctor on campus and a counsellor or therapist to speak to about once a month. Unfortunately the doctors were incredibly dismissive, deciding not to change my needed medication when necessary and instead doubling my current medication to the level that I nearly overdosed on it. When I was suicidal and attempting to end my life they sent me an email that basically amounted to “don’t do it, we have resources, visit a campus provided therapist in a couple months.” At the same time there was a presentation the university hosted about how proud they were of their fantastic mental health program despite nearly every individual I’d spoken to saying it had not helped them in the slightest. Every institution I’ve visited or been a part of has had the same story virtually repeated, where they want to appear friendly to mental health but are disinterested in actually attempting to deal with it. A student I knew with severe autism had tried to get the proper documentation to allow the class to consider his needs. The processing time on this however, lasted several months and by the time he could get the papers to BEGIN the process of getting accommodations for himself the semester had already passed and he had gone the whole way with no real support through the entire process and incredibly defeated from all the hurdles he’d had to go through for what amounted to nothing. Now maybe other individuals have had more positive experiences with this kind of thing, but what I’ve seen of mental health programs in the higher school system is absolutely abysmal and I’m outraged every time they host a presentation to congratulate themselves on what I consider to be one of their biggest failures. I’d love to hear anyone else’s story, negative or positive on mental health treatment in these systems.


TLDR: universities and schools love to brag about good mental health programs without actually investing into them and making them useful."
649,I can't cry.,"You know every now and again things just build up, and sometimes a tiny thing pushes you over and you cry for however long is necessary, til you are so tired u nap and then when you wake up you feel a weights lifted and you start to reset?
I used to be able to do that, I realised today that the last time I was able to do this was July 2019.
Things have been difficult, building up and I just cant seem to get to that release because I just cant cry.
Is this normal?
Anyone got any tips to help me cry as it really does help me reset and refresh :("

651,Is it okay to quit a job for mental health?,"So I’ve worked at my place of work for 7 years. It’s a well known supermarket chain in the U.K. I’ve had uni in-between and even moved away for a brief period and transferred my job both times. So they’d been good to me in that respect. For the last 3 years I’ve worked doing online shopping so an early morning shift of 6am until roughly 12-1pm. They’ve been very stressed over lockdown and I understand it’s a busy time, but the management are just becoming unbearable and they’re trying to make me and others stay extra everyday and even lying about our contracts to try and trick us into staying. My mental health and anxiety have been on and off for the past year or so and this is just making it even worse, there’s nothing I would love more than to just quit and never have to go back.. but the thought of being jobless for the first time since I was 18 terrifies me.. especially when I have stuff like my car and phone etc to pay for each month. I have a bit of money saved up but not enough to live off forever and during these uncertain times I don’t know when it’s likely I’ll even get another job. 

What should I do? Taking some time out of work to focus on my fitness and overall health mentally and physically would be amazing, but it is reckless?

Thanks in advance!"

656,how do you deal with hearing hurtful words from an angry someone?,"when they’re calm, they’re really kind and understanding. I keep telling myself that they’re just angry and don’t mean those hurtful words because it’s usually my poor communication skills and manners that get them angry anyway but when I’m depressed or anxious, I think back to those words and tell myself what I’ve heard those times like “yeah I’m worthless and never learn.” How do I stop doing that?"
657,What's the worst that could happen if I don't see a psychologist?,"Okay, so maybe not ""the worst"" but just what could happen.

I don't really know if what's happening to me is serious or my mind is exaggerating everything. My best friend thinks I might have depression (I know I can't self-diagnose, it was just an idea, and she's suffered from depression for several years so she knows what it's like), but I don't think that's what it is and I don't want to accept it as a possibility either. 

The truth is I haven't felt well for the last months, sometimes I have good days and I think it's nothing, but it doesn't last long. I think I will be able to solve it by myself, but it doesn't seem to get better at all. It's not that I don't want to get help; actually because of other problems I have, the psychologist is not an option for now, but I think I won't be able to see a psychologist for a while. I'm really afraid of getting worse"
658,I'm not okay. How do I rebuild my life?,"July 4, 2020- I had almost everything I needed. I had a job that I loved and a plan for my life. My living arrangements were okay, but I was in my hometown that I knew well enough. I didn't have any friends or dating prospects really. My coworkers were kinda my friends, but a social group was really missing from my life. But I still felt optimistic because I was working my plan. 

Then my cousin offered me an opportunity to work for him and he'd help me out with my career and getting to graduate school. I accepted because the job I loved back home was temporary (but I still had months to find a new one), and I thought it'd be easier to find a new job with my cousin's help while working for him. 

July 20, 2020- I move across country for this new adventure with my cousin.

August 28, 2020-My life is in shambles. My cousin totally betrayed me and became a narcissistic asshole that I'd never imagined. My job with him is over. Our cousin relationship is over. My old job doesn't have a position for me anymore. I'm still on the other side of the country, but with a different relative.

No job, unfamiliar place, away from the few friends I was starting to make when I moved. I don't know how to rebuild my life. I regret ever accepting my cousin's offer. How am I supposed to find a job fast enough? Where do I go from here? I miss finally having friends. The family betrayal hurts. I feel lost and alone and directionless. My plan is shot.

661,Extreme amount of pressure in me.,"Most of the time I feel like I’m going to explode because of an extensive amount of pressure that I don’t know the source of it. Sometimes I feel like I am drowning because of it. I don’t know how to help it I had this feeling for about a year and a half I tried to seek help from friends and family and they just don’t understand they just say you will grow out of it, it doesn’t help that the only person to have ever understand me left me so spontaneously and I still have a huge amount of feelings for her but nvm that. I just feel like a pressure cooker that is going to explode and it don’t know how to deal with it that is actually long term helpful, the thing that I am doing is just to ignore it for now and figure it out later but I don’t know when that later will be and if I will figure it out. I sorta want to have a mental breakdown just to start anew at least that is what people around me say that if you have a mental breakdown you almost restart the mind, and I want that it doesn’t matter how bad it is in the moment I just want this to end this hopelessness."
662,Recovering from a prolonged battle with depression feels like being released from prison with no money or plan.,"After being in prison for a decade or multiple, people find it extremely hard to adapt to life outside of the walls and structure they were forced to live with for so much of their life. That’s what recovering from depression feels like for me. There’s too much to take in, I’ve missed so much over the years. It’s overwhelming and I often feel like I just want to quit and go back into my prison cell of loneliness and isolation. Although it’s familiar and comfortable, I can’t give up, and you can’t either. Settling for something like that never got anyone anywhere. Does anyone else feel like this?"
663,I can’t tell if I was in the wrong or if I just have a shitty family.,"If anyone actually bothers reading this, I appreciate you. Today, while sitting downstairs, I was sitting at the kitchen counter on a laptop. My family was watching a movie in the living room (we can see each other the way things are set up). 

For about 10 minutes, they were giggling and looking at me. During this time, my anxiety levels went through the roof. I thought they were making fun of me. They have messed with me in the past about being gay (I’m not gay but that’s their thing because I have not dated for a few years now) or getting anxious about severe thunderstorms (which it happened to be doing).

Apparently, my sister made a post on Facebook about throwing a food item at me and tried to get like a certain amount of comments/likes to throw it at me. I didn’t find out until after I yelled at my family and kept repeating “what are you about to say!?” 

I’m not usually angry like this but them laughing and looking at me and like ignoring me when I tried to talk to them made me feel a flight or fight sensation. I threatened to start hitting myself. Immediately after, they start mocking me saying “retards hit themselves” and making jokes about it. 

Hours later, my sister is calling me a bitch for getting upset. Yeah, honestly, I’m thinking they’re just shitty people."
664,Is this how anxiety and depression affects someone or is she just lazy and using excuses?,"

I’m 22 and I had to move back home temporarily in April because college closed it’s campuses down due to the pandemic. I am working on moving out hopefully by the end of the year with my boyfriend (but we will see, we have financial struggles so it may not happen until sometime next year). I am currently taking classes online since the college I go to is still closed. I also work at home for a call center.  My mom is an essential worker and works 5-6 days a week. She comes home in a bad mood and exhausted everyday. She works 12 hour shifts and sometimes more if they need her per day. 

My little sister is 19. I also have a 25 year old brother who is also back at home due to other reasons but he is working and contributing to the house, as well as myself. 

My sister has anxiety and depression and stopped going to therapy and refuses to take medication that was prescribed to her (she never took it, not even once). According to my mom she’s been unemployed since the end of December. How she makes money is product reviews (test items are sent to the house and she reviews them). 

She has a car available for her to drive at all times (it’s my moms old car), but hates driving. She has drove herself 20 minutes to work and back before on busy roads, so she does know how to drive. She just hates it and will make up every excuse in the book not too. 

She is currently not going to college and has no plans too. We live about a 5 minute drive from the grocery store (possibly a 20 minute walk) and she refuses to go get food for herself. She would rather sit around the house and whine and complain non stop that she’s hungry and there’s nothing to eat and slam the fridge and cabinets and bother everyone else than go get food for herself. My brother and I refuse to go get her anything. Nobody goes out of their way to get us anything. We have to get it ourselves. She’s an adult. She won’t go to the store by herself because she’s scared she will run into one of her school bullies that works there. She also will leave the house if someone goes with her somewhere, just not by herself. I think quarantine has given her social anxiety. Especially since she sits in this house all the time and literally has zero friends. 

She sent my mom a grocery list via text and my mom stopped at the store and picked her up food on the way back home from work today. I think that’s ridiculous, she is here all day, knows how to drive, she can go get it herself. She’s an adult. 

She started bitching to my mom about how she forgot to get certain items and how my mom got the wrong items. It pissed me off because like go yourself then. Ungrateful

I told my sister “you should be ashamed of yourself, you are 19 years old, you have a car and know how to drive, you shouldn’t be relying on anybody but yourself to go get you food, mom works all the damn time and is barely ever here, I’m sure the last thing she wants to do is go grocery shopping for someone who is fully capable of going by themselves”. Then she said “I have anxiety and you know this” and I said “you act like you are the only person in the world with problems, you have an excuse for everything, anxiety or not, if you want food go get it yourself, who cares if you see someone you know, walk past them, why does their opinion matter, you are there to get food”.  She said “well I don’t like driving and I’m not walking” and I said “if I was mom I’d let you starve until you decided to put on your big girl pants and go get food for yourself, *brothers name* and I do it, so can you” then she said “that’s because you guys are older than me and don’t have anxiety”. I said “I’m only two years older than you, are you gonna do this for the rest of your life, your gonna have to grow up sometime” she said “mom doesn’t seem to mind it”. My mom has said to her many times to go get food for herself and she doesn’t have time to get her food. The only reason she got her food today is because everyday for the last week, she had relentlessly annoyed my mom over text about how hungry she is. My mom is sick of it. My brother made a comment saying “I’m surprised mom doesn’t have to wipe your ass, since it seems like you can’t do anything to help yourself and would rather sit around and cry about it”."
665,CW Transphobia: I feel awful about myself,"Before I begin I want to say this post is going to have a lot of transphobia in it. If you are trans please don’t read it. The last thing I want to do is push my problems into someone else and make them feel bad.
















I’ve been questioning my gender for about 18 years. I was born male, but think I might be female. 

I browse trans subs a lot to help get more information, but last night I’ve read something that hit me hard and I haven’t been the same ever since. It made me realize and confront a lot of things I already knew. 

If I do transition I’ll never be a cis woman.

There are experiences I’ll never be able to have because of how I was born.

I have probably benefited from male privilege at some point in my life, which gives me an unfair advantage compared to cis women.

Essentially no matter what I do I’ll never be a “real woman.” This also led me thinking of how I would perceived by society if I do transition.

If I don’t pass completely I’ll never be thought of as a woman.

When people do treat me as a woman it will most likely be out of pity.

Women will never view me as one of them since there are so many experiences I missed out on and since I have socialized as a male/benefited from male privilege.

At best I could hope to be considered an “honorary woman.” Someone who shares many of the same experiences as cis women, but is still a step below a cis woman.

Even if I am super lucky and pass completely, deep down I’ll still know I’m a male.

I’m not sure what made me think of all of this but as I said before it’s been affecting me. This isn’t the first time I’ve been sad about my gender, but it’s definitely the worst. I also feel bad since I know other people are going through much worse then I am rn.

Anyways that’s all I have to say. I just wanted to get that off my chest."
666,I don't know how else to ask - at what point is it 2020 vs something actually wrong?,"Normally, I think about recipes and baking and my love of my music and my family. Lately, I just feel like I have a lack of passion for anything and I just want to sit and do nothing. My job is really really demanding and I love it, but lately, I just want to avoid it. I'm on Lexapro for anxiety, but I just don't know what to think. Is anyone else just feeling completely and utterly blah? like I just could care about literally nothing and all I want to do is lay in my bed and hug my stuffed dog."
667,I’m so so close to breaking.,"I’ve had depression, anxiety and a possible ED for years, and my friends always call me the therapist friend. They always assume I’m happy and smiling but I’m so close to breaking and I don’t know what to do. My phone is the way to escape the suicidal thoughts and the tears but they always come back. I cry myself to sleep just about every night and I want to tell someone. 

So so so badly but I hate being a burden. Last time I vented was a few months ago to my stepmom who proceeded to post EVERYTHING I told her that i wasn’t ready to tell anyone else on FACEBOOK where a bunch of strangers could see it. 

She’s one of the reasons why I’ve started to develop trust issues. One of the reasons why I’m always ‘smiling’. I want to tell my birth mom everything I didn’t tell my step mom because I’m closer to my birth mom. I’ve tried to ask my friends to vent but it’s always ‘Sorry I’m busy right now’ and then they proceed to do things like play roblox or Minecraft- it hurts me to think that to them, a game is more important then my mental health. 

But, hey. That’s what I get for being worthless. I’m always there for them. But when I need them? Gone. I feel like ending it all at this point. I mean, my boyfriend could forget about me, my friends? They would care less. I’m so easily forgettable that when I accidentally left the group chat I made for us all I asked one of my friends to put me back in and she didn’t do so for a whole week, and I know she read the message.

My only escape is cosplay but I lost my wig, everything I usually use so I feel so lost. 

I just want to tell someone so bad. But I hate being a burden. That’s all I am..

I had to eat something bc I was getting  very very close to passing out and I have to get blood work tomorrow 

Also bc of my period I’ve been losing a lot of blood 

My period is often very heavy but lately it has been worse 

I needed to wait till midnight to eat but I fucked up 

Eating some of my crackers before midnight so Im going to panic over that for the next day but I got myself to eat something and drink something 

I’ll try to eat more tomorrow so I don’t pass out from all of the blood loss 

Im tired of being scared of food Im so hungry and all of the weight I’ve lost makes me so cold  

Im trying to stay warm in bed with a heating pad but at this point it doesn’t help much Im shaking bad bc of the lack of food the stress the panic n the hunger 

But this is the first time I ate in two days and if I wasn’t at this point where Im so mentally Ill I think I would be celebrating that

I want to be loved by people who know I'm being completely genuine in my love AND pain even if others think I'm fake. Does anyone else have this struggle? Am I as Freud says surrounded by the wrong people?"
681,how do i tell my parents i know i’m gonna die before them,nothing can convince me to live a full life
682,Is it normal to feel extremely happy for no reason?,"Ok idk how to explain it but I'm usually just feeling pretty neutral, sometimes a little depressive but for some reason I just feel e s t a t i c without any cause

Ive been what i like to call aggressively pacing around my backyard for an hour and I cant stop smiling

I just really uncontrollably and extremely happy for just existing 

A couple of my friends genuinely asked if I was on crack lol

My face hurts from smiling and my gut hurts from laughing and Ive had the same 3 songs on loop.

This is the first time this has ever happened (at least this extreme)

Lol This normal?"
683,Did I have an anxiety attack?,"About 2 weeks ago I went camping with my family and had an amazing weekend, when we came home I slept in the camper for a few nights barely 20 feet from our front door. For some reason I started to feel really scared an anxious for absolutely no reason. I had to keep reminding myself that I was safe and that nothing was wrong, and nothing WAS wrong. I had absolutely no reason to be that anxious and I ended up closing the curtain to the back part of the camper listening to music through my headphones and crying all whilst trying to calm myself. That's never happened to me before and I'm still pretty shaken by that experience. Can anybody tell me if this sounds like a panic attack? Should I talk to somebody about this?"
684,Why does it all fall apart at once?,I mean everything from family relationships to not being able to find my toothbrush after a compounded bad day... I’ve failed at almost everything I’ve done today now I’m just sick of it and I’m about to drive 15 minutes to go buy a toothbrush at 11:30pm because I’m sick of life screwing me. This has nothing to do with the toothbrush.
685,Im going downfall again and it feels like it'll hurt even more this time,"I had been really good this past months, really good. No sad almost at all. Mostly a euphoric feeling of  having tons of things to do. Happy and busy and thats it.

That is now over. I dont know why. Its always like that, months of feeling hyper and then months of wanting to die.
I literally did nothing wrong. Everything was amazing, i got into the college i wanted, i like my teachers. I did things i liked, and even started wearing makeup and clothes i used to feel extremely insecure about.

Then why do i feel so heartbroken right now? I did everything i could to be better, why? I feel in the verge of crying every day now. I get mad at everything again, i cry every night until i go to sleep and cry again when i wake up because being awake means having to think about all this all over again and i dont want to. I want to make it stop now. Im ruining so many things because i feel sad and insecure and mad and guilty because i did this to myself. I dont want to go into the hole again. I really dont want to"
686,Why do I randomly feel uneasy?,"I'll just be browsing steam games on my computer and feeling fine (like I was just now), but then I randomly start to feel uneasy. As in my stomach slightly starts to hurt, I start to feel a slight bit anxious, I feel stressed but literally nothing would have made me feel that way or triggered anything. I don't have any actual anxiety or stress related illnesses, but this happens every now and again. Is this normal?"
687,Had another panic attack today. One of the main things that happens to me is I feel pins and needles throughout one or both of my arms(the feeling like its falling asleep). Any advice how to help stop this from happening or to help prevent/stop panic attacks in general?,"My whole body feels vulnerable and weak. My chest still hurts. My head is killing me. My arms feel like if I'm pushed any further, itll go back to pins and needles. I'm just trying to wait till my chest stops hurting.

Does anyone know what can help anxiety and panic attacks?"
688,What does it say about me that I'm wishing for cancer? I just. I can't keep living with no answers,"The title makes me sound like an asshole, I'm sorry. 

I'm a fucking medical mystery. And I can't keep living, not knowing what's going on. 

I'm a hypochondriac (because, anxiety). I'm always hyper aware of everything happening in my body, and I worry. 

I've been having stomachaches for the past few months. Inconsistent in nature and placement. Not associated with any food. Tested negative for celiac. Had a weirdly elevated B12, despite not eating any meat, but my doctor didn't think it was a big deal. 

Besides that, I have a bunch of other weird symptoms: eye aches, heat intolerance (like, avoid going outside, no exercise at all. It's bad), exhaustion (though that's nothing new), muscle aches. 

I have an appointment with a gynecologist coming up, and an appointment with a gastroenterologist after that, unless the gyno appointment yields anything. Plus another appointment with my PC doctor, to have TSH and T3 And T4 tests done. 

It just. It CAN'T be anxiety. Because if it is, I'm fucked. No anti-anxiety med has worked for me. My mind is stretched so thin. I don't have the energy to change my diet and exercise habits. 

I'd literally rather it be cancer that's metastasized. I daydream about it in the shower. Because then, at least there would be a REASON I'm in pain all the time. At least I would know I wasn't crazy."
689,Disorganization is putting a strain on my relationship. Is it my mental health?,"Hello everyone. I am in need of some assistance. So ever since I was little, about 8 years old, ive always had a problem with cleaning and keeping organized. I hate cleaning, and im very disorganized. It takes me days, if not weeks to do a single chore, the same with putting something away. I don't know if it has anything to do with my depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD. im just not sure

I moved in with my partner almost a year ago and its really starting to agitate him, which is making my anxiety rise. I just don't know how to break out of this habit as I was never really corrected on it. My mother is the same way as well so I grew up around this. I know im lazy, and I won't deny that, but I just want to find a way to be better. I want to be able to do chores right away. I want to be able to put something away right away. Has anyone else experienced this and ended up getting better? It's such an annoying habit. Im 26 and I would have expected to grow out of this by now. 

Please no judgement. Im just trying to correct this habit and become a better individual. Im sick of the same conversations. Im sick of being like this honestly."
690,I can’t do this anymore (16F),Both my mom and dad have beat me recently. The thought of their hands on my neck and sides and face makes me flinch. I’m tired and can’t talk to my therapist because she’ll report me. My depression is at an all time low and it seems like I’ll never be okay. My mom accuses me of not loving her for acting like a normal teenager. When my mental health got bad the first time I wanted to hurt myself. Now I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. For now I’ll just drown my sorrows in wine I guess.
691,I can't look at my father anymore without feeling like he hates me.,"So I came out as gay about two years ago, and my father will sometimes make homophobic jokes but I thought he was trying to stop. But recently I learned from my mother that my father called a boy a not so nice word for gay people and know I can't look at him with out it ringing in my mind. And know I'm realizing how much of a horrible person he can be some times. I love and care for him but I can't look at him without knowing that he said that. I feel like I failed him and he deserves a better child. I feel like ending it all. But I can't tell him that cause I know hes already miserable he talks about it all the time how he hates our home life and he hates his job. And I feel like I need to spend time with him because every time I want to be alone he gets really sad, and I just feel drained and strest because I'm scared that if I'm not with him everyday or tell him all the thinks he's done that make me feel anxious and stressed and hurt that he'll hurt himself or even worse."
692,Can you be traumatized from other's traumas?,"I've gone through my share of mental health struggles like depression, anxiety, etc., but I was wondering if you could somehow have this sort of empathetic trauma? Like I've been through periods of other people's lives where *they're* the one going through the traumatizing event, or they'll tell me about struggles and such, and I feel like I've somehow absorbed that in a way. 

I've always considered myself highly empathetic, and through that I think it's why I always offer to be there in times of crises or struggle and listen to try and help. I am majoring in Psychology as well. So I've heard a lot of stories. But I've been thinking lately and wondering if I'm somehow also traumatized from that. 

To be clear, their experiences are clearly traumatic in a long-lasting, ""I need to see a therapist and seek help"" in a way, and it's not one single person that's caused this.

It's somewhat affected my actions and behaviors and ways of thinking to a point that I would say is a bit of a trauma response. Not just ""oh this happened to so and so, so I'm using their story to be cautious"", but feeling intense anxiety, worry, and sometimes even an extremely panicked response that leaves me feeling the same way I would to something I've personally experienced. 

Can you be traumatized from other's traumas?"
693,Forgetting mental pain,"Hi,
There's been this question that has been on my mind since a while.

Regularly this days and since over three months, I am going through dark depressed episodes where my brains keeps on spiraling with self harming thoughts. Those episodes can be so hurtful that I'll start complaining about even feeling physical pain in all of my body.

But when it's over, I almost forget its existence and feel as if it never happened.

As if I'm fine and just overreacted, that it was all in my head and never actually existed.

Of course I still remember bits of it, enough to describe it, but I feel like I'm immediately forgetting it and moving on from it. Except that it keeps on re-happening, so I'm starting to understand that I'm not truly moving on from it, and that thinking like that only prevent me from truly understanding what's happening with me. 

Does the brain try to erase mental pain? Is it a sort of defense mechanism? I feel like this feeling is part of a phenomena that I must not be the only one experiencing and would like to understand it better."
694,Literally cannot stop repeating a phrase in my head over and over to the point of extreme stress and anxiety,"I’m scared that this is not the right place to ask this question but idk where else I’d post about this. When I was in like fourth grade I started doing some thing where every night before bed I’d repeat “i love god and jesus and i’m not gay and i love my family and i love jesus and i love my life” over and over and over in my head until i fell asleep. I have no idea what my reasoning behind this was, I just remember I felt like I had to do it or I couldn’t sleep. For years after that I did that every single night and slowly it started becoming a day time thing too. any time i had a bad thought or heard something bad i’d have to repeat stuff like “i’m so sorry for all the people suffering on earth and i’m so thankful for everything i have” over and over but it was always somewhat controllable. For the past like 6 months? it has become totally out of control. I will start repeating phrases like that in my head over and over and i will literally not be able to think about anything else for hours. I’m a little scared that these thoughts got worse because of wellbutrin since I started taking it around a month before this whole thing got worse. Has anybody ever had any experiences like this? Hopefully this is just a regular thing everyone goes through and i’m just paranoid lol"

696,"Poo, meet fan.","Dear Reddit,
I feel like I’m loosing it. I am a socially anxious extrovert. I struggle to relax and when I get the time to I become depressed. I take on everyone’s shit and make it my own. As in I can’t help involving myself in everyone’s lives out of fear that I will be disliked. I lack control and self esteem. I feeling like I’m missing the skills to handle anything. I’m an over reactor and I am obviously self critical.
I feel like the shit is hitting the fan in my life and I want to be a better person. I’m seeking therapy. I’m tryyiiinnngggg. 
I just needed to vent. Acknowledge my imperfections so that I might move on from the pressure of trying to change them constantly. 
Anyone else struggle early on and feel like a complete screw up now? Hola"
697,Do I have tics? Am I just twitchy? Any help would be appreciated!,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this kind of question, but any help or advice would be great! I’ve notice that over the past 6 months or so, I’ve started twitching(? I guess). It’s like an involuntary muscle spasm, but I’ve noticed it happens more when I’m stressed, have caffeine, or am sleep deprived. Like, my head will jerk to one side/up or I’ll straighten my back really quickly (if that makes sense?), or my arm will jerk. It’s not really affecting my daily life, but I tend to notice it more when I’m relaxed, like at night. 
I’ve been on antidepressants for around 9 years, and I had my dosage lowered last year because it was giving me hand tremors, but this feels different. Are these tics? I’ve been noticing it more frequently lately. Anyone that could give me an opinion/answer would be greatly appreciated! :)"
698,Why do I feel sad sometimes even when things are going okay/pretty well?,Self explanatory. I don’t think it’s depression. I just see things happen and contemplate on them and feel some kind of sorrow.
699,There are apparently anxiety reducing audios for role-playing with a fictional boyfriend," 

There are apparently anxiety reducing audios for role-playing with a fictional boyfriend These videos straddle the line between confusing and cute.Forget writing self-insert fanfics. The perfect boyfriend is out there, waiting for you in YouTube land.

Go Back to Sleep after a Nightmare - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS16Y1BTgjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS16Y1BTgjQ)

It's Time For Bed, Baby Girl - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLwxyrwK\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLwxyrwK_4)

Pizza Night - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuwx2-J4IU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuwx2-J4IU)

Confused? Here’s the deal. While many listen to anxiety audios to relax or seek out that cool “shiver” that comes along with satisfying aural treats, as it turns out, many folks listen to these audios for entirely different reasons. Some of those include role-playing with a fictional boyfriend—not that there’s anything wrong with that. What do you guys think?"
700,Helping someone with anxiety online,"Hi, one of my close friends has been having very severe panic attacks fairly frequently.  The location where she lives is currently undergoing a lockdown due to Covid, and I wanted to know if there was anything I could do for her, as someone who can't be physically there for her.

I'm really concerned about her mental health because she is going through a lot of personal things on top of the quarantine, and lately has been increasingly negative.  I want to know what I can do to support her, if at all possible."
701,I feel fine but the people around me are worried," 21 F
I’m a pretty open person but lately I’ve been finding it hard to connect with others and show my emotions. The only ones I can really recognize are anger and anxiety, i know something is wrong but I don’t know why or what. I know my friends and family are worried but overall I feel fine I’ve just been more reserved the last few years. It’s a bit out of character so I don’t understand why it’s happening or why I’ve changed. It’s starting to effect my friendships and relationships because from the outside it seems like I don’t care but really I just don’t feel the need to express myself. I guess my question is do I have a mental illness that has recently developed? If so what could it be?"
702,Finally got anxiety meds,For a few years my anxiety has had a hold on me but i finally decided to put my foot down and get the help i need and went to my doctors (made an appointment of course) and once i got home yesterday and took my first prescibed pill in years and it felt great like there wasnt anything to worry about and it was just all in my head it was wonderful and i wish that everyone who suffers from it gets the help they need and deserve
703,Why am I so angry,"For the past few days I’ve been short tempered and irrationally angry at just about everything, does anybody know why or what I should do"
704,"Please help, I'm concerned","So I’m on anxiety meds and have been for the last 4 years, they work wonderfully, but today I forgot I had already taken my dose and I took another. I am now incredibly concerned 

The medicine is Prozac/fluoxetine and each dose is 20mg 

If anyone can tell me if I’ll be okay or not I would be really grateful, thank you!"
705,Everything Feels Like an Attack?,"Around the time I started school last week I’ve been naturally more stressed, but also I’ve started feeling offended/hurt/annoyed by every tiny thing.  For example, a classmate mocking my input, my mom interrupting me, my dad jokingly undermining what I felt was an achievement, etc.  Stuff I’m afraid I’ll get called overly sensitive for being hurt by.  I just feel like everyone dismisses me and talks to me with little respect.  I was raised in a family that doesn’t speak up when they’re upset so I don’t have the guts to say how I feel, and bit by bit the frustration is starting to stack up in my head.  Me being annoyed by everything cost me a group of friends once, and this is around the time of year when I started to get really depressed last year, so I’m afraid of it happening again.  The way people talk to me is making me want to never say anything at all, because the feeling I’m getting from people is that I sound dumb or I’m boring.  Is there a word when your brain makes you angry/annoyed/hurt by everything anyone says to you?  I can see how maybe this is what paranoia is, but usually that’s without any evidence at all that people don’t like you."
706,Thoughts on what I should do?,"Yesterday it happened again but honestly I’ve been really off since quarantine started. I’ve been having a lot anxiety and have been depressed a lot, I don’t remember a lot of it but TLDR I was going through it.

I’ve been having a lot of anxiety, depression, and some suicidal thoughts, I’ve even attempted a form of self harm but I didn’t actually do any damage. I had a few weeks where I could barely do anything but feel exhausted and low. 

Flash forward to now, I’m back at uni with my friends so I’m doing a lot better, but my anxiety is still getting the best of me. Doubting everything I say, getting anxious over nothing, bad thoughts, etc. I’ve had a couple nights where I’ve spiraled and felt sad, yesterday I even tried to self harm. For some reason I’ve just been angry at everything, and I’ve been so quick to get angry at the smallest things. I’ll go from a bad low to a good high quick sometimes and it’s weird, sometimes I don’t even feel real. I’m worried I’m going to mess up my relationship because of this too, since I’m being a lot. I love my boyfriend and he’s doing his best to help me, but I don’t want it to become too much for him and it’s become something else I worry about. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I know I have anxiety but have never been to therapy or been diagnosed before, but this year has been the first time it really has gotten bad, so I’m not sure how to cope/what to do. I wanted to post here because I read a lot of these posts and wanted to share my own experiences. I’ve lurked on this reddit for a few and have read through a lot of posts so I kinda felt inspired to make my own. Honestly I wanted to post how I’ve actually been feeling so my brain doesn’t backtrack and make me question if I’m actually overreacting or not.

Sorry this is so long, but thank you to anyone who reads this, I hope you’re doing well today &lt;3"
707,Help? Or am I just crazy?,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or having lapses of time. Havent got in trouble yet I think.  I keep getting resisting arrest charges. Yet I dont remember. And I was sober. I keep waking up in strange places. I can't afford healthcare. It's making me depressed. Idk what to do.
708,Should i get an ESA?,"ESA=emotional support animal, also on mobil. TLDR at bottom.

Background:
I (20f) recently moved back to dorms this semester and my roommate from that I have lived with the past 2 years decided to do fully online to avoid getting ""the rona"". Thus, I now sleep in a room alone, and dont have any real friends on campus. Its been a week or so and im starting to feel lonely. Due to the health crisis, most of my classes are online, and I have found myself with more free time. The less busy I am the more I feel my (undiagnosed yet) paranoia, which goes from everything from bridges (weird phobia idk) to shadows to  PTSD like loud noises or whenever I am alone at night and there is someone nearby who I get anxious of. And to top is all off my family (me included) are all prone to depression.

Should I get an ESA? I have been in therapy for years, stoped a few years ago, but it never really helped much, and im not too great at making friends who I could talk to.


TLDR: I have (mild but undiagnosed) paranoia, anxiety, ptsd, prone to depression, and am all alone on campus. Should I get an ESA, and how do I go about it? (I live in CT, USA if that helps)."
709,"""Freakouts"" Becoming More Frequent/Getting Worse","Hello everyone. Hope all is well. So I have noticed over the last year, I have been having these ""tantrums"" over things big and small. Like before I always thought I was just being immature but now I'm starting to feel concerned.

For instance, I just started graduate school and I barely passed my first few assignments with the feedback leaving me to start doubting myself. Then this evening I had class and I started feeling so anxious and before I knew it class ended with my participation grade being really low. And the thing was I started to feel that anxious feeling about halfway in class and I just ended holding it in for an hour. 

In more personal instances; Been trying to watch my weight and so my mom joined me on my journey, well, tried. She told me to be tough on her. One night I told her she needs to make sure not to stress eat since she just kept eating junk food all day (false alarm at her work for COVID but she still had to stay home for two weeks). Out of nowhere, she tells me I'm just like her ex-husband, who constantly made comments on her weight and just had put her down constantly. I ended up just walking to my room and had to total freakout for about 30 minutes feeling angry and just not good enough.

They all happen in this pattern: my chest starts to hurt, then my breathing turns quick and heavy, me clenching onto my head with emotions of anger and sadness where I'm just rocking myself to try and calm down. The urge to break things or just find a way to release my anger is common. Here and there I do end up breaking something of mine as well.

On average they last about 10-15 minutes but about three weeks ago I had another complete freakout where I just cried for 20 minutes straight. My throat was in pain for a few days after.

I was always told I have an anger issue and I feel these ""freakouts "" might have stemmed from that because even when I get angry I can feel some sort of anxiety pop up too. 

My sister knows what is going on and told me I should talk to a doctor. I want to but in the back of my head, I keep hearing a voice that is saying ""Stop being childish. Nothing is wrong with you."" Since I've been told that all my life. I know the steps I should take I'm just scared."
710,I am trying to be normal but the proofs shows the otherwise unfortunately,"literally several things that I think happen at the same time, which haunts me and makes me believe that I live in the matrix or something, I am happy when I try to guess something and I end up making mistakes, giving me hope, but there are times when I see that there is really something weird supernatural."
711,took 5 paracetamol tablets at once,took 5 500mg paracetamol tablets at once in hopes that i fall asleep and never wake up. now I'm terrified and don't know what to do.
712,I introspected for the first time in a while today,"I've been neglecting self-care, self-growth and mental health as a whole as of late (for the past months or a little bit longer. I'm kinda unsure.) Tonight and this morning, I talked about things and I feel like I did what I could've done before (which is good but I want the actual solving of  conflicts to be better.)  

I wasn't watering myself and I saw things that were uncharacteristic to my normal self and got worried. Like, jealousy (green-eyed monster), suicidal thoughts, impulsiveness, some panic attacks and just internal anger and issues. I feel ashamed but I always hopeful because it wasn't always *this* bad, meaning there is improvement to be made. I take responsibility for the things I've done in those moments. Yesterday was scary and I was on a roller-coaster of emotions but being stable and balanced is best. 

* I didn't get a chance to talk to my mother about counseling yesterday but I ***will*** today.
* Also, completing a CBT worksheet today and just caring for me. I still wanna live and I have things to look forward to. 

Some excepts I found on mental health:

&gt; To be in a state of good mental health means that you’re in the right frame of mind to be successful in every aspect of your life. It doesn’t mean that everything is perfect or no conflicts are present; it’s quite the opposite, really. Good mental health means that when issues arise, you can deal with them in a constructive way. Recognizing problems and actively working to overcome them instead of succumbing to stress is also an element of positive mental health.

From the last on this website, doing things like exercise, diet, meditating, journaling and helping others resonate with me to do and I was in a better place when I did these things."
713,I Really Can’t Be Helped,"I’ll keep this short I have MDD severe and recurrent currently going through an episode that has lasted over a year as well as ASD. I’ve been in psych hospitals 11 times within one year. Been on over 10+ different medications none helped. I’ve seen over 8 mental health professionals with no progress made it just made me worse and got kicked out of one therapist office. I’ve tried to kill myself 6 times one would have worked but my mom cut me down. So what do you do when getting “help” doesn’t help? 

I think since I was born with ASD I just can’t be helped. I know I’m going to kill myself I’m saving up to buy a gun but that’s months away It just sucks knowing you can’t be helped. I was just released from a psych hospital after 8 days because it was a short term hospital. I told them I still planned on killing myself but they couldn’t do anything to help me so they sent me home I’m not upset I didn’t want to be there it just made me realize I truly am a lost cause."

I think the nightmare isn’t 100% correct and then I start to remember the dream when I wake up. It just sucks. I’ve had way too much extra time to think this year. It should be illegal to have so much time to think. 

Just have to stay super busy during the day and be super exhausted before bed, right? I’ve failed to keep myself super busy lately sadly."

I’ve been there to support her but there’s only so much I can do not being in the same house etc. It’s stressing me the hell out. I don’t mean to be selfish but she needs professional help. I use to cut as well and what helped me was therapy. She’s dragging her feet with therapy. She just told me she’s cutting and I’m feeling like this is the end of the line.

720,Podcasts to help improve mental health ?,"I’ve been looking for articles to help me improve my own boundaries that I need to set for myself and also general things like a positive outlook.

722,Helping Others While Being Broken, Does anyone feel like they want to help others in spite of being broken? Like helping others gives you fulfillment and a false sense of completeness. That's what I always feel. I would love to give the world to anyone who needs it but I can't give it to myself. I keep on pouring from an empty cup. I'm empty as fuck and helping others seem like an escape from my own problems.
723,"My brother thinks that COVID-19 is a government bioweapon meant to kill minorities, and I don't know what to do.","TLDR; My brother thinks that COVID 19 is a bioweapon to kill immigrants and black people because my parents are both infected with the virus.

My brother, for the past four years, believes that the government is actively spying on him and making his life miserable. Whenever he has conversations about this and suddenly hears distant sirens, he'll start writing his words down on a paper for me to read in fear that the government is tapping into his home while he speaks. 

I only believed this to be an odd quirk about him until last night. My dad tested positive for covid-19 and has been dealing with some severe symptoms. I called my brother to inform him and he went ballistic. He screamed at my mom over the phone, who also tested positive for covid two weeks ago, stating, ""I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU. THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO KILL US BECAUSE WE'RE BLACK. HOW CAN YOU GUYS STILL NOT BE SURE."" He apparently smashed his phone after my mom tried to end the conversation.

He came and argued that we were all too stupid to understand how these coincidences keep happening. I'm 21, while he's a college graduate in his 40s, so he constantly belittles my knowledge whenever we debate, even though his arguments don't come with any concrete evidence. I would understand him being angry that my parents were not careful enough to avoid contracting the virus, but for him to use this situation to validate his own fears while also belittling our competence is unacceptable to me. However, he's my brother, and I'm concerned for his mental state, it's just that his views are starting to become toxic and self destructive. What can I do?"
724,Suicide Prevention Awareness Week,"I know this isn't till September 6th but just a reminder, I hope you all are getting the help that you need and deserve, You are important :) don't forget that.

725,I need someone to read this and help me understand,"All of my life I have felt things so deep. I was a quiet girl growing up. My dad used to target me take things out on me. I was quiet and shy. My mom was emotionally unavailable. I also have 2 brothers. I have memory issues. I’ve felt stuck and weird. Never really had friends or could keep them especially after the divorce when we switched schools. I remember doing things to fit in and sabotaging myself to fit in. Like not trying out for band for fear of what people would think of me. I never felt drawn to anything and was never pushed by my parents. I started playing guitar in high school because my mom randomly took lessons. I fell in love with it. I never was really good. That’s where I wish someone would have instilled me to practice and work for it. I internalize everything I do as not good enough and quit. I met my ex around 17 and we were together for 11 years. That was my focus family. I felt so Alive. We broke up 3 years ago and now I feel like the scared, lost and confused little girl at 32. I’ve had issues keeping jobs. Never really had a career other than in restaurant management when I was with my self made family. Now I’m just lost and stuck. I’ve always wanted to be a musician but I just don’t have the talent. I feel worthless. I know this is first world problems but, it gets old."

729,Obsessed with depression? Anyone else?,"Has anyone else ever, like, dragged yourself down so much to the point that suicide were attempted and shit, and when you finally got cornered and forced to admit everything, when you finally started to get help, all of the sudden your life feels so hollow? Like as if you missed those days, those feelings when you feel panicked and stressed from constantly thinking about dying all the time, those pain you've suffered so much. You felt like a part of you were lost the moment you started getting better. Like, fully aware that this is not a healthy thought, that you shouldn't drag yourself back down, but it's just so tempting. And then after a while you started to get into bad habits again, lying to everyone that you feel better now and stuff, in hopes that you'll get hurt and broken again? You hate it, you hate it so goddamn much, and yet you're still drawn to it. It's as if living is not worth it without that feeling of wanting to slit open your throat everytime you wake up in the morning. You hate it, so goddamn much, but you want it. You crave it. You'd do anything to get it again. Like, anything.

736,Persistent ache,"An Unsettling feeling in my stomach

I have this weird funny feeling deep inside my stomach. My heart’s mostly racing and my limbs always shaking. There are certain words and sentences that appear in my mind. Something like “i am never living in the present”, always dwelling about what may or may not happen”. 
I feel sick in every way possible, with no strength to even be with my own thoughts. I use music to escape or fill the void but now I’ve come past the point where music isn’t making much sense, just some words that sound nice. 
I’ve been feeling contrasting moods for some time. Where i sit to do my work and end up googling a random thought, which then keeps jumping to different interests quickly. I am aware that most of it is anxiety, depression and an attention disorder but I’m not convinced.
How can i want something so much and when i do get it, i don’t want it? 
Lacan comes to mind when i act like this.
There are days where i am fully rational and suddenly something happens and my muscles tense up and i start spiralling.
I don’t know what i am doing, where i am going. 
Although i have an eidetic memory, i still cannot remember what I thought of last. It’s there but i just cannot put a finger on it. I feel like i am going insane and all i need is some support and help."
737,Am I depressed?,7 years ago my father passed. It’s almost like life’s been in gray since then. I never fell into deep slumps of sadness or self harmed. But there is an overwhelming feeling of boredom in living. I don’t want to die for my mothers sake but if my death was out of my control I don’t think I’d mind. The only times I feel happy are when I’m with friends at school but with the pandemic school was canceled and I feel a lot worse.
738,Does you sensitivity get attacked whenever you got downvoted?,"I find myself always have what I would call ”a sudden strong sense of sensitivity” whenever I got downvoted. Some people would tell me to stop using Reddit or simply telling me that this place is not for me if my emotion can't deal with being downvoted. I've been dealing with depression since I was little, and my emotion has always been unstable. 

I have strong emotions and sometimes I couldn't control it. People always say that I'm strong, but in reality, I use that to hide my weakness in order to protect myself from being emotionally vulnerable. That means I'm still very, very weak. Every downvote is like a piece of panic attacks, and then a tiny depression kick in. This usually a short-term effect, but it happens every single time I use Reddit and see a downvote. This is not normal, at all. 

Should I stop using Reddit? I can't decide what should I do because this place also brings me joy but at the same time make me depressed. I just don't know what to do."
739,I told my mum something and now everything feels like it is falling apart.,"So I am a pretty decent student, my normal ranks have always been 1st or 2nd. But after my trials my ranks fell for Chemistry (4th) and Biology (7th). As i don't hide anything regarding school from my parents i told my mum my sudden shift. She immediately told me not to tell my dad. 

Her constant reminder telling me I dropped ranks killed me internally, because she kept reminding me I did shit (which she also stated). She ended up saying ""I lost all hope for you"" that broke me. Within my family my mum was the only one who had hope for me to get into a specific university whereas my dad ultimately declared I am a shit student. I don't maybe it is their way of motivating me but there is always that fear of doing shit and disappointing them.

I think worst of all it gets to me when they bring in money and how they expect me to immediately do well because a shit tonne of money is being spent for me and that I am being sent to one of the best tutoring. I think having Asian parents also brings that mentality that if I get a shit ATAR i will get nowhere in life but also if i get a shit ATAR they would not be able to tell their other friends. Sometimes it becomes a competition. An i am trying my best but after my mum reacted like that I absolutely feel shit. 

I am trying to make both my parents proud but I feel like I am not doing a very good job. It honestly is making me reevaluate everything. It doesn't help because the last couple of months have been the most stressful period of my life and this happening on top doesn't help in some form I feel like the biggest disgrace and I don't know how to redeem myself anymore."
740,Is it common for the anticipation of something negative to feel like excitement?,"So my Maternal Grandpa is dying. We are very close and I’ve broken down a couple of times since. The doctors gave two weeks about three weeks ago and every day I wake up anticipating a phone call from my aunt to tell me he’s gone. The thing is sometimes that anticipation almost feels like excitement, which worries me, because I do not want him to die. I had a similar feeling when my paternal grandma (who raised me into my early teens) died and I’ve felt guilt over that feeling since. What the fuck is this, I logically know that I’m not excited to lose a grandpa whom I hold very dear, but I’m sure what to classify this emotion as."

745,Not being able to get work is really dragging me down...,"Since losing my job just before the pandemic it’s been tough getting anywhere. My just no family are always going on about how lazy I am and useless because I simply “can’t get a job” like they’re easy. 

In the last few years I’ve done 500+ hours volunteering in various places as well as college, university and a bit of paid work. Parents refused to let me do paid work while in education. Always been told companies would go crazy for someone with my experience and qualifications but no one even in my field wants me. Can’t even get basic minimal wage jobs like cleaning or retail...

I’m looking daily for anything I can apply for but every time I am turned down with no comments. Honestly I can’t understand it but every time I get denied it’s like a reminder of how useless I fucking am. Even with everything no one wants to associate themselves with me because I’m so damn useless....even those that are meant to help you get a job have started being nasty thinking I’m just lazy and not doing anything. 

Literally my main weaknesses is my mental health and some mild medical issues. If I don’t say anything most of the time no one notices I have them so why the hell cant I get anything?....am I really that shitty or ugly?"
746,"Worried about ""visualisations"" whilst in the shower??","It's hard to explain, but I want to make sense of it. Back a couple years ago, there was this kid in my class who to say the least, terrorised the class. I'm talking about chair throwing, stabbing with nails, desk throwing. At the time I was scared shitless as was my class. 

Anyway, when I'm showering (idk why it's weird), my mind kinda drifts back to then, and sometimes I vision him doing more crazy shit, like weaponry and shit. I kinda visualise (Like act out, just using hand motions) me shooting him or fighting him or whatnot - like as a self defence. On other, rarer situations, I imagine myself as a cop or Swat or something.

Obviously I know that this is unrealistic and won't happen, but I'm worried that there's something behind it - like a meaning, perhaps trauma, or that I'm worried I'm insane.

It's even more concerning that I want to work in law enforcement and I'm scared that I'm not going to be mentally fit, and therapy could conflict that? Any help?"
747,Thoughts? Advice?,"I'm sorry if this post looks like a rant, it's kind of a rant but I'm also looking for advice and thoughts and opinions. 

------

I'm a college student and I'm in a psychology course because it was the only course in my town that appealed to me (the good universities and other courses are in another city which is about 3-4 hours away from my town, and it's expensive as hell) I want out, but I can't afford it. I just want some support to get through the course. I am currently in my third year, so I'm almost done.

My problem stems from the issue that I can't seem to memorize or remember lectures and lessons. I've heard countless times and read online that depression can affect your memory. I want to be clear that I've never been diagnosed with depression, and I am not self-diagnosing. However, I do feel depressed a lot. Especially when things go downhill. I can't afford to see a mental health professional about my issues. I just want to know if I experience this ""memory issue"" because I'm not really into the course and psychology itself? Maybe it's just not my thing? Do I have some kind of learning problem? Or maybe I'm just not eating healthy/have a healthy lifestyle? I've had this ""memory issue"" since the 7th grade. Maybe some advice would be nice? Thoughts?"

752,So I started going to a mental health center recently,Well I just hope that by the end of it I'll feel better about myself and life in general I don't care if I have to take medication and I'm never actually feel like the real me ever again I don't care I just want to feel better mentally and emotionally. People have been telling me not to take medication and I'm thinking so you want me to kill myself then and feel sad and lonely and make my psychosis worse than it already is.
753,How do I help my mom?,"The other day, my aunt passed away, and I have many aunts and uncles. But to me each one is another mom, another dad, that if I’m in their area and needed to, I can ask for a bed or a plate of food and they won’t hesitate, one where if I need to stay somewhere they’d gladly take me. 

I’m strong, I bottle things up but I can handle death. At least I think I can. Maybe I haven’t realized I won’t see that aunt anymore. But she was one of the closer ones I had. And she passed the other day. And my mom is devastated. And it makes sense, but I’m trying my hardest to make her smile and try changing the subject to help her. Me and my brother are trying to focus on her. And I think it’s hurting her more because my cousin passed around the same time, along with that she never got to see her granddaughter. And that’s what’s hurting my mom deep inside and I know because it’s hurting me too. She grew up with them, typical 0.5 generation American Hispanics, big family, going back and forth between America and Mexico. I can’t handle the thought of losing my brother or a parent. So it must be hard. 

To me, she was a really good help, taught me many things. In a way helping me break out of some things in life and made me into a better young adult. When my parents went to Mexico for a bit to take care of my grandfather, she took me and my brother in. Sure my mom packed us a bunch of snacks and food so we didn’t need to ask my aunt for anything. But she would always bring us things on her way home from work. But seeing someone close, gone. It’s going to be hard on all of us. But I know it’s hurting my mom the most. I ask once again, is there anything I can do for my mom, to help her? She’s strong, she taught me and my brother to be strong. But I don’t want this to overwhelm her."

Then I obsess over the fact I’m obsessing over them and I feel bad because I can’t stop.

There’s a girl I really like and she’s staying with me and she’s moving away soon so we have limited time together and I just can’t stop obsessing over other strange things.

758,Bipolar bears 🐻,"Hi i don't know if this is allowed but I just wanted to share my story and maybe get some help of some kind. I have a donation thing attached but a helpful or nice message may help too idk. Anyways I am 35 years of age and since I was a teen my mind has fought me. Constant suicidal idealation multiple attempts and another recent thought that turned into a plan. You can read the sorry below at the donation link. Anyways it started in December 2003, and I had threatened to wreck my car of a local bridge to my therapist. This scared her and I was immediately taken to the hospital. I spend a week at OSU during Christmas break. I can't remember what the main root was, I imagine it was because of the multiple abused i endured. I hope that doesn't come off like a whiney little bitch move but I was young and was never taught coping skills. Anyways fast forward to 2006 when I put a gun to my head and called to tell my gf goodbye... rookie mistake number 2. The cops were immediately dispatched, but it was actually my roommate that stop me. I knew I couldn't blow my brains out in front of him. As soon as he walked down there was a banging on my door he answered the cops immediately ran in and tased me. I was taken back to OSU where I stayed another week. I was diagnosed with manic depression. Fast forward to 2009 when this time the voices in my head were telling me it is time to make my peace. This time I stabbed myself with a pocket knife. I did my research and wanted to make it quick so I stabbed myself where my spleen should be. I didn't want my sister to find me so I called 911. Now I live in a small town so I figured I would bleed out before the cops got there. Well jokes on me my spleen ended up being on the other side. I was told there are 3% of Americans that have this I failed again. Then in my lowest of low times I take you to 2015 my girlfriend left me, I was fired from my job, and just wasn't right. Suicide was the only option this time. I took all my meds which was zoloft and another med I can't remember what. I took a few days short of a 90 supply and got in my car and drove to a far away parking lot in Columbus. I texted my family bye and waited to die..... nothing happened for what felt like hours. Thinking I failed again I went to the nearest hospital. I ended up just throwing up the pills which felt like I was burning inside as they came up. Life sucked but I went back to the pysch hospital a different one this time. I was downgraded to severe depression disorder this time. This time i decided to stick with my treatment and do all I can to get better. I have tried every pill under the sun and I had been doing pretty good until last year I relapsed and this last month I went in. I am back to being diagnosed bipolar 2. I am on a new pill cocktail, which I hope helps bc i feel there will not be a next time. The story below is what happened to get me to the hospital this time around which is a decent story. I just need to know will the suicidal idealation, mania, and depression ever stop? I feel so broken. Well thanks for reading

759,Doctor suggested I might have cyclothymia but nothing came of it,"I (17F) went to the doctor several months ago about my mental health and they said they thought I might have cyclothymia and referred me to a psychiatrist. However a few weeks later I got letter saying that my referral to the psychiatrist had be declined as it wasn't considered serious enough. I was however sent to a mental health charity and I received CBT for 7 weeks. This didn't really work though and if anything I think I am worse now (not due to the therapy but my mental health has declined).

After reading about cyclothymia however I really do think I fit the symptoms but I don't know what to do as I can't get assessed because it's not considered serious enough and free therapy hasn't helped me.

What should I do?"

I’ve been in some near fatal car crashes, been falsely accused of rape and had someone attempt to shoot me. So I always try to have a good day because I really shouldn’t be in this word right now.

But eventually my entire world seems like it’s crashing down. I’ll make a mistake and won’t let it go. It will haunt me for a month and I feel like shit, than I’ll go back to how I really shouldn’t be alive and instead of using it as motivation I’ll use it to keep myself down. What should I do?"
762,Wellbutrin and Lexapro advice,"My mom has started taking Wellbutrin and Lexapro almost a week ago for her anxiety and she’s been experiencing side effects. She’s been taking the Wellbutrin in the morning with food and Lexapro with food in the evening. She is feeling like she’s hung over, she’s been getting extremely nauseous to the point of wanting to vomit but then like 3-4 hours after taking Wellbutrin the nausea subsides, and in the afternoons she’s feels the best. She’s ready to give up taking the Lexapro and just take the Wellbutrin. I really was hoping she would actually try the meds because her anxiety is bad. 

Any advice? Any similar experiences with these meds?"
763,I've been very disorganized since I was a child. Could it be my mental illness?,"Hello everyone! I am having some issues, idk if theyre OCD related but I'm in a crisis. So ever since I was little, about 8 years old, ive always had a problem with cleaning and keeping organized. I hate cleaning, and im very disorganized. It takes me days, if not weeks to do a single chore, the same with putting something away. I don't know if it has anything to do with my depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD. im just not sure

I moved in with my partner almost a year ago and its really starting to agitate him, which is making my anxiety rise. I just don't know how to break out of this habit as I was never really corrected on it. My mother is the same way as well so I grew up around this. I know im lazy, and I won't deny that, but I just want to find a way to be better. I want to be able to do chores right away. I want to be able to put something away right away. Has anyone else experienced this and ended up getting better? It's such an annoying habit. Im 26 and I would have expected to grow out of this by now. We had another disagreement tonight and im feeling suicidal and just an overall burden 😔 i already feel like a burden at work, i don't want to feel this way at home...

Please no judgement. Im just trying to correct this habit and become a better individual. Im sick of the same conversations. Im sick of being like this honestly."

Very low self-esteem. I also find myself biting the inside of my mouth when I'm anxious (and I'm often very anxious).

I don't want to self-diagnose anything, but I don't think that I should feel like this. I haven't told anyone, because I'm afraid that I'm just overreacting everything. What should I do?? I have tried to speak with my friends, but I just can't tell them."

She usually looks at my crotch and likes to watch me do stuff. This is not new, I felt like this for a long time however I just couldn't bring myself to even think about it. I feel disgusted by my own body, what the fuck?"
768,I feel overdriven with Fervor,"I can't stand the silence in my head that devils around the constant idea of killing .

I can't get it out of my head to kill bad people (high risk Sex offenders, pedophiles,  rapist, murderers)

I want to butcher them,  hurt them , hang them by the weak , disgusting skin.

I keep having vivid day dreams , I e had weird dreams , I keep having thoughts .

My depression I feel is coming back , I'm sleeping less, im eating less my OCD thoughts are back but when they bring up killing it feels like serotonin. 

This all started when I started seeing the news on TV and post on social media about #SaveOurChildren.  


I've had strong feelings about killing before then and idk if this is normal .

I have always been disgusted by sexual Perverts. 


My thoughts keep me up at night not from being scared but because I cant shake the thought of wanting to do it .


I want to pursue Ministry but I feel this is all getting in the way of that."
769,How do you get someone to seek help?,"If someone has depression and social anxiety, how do you get them to get themselves help? How do you get them to call multiple therapists to find someone with a free spot if it takes them hours to make one call, and they think it's pointless anyway? How do you talk to them about how their health is important to you without making them feel worse for letting you down somehow? Should I even do any of those things? I know it's ultimately up to them but if a loved one had a physical health issue I'd try to convince them to see a doctor as well. I don't know how to approach this as what I've been doing so far hasn't been very successful."
770,My close friend is ignoring me due to depression/anxiety. How do I help/support them?,"My (23F) close friend (24F) has a long history with depression and anxiety. Mainly anxiety but she is prone to depressive states. She just started school again after a break (for her mental health), she’s chemical engineering so her classes are super difficult. The last time I talked to her she told she’s crazy stressed with school and ready to just pull her hair out and cry (she’s super sarcastic as well). Well that was a week ago (we usually talk everyday and try to see each other once a week), and she now will open my messages and snapchats but won’t reply. I’m not like upset, I completely understand, I deal with GAD too. I just want to know how to be there for her. She’s strong as hell so I don’t want to come on all sympathetic and make her feel less than, because she’s not. But I don’t want her to feel 1) bad for not talking to me and thinking it’s been too long so what’s the point 2) alone and feeling like she can’t talk to anyone 3) unsupported and not understood. Should I just give her her space until she comes around? Or like call her or try to stop by when she’s off work? Thanks"

772,Is there a right or wrong way to reach out to a friend for support and help?,"I may be thinking too much into this but I feel so alone and I’m stuck between going to a close friend for support but avoiding reaching out because I feel like such a problem. 

I have BPD and my experiences and tendencies have been getting worse and it’s affecting every aspect of my life, as well as my other diagnoses and my ability to function in every day life. 

I am in the process of getting back into counseling/therapy, but in the mean time I really need support and I don’t know how to ask for it without feeling needy. 

This person is someone I trust and I know has my back. They’ve always supported me and validated my feelings and experiences but I’m so afraid to go to them for help because I’m sure they already have enough on their plate."
773,"Do people realize how offensive it is to go around calling people ""crazy"" or ""insane"" or even ""dangerous""?","It's hurtful, with or without a diagnosis. In my whole life I've had one psychotic episode (when I did not hurt anyone) and been stuck with the labels from my family ever since.  Now I'm afraid to ever express an emotion near them of have an opinion on anything and THAT is what is unhealthy.  

I've recently developed a weird shiver when I get anxious and, having had panic attacks before and having learned how to handle them, I've been dealing with the shiver in pretty much the same manner, but I don't fully have it under control yet.   Still the labels are what hurts and boy, do they live them. In the past I was evil for listening to heavy metal. Dare you call any one of them anything, however (I once called my brother stupid in an argument), its evidence of how mentally challenged you are. I genuinely find this environment so toxic, and today I was informed that my mother, who has herself been very toxic to me over the years, has at most 6 months left to live. I'm terrified of what will happens next because I've been grieving her for months already so  I don't necessarily feel bad, but I'm so scared about this being used as some evidence of my disorder again. In fact, I wanna move out so badly so that I can get therapy.  Anyway, my vent is changing topic now so I'll end it.  Trying to think of fun things I can do to get my mind off everything."
774,I can't enjoy my main hobby anymore,For the past year I've been going through a rough patch in my life that has caused high stress and extreme anxiety. I've played video games for as long as I can remember and loved it. But now when I sit down too relax I either get angry at them easily or don't want too play at all. The only time I enjoy a game is when I'm playing one with friends. I've tried other hobbies throughout my life but being an uncoordinated introvert has made my options very limited.
775,I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.,"Life begins at the end of our comfort zone, and this post is going to be uncomfortable for me. 

Over the past few years, I have really challenged myself to truly understand my depression. There have been so many less than perfect moments through my journey. Moments of vulnerability, moments of clarity, moments which were noisy, confusing and overwhelming as I desperately tried to claw my way through depression towards better days. As I continued to confront my own truth there were many who judged me, but not did understand what I was going through. It was at that moment that I decided that I must do everything in my power to make the unseen, seen. I set out to walk with vulnerability through a period in my life that was out of control. 

What did I learn?

1) Popular psychology is wrong... 

Rejection is not our greatest fear, our greatest fear is that we are invisible. Part of learning to live with and walk through depression is an exercise in making the invisible, visible. 

2) People do not change, circumstances do. 

You are the same person you were when you were a child, filled with joy, potential and love. Sometimes the circumstances in our lives greatly impact our ability to seek happiness, and leave us in a place where things that are already overwhelming, became even more overwhelming. We have to do everything in our power to change the channel when we are face-to-face with circumstances that are unfavourable. 

3) We cannot live against our own truths. 

The truth is when we wake up in the morning and look in the mirrior, the reflection we all see drives us crazy. I think what haunts us the most is that vision in our head of how everything is supposed to be, and when we look in the metaphorical mirror and things are not that way it compounds and prevents us from being happy. It took me a long time to learn how to stop living against my own truth: that we are broken, deeply broken people and often times the remedies we use for loneliness and heartbreak are to surround ourselves with lonelier more heart broken people. 

For a long time I spent too much time laying in bed feeling sorry for myself, waiting for some magical thing to fall from the sky and make everything okay. Many of the personal relationships I had began to suffer. The responsibilities and commitments I made to myself and others were not being followed through on. I truly was on a crash course going no where. I really did eel helpless and numb.  

Once I was able to challenge myself vulnerably I was able to feel happiness. My battle with depression is far from over, but I have turned a corner and I am at peace. I found calm amidst the chaos. This does not mean that the darkness no longer exists. It means that the darkness no longer controls my life. This is quite literally the pursuit of nirvana. It took me a long time to realize that I had two choices: I could be a victim, or I could over come. I am choosing to overcome. Thankfully I don't want a life anymore, I want to live my life.

Battling depression is no longer about finding the strength to get out of bed in the morning. I want to get out of bed. I am excited to get out bed. Because in front o me there are amazing experiences that I get to see from a new set of eyes. 

To that person who told me I was better than this and I could not let depression win... you were right... you were always right. 

And to those two fantastic people who drunkenly stumbled into a alive music club and changed my life forever. Thank you for letting me be me. We have celebrated the ups and downs. We have conquered so much together.

To anyone who may be reading this, please know that you can find your way through depression too. I am here to help, and offer any advice I can. 

I haven't laughed this hard in a long-time and it feels good to laugh.

Here's lookin' at you."
776,"There are some days when I think about ending it all, but then I think about my dogs and change my mind. I can't bear the thought of leaving my dogs when this is all over and I have to go back to my university.","Theo and Dora are such a joy to me, but I only really get to spend time with them when I'm at home for the holidays (my university is a thousand kilometers away). Now, though, with COVID-19 and the lockdown, I've been stuck at home for 6 months. I've been spending so much time with my dogs that I can't imagine having to go back to my university in a few months, maybe even a year, which would mean leaving them for months on end and only getting to visit during holidays (summer, Christmas, and Easter). These days I've been thinking a lot about bringing them to my apartment in the big city, but my parents most likely won't allow me to do so. But they do help me cope with those times that I think bad things - all I have to do is play with them and the dark thoughts magically go away for a while until I forget about them. When I'm with them, I feel like I don't have a lot of problems. When I'm not with them (like when I'm studying), I want to be with them I sometimes cry because I miss them.

I have a loving girlfriend that I can talk to about anything, and she's pretty much the only person I feel comfortable talking to about my deepest issues. But venting alone, while it helps in the moment, doesn't really solve any issues.

***Back Story (Skip to Main Issue If TL;DR)***

So i was born in South Africa and moved to australia when i was 8 years old where i struggled fitting in and was bullied weekly by the same person for 7 years, i never told anyone as i thought this is just how people treat me and never thought much about my mental health or anything. When i reached high school my parents enrolled me into homeschooling and did this up until year 10. When i reached year 8 i started getting down now and then from being lonely and not having friends other than my brother and parents i guess you could say. When i was in year 9 my mental health declined very badly and became suicidal half way through year 9, i ended up writing a note to my brother, mom and dad thanking them for everything they have done for me and apologising for being a failure and not able to be liked and things like that, i thanked my brother for all the times building and destroying legos, i thanked my mom for teaching me how to cook and always being up for a hug and always loving me, and i thanked my dad for teaching me everything i knew and loved about computers and always being up for a game of catch or a joke and always loving me. i basically dated it and gave myself like a week left to live before i was gonna take my life a couple days before i planned to take my life i bought and downloaded Arma 3 and got heavily into video games from there and found i can avoid my problems and ignore life through games. I made 3 friends back then i still talk to and am close with and who have helped me through heaps over the past years. My life from there gradually increased i guess but was still lonely and depressed at times. Year 10 was probably the happiest year of my life at the time, towards the end of year 10 my dad got a new job and we moved to the city where i ended up being enrolled into year 11 for 2020. At the time i thought my mental state was all good but didnt realise i basically just been pushing any problems into a box and locking it up, on new years night i came to a realisation my mental state is shit, i was alone in my bedroom watching a move in my bed with a can of coke while watching all these snapchat stories of past friends partying and having a good time and completely forgetting about me, never thought to invite me knowing i don't have any other friends. I broke down worse than i have ever broke down before as it hit like Jan 1st 2020, i cried and cried and fell asleep.  woke up and felt like shit, a week goes by and i realise you know what i'm going to a new school, my first ever high school and i will meet at least 1 person i get along with. On the first day i introduced myself to my mate we will call him Bailey, Bailey was nice and i had every class with him throughout the week so i decided to sit with him the whole of the first day, walking around and sitting by myself at break because i was too nervous to meet his friends. The next day comes along and i asked him where does he generally hang out, and he said he tends to hang out with 3 main groups, year 10's, 11's or 12's and asked me which group id prefer to choose and meet. Me always being able to along with people older than me rather then same age or younger i chose the year 12's. They were so welcoming and accepted me with open arms and to this day i am still friends with them and they are practically my second family. I ended up meeting the person i love dearly and enjoy spending time with and gets me more than anyone else ever has. Also my first ever girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

***Main Issue***

Throughout 2020 so far i have been having these drastic mood swings at the start they were usually once a week where i would go from being joyful and energetic to extremely sad and suicidal. A couple weeks before May this started happening maybe once a day for the next month and i ended up smoking weed everyday to help me which it did, it just made me happier when i was down and took care of all the shit i have been through in the past. It has been happening for the last couple of months everyday where at least once a day i have this drastic change of mood, from energetic, optimistic, joyful and just all in all happy to suicidal, down and not seeing a point in life, knowing i have people who love me and care for my well being yet i still felt this way, knowing i have friends now that i talked to about this and have been telling me to get help or talk to my parents but been to scared to.  I talked to my mom about it and she brushed it off as just mood swings (I did leave out the suicidal part) and said all teenagers go through this and i'm fine there is nothing wrong. So i spoke to one of my friends who has Bi-polar disorder and he said everything i am experiencing is the same that he experiences, so i did some digging and started realising that i have been experiencing most the shit for Bi-polar disorder for a while now. Yesterday i thought was my worst day yet because i had those drastic mood changes about 8 times in school, i talked to my other friend on the way home about it all and he said he knows a lot of bipolar people and they experience what i experience as well. when i got home i broke down, 10 minutes later full of joy and happiness, 30 minutes later broke down and suicidal again, 10 minutes later, u guess it full of joy and happiness, this happened from 5pm till about 11.30pm constantly, i tried talking to my parents in the car omw to a restaurant about it (Leaving out the suicidal part because i'm too scared to admit that) and my mom just said u dont have anything wrong with you u just have really bad mood swings so i believed them slightly still think its something else, bipolar or not i knew it wasn't just ordinary mood swings cause i have had those before but they weren't like this bad. Now the Icing on the cake which made me decide to make a post to get opinions and/or help, I was standing in the kitchen and thought i heard my cat purring at my feet like he usually does when i'm cooking, i looked down and he wasn't there yet i still hear him purring at my feet i looked around thinking the noise was just traveling weird, checked my room and he is sleeping quietly on my bed, keep in mind my room is on the other side of the brick house with a semi closed door just big enough for him to get through. Another incident i was just talking to my girlfriend on her bed about everything she hugged me and we just layed down for a bit,i ended up getting up saying her parents and younger brother just got home, she looked as if i was insane and i said i just heard them come in the door i can hear her younger brother talking, she said they aren't back there is no one talking, i said yea there is i can hear your mom laughing with ur brother, then when she asked me if i was alright i snapped back into reality i guess and it felt as if i went through a wormhole and came back and just wasn't on earth for a second, i was confused and scared, now decently worried layed down and just calmed down. Cut forward to dinner with her family, i'm sitting there at the table laughing and making jokes with her family and laughing, i could feel as if my mood was gonna drop and become suicidal again but just ignored it, then my visual interpretation of things got messed up. I felt as if a dark cloud came out of where and the room felt darker, colder, everyone looked so depressed and look as if they had fake smiles on their face, at this point im freaking out internally wanting to die as what was happening was scaring me so much and hurting me seeing everyone 'depressed'. I asked my girlfriend if she noticed it and she said they haven't smiled and laughed that much for real for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea sorry for the long post but just want to try and get peoples opinions on what to do, i am talking to the school chaplain on monday to try and get some help but still know something isn't right, im not gonna go and self diagnose myself with bipolar all im trying to say is im experiencing something and the only link i have found is that, so i have come here to post my story and try get opinions and help.

Thank you to anyone who actually took the time to read this in advance.

Hope you have a good day and please lmk your opinion... xxx"
782,Bipolar and maintaining a schedule.,Hello everyone! I am bipolar 1 and have a problem keeping a regular schedule. I start off great for a few weeks then all of a sudden my focus fades and I have no desire to continue. I say no desire but in truth I have no strength to push through. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this and build structure that I can maintain. Also if anyone has any ideas on how to move beyond a need for physical affection I would greatly appreciate it.
783,"PLEASE, I NEED SOME ADVICE","I'll drop out of uni because it makes me miserable and I've been trying to make it work for two years but its just getting worse and worse. I made a wrong choice.

So now im faced with a dificult situation because the city where my parents are is one hour away from the place where Im mostly at , and where I spent my time while I was in uni. I dont know where to live. Im broke. Now I wont be getting any scholarship and in order to live on my own I'll have to work at least 3 times a week. I need to take some time off but I SIMPLY CANT AFFORD TO BE TIRED BECAUSE OF WORK AND NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT MY NEXT STEP IS. I need a time off for a year to explore all posibilities I have to change my course ( I already know my aproximate directions). I need a time off for my mental health. When I come home I feel financialy safer but isolated. I feel like I instantly fall into my parents subbmision of how they want me to live my life/how they think is best for me. I am also emotionaly very unstable, suicidal and overall miserable and lost and empty ( I've been taking antidepressants for few years now) .I am tired. At first they seem to understand but after a while they accuse me for being stubborn, whining, unproductive, most of all being negative.
 It is not my first time changing my course( I've already change my study programe once, so that makes it twice). So thats is why I simply cant stand being criticized any longer, I constantly have my own inner criticism unabling me expressing myself. I am stuck. I am broke and confused
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Should I stay home, isolate my self a bit and be financialy safe and think of solutions for myself??

Or should I try to find a job in the other city, maybe come home a bit more often to grab some food that my parents would otherwise have too much for themselves (we have a garden) and have time to breathe normally at least??"
784,TW: suicide—trying to help someone who won’t accept it...am i crazy??,"so theres this sub that I(17) went on a few months ago called r/kindvoice , and i thought the it had a really sweet message. you can post either as a helper or a person in need of a kind voice, and talk to others about problems. i decided to post as a helper, and offer my ears to anyone in need of some advice. one specific account reached out to me and stated that everyone hated him, he was severely depressed, and suspects he has aspergers. over the last few months, I’ve been talking with this person daily and trying to help him figure out how to make people stop “hating him”. the problem is that every time i would offer advice, he immediately shuts it down and gets upset that nothing helps. 

for example (if this is too long feel free to skip this part): he gets upset about his loneliness and believes that everyone hates him. i told him to try complimenting someone at his work, or to just strike up a small-talk conversation with a person at his school. he then immediately shuts the thought down and says that it doesn’t help because people will just ignore him. another example is his parents. he hates his parents and they hate him back, because of their past actions. he resents them for his childhood and they have a horrible relationship. i told him it might be a good idea to sit down with his parents and have a conversation about what can be done to fix their relationship, but he refuses. i then told him that if he wants to mend their relationship, try simply asking them how their day at work is when they get home today. he refused and said it wouldn’t help. 

at this point i’m completely lost. he tells me he will kill himself if things don’t get better, but he doesn’t make the effort to make them better. he tells me i’m the only person who cares, and i feel so stuck because i can’t get out of this situation. i know how hard depression can be on a person, and his aspergers seems to really affect his mentality on mental health. i really need advice on how to handle things. i’ve talked to my therapist, who believes i’m being manipulated into staying with this person, and i should leave the situation immediately. the problem is i really don’t want to. i feel such pity for this person, and i don’t know how to help if he continues to shut down everything i say. i’ve given him about 50 solutions to his various problems (try a dating app, work out, find a hobby, meditate, journal, find a support group, seek therapy, compliment someone, volunteer, etc.) but he turns down all of them. he tells me he wants to kill himself constantly and it’s really messing with my mental health. i don’t know where else to turn. any and all advice is welcome, please. 

tldr; i met someone on reddit who believes the world is out to get him. any and all advice i give him is shut down, and i don’t know how else to help him. i’m stuck in this situation and don’t know how to help."

I ask for help from some of my friends on how to do those things, and it seems that seemingly very easy concepts I'm unable to grasp which I could before. I just don't understand when someone explains those things to me in an attempt to help me and I don't want to bother them too much by repeatedly asking them the same question over and over.

791,"I’m chronically ill and stuck at home rather than being independent, and I cannot deal with the political beliefs...","I hope this is accepted in this sub.

I recently had seizures and other major health issues so I’m at my parents’ instead of my apartment (I’m 24). I can’t drive for six months because of the seizures, and I’ve been in and out of doctors appointments the past month. 

My parents were always a little conservative. I don’t even mind that. I wouldn’t call myself super left wing. And I hope I don’t sound stupid. My dad is a genuine narcissist (which doesn’t have to do with politics at all) so I feel super trapped anyway. But suddenly, the past few months, they’ve become super weird politically. As in, beyond just supporting Trump.

I’ve heard

My brother “black lives splatter!” *gun noises* parents laugh.

“If I were being harassed by a criminal I’d shoot them too”

“All these fucking Black people...”

And it’s constant. It’s all day. It’s all they want to talk about.

I’m sorry if it’s not that big of a deal but I am used to being independent and getting my time away from them. I don’t want to even go downstairs because my dad will egg on my eating disorder as always, shout about medical bills we have to pay because of me, and finally shout racist things at the TV.

I’m fine with different beliefs, but this goes beyond that. It’s extreme and disgusting. I feel almost betrayed. It’s a weird situation, my mom especially was never like this but I just feel a huge rift in my family."

I got angry because of it and because I was bullied and abused by him and other people earlier, and I kicked him and spat on him. To see more details, click my username and read some posts. I was depressed, hated my self, tried suicide once, was near suicide 2 times. It lasted 18 months. Guilt is still stopping me to work on things to achieve something, because I feel like criminal.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I wash my hands always. I feel like my house is contaminated. I was my hands many times etc. What should I do? How to get rid of guilt and OCD? Should I visit psychologist? I am afraid that they will report me to police. And I am ashamed of my guilt and OCD. I will look like a fool. Maybe I also have harm OCD."
794,Certain noises '' trigger '' me," Hi. A little backstory to my question : My dad used to be alcoholic for around 15 years and he would be really loud when he was drunk. Most of the time he would groan really loudly, walk loudly, close cabinets, doors loudly, etc. Those noises would keep me and my mom up at night and I obviously they made really scared, especially the groaning noises. 

But this year my dad quit drinking and he isn't as loud as he used to be, but from time to time he will cough or groan, or sneeze or make any other human noise, maybe close cabinet loud on accident or jokingly make some weird noise and those noises will freak me out, they would make me anxious it feels like my body goes into flight or fight mode and I don't know what to do. It's hard to explain how I feel and I can't find anything on internet, so I came here."
795,If I wanted to use an app or website for therapy would my parents have to be notified?,I (16f) consider myself the “normal” one of the family since I have pretty much no excuse to have depression or anything like that. But I want to talk to someone because I feel like I could benefit from talking to a mental health professional. I don’t plan on telling my parents because last time I did they didn’t do anything except ask if I was okay every chance they saw me. So the question I’m asking is if I seek a medical professional from an online service like an app or website if they would need to notify my parents since I’m a minor. I’m located in Florida.
796,Extreme Anxiety for no Reason,"Hi,

if you want to skip to the question, go to the fourth paragraph.

I've had an anxiety problem for as long as I can remember. I'm in my teens now and I'm visiting a psychiatrist, I've been visiting her for a few months now, but she's recently been on a vacation so I haven't seen her much overall. She's still on her vacation so I've decided to turn to the wonderful people of Reddit for help in the meantime. 

I don't know what my official diagnosis is, my parents haven't told me that, but on one of my papers I've seen the term ""acute psychotic disorder"" which sounds kind of scary. She once told me that what I'm experiencing is most likely OCD, but most symptoms have since disappeared or are being very well controlled by sertraline. When it comes to medication, I'm supposed to take 2 50mg sertraline pills a day, 1 0.25mg alprazolam pill if I need it that does next to nothing for even minor anxiety and even less so for panic attacks which is what I'm supposed to take it for, and one, 50mg, I believe, risperidone pill.

Now for my question. For a long time I've had severe bounds of anxiety for absolutely no apparent reason. It's been getting worse recently. I'm having a hard time explaining my symptoms. Those bounds of anxiety almost always last more than an hour. Sometimes I can distract myself with something else like TV or youtube, sometimes even with that good-for-nothing alprazolam pill, but sometimes I just can't do anything accept lay in bed and squirm uncomfortably. The best I can describe those occurrences is as extremely uncomfortable and followed by an unbearable feeling of dread. I feel like something bad's going to happen but for the life of me I can't tell what. I don't even know if this feeling would classify as anxiety, but that's the only thing I can begin to name it. I feel like I've just downed a whole pot of coffee. I feel like crawling out of my own skin. Perhaps the last comparison comes closest to what it feels like.

I'm not necessarily looking for advice, though I wouldn't mind some help. I'm more looking for people that get me, if there is any. I'd just like to know that I'm not alone in what I'm feeling. If you've got anything close to the feeling I so poorly described, please, I'd love to hear from you. Good luck and much love to everyone whatever you're struggling with. And thank you for sorting by new and coming by this post, and thank you so, so much in advance for responding.

P.S. Sorry for the possible grammar/spelling mistakes, I've done my best, but I'm not a native English speaker so there's 'bout to be something wrong."
797,Mindfulness tips?,"I’ve been suffering with depression, which led to introspection, which led to disturbing intrusive thoughts, depersonalization, rumination, overthinking, existentialism, anxiety, panic attacks, apathy, and emotional numbness to the point were I feel either nothing or anxiety, also I don’t feel empathetic or passionate anymore. I feel like I can’t relate to other people or their problems anymore. I feel like my daydreams are gone. Obsessive googling and even journaling has only made it worse, since I’m just writing the same stuff over and over again. My sense of humor feels gone (I feel like I’m faking it when I do feel like I laugh at stuff on instinct or even when I feel sad about my condition). I’ve looked at pictures of baby animals and felt nothing. I’ve seen those ASPCA ads and felt nothing. I’m trying to read my old comics but I can’t feel the emotions I’m used to feeling. I feel like I keep focusing on any violence or death, questioning what was I okay with an what wasn’t I okay with. I’ve [posted numerous times on this subreddit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-t56bZ3B-qWeA4_xIbDBlmfWytFdh1gD2aOSdqUK-xA/edit) before whenever I feel like I’m having anxiety, panic, or other issues. 

My therapist has said to just take it day by day, but it’s getting very difficult and I feel like I’m at my limit. I don’t know if I’m getting worse or if I’m in the same place. I feel like I’m telling my therapist the same stuff every day. I also just started a Prozac regimen yesterday, so hopefully that does something for me. 

I just want to know how to practice mindfulness so I can find my passions and joys again. I don’t want to give up on my dreams of becoming a naturalist and an environmentalist, I don’t want to stop playing videogames or enjoying movies or reading good stories or engaging with nature or playing DND or writing my comic or just screwing around with my friends."
798,Did getting formal diagnosis help you?,"I was previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been working to treat them for years now. However, I’ve recently had the feeling that it was due to other co-morbidities such as ADD. 

For those of you who have received a formal diagnosis across spectrum of mental health issues, did it help?"
799,parents know abt my suicidal ideation,i just went to a counselor to seek help bc ive been feelin suicidal lately and ny parents had to be informed abt it...and theyre so sad and i feel so bad about it i dont know how to deal with this..i feel a little better because im gettin the help i need but it's so hard seeing my parents like this and talking to them about it...i really dont know how to cope with this rn it just feels more stressful
800,Can you have “prescribing responsibility” transferred from a psychiatrist to a GP?,"I take an antidepressant and as-needed Xanax. I  do not want to see psychiatrists anymore b/c they’ve become completely unhelpful and thereby just an additional doctor’s bill to pay. I know GP’s can prescribe antidepressants and benzos, so I was wondering if I could just transfer the prescribing responsibility? 

Fingers crossed I can eventually dump the medication altogether."
801,Doesn’t anyone else just get this seasonal sadness during early September?,"Nothing really goes in, things happen that bring my mood down, and I’m at home working with no plans until later in the month. It’s been like this constantly for me for 3 years now and I’m just wondering if anyone have something similar? 
Maybe I‘m also slowly be getting more depressed since the end of Summer when my girlfriend changed and left me, and I started seeing my friends less because of COVID and my last year of high school starting.
I don’t know. I’m just stuck with work, my thoughts, and possible plans to brighten up my mood like finding places to go relax and experience nature"
802,"Where There’s Help, There’s Hope","Hey guys!

How is everyone today?

As I said yesterday, everyday this month, I will be posting advice, support, help or anything to do with suicide prevention all on this sub. 

**Prevention Of Suicide**

There are early signs that shows when someone is struggling physically or mentally. Suicide prevention starts by recognising the first warning signs and then taking them to account. If you believe that a family member or a friend is going down a tough road, there are many ways out there to help save a life. Most people with suicide thoughts will show warning signs weeks or days leading up to the action. The best way to prevent someone from taking their own life is to react to the warnings signs and respond if you do spot them. Some **MAJOR** signs can be the following: talking about suicide, talking about harming themselves, writing down worrying thoughts, talking or showing interests in guns, drugs and alcohol. One of the best ways of preventing these sort of actions from happening is to show that you care and love this particular person. You can begin by pointing out the alternatives, show the person that they can change the way they think and lastly, get a therapist, doctor or a psychologist involved. 

When it comes to suicidal thoughts, there are other ways of actions a person can do to show them. A more subtle, but equally dangerous way is showing signs of hopelessness and not caring anymore, pretty much giving out any sort of hope. Many studies have shown that showing signs of hopelessness is a very strong predictor of suicide. A person who is showing signs of hopelessness will start talking about feelings that are usually unbearable, feelings that are always bringing them down, feelings that make them unhappy. That they predict a very dark and bleak future and the express that there is nothing that they’re looking forward to or excited about. 

Dramatic mood swings is also another sign. If you see someone go from being incredibly happy to being verge of tears, you already know that there is a problem occurring. A person with suicidal thoughts will start to lose interests in the things they once loved, losing interests in day to day activities and show a big change in eating and sleeping. 

These are some signs that someone is going through suicidal thoughts. If you see someone experiencing one of these thoughts of actions, assure them that everything is going to be OK and that you’re there for them. Or, if YOU are experiencing them yourself, call a suicidal preventing hotline in your area/country. For the UK, The Samaritans are available 24/7, 7 days a week on 116 123.

803,I am always the last to leave anything is there a name for this?,"I've recently been thinking about a long running problem I have with leaving anything I am currently doing. I always have to stay for 5 minutes later than I can afford to, or be the last to leave a party. If I'm on discord with my friends I won't leave untill all of them have gone.
It's starting to cause problems with getting things done on time and I'm wondering if there is a name for this/ if it's an actual thing, and if so are there some solutions."
804,My father is sick :(,"He siad to my mom that the only reason he dont kill himself is that he has 3childs. Im afraid and sad!
He has depression anexiety and other mental problems. Can u please make me feel better?"
805,I am not good. How can I fix?,"What started as a coping mechanism for social isolation quickly mixed with my low self confidence, imposter syndrome and mixed at best control over my own faculties creating a lead weight that with my inability to grasp onto the logistics of it has created a web like maze of half baked logic that clogs up most of my conscious for the last five years.

 I want to tell people but I just sound so crazy. I know it makes no sense but the more I try and find what makes sense the less sense it makes. I am stuck perpetually rapping duct tape around the whole issue  because the moment I stop I will fall apart, but I shouldn't because that doesn't make any sense but it does, but it doesn't, etc.

I just want to exist without having to fight for a head that meets the acceptable level of clearness/functionality. Help, if you want to. No pressure.

TL;DR Brains fecked. Got a spanner? And a mechanic (preferably with more tools than a spanner)?"
806,My friend is mentally ill but their parents are the cause -- how to get diagnosis/treatment?,"Hi everyone, I recently learnt that a friend of mine has been suffering from depression-like symptoms, and on top of that, they have been hearing voices. I'm not sure what kind of illness they are suffering from, so it would be great to get a diagnosis and professional treatment. It sounds really serious and I hope to help them get treatment asap. The problem is we don't really have the money to get treatment on our own without their parents knowing. They are one of the reasons behind their mental illness in the first place, so we aren't sure if it's wise to tell them so that my friend can access the treatment she needs."

811,"My sister went to college and is not adjusting well. She's isolating herself, and I'm at a loss","My sister is 7 years younger than me. She went to college 7.5 hours from her family. She's always been in small schools (high school graduating class was 35 students; her college's entire undergraduate is less than 900 students). This, coupled with covid-preventative measures, limit the number of activities going on at the campus for her to meet others. She can also be very introverted.  
So now she's mentally and physically self isolating. She speaks when spoken to (unless it's her boyfriend). She's not participating in anything going on. She's trying to drive home every weekend. She's throwing a huge pity party for herself, and she's getting stuck in her own head. It's just this never ending shit show in her own head. She refuses any and all suggestions of things to do. She refuses to go to the on campus counselor. She's just stuck in this negative cycle, and while I can't be the one to break her out of that cycle (that has to be her), I'd like to try and help her if I can. 

Any suggestions? What has someone said to you that helped you in a bad situation? What have others felt in a similar situation to her and what did you do to overcome this negativity cycle?"
812,My friend needs inpatient care. Now.,"My friend, (20 M), is in desperate need of a 4-6 week inpatient program to help him with his depression. It is getting so bad. I’m constantly worried that he will harm himself. He is in love with me (20 F) but I do not have the same feelings for him and I am in a serious relationship . He is fixated upon me and can not cope with the fact that I will never be in love with him. It is becoming very hard to let him vent to me because he says things that are delusional and I feel like when I listen to his problems, I’m just enabling his manipulative nature and he starts getting the idea that I’m interested in him.

But I can’t stand the thought of ignoring him and then finding out that he’s killed him self. But there is really nothing I can do. I’ve begged him to find a new therapist. But I think his struggles are so intense that he needs inpatient therapy. In Louisiana, where we live, the mental health facilities (especially inpatient) are a joke. His dad is very wealthy and I think they would be more than happy to pay for a luxury inpatient program. Does anybody have any recommendations or positive experiences with any inpatient programs in the US? It doesn’t matter where. I just want him to get better. This is becoming a task that is far beyond me, and I feel as if he has given up. Please help me help him. I really do care about him, and I’ve accepted the fact that I have lost the ability to be friends with him. But above all else, I want him to be okay so badly. He is a smart boy and truly kind at heart. He deserves so much better.

We just need advice on facilities to look into."

814,Its normal?,"I dont know why but I’ve always had this mentality that     Nobody is truly happy at all? Everyone has their own battles but at the same time I would feel ashamed to admit that I’m struggling mentally as well? 

We are all putting up a facade making it seem that we’re living our best life (on social media, family gatherings, etc)

815,New diagnosis and no meds. Don’t know what to do,"Hey guys. I’m new to everything mental health related and new to this sub. I’m looking for some help or ideas on how I can get on the right meds. 

This week I was diagnosed with bipolar, ptsd, anxiety and borderline personality. I’m seeing a therapist (almost a year now) and I’m going threw testing the end of the month to finalize (?) my diagnosis. 

My therapist wants me to switch meds as mine don’t do anything and are making things worse. I’ve called my doctor, the psychology doctor doing my testing but both don’t prescribe!

I’ve been calling psychiatric offices that do medication management and prescribe but I have yet to get any call backs even after calling multiple times. 

I’m really at a loss and upset. My anxiety is going crazy, my sleep is nothing but nightmares and my mood is shit. I’m really hopeful someone here has an idea on what to do. I just need some help. Thanks."

Now that I have arrived and started virtual school, I feel hopeless, like I’m crumbling inside. I see my friends in France and see them in school and feel so lonely. I miss the university-like feeling of french school, I used to have a love for school and learning. I don’t have it anymore. It’s gone. I don’t know how to get it back and if I ever will. My mind is blurry and I wake up and go to sleep sad."
817,Is this normal?,[removed]
818,Please someone call me on discord to talk?,"First I’d like to say that I am not in a mental health crisis. I am diagnosed with a fair few of mental illness by several different psychiatrists I have seen through the years.

I need to make a friend that I can really connect with. I’m 30, female, and I don’t know how to explain myself other than that I’m awkward and sometimes bizarre.

I’m not looking for someone who does not believe or advocate for mental health or anyone who advocates for trying natural homeopathic remedies. I am going to stick with western medicine. 

My family is very difficult to deal with as they all want different things for me and they all expect different behavior from me and due to me trying to please other people for arguments sake, I cannot please everyone and I always end up getting hurt.

Things you should know if you decide to be my friend:

1. I can and will offer extremely helpful advice the majority of the time.

2. I don’t always get back to people I’m just meeting. This doesn’t mean I don’t want to talk. My family demands a lot of my time as does my potential full-time job.

3. I am willing to go very deep into hypothetical conversations and I wear people out. I’m “too much”. 

4. I always have a new problem. According to my friends and family there is always something new going on with me and unless I talk to you at least once a week, more like once a day though, you will always hear the worst part of what my problems consist of. 

5. I can be demanding and hypocritical because I do not always take my own advice even if I know it’s the better choice. 

6. I can be indecisive. 

7. I’m going through some sexuality questioning stuff (idc that I’m 30) and I need someone I can feel comfortable talking with about that. 

8. I want to be a part of your life even if it’s long distance. You can call me or message me whenever you like,  and I’m up for late night talks or overseas friends who live in different time zones. 

9. I don’t want to only be friends with disabled or only friends with “regular” people. I want a mix of both. Everyone brings something to the table. 

10. I want to be encouraged and challenged by our friendship. I also want to do the same for you.

Thank you for reading.

819,Girl I dated is showing troubling behavior,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I’m (36m) having an issue with a girl (31f) I briefly dated.

She seemed very clingy from the beginning and I ended our dating after about 2 weeks. However I was open to reminding friends and we spent some time together after.

Despite me making it very clear to her that we were not going to get into a relationship, she still was upset that I wasn’t showing her enough attention. Then, when at a dinner with some of my friends, she for the shock value, blurted out some private about our intimacy. That was not ok. When confronted she told me she’s on the autism spectrum and she says stupid stuff because of that.

More recently, she keeps on sending me angry texts telling me how she hates my friends, like she’s just looking for attention. Then two nights ago she showed up at my friend’s house unannounced and badmouthed me to my poor friend. Then yesterday she seemed normal and apologized. But then last night it was back to these awful texts.

Can anyone shine some light on what mental issue(s) she may be dealing with and how I can best deal with her? I want a peaceful resolution, but I don’t want to encourage vindictiveness from her. 

Thanks."
820,"I don’t have a sense of identity, I’m so confused please help.","Hi, I’m 20 years old and I’ve been through some stuff. I grew up having helicopter parents and having a goal to only make them happy and I had an abusive ex who would moderate what I could or shouldn’t do.

I’m really confused. I know I’m a shy girl who likes helping other people, but sometimes I feel so lost.

I feel like I need to put a label on myself. I like watching videos on how to make food and I like traditional values and being very feminine and kept to myself and a bit of a geek. But, when I think about that those descriptors sounds like I could label myself as someone who’s traditional.

Does that even make me happy? I really love philosophy, anime, video games, and cosplaying and when I think about these descriptors I feel that it falls under an edgy egirl. Or, I really love nature and self expression, especially in art, I don’t really like dressing in that type of way but when I think about it those things fall under a more hippie and free girl. 

What even am I? How can I figure myself out? I feel like I have to be some type of stereotype for some reason.. I don’t know. I feel like I don’t fit in sometimes."

It seems like there’s something always going on on my family though and I don’t want to add more stress on top of everything else this year but I don’t know when a better time would be and getting help isn’t a real option because my parents would think I’m exaggerating because I’ve never talked about this stuff with them (I’m 20 f) I relapsed in SH yesterday also I feel so alone

825,How do i stop stalking this person I hate on social media?,"Sorry if this is long but I thank anyone who reads this. 

Just over 3 years ago, I got in a massive fight with housemates (reason for the fight is irrelevant, it was honestly just fucking stupid and unnecessary 19 year old drama), who used to be my best friends. One of them in particular said verbally abusive things to me, mocked me, called me a baby, and undermined my mental health issues (at the time I was severely depressed, cutting, and suicidal), basically calling me a pussy and saying my problems don’t matter. She even went as far as to laugh at me in my face as I was bawling my eyes out on the floor. The way she acted was completely fucked up and I don’t even understand how somebody could say such things to someone who was supposed to be one of their closest friends. Obviously, after this instance, I cut ties with her and have never spoken to her since. 

However, I can’t help myself but to look at her instagram every once in a while. Long story short, I moved on with my life and my depression ended up worsening, until I finally cracked and got diagnosed with bipolar. I had to drop out of school for a bit which put me really behind for my undergraduate degree, I’ve had a plethora of failed and toxic relationships (both romantic and platonic), and I’ve lost a lot of confidence in the process. I haven’t really done anything special like travelling or working on my career. 

She, on the other hand, seems to have gotten more confident, I hate to admit it but she looks a lot prettier than she used to. She seems to be in a healthy relationship, travels a lot, and is extremely successful with her degree and internships. She’s graduated, and got accepted to a top medical school with very low acceptance rates. 

I hate that I can’t stop comparing myself to this vile person. I hate that I still hate her. I hate that I feel terrible about myself in comparison to her. I hate that I care so much. I hate that sometimes I feel slightly fulfilled, and then I can’t help myself but look at her social media... and then suddenly, I feel like a failure. 

I don’t know how I can get over the anger. Every time I look at her IG, I feel like dying and I get jealous. It’s been over three years, and I still feel so pissed. I just thought that she’s a terrible person, so terrible things would happen to her. But it seems like her life is going amazing. How do I stop obsessing over this person from my past? I literally have nothing to do with her and it pains me that she’s doing so well and has such a good life in comparison to me. I know I should be over it but I literally can’t stop my unhealthy habits, and I can’t stop feeling terrible about myself."
826,I need help with laziness and remembering things,"I have severe anxiety and it causes me to be forgetful. I buy bullet journals because I find comfort in it but then I stop because I get lazy or just forget. I buy planners then stop because I get lazy or forget to write things down and I forget to look at it. I struggle with homework deadlines because I'm distracted easily and I'm also lazy and still forget to look at planners I buy. I also buy really cute ones so that it's something I like. I started up again with my '19/'20 planner but I'm not sure how long this will last again.

I really need suggestions for this school year on how to be more organized and what will help me to remember things or remember to check my planner?

832,Is it possible that I might have PTSD?,"Greetings everyone :)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel incredibly guilty by even considering the possibility of having PTSD, but I've struggled a lot in the last few years, without really understanding why. When Google brought up PTSD, I didn't even click the links; doing so, suggesting that I might have that disorder from an experience that would have been, for someone else, rough but not traumatising (more details in the next paragraphs), would have been plainly disrespectful towards war veterans or sexual assault survivors, to cite a few.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I spent those years believing that I was just a mess. And I still do, to be honest; but a few days ago, someone mentioned PTSD to me, as a possible explanation for (some of) my struggles. I am going to talk about it to my psychiatrist in a week when I see her, but until then, I thought it would be interesting to learn from other sources (and, to be honest, I don't think I would be able to go a whole week in such a level of uncertainty).

&amp;#x200B;

First, I think I should mention the experience. Note that I'm fully aware that the situation is far less violent or traumatising than what PTSD sufferers usually go through - and, once again, I feel guilty just mentioning it. But I've always been severely hypersensitive, terrified of being alone and done everything I could to avoid that, and have always needed some degree of certainty about my future (at least for the following 4-5 years), and, as you will see, all of these were strongly threatened back then.

I'll try to give you the tl;dr since this post is already getting long. After the end of high school, I went to another city where I knew no one in order to continue my studies, which were very selective and competitive. I didn't want to be in a competitive environment, but it was the ""usual studies"" for people with a similar profile, so I went there. After two or three years of intensive studies, students took very hard exams that lasted 3 or 4 weeks total, and whose results determined what school they got into. And, to do what I wanted to do (research), there was only one school that was ""fit"". Problem is, it was one of the hardest to get, so I asked my first year teacher to help me prepare for it. He said something like ""Aaaah, I'm not sure you can do it, we'll have to wait and see"".

At the start of the second year, I asked my teachers again, who basically told me that there was no chance - which, of course, destroyed me. I tried to pick myself up, thinking that I'd show them that I could. I started the year with excellent results, so I went to them and asked them again. What they told me was that I had absolutely no chance, that I should give up, and other very hurtful things. Around the same time, my first long-term girlfriend left me, and I lost my then-best friend. All teachers, and other students, started criticizing me behind my back, saying that I was too pretentious to accept my limits, that I thought I was better than everyone else, etc., which hurt me deeply. Once again, I was broken.

I basically had no strength left, at all. I barely listened in class, didn't do any homework, etc. I managed to work one afternoon every week, but that was it. At the end of the year, the exams came, and, long story short, I didn't get the school I wanted, but was very close to it - which was a great result for someone coming from this ""preparation school"". So I asked my teachers if I could do a third year to try again (which was a common practice), and they refused. Once again, I was broken. 

A friend convinced me to send my resume to other ""preparation schools"", hoping that some of them won't be as stubborn as the one I was in. Almost all of them refused, but one accepted - it was even further away (on the other side of the country), and very well rated, so it would be veeery hard for me to even follow along there, but I had to try. So I went. That year was incredibly stressful and tough, but I got along with the teachers and students well, so it wasn't as bad as the one before it.

After 3 more weeks of very intense exams, I ended up getting the school I wanted - which was great, but I was left with this looming sense of anxiety, pain and solitude that I have had since.

These three years played on all of my worst pressure points. My hypersensitivity - people criticizing me, explicitly or behind my back, my girlfriend leaving me, losing friends. My fear of loneliness - I went from living with my parents to being alone in another city... I guess my gf leaving me also counts in that category. My fear of unplanned future - as long as I hadn't taken the exams, I couldn't know what I would do, where I would be, in the following years, or the rest of my life. Also, I'm terrible at handling stress as a whole, and all the obligations I had, the stress of the upcoming exams (that teachers constantly reminded us of), and the terror of actually going through those 3 weeks, literally froze me in place at times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I think I should go over the symptoms I'm experiencing. I was about to say that I feel like I'm constantly reliving those years, but it's rather that I never stopped living it. That means constant dreams about it (I can't say whether it's \*every\* night or not, since I don't remember my dreams every night, but I can say it's very frequent, at least every other night). And, when I'm not dreaming about the experience, my dreams involve the exact same kind of stress, pain, and loneliness involved in it. I feel like nobody I meet ""knows"", that no matter how hard I try, I can never connect with people because of it. I don't think I'm suffering from insomnia (possibly because my chronic depression makes me constantly tired? I'm not sure). I don't think I have ever been able to properly focus since then, including in my following studies. I have a lot more symptoms, but the others might be connected with some other mental illnesses, so I would rather end here, with the symptoms I think are most likely linked to... whatever this is.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm deeply sorry if anyone with PTSD feels offended by my post... Like I mentioned, I feel awful just writing it (I have been procrastinating it for days now). But I'm kind of lost, and I could use any lead you guys might have.

&amp;#x200B;

833,I hate myself and I don't know what to do.,"I hate myself. I hate myself so much that it ruins everything I try to do. I feel like I can't move forward because I'm so convinced that I'm a piece of shit who deserves nothing. Do you know what I mean? And this type of thinking is so ingrained in me that I can't escape it. It just feels like it's in my nature. I've accepted that I'm just one of those people who isn't cut out for life. And how am I supposed to argue with that? The evidence is so overwhelmingly stacked against me. I have not progressed as a human being one millimeter since I was in middle school. And now, I'm lying in my bed, and I just wish I didn't exist. I wish I didn't have to do or say or think or feel anything. And there's a part of me, there's this tiny little part of my that doesn't want to feel this way. But he's so pathetically tiny and weak that it's laughable.

Anyway, I don't know what else to say. It's my birthday, by the way. I'm 19. Woohoo."
834,"Advice for not comparing yourself to others, especially through social media?","How do you deal with social media? It literally makes me feel shit about my life. I tend to especially stalk people who have wronged me in the past, and then feel shit about how amazingly well they’re doing compared to me. I haven’t had the easiest time in life so far (suffered from severe elongated depressive episodes, got diagnosed w bipolar, struggle in school as a result), I’m not satisfied with where I’m at in life right now - I thought I’d be more accomplished at this age. I know if I maybe felt better about myself, then social media wouldn’t bug me so much. But sometimes I do feel good about myself, then I’ll stalk people I hate, then realize how shit my life is and has been compared to them. How do I stop this lol"
835,I feel like I'm failing my boyfriend by not taking care of myself.,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. He knows about my mental health issues, which obviously COVID has not been helping with. My boyfriend, meanwhile, has decided to take this as an opportunity to start working out and taking his health more seriously, and he really, REALLY wants me to do it too. He wants me to track calories, exercise regularly, and in general take better care of myself. And like, that's great. I appreciate how much he cares. But when that pressure is there, all it does is make me feel worse when I fail.

I have tried to explain to him that I cannot find the motivation to do this with him. That I support him on his journey, and that I am trying to want to join him, but that I just can't right now. He says, ""is my concern for you not enough?"" And I just can't find a way to explain to him that it isn't without him feeling dejected. I just don't care about myself enough to put energy into my health.

I want to want to be healthy. I want to want to be happy. But he wants me to move so fast, and I literally just got back into therapy a month ago. That was a huge, difficult step, and I don’t think he understands that these ""few little changes"" for him are big changes for me.

I feel like I'm failing him. He told me part of his motivation for him to stay healthy and active is to be with me for as long as possible. And I don’t deserve that when I can't do the same for him.

I just wish he could understand."
836,My mind feels like it's against me.,"My mind feels like its against me, when my mind it quiet, like when I'm trying to sleep, itsuddenly wakes up, in a bad way. I go down these ""thought trails"" they start off light then end up getting darker and darker until it brings me to tears(I never cry), the end of the ""thought trails"" is usually my dogs or family dying in horrible ways, I cannot stop these thoughts, I cannot control it. It actually feels like my mind is against me. What is going on? Is this normal for a 13 year old male? Please help, I am willing to answer suitable questions, just please help. Does this have a name?"
837,I am 100% convinced my life is not worth living and that nothing is going to get any better...,"2020 has definitely been the worst year of my life and I am not coping well at all. I have had to deal with a lot of issues on my own and now I just feel like giving up and disappearing off the face of the earth because I am convinced nothing is going to get any better and I don't have the energy to fight anymore. 

\- There is a chance that I have PTSD because of an incident that happened in January but I still haven't been diagnosed. I barely go out of the house, I always jump out of my own skin at any unexpected noise, I always on high alert even when I'm at home.

\- My grandfather passed away earlier this year (I hadn't seen him since I was very young), none of my father's side of the family even bothered to tell me so I had to make the difficult decision to cut them out of my life. My mother told me none of them ever bothered with me throughout my whole life which is true because none of them have ever been interested in me going to visit them.

\- I don't have any friends at all. Sounds generic I know but I am certain I really don't. I have always felt like I never had any real friends, that I didn't fit in anywhere, that I have never been apart of anybody's social circle. I was always the last to know about everything, left out of social gatherings and whenever I'd have something to say, I would get ignored. Back when I found out my grandfather died, nobody in my friendship group said a thing so I decided to leave them to it. Lockdown has even confirmed that I have no friends. I barely received any messages from anybody asking me if I'm ok or how I'm coping. I only received messages from about four people but they were people that I wasn't particularly close with and the conversations just felt like they weren't going to last very long. I deleted all of my social media (Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram) because all I was doing was scrolling through all three and the only notifications I would get were people going live and adding to their stories, I didn't even bother to tell anybody because nobody would give a shit.

\- My mental health is all over the place. I also suffer from depression and anxiety. Almost every day, I am depressed. Today was my second breakdown in a row. Every day is always the same: I wake up, be a depressed all day with no energy to do anything whatsoever, go upstairs, stay in my room and so on. I am meant to be getting help and support from an organisation called Healthy Minds but I am not happy with them at all, I don't think they are helping at all and I have been on-and-off with them at least three times now. I feel like I am going around in circles with everything and nothing is changing. I am always irritated and I'm starting to have urges to smash everything in sight. I am frightened that one day that I will go mad and it will be too late. I know that I have changed as a person and I hate it. I just don't know what to do anymore.  I have had thoughts of ending my life and going missing so many times this year. All I ever wanted in life was to be happy and have a good life but you can't always get what you want..."
838,Whats the most annoying part of my pure ocd?,"Its not being able to have a happy moment and immediately questioning the feeling and just complete loss of identity confusion about how i'm actually feeling constantly so hyper aware that i cant separate my actual reality with the false one. Loss of desire or any attraction making life seem much more like a chore than an experience that I should be loving. Having a feeling like a cant tell the difference between what i hold most dear and my biggest fear. Having everything that I held so high up come tumbling down. It seems like the best part of the day is waking up and that 10 seconds of not having the constant intrusive thoughts until i realise what happened and it starts all over once again. The depressive moods states that make the world seem so grey or the high anxiety constantly keeping you from enjoying whats happening in front of you feeling that you don't deserve this because you are a horrible monster. It just feels like that the once happy guy and becoming a good person living a fulfilled life just didn't seem as exciting anymore. Feeling loved felt unwarranted because I didn't feel like i deserved it anymore. I don't deserve friends i am the worst person on this planet. Its the doubt that I actually I don't have OCD and that iv'e always been in denial about it my whole life without knowing it that everything iv'e ever done is one big lie and i'm hiding it behind a mental illness just to be in more denial. It just feels like Ive forgoten how to love and how to fall in love and my worst nightmare is coming to life.

Would I go back and Change it? Absolutely not It has made me a much stronger person and I love myself a bit more i'm more intelligent about things i thought i could never learn Iv'e found people who have the same struggles I do and having that little bit of hope that I can become a bigger person by the end of it. I'm  more empathetic and compassionate then ever before become even closer to my friends and having such a good support network and knowing that one day this shall haunt me no more it does not define me anymore I can see through your lies no matter how convincing you may seem you shall not overcome me anymore I am more than my past and the past will always behind me. I am not what my OCD says I am no matter how loud it gets I know its all lies now you have no power over my happiness anymore you cant control me anymore I wont listen to what you tell me.

I have been getting better slowly and have had very good progress made to helping me heal and get on with life but I just felt i needed to type this out because i wanted to express my emotions more as it makes me feel better. Not looking for any reassurance all my homies despise negative coping mechanism which lead to worsen the mental state"
839,What would I call it?,"   I constantly twitch(?) and shake my hands. Sometimes my head twitches(?) along with my hands. It usually happens when I’m watching my favorite YouTubers or listening to my favorite music. 
   This has been happening for a while and I never want to put a label on it cause I don’t want to be offensive to anyone. 

   What exactly would I call that?"
840,Why am I like this,"So basically some years back I was at the school vaccinations. After a few hours of panic attacks the nurses gave up on trying and I got chewed out on the way home from school by my mom. The next year the same thing happened. About a year later I went to see a therapist and they helped a bit but there was something my parents had to do which they wouldn't.

So anyway these days whenever anyone talks about vaccinations and stuff I get emotional. The context depends on how emotional I get, but it's mostly stuff about consequences of not getting vaccinated or directly talking about getting vaccinated. At least I'm a bit better than a few years ago, when just thinking about it could leave me in tears for hours. There was even this one time when I was looking at my fountain pen and thought how it looks slightly like a needle, then the thoughts came rolling in.

I just wish I wasn't such a weak fragile emotional basket case. I'll probably die of something preventable because of my inability to keep my emotions in check."
841,Can somebody quickly help me? I feel pain all over my body and I have an exam tomorrow,"I kind of hate the career I started studying and I was going to change it but I still have to finish a few things before I start with the next year properly. Tomorrow I have an exam and I've found it impossible to study. I had this ""pain"" all over my body every time I tried, specially in the chest, feel tired without wanting to sleep, can't concentrate properly, can't breath properly... I don't know, I want to go back to studying, but these feelings are overwhelming right now.

How do I calm down? I need to but I can't, I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. Every minute it gets worse. I don't know what to do. Any help would be great, thanks."
842,i wish i had someone to help me,"everyday my mental health gets worse, i cant get help for it. i ask my mum for therapy, she finds a way to refuse and says just “dont worry” like cmon bruh, just please man. my school wont be able to help, i et mental breakdowns everyday, i need medical help with my mental health according to people and i cant get it. I am goong to beat my mum up if it doesnt get better and put the blame on her."
843,I’m overwhelmed exhausted and scared of myself,"I know that I’m not in this battle alone; 
Still I got up today and my list was ‘clean up my room at my parents, clean a couple animal cages, hot the grocery store, finish cleaning out the cat carriers for the bug bomb this weekend’ 

It all seemed attainable even on low sleep,

Got where I needed to be- and found out the house needs to be clean entirely by Monday. 

Clean all animal cages, do dishes, sweep, vacuum, seal upstairs for bug bomb, clean cat carriers, hit grocery store, find alternate organization in livingroom to accommodate animals, get a nanny cam, it goes on and on and I feel useless.


Mentally I am going “I can’t finish so why bother” I wanna cry, I wanna scream, and I kind of want to hurt myself. I won’t, but I want to."
844,Please read this is my back story,
845,Communication problems...,"Well, long story short, I'm an introvert but I don't avoid interacting with people as a hardcore introvert would do, it's just that, usually if I don't engage in a non-stopping conversation, with lots of back and forth, and lots of opinions, in a group or just one person, people think I'm upset or didn't enjoy interacting with them so much, THAT, upsets me. I rather be aware of my surroundings than in the conversation, as I live in a pretty dangerous city. As time passes I'm starting to feel more un-connected to people, they make me feel like I have a condition you know, is there a condition for this? Apart from being an introvert.

849,How do you tell your doctor that you need anti-anxiety medication without looking like drug seeking behavior?,I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life… Lately things have been very hard financially but I have started a new job. Starting a new job is extremely stressful and it is making me my worst self. I have always been adamant that I will handle my mental health issues on my own but I finally feel like I can’t anymore. I cannot keep feeling like this..:the anxiety is getting worse which is making me angry which is making me depressed. It’s this whole snowball pattern and it gets worse and more dramatic as the days go on. I don’t know what to do. Unfortunately my benefits don’t kick in for another 60 something days so there’s nothing I can do about it immediately. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or does anyone have any good advice? I seriously need help and I don’t know what to do.
850,Today was the best bad day,"I just had a bad day. However, it’s been a while since I’ve had a “normal” bad day, unrelated to mental illness. 

I’m in remission and it feels so good to have a “ this sucks, lemme cry a bit to feel better” kinda day instead of “this hurts so much I’m going numb” kinda day. Getting better is so worth it (humm.... I’ve also had a TON of good days I promise)"
851,I am considering transmaxxing,[removed]
852,Not sure what’s going on and need help...,"Been going through depression and anxiety for nearly two years now and am finding myself always trying to hold onto past thoughts and regrets. However, i realized I’ve distracted myself so much that I’ve forgotten certain things that used to hurt me so I continuously try to seek that out too; like literally having to stop and think oh that hurt me let me think about it because I forgot it hurt me. I’m not sure if this is what moving on is or if it’s a distraction. Maybe one reason I hold onto things is because I feel that if I let it go, it would be like the past didn’t exist and it was all for nothing. I feel there’s a lot unresolved but I’ve distracted myself for so long that I don’t know how to handle anything. 

I’m scared about this apathy of sorts. I don’t care for anything anymore that much apart from random breakdowns where I do care and feel sad. For instance , I haven’t really understood the concept of a pandemic virus going on because I’ve been in my own bubble of depressed distraction. It feels like I’m going crazy sometimes. There’s probably a lot more I wanted to say but hopefully this string of sentences will do for now...

Can anyone relate or recognise the actual problem or know of any solutions?"
853,"Hi all, I (F37) am feeling confused today. I recently had surgery (Monday) in an intimate area after coming from a sexually abusive relationship.","I had surgery Monday in my intimate areas... and I requested only female nurses around me while I was out, so I’m not panicking about this I know, I was continually raped by my ex husband while asleep on my meds over the course of 15 years, creating physical issues... 
well, this surgery might have exacerbated one of these physical issues and now I’m emotionally regressing very quickly. 

I’m close to crying often, disassociating, not wanting to communicate, be around people, I want to sleep and be alone, I find I’m very quick to rage. I want to scream and hit and yell loudly. 

I do have PTSD from what he’s done, but I felt I’d covered my bases for this surgery, and now I’m not sure I have and mentally I am floundering.

I’m not sure if I write for support, advice or just to speak."
854,Potentially the worst mental health crisis of my life,"I don't even know if I have the energy to type, today I got so lethargic later on in the day that now I am just in bed, feeling broken and helpless.   I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.   Being oblivious to the waking world now feels more inviting than having to deal with reality.  

I met a guy last year at a former job.   It was instant chemistry.  I just wanted to hang out with him all the time--  I thought his personality was so infectious and charming.   

Although I ignored the red flags for the most part.  That is where I will take accountability for being an utter idiot.   When a week past, he asked for my number.   He asked me on a date to a renn faire.   I was so happy even though he was rushing so much.   He was even picking out the wedding colors and what /he/ would want, and that was maybe within the first few days of dating...   I do remember being sick though shortly after we started dating and how I developed my first cold sore on my lip (he admitted later he knew he gets them and was sorry for not telling me.)

Two months later, he convinces me to find an apartment with him.  We both sign a lease together.   Yes, this is where my stupidity multiplies by 100.   

Shortly after moving in, and even I introducing him to my family (who also can be toxic), the BF then shifted, changed.   His personality was no longer so inviting or infectious.   He was suddenly getting stressed that I wasn't working immediately after moving in.  Even though I spent years bring on disability income, I applied to at least 9 jobs before finally getting one in retail.  

It was so hard to adjust to working for me again.   And that honeymoon phase died after only 3 months.   I should of known this relationship wasn't going to last.  

Overtime, he began to blame me constantly for things.  And then I started watching him lying, constantly, and even though I would catch him, he would never admit to it or acknowledge it.   The lies never stopped.   

I almost jumped off the apartment balcony because of a lie he was telling to my face, ""You are not paying rent "".  He said it over and over, even though I /was/.   He messed do much with my head.  Still does.  

The trust was breaking.  He wanted to be the one to talk and I couldn't interject or give feedback without him saying, ""No, I am not done"" or ""No, no, we are not talking about that"" or something to that effect.  

My brother then committed suicide in August.   I never knew how hard this grief would hot me.   My BF always went on about grieving for his father or other people and friends in his life he lost, but when I was in grief..   While he was initially supportive and holding me...  One day I take a nap and wake up to find his mother talked him out of not going with me to the funeral.   

I was so angry.  Tbh, my anger got a lot worse as our relationship even progressed.   Even before my brother died.   My BF had always held that against me.   Tbh, we both had brought up things in the past that had hurt each other, but I felt like that became more important to him to do than to try to help me through my anger.   

I go to the funeral on my own.   My BF had 2 guy friends over the night before of my brother's funeral and I became do upset when it got to be past 11pm at night and the guys night wasn't ending.   He couldn't even take 10 minutes to talk to me.   I had to beg him to call.     He did.   He later revealed he apparently let his friend listen in on our phone conversation.  

The thing is, the BF's ego became more profound, or maybe it started to be harder to ignore.   

The night our relationship essentially ended was about a week ago.   I caught him texting someone at nearly midnight.  My anxiety and insecurity got to me, yes...  And I asked who he was texting.  He said it was work.  I later found out by looking at his texts that it was a female mutual friend of ours.  I didn't really read it, but at the time it seemed like nothing to warrant lying about.   But then I stand by the door to the bathroom as he was showering...  He didn't see me there.  And he just mutters under his breath, ""I'll just have her locked in a psychiatric ward."" 

I broke.  I said, ""I can hear you "".  I ran off to a park, in the dark, at 1:30am.   I sat on a swing and was trying to text a friend who was still up.   I didn't want to go back.  

I didn't.  I went to a Crisis Center that morning.  I have called them a number of times since.  I have spoken with 3 crisis hotline volunteers.  All within a week.   

Yesterday, I found out that my BF was waiting for me to pay my portion of rent and then he wants me released from the lease.   I never went through this before and dealt with a bad anxiety attack.   

Honestly, the anxiety attacks haven't stopped.   I am feeling light headed and my chest hurts.   I don't really eat anymore.  I have no appetite most of the time.  

I don't want to go to work tomorrow, but I do have to keep working.   I need money to get out of this psychologically abusive situation.   I even had cut my family out of my life the other day, I just don't want to hear from them.   They just continue to let me down and hurt me too.   

I want to give up.  I do actually do sometimes want to join my brother, but then I realize that I need to outlive my parents and try to give this pathetic life of mine another chance.  

I am too tired to type anymore."
855,How to get help in the time of Covid,"I am not sure that I am in a great place, mentally right now, and I think I need help. But, I am at home with my wife and elementary school children (everyone is working or going to school from home) and privacy is basically non-existent right now.

I don't know much about how finding a therapist works, but I don't think many people here are doing in person sessions and even if they were getting out of the house is difficult (managing two young kids doing school online and also trying to work pretty much requires both of us all the time). I know that online sessions exist, but I can see doing a conversation with a therapist about how much anxiety and depression I am feeling dealing with all of this stress that involves my family while there are in the room listening to me.

Is there any other type of resource? I feel like therapy via email feels like a weird concept, but maybe it exists? I just know that I am super overwhelmed with life right now and I need help."
856,"Hello I need help because idk what to do! 19 M Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe",
857,Any ideas what I should do?,"I’m supposed to hangout with a girl I’ve been chilling with later, but whenever I hangout with her I always get stressed out like fuck, and don’t do well. Sometimes I end up happy but most of the time I get stressed out especially when she wants to do stuff. She thinks highly of me but has no idea of my problems nor do I think I can tell her. She’s already where we’re supposed to meet and I told her I’m on my way but I really just need to figure it out. Ik when I get the chance when I’m with her I’ll just hit my head and the headache will take my mind off things."
858,Finally did a meditation... now I feel... weird?,"I finally did an actual meditation with my therapist, something I wish I did before I went down that whole mental health/introspective rabbit hole. We also talked about a bunch of Buddhist meditation stuff, and about letting go. 

I do feel calmer and maybe a bit more present, but now my mind is... blank. Like my intrusive thoughts are gone, but my emotions and connection also don’t feel right. I can feel emotions inwards, but not about things. I feel like my passion for science is still gone. Instead of the happy daydreams I usually get, my mind is now empty. It feels like the only thoughts I can conjure are intrusive ones. I don’t want this, I never wanted this. I want my emotions and passions back. I want to feel that chaotic energy with the world. I want to get engrossed in a good story, but I forgot how to. I forgot how to be passionate. I haven’t felt this disconnected from my passion for science in my life. I don’t feel like I can feel anger at people who deserve it, I don’t feel like I can connect with others still. I just feel like I’m... calm. Calm but empty. I wish I did these meditations BEFORE I started questioning myself and which things were somehow related to my intrusive thoughts. I want to feel emotional. But I feel... nothingness. I don’t feel bad, but I don’t feel good either. I feel like I emptied my mind, but now I’m dissociated with an empty mind. Everything feels like it happened so long ago, like it’s all a distant memory. Like it was never real. I want to feel with the same intensity that I did before. I want love, happiness, sadness, anger, passion, excitement, empathy, even fear. I feel like I’m gone. Gone and calm about it. Or maybe I am panicking again. I’m afraid I’ve given up everything. I can’t feel my passions or my joys. I can’t relate to my comics, I cant relate to real people. I can’t even relate to animals anymore. 

...as I was writing this, the anxiety came back. But it didn’t feel as strong. I feel like I’m sad about being stuck in my own head. I feel afraid of intrusive thoughts latched onto my passions. I just want to be the guy I was 2 months ago. The guy from June. I was 21 for about a month and felt like I was grounded in reality. I had passions, dreams, hopes, aspirations, I had anger and sorrow and joy. I could appreciate stories and deeply analyze them. I analyzed all sorts of things. I was often so deep into some crazy wonderful thoughts, that I wouldn’t notice the intrusive stuff. Now I feel nothing. I let an intrusive thought take hold of me and ruin EVERYTHING. I feel like seeking therapy is all I have now. I’m probably condemned to this life of unfeeling now. This life where I can’t think or feel. I’m numb... sure I can think ABOUT things, but it’s... different. I don’t know if I like this. It’s so much quieter than my usual hectic mind. But I appreciated my hectic mind. Often lost in thought, always full of some sort of emotion. Even my anxiety wasn’t really a problem. Worrying about real life stuff: my grades, my family, my friends, animals, my future, my health. I have this cold buzzy feeling on the back of my head. I want to just feel normal. Not numb, not apathetic, not emotionless, not like I’m some sort of sociopath, I want to be ME. My passion for science, games, my friends, my art. I don’t feel any of it. I fee like I let too much go. I feel like I’ll NEVER be myself again."

861,I don’t think he gets it,"TW: calorie counting, gaslighting 

I recently told my dad that I had an eating disorder in high school, and that him using an app to keep track of his calories was really triggering back then. I don’t mind that he tracks everything, but when he says things like “I’m 200 calories over today” it makes me feel like shit and honestly I’m starting to relapse because I’m constantly reminded of counting calories. I know he doesn’t mean anything by it, and he doesn’t understand what it’s doing but it hurts a bit to know that I explained it and it’s still coming up. 

On another note, he used to say “you’re a healthy person” or “this room is what a healthy teen’s room looks like” and now anytime I feel depressed or panic-y in anyway, I feel like I must be faking it. And maybe that’s a whole other issue and it’s not gaslighting but I think about those phrases constantly. 

I don’t know. Thanks for reading I guess, maybe you’ve felt this as well?"

my parents are divorced, i live with my dad but he comes home like once 2-3 months and he stays for like  2 weeks and i became so lonely bc i live in the countryside and i dont have kids my age and all my friends are in the nearest town that i cant go when i want bc we dont have busses exept the one for highschool... so i started feeling lonelier and lonelier not only bc of friends but i also didnt have any parent around me and only my grandma and shes always making me feel like i have to do great things like get good grades bc she has to tell people how well she rased me, she just want to impress  people and she always says to me that if she werent there to push me to learn i would never be able to get good grades (she didnt even go to highschool and i am in highschool) and that makes me to not study. so im getting bad greades and live in a country with no future so i need good grades so i can leave. and i actually tried to leave, to go to my mom that always told me that im distanced from reality and that i dont live a normal life and i didnt belive her cuz i was 8. but she was right cuz when i told my dad i wanna move with her he didnt let me and told me if i move i should stop loving him bc he waste his time rasing me only for me to go to my mom. that destroyed me so bad. he was so ready to give up on me only because i chosen to put myself first cuz i felt so lonely. so basically every good memory with him from the past became bad bc for him it could turn so easily into a waste of time. he told me i can leave... but that was just a lie bc he didnt and i was so sure that i was going to leave that i couldn't imagine myself here anymore and i could feel like i was already leaving... but that didnt happened and its so hard for me to process all of this and i also feel like all the ""love"" my dads side gave me was fake so ""i love you"" became just a lie, when someone tells me they love me i cant belive it anymore, and currently im in a related and the person im dating says to me ""i love you"" multiple times a day and i get mad cuz i dont trust it and i would tell them that but i dont wanna hurt them. i also feel like life has lost meaning, and that i just keep failing i cant get myself to actually get things done and i feel so guilty for it cuz i know imma regret it. all these thing just eat me alive. it somewhat feels like i can feel only anger and i end up saying things i regret.
i sometimes wish i didnt see that my life is better only when im with my mom, i wish i kept ignoring her and now im stuck here feeling lost and not seeing meaning in anything cuz i feel hopeless here and unloved and loney. i just wished to live with both of my parents like most my friends do, and i feel so mad at myself for being so jealous of them."
865,Realized my mental health is worse than I thought,"I've always accepted my anxiety with secondary depression. But I suppose, thanks to the amount of time we have at home to ruminate on things, I'm realizing that my mental health problems are a lot more severe than I thought they were. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, but its frustrating looking back and realizing that most obstacles I've experienced have been because of my anxiety and the issues it lends.

I'm realizing now that it wasn't normal to be paralyzed with fear, crying myself to sleep in high school because of my fear that I would choose the wrong degree in university and subsequently fail, find no job, and become homeless. Or that not everyone gets so easily overwhelmed that they just want to sleep, with typical life things like driving or having to apply for a job or finishing an assignment. Or how I can't be on instagram because my anxiety races so high. 

My medication works, and I feel so much better than when I'm not on it, but man, is it upsetting that even with medication I still need to deal with my anxiety and attempt to function like a neurotypical human being. I still get tired easily, I still have problems with focus and concentration, I still get caught in spiralling thoughts really easily. All this and more on top of the usual struggles any person goes through. I go to therapy and am so much better but...feels like at the end of the day I am still so much more behind compared to other people my age.

And, I'm doing the best I have been doing in a long time - I've gone back to school for a degree in something I love, and am creating really useful connections in the industry I will be entering, my relationship with my partner is continuously improving and becoming even more wonderful, my friends are wonderful. But its so frustrating knowing that all of this could have been even better if I just DIDN'T have my anxiety. I'm smart, I have great ideas, I work hard, I am well-liked by those around me. BUT MY MENTAL HEALTH!!!! It's like I'm living life always going 2 steps forward, 1 step back, and yeah I guess I am moving forward, but at a really, really slow pace compared to my same aged peers. Things wouldn't have happened so late for me, and things would take so much of a shorter time like other folks if I didn't have these mental health problems. Everyone else is getting promoted, buying houses/condos, moving out of their parents. Me? I'm in school for another undergraduate degree I guess? Still living at home. Had mental breakdowns at my first professional job even though I was doing well at it.

I don't know what I'm looking for or why I'm ranting. Just upset that I'm sick enough that my life is severely impacted in so many ways? Or upset of where I'm at in life compared to others. I don't know."

i am \*assuming\* im neurotypical because i have never been diagnosed with anything and i dont have access to professional help, so im not sure if these moments count as just spooks or if theyre actually panic attacks. im not very educated on mental health things either, so i dont know if you need to have a mental health issue to have a panic attack. sorry if that sounds dumb lol."
867,Advice needed: How to cope with loneliness in lockdown?,"Hello everyone! 

You may wondering why I asking for this now, so let me put my question in context: 

I'm a 24 (male) years old university student. I was really socially awkward until the end of highschool. I had no friends or relationship. Then at the university I started to develop my social skills. I got some amazing friends, and I started my first serious attempt to get s girlfriend back in February - so just before the whole Coronavirus pandemic thing. I was mislead and I got rejected in march. Therefore I had a very bad mood during the lockdown, I just lost in my bad thoughts and I couldn't care with my mental health. The summer was better because the lockdown was partially lifted and I could met with my friends. 

So, my problem is that I start my last year at the university shortly. Therefore I will separated from my friends (or at least I can't see them very often) and the Coronavirus just started to hit again so we are expecting for an another lockdown. I'm studying abroad, so this time if this happens I will separated from my family too. 
I'm feeling quite OK actually, but I fear I'll be quite lonely in the next few months. So I was wondering if someone could advice some techniques to bare the loneliness better this time. 

Thanks for your help! :D

868,I need to change my way of thinking.,"Hi all, 

I would like to start this letter by saying I am relieved to realize I am not the only one struggling with any form of mental health issues and I hope by writing this letter I can not only get years of discomfort of my chest but also hear you guys out on your struggles and how you cope with them. I would also like to add that English is not my native language and I thereby apologize for any confusion.

I was always the loudest in the room, the person that felt everyone I bonded with should not go home without a smile on their face. I wanted to make everyone happy and if I succeeded in doing so I would have a sense of happiness myself. 

As I’ve never really written anything down and have no idea how to structure a letter, I’ll just go down the timeline of some of the things I have a feeling have an impact on my way of thinking today. 

&amp;#x200B;

2008-2012 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to get bullied from the age of 8 to the age of 12, not severely as I could call some of those bullies my friends from time to time. It was a weird period in my life, every month or so someone else got bullied for some odd reason. 

I luckily had a loving older brother who was always there for me and took care of me whenever I was in need for help. We were best friends and did everything together. although he could be an ass from time to time, I truly loved the dude and considered him as one of my best friends and vice versa. (keep him in mind as he plays a big role in my loss of mental stability later on)

At the time it was an unpleasant experience, but I don’t really think it added that much weight on the “struggles” I carry today.

I just wanted to throw this period in here as I’m not sure how mental health develops over time and if I could still carry any form of “trauma” from those days even though I’m pretty sure it hasn’t impacted my life today all that much. I moved to a different school as I got older and was in a good place with good people around me. 

&amp;#x200B;

2015-2016 

At the age of 15 I moved to Cambridge for a year and I honestly had the best time of my life. I had met some of the best people that I will forever hold close to my hearth although I most likely won’t meet them again. When I look back at it now, this was definitely the year where my mental health was at its best.

&amp;#x200B;

2017

I finish my year in Cambridge and get back home. Although I had seen my family a few times during my stay in Cambridge it was nice to be able to spend a lot of time with them and my friends again. Unfortunately, my version of spending time with my family differed from what reality gave me. I realized my loving brother wasn’t really who he was anymore. His love and care turned into hate and bigotry, he reminded me of my bullies. I got to learn he made a new set of friends and I quickly noticed that these friends were a very bad influence on him. They were bad people, criminals. Not only did they literally steal they also stole a valuable bond both me and my brother had been working on for years. I was angry and frustrated but still focused. I had things in control.

He’s negativity quickly progressed into something much bigger. It felt like I was living with a stranger in my own home. Before I go on, I’d like to make It very clear that my parents did everything in their power not to let him take the wrong path in life. They are literal gem’s and I will always love them with every single tiny piece of love there is left to give. 

This year consisted of my brother breaking stuff in our home when things wouldn’t go his way, my parents trying their hardest to not let their kid fall in his own pit he’s dug and quite frankly me in the middle of everything not wanting to speak up as I didn’t want to make matters worse. My antidote during that time was going out of the house and drinking till I forgot what happened. I was not by any means an alcoholic, but I did know it was an easy way of forgetting the misery that was playing out at home. I had lost my best friend and didn’t want to admit to it.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 

I feel like this is the year everything went south. My brother went from being angry when things didn’t go his way to being angry all the time. He became a bully and always had a need to show that I wasn’t going to amount to shit and that I live under his rules. Not mine, not my parents, HIS.

He started finding interest in Muay Thai. For those unfamiliar, Muay Thai is a combat sport that combines the use of your fist, knees, elbows and shins. He wanted to join a club, but my parents would just not allow him to do so both out of fear of him getting hurt and fear of him hurting other’s as... you know, him being him and all. 

I took it upon myself to convince my parents to let him do it as out of the little knowledge I had about combat sports at the time I did know the importance of combat sports is teaching discipline and I had a good feeling it would results to him learning about how to control and form his aggression into a passion. I thought it would be a good way for him to spew out any aggression he had during his training in his club and he’d come home with only love to offer and this was definitely the case in the beginning.

However, it quickly shifted to the punching bag at the club not being enough. I was his new punching bag. He came home frustrated about someone or something I have no clue about, and he would start beating me If I tried to spark a conversation or would offer him help. It was bad. I was hurt and refused to tell anyone. My parents were the only ones who knew and that was only when my wounds were visible. Like bloodshot eyes when he choked me unconscious in front of a friend as I tried defending myself from him harming me. Something new he learned I guessed. Or the few times I had to walk around with bumps on my head from either a fist or shoe or whatever throwable object. 

I didn’t have things in control anymore. I got to learn my first signs of mental health disorders. Paranoid, depression I was barely sleeping. I was angry, inside my house I was a victim and outside I became the very thing I wished not to ever become. I became somewhat of a bully myself. I wasn’t friendly anymore, you have feelings? I don’t fucking care, you have no right to have them as mine have been taken away. I have no control, and neither should you. I was a bigot and started treating people the very way my brother treated me. I didn’t beat people but instigated fights and had to figure out how to get rid of this anger somehow. I’m ashamed of the person I became. I was empty, numb. 

&amp;#x200B;

2019 

It’s the year 2019 and things haven’t been all that better. 

I start distancing myself from people even more. It used to be just “ah fuck that person, I don’t need them anyway” to “it’s me against the world.” I was quick to drop people who did something minor that didn’t sit with me too well and only got to realize now that most of it was out of their control. I still had friends but not the good ones for the most part. I’ve also learned that finding peace in loneliness makes me comfortable and it is pains me to even write it down. It’s scary and I want to change this.

I started drinking heavily. I’m 18 at this time and for a period of 6 months I was drinking daily every night until my liver couldn’t hold anymore. At the time I was convinced it wasn’t a problem and just me being at the legal age to finally buy my own alcohol and being able to be somewhere else instead of home. I stopped drinking and only drink from time to time now.

I try to look happy but I’m not. For the first time suicide pops in my head. Why am I here? Why is it that every time I try something that I could benefit from it fails but every time I do something that shouldn’t be done, I succeed in doing so. How can I be good to people without being good to myself? 

Those two gems I was talking about. Yeah, they saved my life. Without my parents I wouldn’t be here. Their unconditioned love outweighed the hate I received from not only my brother but myself. I love these people, they are the two angles life wanted me to have.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 

It’s 2020, I’m turning 20 this year, holy shit. I need to start thinking about my life. How will I be making money? If I have a family, I want them to be good. 

For the first time I value my life, my choices and how I go about things. I’m friendly again and greet people with a smile. I try to make everyone as comfortable as I can. 

I almost completely don’t touch alcohol anymore, but I did start smoking weed at night. Kind of like my own therapy session, I could ask myself things I’m worried about without this filter that telling me not to care or telling me “you’re not wrong, they are”. Weed made me solve problems I had logically and calmed me down quite a lot. I don’t smoke during the day as I like being productive and I really only like smoking it when I’m alone so I can think about my choices in life. 

My brother and I haven’t fought this year, which is (crazy to say) an achievement. Were better to each other but I will never be like it was. We talk here and there but we’ve definitely lost sight of friendship and value to one another. I miss it but I can’t force him to miss it too.

For the most part I am in a really good mindset now. I’ve developed a “fuck it” mentality and try not to care what people think. However I have noticed that I have gained a lot of anxiety. When I walk the streets in my city, I have a feeling that people are staring, and that people are judging me. Paranoia? No clue where that could come from. I’m not good with groups anymore and I’ve developed a slight stutter. I’m not that good with words and somehow lost the knowledge of starting meaningful conversation although I have a lot to talk about. I think I have slight form of OCD as I do recognize symptoms of it and apparently It puts thoughts in your head that aren’t true, could this be it? 

As of now after a few months of feeling really good, this week I fell into a pit again. I don’t even know why but I woke up feeling off and it’s been like this the whole week. I was convinced that I “beat” depression, but I’m scared it has come for a visit again. 

I have never been checked for depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. as somehow knowing the truth scares me. Right now, I can still convince myself that these are things I THINK I have, and I’m scared once I read it on paper that I’ll feel abnormal and I’ll have an excuse not to go out and meet people etc.

How have some of you coped with knowing about your depression? Can you learn to have control over it? Is there actually a cure? I’m afraid of taking pills as I’ve heard a lot of people say it makes it even worse when you’re off. Should I visit someone who could help me out and if so who? I’d like to be able to do it on my own without anyone knowing. 

Well, that’s a glimpse of my life, I’m not even sure If anyone will read this but it feels good to get it out there. And if you are reading this, this is a 2000+ word letter, you’re crazy but I thank you! &lt;3

To the person that said to start writing as a form of therapy, I thank you also. Really, I’m at the end of my letter and It does feel like a huge weight has left my body. Even though it’s not a good letter I’m glad it’s out there. I hope this isn’t temporarily.

Four years ago I was obese, single, in a dead end job and going nowhere in life but i partied every weekend, had more friends than i could count and always had something planned for weekends with friends ect. I wasnt in a good place but i was happy for the most part.

Since then, i moved in with my sister to a bigger city to start an apprenticeship as a mechanic (in australia apprenticeships normally go for 4 years) 

I have lost ~50kg
Been promoted to manager even though i am still meant to just be an apprentice
Got a long term girlfriend
Got my own place with my girlfriend
Generally become more motivated in my job and life

But why do i not have friends anymore? 

Everyone i used to be friends with have drifted away, now i only hear from them if they need help with their cars. Most dont even send me birthday messages anymore.
I find it incredibly hard to make new friends now, but a few years ago it was so easy i didnt even have to try.
And although i have my girlfriend and family who are all very supportive i feel so isolated. 
I dont even look forward to weekends anymore because i know all ill be doing is housework and watching netflix
Is this just part of becoming an adult or am i doing something wrong?

It's been a great help to me. It encourages me to do healthy and useful things as I enjoy looking at my ""scoreboard"" and thinking 'hey, I've done a lot of cool stuff this week, I'll make next week even better.'

I have english for my second language, so there will be a lots of mistakes, so close your eyes before reading it. I don't really wanna use my name so we should just call me Jessie. I think it's nice name. 

Everything started when I was little girl. Me and my cousin were the same age (I was few mounths older, but that's secret) but she was always the serious one and she was bigger... Not her body, but her presence. She was the queen and i was her pet. In the beggining I didn't really see it, I was always so optimistic and happy, I saw just the best in others. I didn't understand what was manipulating and dissemblance... I saw just the good things. Maybe I was ignoring everything bad, because my mother was devil, she took away my older ssister from me. Not directly, but my sister left us when I was very young and my mother was always mean to me because of it. I was happy for my sister, she was living with my dad and me with my mother. 
Everything changed when me and my cousin got a new phones with messenger. We were like 12 maybe. She was all of this time so depressed... I was there for her all the time. She was mean to me, but I was thinking ""that's alright, she's broken, she has the right for doing this"" And it was always like this until we were 17. Up to that moment I had most of friends from her friend groups. I didn't have anyone who was just my friend. But I was happy... Not much but the friends part was the best. I was suicidal before in the time when I was 13. I was always thinking about killing myself and I was broken. (I even tried many times, but it never happened) But I still was optimistic about others.. I was too naive. At that time I had real problems with my mother. I was forbidden to see my sister for christmas, which was the only day she was allowed to go to our house. I had big crisis and I found out that I don't like only men. It was pretty hard and my familly was angainst me. But I found one friend which was only mine. Not my cousins. But not for long she got that friend into her hands. She was still more my friend than hers, but was super big fan of my cousins work on social medias. Everyone was using me to get closer tu my cousin. But I thought it was normal and was helping them.
Now we're going back to time when I was 17... My cousin was talking to me like if I was garbbage... She was my queen and I was her slave. But at age of 16 I started going out with one girl and she told me what she thinks my cousin is doing to me. She said that my cousin was manipulating me and using me. For months I was telling her ""no she's not like that. She's just broken."" I was right she was really broken, but I didn't write her much, because I was with my gf and I didn't chat with any of my friends, I was madly in love. (and I still am) but when my cousin told me for 4 time to kill myself, I started thinking and wrote her at the night if she could be just i little bit nicer to me. But she couldn't. She was so furious... We are going to same school, so it's the worst, because I was always on good terms with everyone, but now I'm not. 
I made a lots of mistakes and apologised for them... She didn't... Our familly want's us to be friends again, but I can't... She was thinking that I'll always return to her, but I can't. Now I'm tired. I sleep 3 hours a night every day and I'm always doing homeworks.
I hate myself, my friends are one after one turning their back at me and I can't take it. I feel their hate, because they like my cousin more. I still have my gf and she's very supporting, but I don't want to disappoint her... I love her, but I'm broken... I'm not as optimistic as before... I just want to run away with her and never see anyone again. I just want to die... If she wasn't here for me, I would be dead and I should be dead... I did many things wrong and now I'm posting my feelings online, because I can't do anything anymore. Maybe it seams like a little thing for you, but my whole world was constructed on my cousin... Now my world is on the ground and is building itself on my gf. From young age I didn't have anyone except my cousin... Now I feel really broken... I was good child, now I'm just teen in her body set on autopilot and is only living if I'm near my gf.

I lost all of them. And it makes my heart ache."

880,I feel so alone,"Hi, I'm not usually one to post or talk about my struggles but I'm at a breaking point and I feel so lonely, so I guess if anyone has any advice or just wants to support and let me know I'm not alone that would be great.

I can't sleep at night, I have nightmares and I can't get a good nights rest. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and irritable. I can't make myself eat or do anything because I feel so nauseous and insecure. And I'm a teenager so I'm stuck in quarantine with my parents who constantly invalidate how I'm feeling and tell me ""its all in my head."" and my mental health was doing so well. I don't know what to do now.

And yeah, if you read that thank you for taking the time out of your day :)"

883,"US, MST (Military Sexual Trauma) is finally being recognized. Is there such a thing as PST (Police Sexual Trauma)?","I work with a lot of active duty and ex-military folk and a growing long overdue area of study in mental health care is MST or Military Sexual Trauma, usually defined by sexual violence experienced during military service. Sexual harassment, assaults, or threats of either by military personnel have been a problem for quite some time and more often than not was either covered up or minimized due to things like corrupted internal investigations and politics and whatnot. Now that awareness of this problem is starting to pick up I was wondering if something similar existed within law enforcement. 

Studies I've seen (so far) only reference police misconduct against the general population and although those studies are informative they haven't been helpful in answering my question. Is sexual violence by officers against other officers even a thing? If yes is there justice for the survivors or has it been similar response to the military? Sexual violence against the general population by officers is significant enough to make it difficult to for to believe that it's not a problem within the LEO community itself but I am prepared to be wrong. 

Note: I am not trying to stir anything up or bash anyone or heap more mess onto the flaming dumpster fire of hate that's already been lit. I ask this out of genuine concern and curiosity. I tried asking in the ""Ask LEO"" subreddit and got swiftly permabanned so I turn to you. I've no doubt there are other facets and nuances that I haven't thought of yet so contributions, especially with data, will be very much appreciated."
884,I am a helicopter sister,"So my (19) older brother (22) was diagnosed with depression two years ago and after that he had so many scary breakdowns(I won't go into detail because it will be so long) and ever since I am constantly scared that he will have another breakdown. So whenever I think he is a little off I can't control myself from checking on him to see if he is ok or not. Also he blames my father for his depression because my father always did everything for him and my brother thinks that he controls everything and therefore he has low self esteem. And again whenever my father talks to him I am scared and anxious that he says something that triggers my brother and he has another breakdown. 
So I always make sure he is not sad and tell my parents don't say that or do that because it annoys him and recently i found his twitter and i check there to see if he had said something about being sad and stuff like that (I really hate doing this but i just can't stop)
So the question is how can I stop being so protective over him and just let him live his life because this is just ruining my mental health and  l already have anxiety and this is just making it worse."
885,Social isolation and it’s effects on mental health,"I live in Melbourne Australia 
And under the currant legislation that’s being passed I cannot leave my house
I’m not aloud for more than 1 hour a day unless it’s too work or do grocery shopping 
We’re locked in our house from 8pm to 5am 
We face heavy fines 
We face massive sentences for breaking such a draconian law and it’s slowly but surely eroding my mental health I can’t work I can’t see friends I can’t even see my own family 
This is slowly but surely destroying me inside and I’m not sure how much longer I can survive? 
Work home work home work then home home home our business are sufferings our mental health is suffering and the lack of funding there of our economy is suffering driving our businesses against the wall degrading our way of live and in record numbers men and teenage kids are committing suicide due to depression from this our way of life has being robbed from us our dignity stripped our hopes and dreams stomped and left in a gutter may god speed get us out of this mess i for one have no idea how much longer I can take it"
886,The Daniel Prude death has me upset,"I recently watched and read about the death of Daniel Prude in police custody.

From what I gathered, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the man was mentally ill, having an episode and high on pcp at the time.

The next part is a brief detailing of how he died, so if you don't feel like reading it please skip ahead. 

&gt;!The man was naked in the street, handcuffed with a spit mask on his head. His head was held face down on the pavement until he suffocated and was removed from life support a few days later.!&lt;

From the video I saw, he appeared to be fairly cooperative and not really struggling with officers. Which is more than reasonable for a man in the middle of a psychotic episode. 

I'm mentally ill and have psychotic episodes when I'm unmedicated, and something like his episode isn't too far from possibility for me.

Why did this man have to die, it makes me tear up thinking about life struggles and that's how it can end. Just have an episode on the wrong day and instead of receiving help a person gets killed."
887,How to get rid of your parents inside your head,"To make a long story short:
How do I get rid of your parents inside my head?

I am completely not in contact with my parents for years now. A lot of shit happened in my childhood. Talking about it with a therapist makes me feel like a very bad person because I was always told not to talk about what happened at home. I'm terrified that they will walk in during a Therapy session what is ridiculous because we are not on speaking terms for years and they don't know where I am (I think) I hate the total fear I feel all the time. 
It feels like the worst decision ever  to talk about things that happened when I was a kid.
Everything that happened is my own fault anyway so I should stop talking about it And act normal"

889,Ketamine therapy for Debilitating OCD,"Has anyone out there had any success with Ketamine therapy for debilitating OCD? Also, if you have had success with ketamine therapy as a treatment for depression, please share as I also have depression. I am just hoping that something can tame the intrusive thoughts as they are becoming debilitating."
890,I am constantly anxious and worried,"Just found this sub after posting a couple times on offmychest in the past.

 I am constantly anxious, to the point of being sick, and worried about everything. It mostly is triggered by work, I try to do everything right and often second guess myself, then worry the rest of the day. Like today, had a very good day, then I got asked if I checked something that was my responsibility to check, then I worry like crazy and cant sleep all night because I'm not 100% certain anymore. Im just so worried about doing something wrong.

 Its all the time. It has put a strain on my life and marriage. I will get myself into such a state and I am just not sure who I should be telling and of its even an issue.

 I know enough that this is not normal. And that if people just tell me to ""calm down"" or ""dont worry"" they are about as helpful as using petrol to douse a fire.

 I dont know why I have put the flair as need support. I believe from what I have looked up this is panic disorder. But with my job and family I have no idea who to tell and how to convince them im not just pulling this out of my arse. So I suppose I need someone to tell me if this is healthy or if I have some form of mental health issue that I should flag up."
891,"From a psychological perspective is there any meaningful difference in ""self talking thoughts"" that start with ""You are this"" as compared to ""I am this""?","When it comes to interacting with our thoughts is there any significance between having self talk which starts off as ""I am this or that as compared to the inner voice saying ""You are this or you are that""?"
892,Am I overthinking?,"     This is heavy on my head a lot so I just want the opinions of other people. Lately, my boyfriend won’t stay off his fucking phone. I don’t mind just getting on your phone to do something real quick or whatever but I will want to talk to him after he works on his car or works a night shift and i haven’t seen him since the night before but he will just be watching some shit on youtube or instagram. Like yesterday was his off day and he went and hung with friends and said he would be home soon since I wasn’t able to go with him and I was fine with it but I didn’t get a text til after I was asleep at like 11 and he got home after 12. (Which is another thing that bothers me. He seems to always be on his phone but when he’s out I have to pray for a text.) 

     Don’t get me wrong I am NOT that crazy girlfriend that expects you to text her 24/7 while you’re out because I know you wanna take time to hang out, but it’s just nice to have him check in and know when he’s coming home so I’m not just waiting around? Especially when he told me he would? 

    Then today, he worked on his car all morning and when he was done he came upstairs and started watching youtube. I asked what he was watching and he said it was something about a mortician or whatever and I was like 😐 dead bodies are more inretesting than me. 

     I just hate being mad or upset when I don’t know if it’s for a good reason or not. I love him a lot but I just don’t know if Im missing something because if it’s something on my part, i wanna get better. I will admit that I get a little sad when I don’t get attention sometimes and he knows that but I don’t know how to talk about it without seeming needy? Or maybe there is something I can do to come across as more interesting? Be honest please"

897,Is Corona virus a curse or blessing in disguise?,"As a once in a hundred year pandemic hits the world I am honestly feeling indignation for the world including my own community. I delight in the idea of the rich losing their money. They were haughty and trusted in their wealth, and now they cannot spend their retirement and twighlight years enjoying the excess of riches they accumulated by the unjust system they benefited from. I also am filled with wrath due to this ambitious spirit that fills the world, ambition for money and status. Now I also believe the lord of goodness feels the same way, and this is why I pose the question, is covid 19 a curse or a blessing? The answer in my opinion is both, and I will explain why. Many people have said that the god of the OT does not correlate with the God of the New Testament. How can a God of indignation and justice also be of goodness and forgiveness. How can a God of goodness allow plagues and famines? What good could come from a pandemic resulting in a future economic collapse? Let's think spiritual, losing all your riches, or losing the ability to spend your riches, naturally makes us look introspectivly at ourselves, our values and produces humility, a virtue you may not have otherwise sought. Also as a people we are seeing changes in our collective consciousness, we are asking questions, having conversations and thinking about different things. God is concerned about the second death, the spiritual death that takes place after the physical death for the unsaved. So it is out of mercy the god of goodness brings these plagues and crises. So that we have a spiritual blessing. I believe we are lucky as a generation to see such things, many generations have passed without a sign. We may not think this valuable because we don't believe in a god, or another kingdom in heaven, but that doesn't change the reality."

900,I am an Adult Baby and I want to die soon.,"I was curious about the whole adult baby thing since I was about fourteen but only really actually tried it for myself now at the age of 20. I have had serious anxieties around this for years now. I have had therapy for almost a year. Even told my parents about it. Keeping this from my friends is absolute torture. I cant even describe the guilt and shame of this. I have my dream job, dream university course, everything and this is just ruining my life. I cant get rid of it because it is a fundamental part of myself and I feel hopeless about my future


I am just scared of having to be a funcioning adult. I just dont want to have to think anymore. There is not even a single moment in my day that is not filled with some kind of anxiety, depression, shame and hopelessness. When I sleep at night with my onesie, and diaper and pacifier I feel so at peace. I want to die that way. I hate the fact that this will sound so ridiculous and laughable to most people. Nothing really brings me joy anymore, everything is just a temporary high."

My mum was blank and I had to focus really really hard to remember where I was or what I was doing, and going. It's happened on the block next to mine, as well.

I know that you don’t have to have every last symptom to meet a diagnosis, and we are all different, but I feel like the feelings of worthlessness is one that most people experience.

It’s hard to explain but i feel like the world is fake / i realize im living and here? Or it feels like i’m watching someone elses life through a screen. 

If it helps, i had a somewhat traumatic childhood. I was bullied for years out of school and finished the last 5 years with online school. I have alot of unresolved trauma, and i somewhat bottle up how i feel. Maybe it’s all of this that causes it? 

Any comments would be appreciated.

920,Why do I feel like I’m in trouble?,"I’m an adult, but whenever someone around me is upset, I feel like I’m in trouble. I feel like a kid getting in trouble, and that ends up leading to fear. I know this is likely a ptsd or anxiety cycle, but I can’t pinpoint where it’s coming from and I don’t know how to stop it. 

My partner will come home from work normal levels of upset/irritated, and I’ll feel frightened and like I’m in trouble. My partner has never done anything to make this a logical feeling. Sometimes she’ll just be bored/irritated while cleaning and I’ll cry and hide because I’m so afraid. I don’t understand how to mitigate these feelings.

I’ve only heard them actually say one thing and that was to hurt my dad which I tried to do but it got flipped on me. I don’t really know what to do about it. another thing I don’t understand is that I am always really paranoid because I think they’re are cameras watching me all the time like I know they’re in every single object like the walls, the spines of books, any technology literally everything, I can’t live normally, I have to hide myself getting changed and I even got into the shower with a towel on once (until i realised I could just have a bath with the curtain and a towel over the shower head) but idk what to do about it can someone pls help or maybe just guide me what to do. im 16 and already struggle with ptsd, anxiety (social) depression and intense androphobia I really don’t know what to do so could anyone maybe give me some advice to what this could be or maybe just some general support and ideas ty ty ty"
922,Frustrated about college fall term plans stuck at home (family issues),"Hi yall. I'm mainly here because I just need to get my frustrations out. I'm going to be a senior this year at college and in response to the pandemic, my school is only allowing necessary classes to be in person (performance-based classes, science labs, etc.). I'm a theatre major so a good amount of my classes will be in-person. Buuuut my mom is making me do this term online FROM HOME and isn't letting me go back to campus. All students have the option to do any class entirely from home so I still can take my theatre performance classes but literally no one else in the class is going to be online, my professor told me everyone else is going to be in person. I'm going to be the one doofus on a laptop screen that people have to squint to see. I'm just so so annoyed that my mom is making me stay home because this is literally my SENIOR year. For acting classes, being in person makes such a difference because you can connect with your scene partners and the audience better. Acting over Zoom ain't it. 

I'm just so angry because I feel like she has no regard for how I'm feeling. Being stuck at home these last few months has been so hard for me. I'm a very blessed person and have access to all the things I need. It always feels weird complaining about my home life because I have all I need. But at home, I'm not able to be independent like I'm able to be at school. There are bad habits I learned from my family and since I've been at school I've been working to get rid of them. Being around the ppl that gave me them isn't helping. I also have issues with my dad. He abused my family when I was younger and although he's better now, I suffer from PTSD from those times so being around him is difficult. Not to mention just being stuck in my house is a lot. My mom can be very controlling and in a manipulative way. She's so so paranoid about the coronavirus that she literally doesn't let anyone in my house go ANYWHERE. We're only allowed to go out when we go out with her so she can be with us (I'm 21). Haven't hung out with any friends, not even socially distanced, since March. When we tell her we need more freedom she tells us things like ""If you want me and your dad to be here tomorrow, you'll stay home."" I literally don't know how much longer I can stay here.

She tells me the main reason I can't go is because it's a money issue. This doesn't make any sense to me because how much she'd be paying for me to stay in Illinois (where my school is, I'd be staying off campus) is the same amount she'd be paying if there was no corona. Neither of my parents have lost their jobs (knock on wood) AND, she literally has a whole refund check from last term's room and board tuition. When I tell her all this she says that she needs to be able to plan her finances in advance and she didn't budget for me to stay in Illinois. This makes sense, but at the same time, I can't help but feel like she's just manipulating me into being okay with staying. Every now and then she'll talk about getting expensive work to the house done and I just think ""waaaiiit, you can pay for that but not for me to stay in Illinois?"" I think she just doesn't want to have to deal with me going there, catching the virus, and then bringing it home. I know she's scared and she has every right to be but we can't live in fear, ya know? Why should I stunt my life if I can safely resume it?

I probably sound like a spoiled brat. My mom pays for me to go to college and (when there's no pandemic) stay there, why the hell am I complaining? I'm privileged and I should be grateful. I think what just makes me upset is that I feel like my mom doesn't have any consideration for my feelings. Being stuck at home has been so hard for me and she knows that. I'm worried about how my mental health will be affected over the next few months.

I just really need some words from yall. Anything. I just want to feel seen."

I got news today that my grandpa who I’ve been with for almost 17 years had a bad stroke on Monday. All he can do really is hear i guess and they say theres not much they can do for him. I dont really feel sad or anything. Im not someone who just suppresses their emotions to appear tough or whatever, i just genuinely don’t feel very much. Usually whenever someone has good news i act all happy and excited and similar with bad news i act sad. Does anyone know what this be from? I never had any emotional trauma or anything. The only thing i could think of that might be important is that i had a bad concussion when i was around 10. I’ve been thinking about this all day and can’t really remember the last time i felt emotion. Im not trying to sound like im trying to act like im depressed because im not, thats just how i feel. Once again sorry if this doesnt fit the sub, im just curious."
924,I love my parents :),"So today I had yet another mental breakdown where I was harming myself and ran to the bathroom and grabbed a blade to continue, because of how my parents had flared me up. And my dad runs after me and was telling me to not do it and I was calming myself down until he said if you want to do it do it elsewhere not in this house. I love my parents :) I’m eternally grateful for their thoughtfulness towards me. And this is a day after my birthday which I never celebrated but they went out to celebrate without me because I was going through my own issues in my head. Also depression."
925,My family is really affecting my mental health,"Some background. I live with my dad and his parents in a compound style household. I live in a very expensive state and have a demanding job that pays very little. So to address the inevitable ""just move out"" comments before they come in, yes that is a solution that I am working on through saving, however it's not an immediate solution so if you can please avoid that conversation for now. 

My dad is cray. Most likely bipolar or borderline. My grandma is his primary enabler which I am able to handle, but the frustration that she feels from him but is unable to express she saves for me and my grandpa. She is in her early 70's but acts like shes 80 on her death bed. Everything is doom and gloom. She is constantly talking about ""traumas"" that have occurred decades ago. Almost every conversation leads back to how bad something was for her. Its quite annoying hearing about the same thing (like a pet dog dying of natural causes 40 years ago) over and over every time you're trying to have a conversation about dogs. I usually just let it go. However, when somebody else (excluding my dad of course bc he's just a poor baby that has it so bad even though he has lived for free with them for 10 years 5 of which he didn't even work and the list of his perks goes on and on) has something they are dealing with. It becomes a pissing match of who has had it worse. She is my grandpa so at times I feel compelled to confide in her, but if its something I am going through I just need ""to get over it"". For example one of our dogs died recently quite peacefully of natural causes. He went quickly with very little pain or fuss. Everybody was there except for me. She was understandably a mess, I talked on the phone with her for 2 hours consoling her after my dad freaked on her for being upset as her dog was dying. In his defense her ""upset"" is quite intense there is no in-between for her its either shes fine or screaming. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later I watched a dog get hit by a car in a hit and run, and I watched it drag itself off the road as its legs hardly worked, and I waited with it for an hour as it was bleeding out and dying a slow painful, traumatic death. I told her about it and she said she didn't want to talk about it and started bringing up our pet who had recently died. Just now a bird flew into my window. It was still alive and bleeding, and just laying there rolling its head around. I told her about it, she wouldn't look, and she said to just wait till my grandpa to come back that he would deal with it. I said that i was sick of seeing animals get hurt and dying in front of me and started to say ""I have a hard time letting it just lay there as its suffering"" but she cut me off and sharply and said ""Well me too! it's hard for me too you know! just get over it"" And I told her I don't even know why I talk to her anymore. I was just trying to discuss the situation not have a pissing match about who is more traumatized by it and I mentioned that I am sick of every conversation turning into that kind of pissing match. Like a conversation about organizing our hoard of books triggered a ""trauma"" for her 5 years ago when she had to move them to a different room."" I told her in that situation that I am just trying to talk about the solutions not about how traumatic the books were for her 5 years ago. She shot back with ""well if it were your trauma we'd be hearing about it."" There is so much I have gone through that I just dot talk about. I go through something, talk it out with my loved ones, and move on. Shes allowed to ruminate on EVERYTHING but has no patience for people going through something RIGHT now, and makes everything about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Living with this is driving me nuts. My anxiety is going out of the roof. I live in her house, but I want to get out but I feel stuck especially bc this time of COVID sis not the time to try and initiate major life changes. She's not the person who I thought she was. She is not nearly as kind as she makes herself out to be. I am so sick of watching my dad do whatever he wants with repercussions, not even that but getting constantly excused by her no matter what it is. I am sick of her jumping down my throat every time I say something she doesn't like. It makes me feel sad and angry and torn and unwelcome all at once."
926,Has anyone else experienced a state of blank mind?,"I have been suffering from a multitude of mental health issues from a very young age.
    Since I was around 19, I begun experiencing wjat some people call ""blank mind syndrome"", perpetual brain fog, and extreme cognitive sluggishness.
    These days, my brain seems to have been completely destroyed to the point where, I can not really learn anything complex. Maybe I always was this way, so, I am not sure if I just became dumber, or just became self-aware of how dumb I am.
     From all cognitive skills, it seems my Working Memory suffers the most....
   Is anyone here with a similar experience? If yes, have you ever gotten a dx for it specifically?"
927,Wellness penpal/textpal,"Sorry if this isn’t the place to ask. 

Is there such a thing/subreddit for something like a penpal for wellness? I started therapy about 5 months ago for some attachment and depression issues. I have sessions every Friday but sometimes I get extremely low and I just need someone to talk to just for company. I don’t really have a lot of friends anymore (for a lot of reasons I don’t wanna discuss). I can’t immediately contact my therapist for things like this, so is there such a thing? Thank you. 

FYI- I’m not looking for someone to confide in or give me advice/therapy related stuff, just someone to converse with."
928,I am happy about it,"Tonight's the night i think. Im gunna try at least. Only half a bottle to go. Then I'll go for a walk.  

I hope everyone has a good day tomorrow. Stay safe please. When someone says they need you. They fucking need you ok?

Mental health is not something controlled. Its not what you think. Its not as easy to get rid of.

Its when you stop dreaming ok? Its when the nightmares become your dreams.
Thats what it mostly is.

Im real scared of what you are all capable of. Even if your not. I'll never get to know.

Just be real with yourself. Look in that mirror and say it. Be what someone needs you to be. Not who you think.

Its not hard to fix us, its hard to get you to understand.

But ima go, too many taxdollers towards me. Im a burden. Im sorry everyone
. I do love you all. For the last year you have all paid my bills. You are all my heros. All of you. All. Of you. Don't ever give up. Your a hero ok. If your sad, your sad.

I promise you I'll be there. 

Your all in this together. Just remember that guys and gals. Be someone's someone.

Look them in the eyes.


I need help"
929,I am very anxious about my physical education classes,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this but I hope it is. I’d like some advices.

My physical education classes are ruining my weeks. I keep being anxious about them. I keep thinking about my PE class all week, because I’m scared there will be stretchings, in which people will notice I’m really not flexible. I’m also scared people will judge the way I run, the way I move and the way I act in my physical education classes. (That’s a bit like that in general but it’s the PE classes that are bothering me atm). I kinda feel the same in my drama classes.

I know it might sound stupid but I really feel anxious about it. Do you have advices for me?"
930,Depression to almost schizophrenia,"I am full of anger on this world, i love the idea of being with ppl, but i get really really depressed anf angry
Ik that's not ok but here we r
I feel like i suffered the emotional abuse by family and society in schools
I feel like I will never do what i want in my life
I remember when my dad hit me against the locker in 5th grade when i didn't learn biology and he really had a huge rage, and i am one of the family members who had balls to fight back
I feel like I have no freedom 
I don't want anyone to touch me.
I really miss the idea of excitement when u fall in love for the first time, excitement of hanging out with new ppl, doing ur hobbies
And the fact is that i know my wrong doings but i sometimes don't care
I get to wish for everything sometimes
I don't wanna be perfect but sometimes i desperately do, like in shameless, degrassi, one tree hill
Lovin the music, dance, drawing etc
A lot of stuff to know and to enjoy
i am improving in some field
I am not smart but i am.not stupid either
I wanna be anonymous too
But i think if i get too much angry and depressed and suicidal, that i will kill myself and to get schizophrenia
My sister told me that, she goes to medical school, as much as i get bravery from ppl, as much i get really sad."

932,I'm having a major PTSD episode how do I get out,I can't stop I'm panicking tell me how I get out please please
933,Overcoming executive dysfunction?,"I don't even know if executive dysfunction is the right term. But I'm stuck and I need help please. **TL;DR I tell myself to do the thing, hell even just a tiny part of the thing, but I can never convince myself to get up and DO anything.**



I can't do...anything really. I sit and scroll through my phone or stare blankly at the wall. In my head is ""do the thing do the thing do the thing"" and then boom it's hours later and I'm still sitting there and I haven't done the thing. So the next day ""ok self, do this teeny tiny part of the thing. Just this little bit. Just do it. Do it do it do it"" and same result. The day ends and I've done literally nothing.



My therapist keeps telling me I just have to ""push myself"" and ""just do it"". Like???? I would if I could????? 



How do I actually do the things? I'm missing deadlines, causing tons of anxiety within myself. Letting my home become a disaster. Not cooking and barely even eating. Before I quit my job last month, I was barely making in on time and often late. I won't even get up to pee until I'm about to soil the couch.



I'm aware this is part of my depression. I am being treated by a psychiatrist and therapist. But nothing is working. How am I supposed to do the things when no amount of willpower is enough? I know I need ""discipline"" and ""routine"" but like......how? I don't understand. I guess part of it is extreme fatigue and loss of enjoyment, but I feel like it shouldn't be this hard. 



When I say ""do the things"" I mean anything. If I can't convince myself to shower, surely I can at least brush my hair? No. Can't cook a whole meal, maybe I can grab a handful of food from the fridge? Nah. Doing the dishes sounds like a big chore, maybe I can just put the scattered dirty dishes into the sink? Nope. Customer waiting on a project, maybe I can at least set up the tools I'll need? Yeah right."
934,I feel like I'm not being taken very seriously by professionals,"A few months ago, I had to go to the emergency department because my mental health had really deteriorated. I couldn't think clearly, and all I wanted to do was die. I got triaged, then assessed in the psychiatric unit, and then discharged a couple hours later with a referral to an outpatient counseling program. 

I completed the DBT group therapy, and felt very little benefit. I also got a new prescription, which didn't work at all. 

I don't really know what I'm expecting. I still feel suicidal  every day and my psychiatrist rates my depression as severe, but yeah... all I have are quick follow up appointments every 6 weeks, and counseling every 2 weeks that I had to seek out on my own. 

Is it because I didn't come in by ambulance after narrowly surviving a gruesome suicide attempt? Is it because I'm not psychotic and brought in by the police? I'm the worst I've ever been, but nobody seems very concerned. Is this a fairly typical experience?"
935,Some states in the US povide assisted-suicide for those with physical illnesses that no longer have the will to live. Why can't this apply to those with mental illness that no longer wish to live?,"I am asking this for myself, as I have chronic major depressive disorder and I no longer wish to live. I find it more reasonable to assist my suicide with doctor supervision than to take action on my own. Why shouldn't I qualify for this?"
936,How do you even begin to improve when you've struggled for this long?,"So long story here, I'm 23 (F), I have always struggled with my mental health off and on since I was about 12 - 13. I was overweight as a kid and was the target of bullying, long story short with this part I developed anorexia nervosa at 13 years old and had this for 3 years before being considered recovered. All throughout highschool I struggled on and off with depression and anxiety, being properly diagnosed with GAD and depression. I got into a severely abusive relationship with a man far too old at the time, (I was 16, he was almost 22.) I managed to escape this situation when I was 18, and thought I was okay but I developed a fear of abandonment, not being good enough and scared every person I meet has it out to get me.

 I met the man I am with now 4 years ago, and he's honestly so great and I love him more than anything, but my mind kept telling me a year ago that he was bad for me, didn't love me, and I made a rash decision to move out and live alone after living together for 2 years. This hurt him a lot, but we reconciled and he's trying to understand my issues and we live together again. That year, I made so many rash decisions and I think I may have Borderline personality disorder, I'm waiting for a psychiatrist to properly diagnose. Anyways, where do you even begin to improve your mental health and find peace? I've tried counseling and the tactics I was given never seem to work, I'm at a loss and just want to be happy and ""normal"""
937,Currently criss crossing hotels until I get my tenancy down in a new place. Checkout at 10am then can only check in at 4pm. Carrying two suitcases at the moment where shall I go in between or what should I do between the time?,Currently just crashing outside the bus station on my phone :((
938,My dog made me realize that I might be depressed.,"For the last few months I have had symptoms of depression - sadness, anxiety, stress, restlessness, memory loss, and general unhappiness - but doctors have told me that its not classified as depression if the days that I am depressed are less than the days I'm not. 

I never face all the symptoms at once, but its always there a little bit. 

Last night I was playing with my dog, and for a solid hour during and after playing with him I felt like a massive weight was taken off my shoulders. I had no stress, no worries, no anxiety (even though the following day would be my first day of school), just happiness. The last time I felt like that was a couple of months ago when I was hanging out with my best friends.

I had a realization that I haven't truly been happy like that for a while now. I was wondering if I should go talk to my doctor (or a therapist), or if I'm just overreacting to a temporary moment of extreme happiness. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
939,A girl I befriended a while ago,"This is messy, sorry about that.

One time our teacher asks her to answer a question, she got it wrong. The teacher told her it's ok and moved on. I could see her shaking and crying. I approached her afterwards. She's still crying, I think she also have trouble breathing. I asked her if she's ok, she said she's having a panic attack. I comforted her and went back to my seat. 

The teacher leaves. I talked to her again, then she suddenly slammed the desk and yelled to me ""SHUT UP!"". I was surprised, she usually never yells. So I thought maybe she needs some time, I proceed to leave. But she suddenly cried and grabs me, saying she didn't meant it. I told her I don't mind and calmed her down.

Both of us loves english. But she always thinks that I'm better than her. She often makes some shady remarks towards my english. She also talked bad about me behind my back, she thinks I'm a privileged bitch.

My friend (not a therapist) told me that she may have social anxiety, anger issues, panic attack, and narcisstic.

So I want to know your thoughts about this if that's okay 🤏🤠"

941,What to do differently when they come home from hospital,"Hi all, my 20+ son is being released from his third hospitalization for schizophrenia.  All his hospitalizations have been involuntary and he still believes his delusions are real.  Since he doesn’t believe he’s sick he’s always stopped taking the meds.  He’s never worked, has no friends or relationships, and can’t finish any college courses, as he also has recently diagnosed disabilities which he refuses to acknowledge. His outbursts are frightening and I’ve had to get mental health help myself to cope.

This time he will be in an outpatient program that will require him to go before a judge and sent to long term care if he doesn’t take his meds and cooperate with treatment.  I’d like some advice on how to encourage him to stick to his treatment program without nagging.  Also,  how to stop his heavy marijuana use, since it makes people with this illness even more paranoid.  I’ve read the Amador book on LEAP but I haven’t been successful getting past Empathy so perhaps someone on this site will have some experience to share."
942,I just don't want to be here anymore.,"I have tried soooo hard.

Tried everything possible to work on my mental health, 

I just can't anymore. I am too tired."
943,"Nobody to talk to, Never had problems with mental health before COVID","I (19m) have just been feeling super lost recently. I basically went through high school with limited to no friends, and totally turned my life around in my freshman year of high school. I finally was out to everyone as gay, I had a really great friend group, and then COVID happened. Now it's my sophomore year and my classes are all online. And I just honestly feel so out of it. 

Most of my friends have been able to get apartments in the city where my college is but even though I worked all summer I still wasn't able to afford it. So i'm back at home for yet another 5 months, back in the closet, fully alone and 6 states away from every single one of my friends. I feel like I was finally shown the light after 18 years only to have it ripped away. 

I honestly feel like I have no one to talk to. I feel weird talking to most of my friends about my mental health since I've never talked about it before and it'll come out of nowhere. I've literally never had any issues with it before so in the back of my head I almost feel like a poser for having issues? if that makes any sense. 

I also don't talk to my parents ever about it. I have a good relationship with them but it's honestly super draining being around them all day and I just have never talked about how i'm feeling to them. 

This is quickly turning into a rant as I talk and I honestly don't even know what I'm asking at this point, but basically I just feel awful. I don't wake up feeling down but at some point in the day I see something that reminds me of life six months ago and I just am in the pits for two hours or more. I go down a spiral, and I feel like I'm going to get left behind by my friend group of a year since most of them are together in apartments and I'm home. Many of my friends have slowed down in texting too. 

I honestly just have nobody to talk to and would love some support. Some days, all I can do when I start to feel down is cry in my bed listening to music and picture my life five years from now, in an apartment in the city with my boyfriend and lots of plants all around me. Sometimes all I can do is just watch one piece for hours, just to not think about my current life."
944,How can I tell my professors I'm missing class because of my mental health?,"I'm not going to class tomorrow. I worry this may happen more than just this once...

I've been diagnosed with GAD and MDD, and I've been struggling a good bit at the beginning of college. I have a hard time focusing on my academic classes especially, because I can't logically rationalize doing well in them since they don't directly affect my degree. It doesn't help that my suitemates (I'm in a dorm with five other girls) stress me out beyond belief. I'm terrified of them. I know they talk about me behind my back and they're generally just not very nice people.

Blahh I digress. I just would like some help emailing my professors about how my mental health is affecting and may continue to affect my attendance and ability to complete assignments.

Thanks y'all."
945,Tell me your Hallucination Stories,"(avoid telling recreational drug related ones, mental health only)

For me, I used to and still sometimes do get really bad sleep paralysis. It started when I was very young, I would see a floating frankenstein like head floating above me and if I closed my eyes I would see a very wizard of oz setup similar to the guy inside the wizard figure operating the head. Lots of engineering like stuff, levers, pulleys, steam, very old timey. This was enough to terrify a 5 year old.

As I aged, it progressed to the standard pretty common SP visions.  
A large, outlined, shadowy figure dressed in what looked like those old timey fishing outfits (Giant Waterproof trench coat and huge brimmed hat covering the face holding a sickle (very, I know what you did last summer vibes)

Every time it happened he would get closer and closer to my bed until he was right above me one night. Scared the shit out of me.

The worst by far was the first time I had a seizure last year.  
I woke up and my family was in my room standing at the end of my bed. Only they didn't look like my family. My dad, brother and sister all looked to me like young, sketchy looking men who I felt were holding me hostage or here to take me away to an asylum. They were moving about my room and to me it felt very hostile. Their faces were so vivid I just remember them staring at me the whole time no matter how much they moved they never took their eyes off me. My mum was next to me holding my hand and I recognised her but I felt she was in collusion with them. It was awful. 

Now every time I have a seizure i wake up so confused but the hallucinations aren't nearly as bad as the first time. 

What about you guys?"
946,Don’t feel like texting back,"Hey there, I’m not sure if I’m looking for answers or advice or if I just want to see if someone can relate but here it goes:

This past year (or year and a half) I’ve felt like I’ve been drifting away from my “true identity” or just the normal me. I have not gone to a psychologist so I can’t justify those feelings using a diagnosis (nor do I want to self diagnose). 

I am just curious if the following has happened to anyone because I’m not sure if it’s part of this “phase” that I’ve been going through. I can’t seem to find it in myself to text people back. It started with only my acquaintances, I started replying afters hours, and then days.. Now it’s gotten worse, it doesn’t matter if it’s with strangers, acquaintances, close friends, or my best friends,  I still reply way too late (that is if I do choose to reply). A lot of those acquaintances/friends have been pointing it out but I just can’t seem to explain it to them or tell them what’s going on exactly, so I just brush it off and now I don’t really care about if it’s bothering them..

Again, I know this post is kind of messy, but I’ve been going through this for quite some time and I just wanted to see if anyone could relate and if anyone wants to share how they’ve been coping with this “issue”. 

Hope you’re all doing alright."
947,Mental health help options?,"Hi guys. So I’m going through a rough time right now. I suspect I’m dealing with a lot worse than just your usual bout of depression and anxiety. I want to see a professional but I don’t have insurance. I make just a tiny bit over the threshold for Medicaid in my state but my income is very low so I cannot afford anything out of pocket. All of the professionals I’ve researched either don’t take patients without insurance or they’re prices are a few hundred dollars per session. I can’t afford that at all. I’m stuck in a rut. According to the government, I make too much money when in reality I can’t afford this kinda stuff at all. Does anyone have any advice? I live in eastern US btw."
948,How accurate are those online tests?,"Because if they are accurate, well, I gotta fucked up mind, which I already knew there was SOMETHING wrong, but I really hope that I'm not too fucked up to the point I'd need to take an entire bottle worth of pills in order to feel normal...

I want to contact his father but I’m not sure if that will make things better or worse. His dad is the type of person that I’m not sure if my friend will be made to feel like he’s weak and worthless more than he already does.

955,It feels like my brain is breaking,"My mental health has been steadily deteriorating for awhile (especially within the past few months), but I’ve always somehow managed to distract myself from it and have felt pretty apathetic towards my situation for the most part, and I’m usually a very calm and reserved person except today it seems I reached my mental breaking point. My dad was demeaning me and explaining how everything I do and say affects him and essentially just explaining how my feelings don’t matter and how selfish I am for ever voicing them while completely ignoring me and usually I can handle that and stay calm but I started hyperventilating and it felt like I had left my body and suddenly I was screaming but not consciously. It just came out. It felt like something had possessed me or something. It was so incredibly terrifying and I’m convinced that my brain is breaking or something because I feel completely disconnected from myself and my surroundings, and I’m scared that I’ll soon lose full control of myself and my body."

I feel like I'm an irrational ball of sadness and anger. I don't want to try and make sense to other people anymore, I don't want them telling me that this is just life. Because I can't put up with any of this bullshit anymore, I shouldn't have to put in work to fix things that I didn't brake. I want to do something drastic, something bad, something absolutely insane. But whats after that what if I don't come back and I just fuck up my life more. I can't take this anymore."

959,Intrusive Thoughts,"warning - graphic / gory descriptions

I’m wondering if these are considered intrusive thoughts, or if anybody else gets them / a different name for whatever these are? I don’t have the urge to do anything, but often times a day I get these really disturbing images of myself/ close friends and family in my head. For example, right now I’m being plagued with a repeating image of myself with a big cut in my foot, walking on it &amp; opening the cut even more. it doesn’t cause me physical pain, but I imagine the pain of it and it is just very uncomfortable. This happens a lot with a bunch of random scenarios: me trying to cook and accidentally cutting my arm or something, me falling and breaking a bone / otherwise hurting myself, something happening to my best friend, there’s dozens of things like this. I don’t know if they’re anxiety caused, but i’m not really anxious about those things actually happening, more as if they’re just an image showing up in my head randomly and repeating for hours on end in a loop. I also don’t have any urges to actually do these things, hence why i’m not sure if they’re considered intrusive thoughts. but try as i might, i can never manage to distract myself or forget these thoughts, they just hang out in my brain until eventually they disappear / i forget. 

Sorry, that rant was long. any ideas would be appreciated!"
960,Are there examples of public policies being implemented which lowered suicide rates?,"I see many, really countless suggestions and calls for policies that might help, or that people want, but I cannot find solid evidence of a jurisdiction that did x, and it worked.  Meaning suicide rates or depression or similar, actually went down, within a jurisdiction, controlling for other factors.  Can anybody help me out?"
961,I keep thinking most people hate me.,(M19) Got a part-time job at MacDonald's as my way of exposure therapy for my social anxiety. It's the fifth time I've worked and the second time getting a job alone without any friends. After all this time I still haven't gotten over this feeling although I would say I've been through quite a lot. I know this isn't true because I try my best every time and I do a good job most of the time except when I'm new at something but it's always in the back of my head.
962,No one listens,"All my life, I've never been truly able to express myself and show my true interests. I have a strict Christian mother who hates anything that isn't about Christianity, and a sister who is my polar opposite (to a degree).

I try talking to my sister about the things I enjoy, the things that make me happy. I sometimes try to show her things, but she doesn't care. She told me that. 
I would say my sister is my best friend, but it makes me so upset that I have to refrain from talking about the things I like. 

I usually listen to the things she wants to tell me about, but I find it getting harder because I realize she wouldn't do the same for me.

I dont know, it really sucks not having friends and people that I can freely talk with. I feel like people think I have no personality, when in reality, the things that shape my personality are things no one feels like listening to. Does that make sense?

It really takes a toll on me mentally, never having anyone to talk to. I find myself almost saying something and then thinking ""oh...wait..."" and just keeping it to myself.

I keep everything bottled up now since no one has ever wanted to listen to a thing I have to say."

966,Been under a lot of stress and anxiety lately,"This summer has sucked. After my online end of the school year ended, I got my first ever job (I’m 15). My job added unwanted stress onto the stress I already had from school. Recently I went back to school but now it is back in person and since I’m taking a couple honors classes the work load is a lot. Also I kinda get social anxiety sometimes so that’s yet another reason why school can be hard. Yesterday, I went to school all day and then worked till around 9:15 at night. When I got home I was gonna do homework but my mom then told me that my 9 year old black lab that I have the highest level of love and adoration for is dying of cancer, which makes this whole thing even worse. I didn’t go to school today because I didn’t get much sleep last night worrying over my dog and also wanted to spend the day with him. I just feel like I need to share this with people because I’ve been under a lot of stress and shit lately."

Can’t really work anymore 

Can’t deal with me being poor

can’t take the stress of this mess…
This shits a ass I abhor

this shit hits back like a door…
Swings so you hit on the floor

I can’t take this one more bit,
I can’t take this anymore

these problems they hit my core

obsessions I don’t adore
and these compulsions ain’t fun,
Cause these compulsions a chore
And now my minds feeling sore 
Yeah I have felt it before
But one thing that I do know is, is I can’t take it no more

woke up and started to think

Woke up and started to blink

Woke and thought to my self…
maybe it’s time that I drink"
969,"worst panic attack in a while (F/25) TW: sexual, emotional, mental and physical abuse, self harm and panic attacks.","i have GAD, cptsd and major depressive disorder. i was unmedicated for many many years and held up pretty okay. it wasn’t until i was in an abusive relationship that my traumas started resurfacing and i decided to start medication again. my doctor at the time put me on Wellbutrin, Paxil and Lamictal all at the same time. I felt like a zombie all of the time, I’d disassociate while driving so hard that I felt like I was in a video game and couldn’t express happiness or sadness if I wanted. I was a literal walking dead. I stopped all of it cold turkey. I later left my abusive partner and was single three years. During this time, I finally found me. I fell in love with life and myself. I wasn’t medicated. I still struggled with all of my illnesses but I was free for the first time it felt like. 

Rewind one year and two months ago, I met the love of my life. My first healthy relationship (although not perfect and at times codependent). Things were absolutely wonderful, out of a dream really... until late March. Lockdown hit. We unexpectedly moved twice SUPER last minute. The first was a vacation that turned into a permanent vacation until I lost my best friend, we couldn’t find jobs after three months of looking HARD and my mental health started severely declining. I was having panic attacks nearly every day. I attempted suicide twice in one month (my last suicide attempt prior was at the age of 14, nearly 12 years ago) I felt like a monster. My partner and I were living together for the first time and very very excited about it at first. Until we literally couldn’t get away from each other. I started to feel trapped. I know she did too. We started fighting constantly. I was having the worst CPTSD flashbacks. I was remembering things I’ve never been able to remember. Having panic attacks so bad I would convulse and my eyes would black out. I started having outbursts in which I couldn’t control my anger so I would hit myself. The city we both once loved, hurt too much to be in, so we moved again. 

I started zoom therapy and Gabbapentin. The Gabbapentin was realllllly helping with my moods and my ptsd. I felt better. I was excited about a fresh start in a new city. My girlfriend went back down to FL for a few weeks and I got our place set up. I started a job at a restaurant and hated it. Quit right after I finished my training. A week later, I found my current job (another restaurant gig). I loved it at first. I started falling back into a deep depression. I’m a clinical facial specialist. I was making 3.5-4K a month working 20-25 hour weeks. I lost my job due to COVID. I can’t get my license up here right away bc I’m short 30 hours. Now I’m back in the service industry working 30-35 hours a week and making 1.2k a month.... now, I also have an invisible illness. The doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me yet. I have extremely bad “IBS”. I’m intolerant to just about all types of food. I’m constantly in pain and sick. I puke often and have diarrhea most every day unless constipated. People at work have been talking about me behind my back and saying that I’m always in the bathroom or sick with stomach things. I’ve had three people within the past week tell me they don’t like me bc of it. I’ve also not had the easiest time making friends here bc I’m always feeling ill, working, I don’t drink really and honestly depression x anxiety. It’s been a lonely and hard past 6 months.  

Rewind back to March, I bought my first vehicle. 2017 Honda 23k miles. Fucking. Fell. In. Love. 
Within one day, she was giving me issues. I took it into the dealership I bought it from (turn and burn lot) and they sent it to Honda. 800 in repairs. After that, it ran perfectly. Fast forward until two weeks ago, it stalled out while I was driving two hours from home while seeing family. No more problems for two weeks after, until this past week when it happened again.  My engine light came on and stayed on, my break light came on and my car was telling me to park immediately. I took it into three different places for opinions and all of the diagnostics came back with the same code: my engine computer and wiring harnesses are fried. 2.6k in repairs. 

I do not have that. 


Now the real point of all this back story shit... two days ago this panic attack ensued. I was hyperventilating, I hit myself (or tried to) multiple times, I was weeping uncontrollably, screaming, flailing at first... I locked myself in our bathroom and fell to the floor and continued hyperventilating, weeping, choking and then my eyes blacked out and I started seizing again. 

I’ve wanted to self harm all week. I haven’t in six years. Before that time, it was ten years. Every time I went to do it prior, I’d stop. This time I didn’t. 

I grabbed a pair of fabric scissors and cut my upper thigh by my hip about ten times. 

I am dealing with so much shame about it. I’m so mad at myself for breaking that six year mark. I’m so ashamed my partner saw me like that and has had to witness and deal with my mental health since quarantine. I’m ashamed to not wear pants. I’m ashamed to look in the mirror even more ashamed to be naked in front of one. I feel ashamed for having to put her through half of the shit I have. 

I feel alone. I’m scared. I miss home. I have no money. 

I think a part of me was hoping to just vent but one part of me wants to not feel alone, the second is happy to have this platform to vent and the third part of me is hoping for an answer. 

Regardless, if you’ve read this far, thank you...."
970,I hate myself,"I ate my way into type 2 diabetes at age 21. I've had depression for about six years now and none of the meds or even therapy are working well for me. I was self medicating with junk food this whole time.

Now I can't even eat a whole grain tortilla without becoming hyperglycemic. I can't have the only thing that made me even a little bit happy, junk food, and I already feel extremely shorty because of it. I can't afford insulin so I'll probably have to eat vegetables and meat and healthy slop for the rest of my life. Sounds like hell for someone who's having trouble finding the will to live in the first place. I hate myself for getting depression and I hate myself for getting to this point. I abused my body so much that I have a grandparent's disease at fucking 21, and I'm miserable because I can't even enjoy a dammed tortilla without harming my health. I'm so pissed and upset at myself"
971,Doing my best to stay optimistic and on top of my studies.,"It’s been a crazy second week of my school’s nursing program. This is my first term, so it’s a whole different ballpark from GE. Having a mental breakdown with cries and screams for the past three days has been difficult. It is solely because of my professor who is not compassionate to and helping my mates and I. Trying to be strong because I’ve been working hard to get to where I am now. Giving up is not an option."
972,Its getting bad again,"I am staring to get super lonely and its triggering so much within me. My main coping mechanism is distracting myself from my own thoughts with keeping busy and always hanging out with my friends and boyfriend. I feel like there was a switch that was flipped and everyone around me started distancing themselves. I havent seen my best friend in months, and if I am lucky I see my boyfriend maybe once a week.

Because of this, my anxiety has skyrocketed recently to the point were I can barely get out of bed because my stomach is in knots. I also cant seem to get out of bed because I have such a lack of motivation to do anything. Ive been crying all day now because I just cant help to think that I did something wrong to have everyone distance themselves. I feel like shit. Ive also been thinking about how not very good of a boyfriend I have. He puts in no effort into our relationship and its really starting to get to me. I just cant bring myself to break up with him because hes the only person that does hangout with me every once in a while.

I am hurting so bad, and honestly have never had this much hurt in my heart. I dont know what to think of it at all. I know I dont want people below this talking to me about how I need to break up with my boyfriend either, I just wanted to get that out. Im already fed up with the comments coming from my mom about how I can do better and how I need to break up with him. Im just in so much pain. I dont even know how to approach anyone with it without feeling like im going to be an emotional burden to them. I would love to bring it up to my bf but I dont want him to blame himself on how I am feeling, he has anxiety disorder so I know he will somehow connect how I am feeling as a whole &amp; think its all completely his fault. Ive talked to my best friend and shes made excuses as to her not ignoring me, she just has “a lot on her plate right now”. She didnt go into further detail, just that which obviously isnt my business if she didnt tell me what was going on.

Anyways, I have been numb for over a year now, so me experiencing this intense sadness is extremely overwhelming for me. Like I said, I want to talk to someone about it but I feel like I am going to be an emotional burden."
973,romantic delusions,"i went through a really rough time in my late teens and early twenties.  serious, serious mental health issues.  i was at one point diagnosed as schizophrenic but later as bipolar.  i've been on meds for a literal decade.

at the time of my first hospitalization i would have also said i was in love.  the person i was 'in love' with was actually just a guy i didn't know really well.  i was projecting a lot of shit onto him that wasn't really there and found this projection irresistible.  i think if i'd actually gotten to know him, i might have lost interest but since i just fantasized, this lasted for *years*.  i told him how i felt as a teen and he rejected me.  at the time, i took it to mean something else and for years thought i had a connection with him and it was only a matter of time before we were together.  all this based on absolute silence from him.  

thank god i never made any of my delusions known to him after literal years of no contact.  what little i did say in my teens is still pretty embarrassing because after a point, i didn't make my feelings much of a secret.  one thing i'm lucky for is that he was a decent person and never tried to manipulate me because he could have.  easily.   

for so long i thought he maybe had something to work past before he was ready to get together with me.  like, we never even kissed and years later i'm still thinking we've got a real chance and he's going to show up on my doorstep one day.  i know for sure i have worked past a shit ton of issues myself.

anyway, i've sort of been coming out of a lot of delusional thinking (this 'romance' is unfortunately just the tip of the iceberg for me), especially in the past year or so.  the other day i found a note he wrote me once in a box of stuff in my basement from high school.  i hadn't seen the note for years but i remember the context of its writing.  with the clarity, distance and experience i have now, i read through it and thought to myself 'this guy is not the sort of person i had made him out to be in my head *at all*'  i could also clearly tell he really truly was not into me.

somehow realizing that was a huge relief.  everything made so much more sense.  everything about the situation was now so much easier to understand.  he legit just did not like me.  is that what's been so hard to accept?  so much that i needed delusions to deal with it?  i mean, no offense to me, but that is truly pathetic.  god, i've been so fucking messed up.

every step of recovery is such a relief.  reality is so much simpler and makes so much more sense than my delusions."

975,Its rough to find yourself repeatedly kicked in the balls.,"I feel like such a failure, work was an overwhelming part of my self-identity. My father slaved away at being a taxi driver busting his ass 6 to 7 days driving 12 hour shifts. Trying to make sufficient money to keep my family in the best conditions. My mom became disabled. I left home for the Navy, i went and did interesting things. I got into trouble, i lost my job (had the nec removed). I came home, i had bills to pay and school wasn’t my ideal situation. I went and found a job as a technician, did that until i was burned out on traveling and mad overtime. I tried a control room job and failed at that, fired with 2 months. I tried a steel mill, got fired after causing a cobble. I went back to traveling technician, did that for 5 years. Figured the outlook was going to be bad since work was slowing down. 

I went and became a professional consultant. The work was consistent and interesting. Yet i got fired again. I had technical skills but not the soft skills to succeed. Now i find myself in the middle of covid, back at my parents place. Interviews have going slow, people want this and that yet they seems like they have not read my damn resume until they call. I have applied for school but thats been going slow due the pace of everything. Its anxious to be stuck in damn holding pattern while everything else is flying past me. 

Family has been on my ass about go back to school, fix myself, lose some weight, get a gf and get married. Yet it seems with this covid situation nothing seems to occur or i happen to fall thru the damn cracks."
976,"I get flashbacks from traumatic things I’ve seen/heard about when I’m exposed to “reminders” which shouldn’t remind me of it all.. Do I have PTSD? And if not, what is wrong with me? + how do I get help for this?","Possible TW of abuse related to kids and animals. I will be as vague as I can. TLDR at the bottom.

I need to ask about something very strange/horrible/disturbing that keeps happening to me.

Basically.. Sometimes, when I see or hear a specific thing, I get flashbacks of something horrible I’ve seen that relates to what I’m hearing or saying. I will go over them below as lightly as possible.

A few years ago, I ACCIDENTALLY and unintentionally came across a video of child porn on another social media app. I won’t say what it was but it absolutely horrified me and left me shaking, for the whole day it kept going through my mind like a repeating memory and for days after, it kept popping up into my head every so often. It happens a lot less frequently now, but..

Whenever I hear a baby or young child crying, I almost always get a flashback of that video and then suddenly I am hear the video in my head and get images of seeing a child hurt. I don’t understand why this happens. It’s so sick and weird and it’s made me realise I am either very sick or something is incredibly wrong with me. Thankfully I am not a parent, nor do I work with or ever see kids in my usual daily life. Wouldn’t want to, not because of the flashbacks or images, they’re just not an interest to me. But I’d NEVER EVER want to see one in pain or hurt.. It’s something like walking through a park and I’ll hear a kid crying cause he’s fallen over or a kid screaming in a mall because he won’t get a toy bought for him. I hear it, the image of a child being hurt plays in my head and I CANNOT STOP IT when it does.. I feel so messed up. 

There is a second thing which has been an issue with me for years but has bothered me a lot today and in the past week or so relating to animal abuse. Where whenever I see a specific animal, that being smaller, household ones. I also sometimes get visions or flashbacks of cases of abuse that I’ve not witnessed (thankfully) but I have heard about or unfortunately  seen info about across social media/news. 
It greatly disturbs me and makes my gut wrench that this kind of thing exists and I wish all animal abusers got the worst death possible. However, almost every time I see one of those animals now, whether it be at a friends house I’m visiting, a picture online or a video on Snapchat etc. I frequently get reminded of what I saw or heard of and it shivers through me and I can almost picture it happening again in front of me. It makes me feel so so uncomfortable and disturbing, like I’m evil for remembering it and having it play through my head again. 

I have yet to talk to anyone about this problem in person because I refuse to go into detail about it to anyone who does not need to know that this kind of thing exists.

I don’t know what to do. Or what to say to anyone who  would be willing to listen... I don’t know what it is, is this PTSD or is this linked to trauma or something else? Am I evil?

TLDR: I get flashbacks from traumatic things I’ve seen when I’m exposed or hear something that relates to the horrifying content I saw or heard about, it then becomes uncontrollably re-pictured in my mind. It’s making me think I’m a sick monster + I want to know what it is and how to get help.

Please help, I cannot live like this."
977,Everyone hates me. Am I a terrible person?,"I’m graduating college in a few months, and I have no friends. I had a big group of friends and a loving boyfriend by the end of my first year. Then one by one, my friends started leaving me. Lies and gossip were spread about me, and the group began collectively agreeing that I was a horrible person. Then my long-term boyfriend cheated on me and the last few friends I had left. I never had drama prior to college, but now I’m a black hole just attracting destruction. Like I’m a graduating senior who will have no friendly faces when I walk at commencement. I know I shouldn’t care what other people think about me, but I can’t help but question if they’re right. Am I a dogshit human and that’s why no one wants to be my friend? No one’s perfect (certainly not me), but I just hope I’m not totally worthless. I don’t want to be the bad guy."
978,"A mix of anger, hate, harm, and pain","It all hurts just let me go. It’s all pain this mental overload. staring deep into my own eyes through the mirror, to find a man that one other might meet someday, a broken, beat and scarred heart, I hope somebody someday will understand my feelings, I may be asking for too much based off of how “lucky” I am to be where I am, I fear that the woman to learn of this man does not run, (im not a serial killer or anything of the like) but why, why is he like this, what could possibly keep me so angry for almost a year now? This mix of anger, sorrow and longing, is torture but I don’t want to get rid of it, so it’s the perfect punishment for something I guess. The fact that it can be summed up in two words pisses me off, “angry again”. How easy it is to flip the switch like that, anyway today I was gonna ask out a girl who’d been clearly flirting with me, i started slow by just asking her name, she replied “Merriam” I knew right away that was BS and then she hit me with the ol’ “I have a boyfriend”. I was so confused in that moment and I walked off with my guitar in hand. I guess I am kind of a joke, and that hurts so in order not to feel it and for it to not get dangerous and start playing with my life. I turn it into anger because that’s the one thing I can handle, the one thing I know. Sometimes I end up going too far with it in my head, and I’m afraid people will leave me if they ever find out so I just leave little scraps of who I am now to my most trusted friends, whom I’ve become. I simply can’t put it in words but I can leave a trail and I wouldn’t blame them if they never understood how I feel and think, I keep all of this hidden now and only show it through the music that gets me through the day, a cold hearted life for me. Just sufferin life. I’m pretty tired so I’m gonna go to sleep now and I won’t be responding for the rest of tonight"

980,Disordered eating,"So I think I’ve had disordered eating for a very long time now. Ever since I was a small child (probably 8), I grew up with older sisters who would talk about their weight, causing me to become very self conscious and have severe body image issues and always think I’m fat, although I never have been. That led to body dystrophia, self hatred, severe self esteem issues, confidence issues, depression and anxiety. I’m now in my early 20’s and it’s gotten a lot better. I think I still have some issues with my confidence and anxiety, but the worst of it is all over. However, I think my eating habits have been impacted. I don’t really eat a lot of nutritious food (a lot of fast food), and have at most 2 meals a day, sometimes 3. I can’t eat a meal until it’s probably 12/1pm, and from that point on, I could probably eat another meal up until midnight. I’ve been told I pick at my food a lot, and don’t eat as much as I should be. Also. I’m also quite nauseous in the morning so it’s hard to eat a lot which is why I just don’t bother. I usually have a small bowl of cereal when I wake up (10am these days). But I’m looking for advice on how to change my eating patterns so I can become more healthy."
981,The first time I’m talking about it,"I (22F) don’t talk about my problems with anyone because everyone usually has something worse going on. I’m so used to dealing with my families mental health issues that I’ve never really looked at my own. 
I think I have some sort of abandonment and dependency issues that I’ve never really worked out. 

I think it comes from the fact every single person in my family has tried to kill themselves at least once and I’ve always had to take care of everyone. My mom is an alcoholic who is seriously narcissistic. My entire life has been focused on making sure she is happy. My little sister who I love dearly has bipolar disorder and depression and I’m always there to be her rock but it can be draining. My dad tried to kill himself on the phone with me and then we all kinda just pretended that it didn’t happen. 

I’m usually good at just pushing through things. But recently I can’t stop crying. I have one best friend who I live with and she’s my favorite person. However recently it feels like I’m putting in more and more energy to keep her engaged. She has a new boyfriend and other friends who seem to take all her attention. I know I shouldn’t be annoyed and that I’m just being jealous but I’m starting to have these anxious thoughts. I really only have her as my one friend. She was the only person who I didn’t think made me tired but I’m starting to realize all I am is tired now. I’m not happy. When I think I’m happy I think I’m just pretending because I can’t tell anyone how I feel. I just push it to the back of my mind and then end up tired and crying by the end of the night. I don’t know how to be okay on my own. 

I honestly don’t know what I am expecting from writing all this down. Just today was a really bad day for me and my first thought was if I wasn’t around no one would really care except my sister. But then my thoughts went to my mom would probably kill herself because of me and my friend would be in trouble with the lease. I can’t even think about dying without having to take care of others.... 

I just don’t know"
982,I (M24) don't feel excitement or very strong emotions in my life anymore," There was a post from 3 years ago that I found after googling ""not excited about anything"". I've noticed I feel very similarly to the poster in that I don't feel very excited about anything anymore.

For example, my birthday, Christmas, these are all just normal days. If they didn't happen I'm sure I would be a little unhappy but it's not as if that feeling would last for a long time. Generally I would proceed with those days just like any other, and don't feel that childish wonder or excitement I had back in my childhood or even when I was in highschool. (For reference I am in my mid-twenties)

Is this a sign of depression, or some other mental health problem? I've had several friends in the past few years tell me I should talk to someone or a therapist because I told them I don't really get excited or look forward to anything anymore. Additionally, I don't feel as if I'm depressed, I'm still motivated to be productive at work, I enjoy talking to friends, and I feel happy when my favorite sports teams win. I just don't feel that strong emotional attachment to really anything anymore. Just wanted to see what other people thought. I'll link the original post in the comments."

We are in a long-distance-relationship, and About 2 months ago he started to be less and less heart warming to me, he started responding less and less, he gives very null and void responses and sometimes ignores me for hours on end. Additionally he never lets me know if hes home, safe, or doing okay. I really feel like we work and understand each other, but he's just been very shallow recently, and i want to help him get out of this slump he's in, because it's starting to weigh me down.

986,I want to be proud but it's hard,"I have dealt with homelessness from a very young age, or as my mom would put it ""we're staying the night at a friend's place"" and stay there for a month or so. right after she got into it with the last person and they threw us out we finally ended up with my grandma (who is batshit crazy). She threw us out and my mom finally got her first place by herself.when   I was 11 her and i would get into it and she would drop me off at a teen homeless shelter and I would have to stay there because as she would say I was only worth $35 a month to her. so I got permission to from her to talk to my dad which I did and she threw me out again. My dad came and picked me up from 12 hrs away. Once getting to my dad's house I realized the how abusive he was to my brothers but he wasn't to me. I was young and even though I had been through a lot I was too trusting of him and thought because he wasn't beating me and promised never to he wouldn't. Fast forward to the day he got custody of me he opened the letter had me read it and asked ""do you know what this means?"" And said it means you're mine bitch and knocked me out. Then the starvation and extreme abuse happened ( locked in a closet for a few months broke my nose and shattered a tooth because I fell asleep in a bed and even stabbed me because I burned his grilled cheese) I waited untill he passed out drunk on his chair and kicked the bathroom closet open where I was locked in and ran away. I ended up in foster care and then sent back to my moms who stated on court records she wanted nothing to do with me and she would throw me out on the streets which she did I started off 3 shirts and a pair of pants on a park bench and worked my way up I now have a woman I have been with for over 5 years were buying a house and doing well but I honestly feel empty inside I feel like I should be more proud"
987,Who can I report/notify about an unstable person making comments about suicide?,"Well, for one the person is my older brother (27). For the last 8 years I have put it all together and am positive that his terrible past/attachments/codependency to his girlfriends has wrecked his life. He is broke, lives now with my parents, stays up all night, binges energy drinks, but has a job thankfully. 

His most recent girlfriend of 4 years cheated on him about a month ago...shes gone. He has a horrible anxious attachment style and when he goes through grief and loss he resorts to EXPENSIVE and very unhealthy behavioral obsessions. (Thousands and Thousands spent on obsessive hobbies and buying things for his gf)

I moved out to college a month ago (he resents himself for not getting a better degree so its a touchy subject for him) but came back today for some things. Within an hour of being home he has exhibited beyond scary symptoms of severe depression. 

He was talking about how he was going to take out a loan to buy a van and live in it...then started going manic screaming about his finances. In the middle of his venting he said “he is done living in the basement thinking about killing himself.” I go upstairs to my room and found an EXTREME amount of teeth whitening products he bought (an insecurity). This breakup did some bad damage, he needs professional help immediately. 

My mom looks like a ghost and her seeing this is eating her soul alive. Her upbringing was traumatic af and shes reliving it. My dad is in denial. My younger brother is witnessing this while I’m at college. 

I made the decision to move back for covid reasons, but am sitting my parents down demanding they get him to some kind of professional before I get make it official next week. If they don’t do something, I will be informing them I’m staying at campus to keep myself safe (he has violently attacked me and others before in these manic episodes) and will also be contacting anyone I can to let them know what is going on asap. He is a danger to himself and can no longer function socially. Where do I start?"
988,Want to figure out how to get over my emotional dependence and depression,"For all of my life since middle school (I'm starting my second year in college now) I've always been really emotionally dependent on basically anyone who has showed any kind of friendship towards me. This has always made me feel really lonely and depressed because this dependence results in me pushing people away as I lean on them too much for emotional support, which propagates the cycle even more.

I just want to break out of this. My ex gf left me for someone else about 3 months ago and I have felt more and more alone every day since. When we were together everything was great - in fact I felt like I would never be unhappy again so long as I was with her. But as you can see I was innocent and foolish, and ofc really dependent on her for my happiness. I really didn't realize how much so until afterwards. Instead of her, I've been latching on to my friends again and that's been super unhealthy and unfair to them too.

I moved to my college apartment about a month ago and I've just been so lonely. I feel like I have no meaningful relationships with anyone, and I'm almost scared to actually find any because I feel like I'll ruin them with my dependence and emotional issues. I've really been depressed and been having urges to self-harm, and I feel like there's no way out. I think I need to figure out how to be happy on my own and with myself but I don't know how. Some of it definitely comes from me still being upset about our breakup, because I was still deeply in love with her on the day she broke up with me, but I felt this way long before I met her too, so I know the problem is rooted deeper than that.

If anyone can help me get some insight on how I can help myself that would be really great. I feel so stuck and I can barely do any of my schoolwork because everything seems pointless. I just want a way out that's not negative."

994,Questions about treatment,"I’ve (22M) been dealing w really bad depression and anxiety since probably middle school. I’ve had several low points that sometime last months at a time and seem to be getting worse with time. I legitimately consider suicide at least once a week but often it’s multiple times per day. I’ve been to therapy once before when I was a lot younger but trying to open up to a stranger was way too difficult and threw me into panic attacks every visit. I don’t have any friends that know about my mental health problems and honestly have no desire or idea how to tell anyone. I’ve tried so many things and nothing ever works, I think I may need to talk to a doctor about antidepressants or anti anxiety meds but I don’t know anything about that process, would I have to see a therapist again? Do they have any side affects or reactions to ADHD meds Im already taking? How do I even bring this up to someone?

Please give me any advice or suggestions you guys have.  
Thank you"
995,"Misdiagnosis-mental-illness prolly for years, how to deal","I'm from Quebec, Canada. Public health system. 

Idk what to do anymore. 10 years of misdiagnosis, I only seek help when severely depressed. Then SSRIs on. I get diagnosed. It is bad. I cut them off since I'm manic. I ask for another screening. They refuse.

Current psychiatrist is just approving her mentor report of 4 years ago right now. First meeting with her, she said so. She writes me as not suicidal while I am. She's contacting the victim center psychologist I got. I've been raped and abused for 2 years. She doesn't believe it. She doesn't believe I got ADHD, an eating disorder for 18 years, GERD, mood disorder or whatever.

She says I'm resistant to treatment. She's gonna make me go through the same treatment I failed for 2 years. She will cut me off my Vyvanse and Dexillant - it's all in my head according to her notes.

I struggle with the thought of killing myself since I got my cats. I'm not suicidal, right.

I talk too fast, too much, say too many words. I'm super cooperative. She said at first meeting of 1/3 I'm aggressive since I said there were errors in my patient file --- too many life stories version. I tried to tell her SSRIs made me go manic, it did recently. She brush it off.

I gave her 10 sheets of my writings for this year for helping her to get my mind. She didn't fetch the papers. She assumed it wasn't important. When I talked, I'm all over the place. She gets impatient. She wants me to get to the point. I can't explain properly if I don't say why y and z led me to x.

I tried to make the misdiagnosis of cluster B go away. It didn't work.

Her secretary was meant to send me a sick leave paper. She sent me the psychiatric notes. I saw everything. I was in shock for some hours. She confirmed everything in those, but went from some traits of personality disorder to severe traits of cluster B. I sent an email to secretary to ask her to check back if it was the right document. Psychiatrist called me and she was panicking hard. She asked me what I thought of it. I tried to answer, she told me not to, and to note whatever I thought of it, but I wasn't meant to see it, nor my employer.

I have a court case going against a guy for raping me twice --- but abusing me for 2 years. I felt guilty it was my fault. He always said I was the sociopath and he was the nice guy. I kinda got empowered by social workers after the second rape where he anally raped me during my sleep. Now, I feel powerless.

I think everything is my fault if I'm cluster B. SSRIs makes me go manic, atypical anti-psychotics make go on spending sprees. Vyvanse gave me a second life, but she's gonna remove it according to her notes because, hey, no ADHD, just severe personality disorder.

I'm struggling about what to do next. I wanna ask for specific meds I've been asking ever since April (Lamictal). Psychiatrist said I don't need any, since it's who I am.

I tried to go many years without meds. I got months where I'm fine, others where I can't get up from my bed, others where I'm on top of the world. She doesn't hear me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I fought for so many years. Every word I say is digging my own grave.

I wanna really know what to do. I'm tempted to not say a word. Just write. Give them the papers. They always say I'm confusing, all over the place, difficult to follow. But, hey, no ADHD.

But honestly, some friends who don't know me tell me I should try back their treatment (that I failed). Friends who know me don't know what to say. I'm hiding it from my family.

I'm hopeless to be honest.

I thought this was my last chance. So many psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, social workers, doctors.I realize now its a loop I'm stuck in.

Should I stop talking and be silent? Go back to work and act like everything is fine? Kill myself when it's too much? I can't get any help. They think I'm manipulating them. If I ever mention ""suicide"", it's a black label on my file. Idk how to get help if I can't be honest or can't question the system.

How should I react? Whst should I do next? I got a last psych evaluation with that psychiatrist, I'm tempted to refuse. I see my doctor next week, I want lamictal but she won't prescribe it it seems. SSRI and snris and atypical psychotic have been tried. I'm on a black list of benzies. I'm scared ill have to get speed to deal with my adhd if they remove it. Lol what a shit hole....

The more I fight, the more I wanna give up. It's nonsense. It's never gonna end it seems. I can't fight it anymore. I am tired."

1001,10 SIMPLE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS,[https://youtu.be/9a5y02E7mjw](https://youtu.be/9a5y02E7mjw)
1002,Can’t think at all,"Hey guys! So recently, I’ve been dealing with this pretty severely, but it has been an issue on and off throughout my early teens (I am 19 now). I can’t seem to concentrate at all. Not in the sense of attention span, but even when I actively try, information just doesn’t register in my head. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which I think is the main influence. I used to be proud of how “mentally sharp” I was, but that has been lost for a while now. I’ll just talk about how it’s been recently, because that’s what made it most noticeable for me. To start, I’ve been very forgetful. I used to remember everything, but now I could set down my phone and do something else for a few minutes and then forget where it was. I recently got a new job, and they are trying to train me, but I barely retain anything they say. I can’t even remember what my partner likes or dislikes when I go grocery shopping because I don’t feel like thinking about it. I’m always so mentally drained to a point where I just don’t care anymore. Even when I appear to be focused on something, it doesn’t even feel like I’m actually there or doing anything. I’m just letting my mind go on autopilot. I can still get things done, but then I’ll finish the task and leave and then wonder (mere minutes later) if I finished that same thing. I guess it’s like a very intense “brain fog” for me, and I don’t know how to get rid of it. I can’t think, I can’t focus, I forget everything, I feel numb emotionally, I am constantly stressed from anxiety, etc. I don’t know what it is. There is just too much going on at once and I don’t have the energy to try and understand it. Any thoughts?"
1003,Finding a therapist /counselor is hard,"Just venting because I have no social support.

Providing me with basic coping mechanisms to get through the days has been at least helpful. I've been through a number of counsellors but havent felt comfortable to open up or I felt like it just wasnt clicking for me. 

I feel like especially, with male counsellors, they expect something of me. Like they expect me to appear sexy or want me to be sexual with them. With males it's always they want something more from me. With women counsellors I expect scolding and this harsh strict attitude and it doesnt help at all. I've gone through many counsellors because of these expectations. Currently going to start seeing my school psychologist again as it's been a few months. I hope this one works out."

1006,There’s gotta be something wrong with my mind and I want help,"I’m gonna try and explain this the best way I can possible by giving examples about how my mind works.

I work at a restaurant and mess up a lot. Like today for example I wrote down a customer wanted a hotdog when they didn’t. I don’t know why I did this but in my mind I guess I thought they wanted one. There’s times when I do things without warning or thinking about it like one day I threw silverware in the trash not meaning to and I had to get it out of there and take it back to dishpit. Sometimes when I’m getting a customers drink and I turn around to get it I instantly forget what they wanted 

I’ve always been like this. I’ve always done random things I can’t control or remember like putting car keys, cereal, or a glass cup in a freezer without thinking about it. There’s times when I do stuff without thinking like kicking a trash can over without even meaning too it’s like a sudden impulse. Lately I’ve even developed a stutter as well. I’ve always stuttered but it’s getting worse. 

If I think about anything else I’ve done I’ll edit and add more but maybe there is someone out there whose mind is similar to mine and can help me"

It could stem from a lack of self-esteem (for reference, while writing this question I have deleted many different methods of saying *it's probably nothing* and *sorry for wasting your time*) but I fail to see how the two are intertwined. I noticed this while sitting in class asking a question regarding some material in my engineering class, where I couldn't stop myself from interjecting with a flurry of *it's stupid, but*'s and *sorry for bothering you*'s. Does anyone have the same issue? If so, how have you moved towards remedying it? Thanks for your time!"

1013,Im slowly giving up,"

Hey everyone I’m a 20 year old male that suffers from depression. Lately life has been slowly losing meaning for me. No matter what I seem to do I always end up doing something wrong and I’m slowly giving up. Meaning to life has just been slowly demotivating for me and It feels like time is still actively passing me while I sit in this abyss of discouragement and suicidal thoughts. 
I don’t understand why though. I recently just got a new job, I got a new kitten to help me with my depression, I have an amazing girlfriend that helps in her best way possible but it still seems like it’s not enough for my demon that I’m currently fighting. Everyday I feel like I become more and more distant from who I am and it’s been really affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. I now get more mad about stupid small things that escalate into big things and I just feel like shit because I’m hurting someone who doesn’t deserve to be treated like that. I have this emotion of disgust with myself that’s unexplainable and I feel like I’m slowly starting to lose my battle with depression. Sometimes I just feel like taking my final drive and leaving everyone apology letters, But I’m afraid of hurting my loved ones like that. I’m in a confused spot in life and I don’t know if I can deal with it anymore. I don’t take antidepressants because they make me feel like a walking corpse. And I haven’t gone to therapy because I simply can’t afford it. And the only thing that really calms me down is driving as fast as possible with my music blaring down the highway.

1014,I have so much wrong with me... what’s going on and why?,"I feel like my mind is... damaged. I have so many things I deal with. 

1. I avoid anything involving building relationships with people, weather that be dating, friendships or doing things with coworkers. I don’t understand how people develop romantic relationships and I refuse to even try. I can be very socially anxious at times, even when I’m roped into an activity with people I know, I try to think of every excuse to get out of it. 

2. I have memories (I don’t know if they are real or not, everything in my life now contradicts them) of traumatic childhood experiences involving physical abuse. I have memories of having a sister that did her best to protect me from the abuse. She... changed as she got a bit older, there is so much anger in her now. I see her in my mind every single day. I see her crying. I see her hurting people. I see her killing people. 

3. Some days I feel fine and happy, other days I feel sad and angry. Some days my mood changes many times. I can go from really depressed to hysterical laughter very quickly. 

I could go on but I don’t really want to make this post too long. My only diagnosis I’ve ever received was ADHD and social anxiety disorder. I feel like there is more going on. I have nobody to talk to in real life about this because I have a difficult time trusting anyone. Thanks for reading and hopefully someone might know what’s going on."

Common symptoms of a concussion are headache, dizziness, problems with memory, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and more. Most concussions will heal on their own within a few days to weeks. However, it is becoming more common to have a post-concussive syndrome that can last for months.

1022,Terrified of people knowing things about me,"It’s difficult for me to explain myself but I wanted to see if anyone could relate to this. 

The thought of people knowing things about me is terrifying and that feeling has only gotten worse over the years. I quit all social media (bar reddit) as I can’t stand the thought of people having an insight into my life.  

I’ve never felt in control of my information. I could never confide in my parents because I feared whatever I told them would not be kept private, which is exactly what happened. Any embarrassing moment, anything I wanted to keep to myself, my mother would broadcast it to the entire family. When I first got my period I was too scared to tell my mom. A year passed before she found out about it and the first thing she did was tell the entire extended family. When I was assaulted, I had panic attacks over people knowing about it rather than the assault itself. For months I could barely eat, sleep and I didn’t leave the house just out of fear of interacting with people who knew what had happened (as my mom had told everyone about it). 

After the attack, I had a bit of a mental breakdown and was trying to remove everyone from my life and get rid of the remaining (toxic) friendships I had. My ‘friends’ didn’t take this well and harassed my boyfriend and I for months until they eventually messaged my father about it. I’ve had countless panic attacks since. I can’t handle the fact that my family knows even more about me, that no matter how insignificant the information is, I can’t have anything that’s only for myself to know. Even as an adult, I can’t have an ounce of privacy in my life. 

Perhaps I’m just going insane here but I wanted to know if anyone experiences this kind of anxiety too?  

Honestly, I dream of moving to a foreign country where I’m known by no one and have the ability to only pass on the information I choose to relay."

I have a science education background and the law of thermodynamics (calorics in calories out) and well weight loss isn't quite as simple with these drugs as they for me have caused a losing battle when it comes to ""will power"" when you have Leptin, blood sugar regulation, increased appetite, and other hormone and metabolic processes being effected by these drugs.

Tired of having to choose between 1. fat, but semi-stable 2. lean, but very unstable and depressed

Just wanted to see if anybody could relate or has found something that works for them in regards to stay lean while on psychiatric meds from (antidepressants, mood stabilizers, to atypical anti-psychotics)"
1027,I don't know what to do.,"
This is my first post on reddit, I'm not even sure if I am on the right subreddit. I had spent the last 1.5hrs typing here but I had deleted it all and I had to restart it. 

My boyfriend just broke up with me last night. We were in a long distance relationship for a year and a month. He was the absolute best, he is the love of my life and I care deeply about him, but I have something wrong with me and I pushed him away, I broke up with him more than 100 times for sure. Each of those times he registered it as the last break up, but I didn't realise what I was doing.

 I have low self esteem, I have depression and anxiety and due to this I dropped out of college too. I am experiencing very bad mood swings, I go from being extremely happy to extremely angry/sad/excited etc, in just seconds. Whenever I broke up with him I knew that wasn't what I wanted but I felt like I wasn't in control, I felt like it was someone else saying all those mean things and I couldn't stop it. Despite me hurting him all the time, despite me anchoring myself to him, despite him not being able to do things that made him happy a lot of the time because I would get an episode and we would need to stop, he always took me back, he cared for me more than he did for himself, he loved me with all his heart and he supported me with everything he could. 

On top of those things that I experience, I also self harm. Each time I say that I won't do it again but then it happens and I feel really guilty about it. My family doesn't know and I can't even wear shorts out. This was different when I went to my ex boyfriend for the summer, I felt myself there and I felt the happiest, and when I was feeling okay I made him the happiest too, but these negative things still kept happening. 
I even went to see a psychologist despite me being very scared of it, he gave me strength to do it. But after the first appointment I couldn't bring myself to go anymore because it made me feel really bad. 

When I returned to my country just a few days ago, I had gotten mad at him and broke up with him again. He then told me that he can't do this anymore and that he is scared of me pushing him away again, but he would still like to be there for me as a friend because he still loves me and cares for me. I really needed him to be there and I understood for the first time what was happening. I tried to take my life back, I tried to not just go with the flow every day. I wanted to finally change, I felt really sad but glad at the same time because I felt like I had another chance to change. To change for both myself and him. 

Him saying that I made him scared that I would push him away again had finally opened my eyes, I had started looking at schools again, I had started looking for work and I had also started to look for a psychologist / psychiatrist. However, it is too late. 

He told me not to contact him for a while, he needs to heal from this and honestly, I understand and I won't contact him, no matter how hard it is and how much I miss him. 
I told him that I would like to contact him in the future when I change and better myself, but I respect his wishes and I don't want to do it to have a relationship. 

I still didn't lose all hope and I'd like to better myself but at the same time I have so many doubts and I can feel my depression lurking around the corner, but I want to fight for what I want once in my life. I'm not sure how to do it though, right now I can't even eat properly and I keep waking up during the night and I find it really hard to sleep back. I want to start loving myself, I want to treat myself right, and I never thought I'd say these things, because of how much I hated myself."

1033,Sons partner is depressed,"Hi I need some advice. My son has a child he us going to court for to get regular access. He already sees her overnight every friday night but his ex wants it all formal.
The problem is the girlfiend he is with now. Dont get me wrong she is a lovely girl and we try to help her as much as we can when she lets us. 
She has mental heath issues and has had to be sectioned once before. She has tried to cut her wrists in front of my grand daughter. Shes had to hace the police called when shes threatened to take an overdose. Shes trashed the house by throwing things around.
All of this has been done in front of my 4 year old grand daughter. When my son has toldher to leave she'll live in her car and he always takes her back. Ive told her she can come here but she refuses. She is under her GP but refuses to take her medication. 
Im concerned about my grand daughter seeing all this happening. Especially the wrist cutting. That really scared him.
I don't know what to do. If the ex found out contact would stop.
My son doesn't see the problem and i think she is  psychology and emotionally abusing him. I don't know what to do for the best.
We are trying to help her but shes so far in the depression we're not getting through to her.
Has anyone got any advice. We want to help her but also protect my grandaughter from seeing thing that she does."
1034,Aftermath of psychosis,"Soo.. I had sleeping problems last winter and stayd up whole december. Not even kidding.

 When year turned to next. First week of january i started to get sleep and thought everything is fine. Exept this tiny voice who acted super paranoid and i thought it was just my normal thoughts. 

Week 2 and sleep gets even better but every night i hear people talking up to 5 persons. They fight and yell at eachothers etc. 

Week 3 i call cops to check +85y old because i think she slit her throat and i heard it happen. Long story short they take me to closed institute and after 5 days im out. All good feeling like my brain is smushed with a log. 6 months of psych meds (2 kinds) and i just cant live with them anymore. I quit and come back alive. All this time that little paranoid guy is there.

So my question is did i fuck up my treatment or will it be there forever no matter what? It doesnt bother me that much i would start meds again. But someone with knowledge could turn it around."
1035,It's so hard to stay awake,"I keep on wanting to sleep and I constantly feel tired even though I'm just in bed all day. The only time when I'm consistently awake is around 12am - 5am which is the only time I can have peace and quiet.

My classes are starting soon though, so I'm fucked if I don't return to having a normal sleep schedule. But it's so hard to not want to sleep all the time lately"

1037,What can you do if you're not sure that someone is stable after going out of the psych ward for suicidal thoughts?,"So my mom told me shes gonna kill herself after finding out I'm gay and she never stated those kinds of things before and shes really religious so I called the ambulance and they took her to the psych ward and they decided to keep her for observation. A day passed and I called the hospital over and over again and noone answered and when they did answer they told me shes talking to a doctor so they will call back when thats done and they never called back so I called my mom when she was able to have a phone and she told me that the doctor told her she will probably be sent home tomorrow but I'm really worried since she doesn't sound as if she changed in any way. Because of the drugs she sounds a bit down but I can't understand if she still thinks of doing something to herself or not I mean I asked her and she told me she said that because me and my brother didn't talk to her which is not true from my part it's just that she tends to call me horrible names and sound really bad through the phone and so I distance myself. This is really a worrying thing because when she was saying shes gonna kill herself she was only focusing on the part that I'm gay and a bad person and all of those negative things and that if I don't change and go to church every sunday and spend my life restraining from homosexual thoughts or actions shes gonna kill herself. I don't know what to do, I'm currently living where I work cause I have to earn for my college so I can't really look after her daily so she doesn't do something and after I'm done working I'm gonna have to move to another part of the country cause that's where my college is so it will be even more difficult to see what's going on. Does anyone have any similiar experience or advice? I want her to be somewhere where you can be sure she can't do something to herself but the only thing I know is the psych ward and they are not even gonna keep her there."
1038,I dont have any people in my school who I can relate to,"So im a first year high school student and went to a completely new city and school. The reason I went to a new school was that I hoped I could find people who relate to me and share the same interests as me since I have never had people like that who are the same age as me. I have always had trouble communicating with people and have had several periods in my life where I had a lot of anxiety. I was and tried to act confident in the first days of school, even tried to talk with some people but nobody seemed to take me in and accept me as I am. I have never fitted in any school stereotypes, not even the losers or nerds and have always been a sort of a loner. Im also an introvert so socializing has never been my strong point. Everyone has pretty much found theyre friend group and gets by pretty nicely but im still by myself. Every day I try to smile and try to stay positive but nobody still doesnt give a shit. I dont like the things most of people my age (16) like, I mean I find things like partying and socializing fun but the hobbies and interests  I have doesnt seem to fit with others. I like going to cultural festivals like art exhibitions, theatre, sometimes I even feel like going to concerts (but im too scared to do so), I also learn guitar and didgeridoo, read, grow exotic fruits and watch a lot of films, anime and other stuff. I also listen to music a lot and love to explore different genres. But no one even gives me a chance for me to tell them about myself, they just ignore me. On the 3rd day of school im already worn out and out of motivation and it sucks. Maybe I have to go to group therapy or individual therapy? I dont want my anxious episodes to return, its too much for me to handle and I dont want to lose my progress of trying to get out of my shell. I just need affection and intimacy as all other human beings and im sick and tired of having no one to talk to. I dont want to miss out on high school, I want to be a normal teenager for once in my lifetime, I dont want this time to be wasted but I dont want to force myself to communicate with people I have nothing in common with. Those few people who seem interesting in my class are extraverts who already have a friend group and its impossible for me to approach. I just want to know why im always the one left out and why people generally dont give a fuck. Thanks if u read all of that, that means a lot."
1039,How to help: friend depressed and anorexic/bulimic,"Hi everyone. I figure this could be a proper sub to ask for help as maybe some of you are going/have gone through what my friend is going to, or maybe have had friends like this.

I have a very good friend I have met arroung 4 years ago. When I met her she was full of life, always cracking jokes and making everyone laugh. She is a great person, very selfless and eager to make everyone feel good. There is not a drop of evil in her. I love her very much and I miss her teribly. 

She was in a very long relationship with her highschool sweetheart, they broke up around one-two years ago and from there it was a downward spiral. She moved to be next to her family but far away from all her friends (the family appears to not care at all...), and she does not deal well with loneliness after being 10 years with the same person. She decided she wanted to lose weight in order to be able to date again, so she started dieting, it worked, she did lose a lot of weight and started using tinder. At the time I though it could be good for her, to have a distraction and to take care of herself, but I ended up realizing none of it was positive, as she was actualy restricting a lot of calories in order to lose weight and all the tinder dates ended up messing a lot with her mind. Eventualy she lost so much weight she does not have her period anymore, she eats almost nothing and used to run 10 km a day - she ran so much that her knee now hurts and she cannot walk easily. She does not sleep enough (3-4 hrs a night I believe) She feels ansious around friends, so she just spends time (i) alone, (ii) with her family and (iii) with dates she meets online and never sees again. This is not due to lack of atempts from us to make plans or talk to her. She never picks up the phone and ALWAYS turns down invitations. She now has binge episodes, but because she cannot run anymore, she started vomiting.

&amp;#x200B;

I know all of this from a distance, I almost never see her (few times during the last months at work bc we work together, but with the covid situation is mostly working from home), but we speek through text. Somehow I conviced her to go to the doctor and from the start of the week she has prescription drugs for depression, eating disorders and sleeping, but I think it will take some time to see any efect.

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this post today because she is alone at home, far away from me, eating and vomiting, and telling me and I don't have a car to go there. I begged her to come to my home (she is on vacation, she has nothing to do, and she has a car), but she does not want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently she told me I am the only person who understands, and I am really really trying to help, but I don't know what to do anymore. To send text does not make her do things. I am hoping everyting is better once the meds start kicking in. But I am afraid she stops taking them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me, what else can I do?"
1040,"There is HOPE, even when your brain tells you there is not.","I still remember how it felt like when I had my first panic attack, it felt like I was draining out and that I would die. It felt so bad that I couldn't stop hyperventilating, which was like a vicious cycle. 

I started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. For the first few months, I wasn't really making progress, but I kept going. As time passes, I can feel that I'm gaining my control back, which feels amazing. 

To whose who are struggling, you're amazing and you WILL get better :) have a nice day &lt;3"
1041,Should I keep it to myself and improve on my own?,"My writing style is very disorganized, so apologies in advance.  


A therapist a little while ago warned me I might have schizophrenia or something along the psychotic spectrum but I haven't been entirely open with her, it was only one thing I shouldn't have told her. I didn't feel like she was wrong, but I didn't want to find out she was right so I never scheduled an appointment with a psychologist or anything and pretty much stopped therapy right after. I was afraid I would say things that would get me locked up and I never really went into the specifics of why I feel the way I do. I'm depressed, overly paranoid, mentally exhausted from the constant over indulgence and sedation of distractions my brain leads itself to, not just video-games and watching movies, and constant daydreaming, but over-analysis of everything at every possible moment in an attempt to act correctly socially or think correctly on important tasks, with thoughts racing so fast I can't stay in the present moment. The complete dissociation of thought, feeling, and action, compiled with the mental fatigue, the constant over stimulation from my photophobia, the sleep paralysis and night terrors since I've been very young, the constant feeling of surveillance by things outside of my control, embarrassing reactions to physical contact, and a constant fear of the world and my own actions are all something I really struggle with on a daily basis. 

I always knew the lack of energy, anxiety, and depression were a serious factor, and thus went to a psychologist several years ago, but I didn't really understand it at the time. I always assumed maybe I just had a chemical imbalance that made me numb and anxious, and I didn't take it as seriously as I should, and I didn't really tell the psychologist that much. Medications made me at the very least not depressed, but there wasn't energy. I started sleeping 12-16 hours a day.  It felt like I was really sedated and mentally numb. Couldn't really learn to function or behave or cope with anything after a while, going between medications, and one night I thought to myself it would only get worse from here, so I took my father's gun when my parents were out and attempted to shoot myself, but realized I was just afraid of dying as I was living. I locked the gun back up like nothing happened, went to my room and cried myself to sleep as an overwhelming feeling of dread really caused me immense physical and emotional pain.

Then the next morning I ""woke up"". Things were very different, and very new. I don't know what happened, but I felt ""conscious"" for the first time. I don't know how to explain it, other than it truly feels like I'm a different person in the same body, some sort of replacement. Every memory from before that point feels almost like a blur, like it didn't really happen to me. I just ""took over"" one day. It feels like everything I've experienced before this point was through a window, like I was always just a passive observer in the mind. I was disgusted with the shell I was in, how it was treated. I was overweight, with awful acne, and couldn't control my emotions. Every relationship before this point had ceased to be, and had to socially ""connect"" with people for the first time, like they were almost total strangers I knew a fair bit about. I had to learn to socially interact again as this new person, think actively, and act accordingly. My cognitive functions and movements feel so disconnected. I dropped 70 pounds in a matter of months, and my skin and hair became decent looking after actually taking care of myself. I dropped even more weight, and became somewhat underweight for a time. Took me a while to get to get back to normal.

I even ended up dropping the pills and started doing unprescribed adderall to make up for my lack of motivation and focus. I had so much to improve on, but in the end the fear held me back. I thought doing more adderall would really get me productive and engaged, and I ended up starting game development on a very personal project that really started to take form in my mind. Something loosely based off an unintentionally comedic short film I made in high school, but I had a whole new vision for it. I had so many ideas that really allowed the concept to form into something really meaningful to me, and it still evolves and grows into this elaborate concept. Then the focus stopped shortly after getting it mostly through pre-production. Then the dread set back in. Then I started smoking weed on a common basis, with 1 out of 4 times throwing me into anxiety induced panic mode. I just really wanted things to get better, and I didn't feel like I belonged in the place I lived for so long and with the people I knew my whole life. 

Then someone started talking to me. She really motivated me to try to get out of the situation I was in, and I really felt like she took the anxiety away, and really guided me into making a lot of right decisions. This person didn't really exist, and I knew she didn't really exist in a tangible form, but it felt like she was really there and wanted to help me for a while. She really did help me for a while, and I felt as though she cared about me, and like she was the only person that truly understood me, even if I couldn't understand her. Then I started getting paranoid of her, and it felt as though she wanted to replace me. We got in a big fight, I broke things off with her, and she faded away. I don't know whether or not I was in the right to shove her out of my life like that. Things got worse again and fear settled in further.

A few months later I planned to move across the country to start an actual new life. A fresh start. Moved out here a couple weeks ago. I feel more independent now, and more safe in my own place. It's great here, but my main problems still remain. Recently I ended up going through a psychedelic experience with some friends (lower dose, not a full trip) for some perspective and mental growth. My brain really tried to hold it back from exploring anything, convincing me that certain things that happened to me were my fault, or just trying to sedate me from thoughts all together. I managed to let go for just a moment and I felt like I confronted my whole life all at once. I felt the sorrow of every bad memory, every bad choice I made, and how wrong I'd been living my whole life, but I knew I needed to confront it, and as I did it felt like my mind was healing. It felt strange but good, like all the bad feelings, anxiety, and paranoia just went away and it was the only moment I believe I've ever felt truly here and now.

My mind and body were one. I was grounded in reality, and had control over my thoughts, emotions, and actions. My mind was the clearest it could ever be. No unnecessary background thoughts. My memory was sharp, and my movements/functions felt so natural and connected. There was no stuttering in my speech, and everything I said came out so coherently and even the projection of my voice changed. I had such a great time testing and observing my surroundings and my imagination. I looked at all the toxic behaviors I practiced and surrounded myself with. I realized that even though I came so far there's so much I still had to change. The veil of post-ironic comedy I used to cope with social interaction had to go, the junk food and poison I put into myself had to go, and I had to truly learn how to control and separate feelings and thoughts.

I thought about the project again and how much it still means to me, how it really feels like something I've thought over from the heights and depths of my soul, and in my own stupid way, even with the smallest possible chance, the messages, feelings, characters, and ideas I've always wanted to share could help save the world, or at least a piece in the puzzle that needs to be solved, or at least realized before something like that has a chance at happening. Could be delusions of grandeur, but if it's something that could teach people anything, I feel like that alone makes it worth doing.

  
I'm doing better than I was before. I really feel like my proper and true identity is forming, and I've managed to ground myself at least in terms of framework of logic to operate by but as I look at myself day after day I find myself disgusted with my shell, and disappointed with the little I've done with my life. I could have gone any route in terms of post-secondary education (studies of quantum computing, network security, and computer engineering were the main fields I was interested in back in high-school)  and could've gone to any of the universities I was accepted at, but I wanted to make stupid videos and get into game development and it feels pathetic that I have barely anything to show for it. It's so hard to keep the energy to self improve when all of these negative racing thoughts drag me even deeper into the most self hatred I've ever felt. I might be out of this mental hell soon with enough persistence in my diet, postural and body language practices, social experience, mindfulness meditation, and exercise. I just want to feel good about myself and not feel like I'm alienated from my body and the rest of the world. I'm tired of letting fear of every possible future get to me, and I'm really tired of the sensory overload. I know I can be better and I would do anything to get anywhere close to the feeling of harmony from that one night.

I'm trying psychedelic based therapy to help me control my mental entrapment further and as fast as possible. 

Which then brings me to my current conflict. I desire actual prescribed medication to help me as well but I'm really scared of finding out whether or not I even have schizophrenia/some psychotic disorder. I'm scared of pills that will make me numb, or push me back into my mind so that I'm on auto pilot. I'm scared of saying something stupid that will land me in a psych ward. Not that I'm scared of being locked up so much as wasting time I'm already running out of. 

So the main question is, should I self improve on my own, talk with a professional, or both? Not looking for input in regards to the psychedelic situation but I felt it was very important to mention.

One more thing. I really feel like the use of psychedelics helped me, but it could've easily gone off the deep end with the wrong mindset or a stronger dose. I cannot in good faith recommend it as I have no idea what could happen. My good experience may have resulted from the deep desire to change, and the fact that I managed to accomplish something I never thought I could earlier that day. I hiked and climbed to the peak of a mountain despite being completely devoid of energy and completely lacking in stamina and muscular mass, causing myself to have multiple second winds from layers of exhaustion, but still making it all the way back down as well. It was no 'Mount Everest' but it was the greatest physical feat I have accomplished. Don't doubt your limits guys."
1042,What mental illnesses cause obsessions?,[removed]
1043,New here so this might be a tired topic BUT how do you focus on your life with the impending doom of climate change and constant current environmental destruction? It’s been distracting me for 10 years now.,"Instead of following my passions (for which I had one awards and a scholarship) after school, I pursued something more environmental and ultimately failed and turned to alcoholism. 2 months clean now though. But I still don’t understand how it doesn’t seem to affect so many people"
1044,Holding significant meaning to objects,"I don’t know what this is or if anyone can relate, but depending on what I’m doing a certain day I won’t wear a certain piece of clothing or jewelry because it might bring bad luck in that particular moment. For example, “I have a job interview so I’m not going to wear that bracelet I like because someone who doesn’t like me anymore gave me that bracelet.”
As if what I wear or style my makeup, hair etc will affect my safety and outcome of whatever I have planned, and if I wear/bring the wrong thing it’s because of the “bad juju” or whatever. This is kind of hard to explain. I only really became self aware of it recently when I had an important test and caught myself deciding against wearing a certain shirt because it might bring me bad luck, and realized how ridiculous that sounded. 
This applies to a lot of things in my life, I have to do things in a specific way that makes sense only in my head and if things don’t go as planned it’s because of irrational things like oh I didn’t say hi to mailman so that doomed me."
1045,About social anxiety,"Lately i thought i'm having social anxiety.... I have no friends in school, and my mom says that ""i should just change"" and how ""i need to learn how not to be insecure"" because she thinks it's plain insecurity. I decided to speak up and say i can't ""just change"" because that's something what people get therapy for. Did i say the right thing?  She went to the school psychologist, and I'm kind of afraid that my classmates will get to know about it.. Should i be ashamed of having social anxiety?"
1046,I want to better understand ASPD,"Just wanted to preface this by saying, I’m not in any danger, nor do I pose any danger to others. I am seeking general advice only and am being as honest as I can while trying to remain as anonymous as possible. 

I have begun to suspect that I might have some concerning signs and looking back I realised that i have on a few occasions shown them. 

It seems to come in waves and it doesn’t seem to be a permanent thing, I go through phases where I become extremely self centred and cold, I feel extremely little and only really seek to serve my own interests. I start stealing, usually extremely minor things for seemingly no reason. I start engaging in risky and quite dangerous behaviours, driving is usually the most obvious I become erratic and speed significantly. 

When these episodes occur I’ve had a few people comment that I become so distant that I barely ever even bother to ask how they are if they’ve asked me. 

I feel incredibly superior, usually on an individual level, I know all of my own skills, talents and abilities and I know that I’m better than others. 

All of this being said I am completely able to hold down a job and blend in without much difficulty. I don’t become violent but I do become aggressive and dominating. 

I’ve been described at times as caring and compassionate but I begin to worry that I might be doing that to convince myself that I can. Even worse, that I might be doing it to keep up appearances and make other people believe I am. 

Thing is in my understanding it can’t come in waves, it’s permanent, but I feel this current episode far more than the ones before it and there was a very clear trigger. 

I’ve had friends before comment on my low levels of emotion, I do show some emotions but they tend to be centred around control, or rather the loss of it. When I feel that I’m not in control of a situation I become exhaustively angry and upset. 

Just to clarify, I’m a client facing professional, I am a recent graduate and achieved incredibly highly at University. I’m not some moron who can’t control himself. 

I have sought professional help in the past but only recently began to suspect this, I remember a clear moment when I was in therapy where I let the mask slip and showed what I thought about myself, my genuine unfiltered thoughts and she had very few comments she didn’t seem to suspect what I’m now thinking. That being said I intentionally misled and kept her at a distance in numerous ways so to say that she saw everything is completely wrong. 

I have also started engaging in increasingly aggressive sexual behaviours, nothing illegal or putting other people in danger but I’ve begun dominating the girls I sleep with very intensely, with consent of course, but I’ve growingly started enjoying some more sadistic engagements. This seems to have started with this recent episode and it’s quite new. 

I suspect that my Dad may have a similar issue, he suffered quite a bit of childhood trauma and it tracks that he would be emotionally fragmented. This could very easily explain where some of these traits have been learned. 

Anyway, hopefully someone sees this and has some thoughts, I’m getting a bit worried about this and seeking professional help has only gotten me so far in the past because once I’m in there I become very intentional with how I let them see me."
1047,I don't know what or who is real anymore,"I have been battling with this for around 5 years, I believe everyone I hold dear or close to me and many others are against me. It's as if they are in some club and I am not.
I keep hearing people shouting about me from either upstairs or downstairs in my flat.
EVERYWHERE I go I seem to be being kept track of r stalked. People asking for my recipepts in ships.
When I talk to people there seems to be 2 conversations going out the one we are having and a subtext that I am not privey to.
I have been in hospital, I have spoken to psychiatrist, I have taken medication. I honestly don't know where to turn. I can't talk to my mum anymore as it is destroying her as she has mental health issuess, and my best friend said I made her feel mentally ill.

1048,Tips On Meditation?,"Hi, so I've been trying to meditate to fight being anxious and I don't think I'm doing it right. Anyone who has more experience, can you share your tricks on how to meditate?"
1049,PTSD and going to the doctors,"Hey I just been thinking about this a lot since I’m due for a check up and wanted to schedule an appointment. 

So I have PTSD from sexual assault a few years ago. And I wanted to schedule an appointment but I’m just so afraid of getting a pelvic exam. I don’t think I’ve had once since before the assault. And even when I am intimate with partners I need to be so fuckin high or crossed to feel somewhat comfortable. 

I am just really nervous about telling them I don’t want to do it. And no one other than health care providers really know that I have PTSD and was sexually assaulted, not even my family. So I’m afraid if they put that in my charts a family member especially my parents would somehow hear about it. 

I got hospitalized recently and I’m currently in a partial hospital program working on my PTSD. I have a lot of triggers come up from just working through the thoughts and emotions around it. So I know damn well this would be really triggering for me. 

Any tips or advice I would greatly appreciate. Thanks for listening."
1050,Help for my selfless father,"My dad is the perfect father anyone can imagine: Loving, very intelligent (emotional and normal intelligence), very knowledgable and selfless. He always put family first and regrets some of the decisions he has made in the past that led to him feeling miserable at work because of his co workers and boss (read post history). The problem is, in our family he is depressed as well because of my mother. The fundamentals of their relationship are there (they trust each other, love each other etc.), but it's the ""little"" things that destroy them. My mom always overreacts over little things (when he accidentally raises his voice sometimes for example) and is unforgiving. She would always bring up things that happened 10,20,30 years ago and weren't even big things back then. This has taken a toll on my dad. In the end, he wants to fight for his family and that's where his heart always is. But seeing him so depressed at work or when he comes home to more stress makes me so sad. He himself even said that he doesn't have much hope anymore for his life since he's already almost 60 years old. He doesn't have energy anymore to do new things and every day he gets up, ""he is just trying to make the best of it"". I recommended him to start new hobbies, go to communities and not always care about the arguments with my mother too much. But he's starting to feel too tired to do that. I don't want to see him this way. This man gave everything in his life for other people..What can I do?

Edit: My mom is a SAHM, she doesn't value social contacts as much as my dad. My dad loves connection and needs friends and the community feeling, but over the years he's lost all of them.."
1051,please help me (17m),"my entire personality is surviving on lofi beats

I don't feel like doing anything anymore. everything is a chore these days. I used to enjoy playing video games but not anymore. I have been feeling like this for at least 3 years now. but it has worsened these days.

my deteriorating mental health has my parents to blame. they don't understand me at all and not only don't respect my choices but also try to manipulate and control me all the time. i have chosen a different career because of them when i wanted to go into art and video game designing. i have a huge pile of work of subjects i don't even want to study.

not a day goes by when my parents and I don't get into an argument. they have tried to physically assault me multiple times and i don't know how to behave anymore.

where i live we don't have mental health support and i cannot talk to a professional about this. i don't have anybody to talk to because my parents don't let me maintain a relationship with any of my friends. i feel like everything has been bottling up now and i cannot take this pressure anymore.

i have entrance exams in a year for a career my parents chose for me. i don't know what will happen if i fail.

all of this has been constantly bottling up inside of me and even the slightest of things set me off now. i have immense pressure on me about being perfect at everything and if I fail now I'm scared of what will happen next.

i have panic attacks when my parents shout at me, i can't breathe and my hands start shaking.i have severe social anxiety because my parents always controlled my life and never let me have any experience alone.

i am skinny and fragile, my parents always bully me about it and won't stop calling me names and embarassing me infront of people. i hate my life.

i am not allowed to speak up against them and they have ruined my mental health completely

please somebody help me i cannot take this anymore."
1052,How do you deal with anxiety?,[removed]
1053,"Psychologists: Is the “you’ve made a breakthrough!” trope in film based in reality, or purely a Hollywood invention?","
More specifically, is the one word or phrase which in a therapeutic session that leads the psychologist to suddenly respond with “you’ve made a breakthrough!” just a Hollywood invention or a holdover from a previous era that never went away like the therapy couch the patient lays on their back on?

I’ve literally never heard that during treatment. It’s always been slow, steady steps, looking back at the previous weeks and seeing if any progress had been made. Any “breakthroughs” I’ve had have always been a result of me practicing them in my day to day life, so I’ve reported on what I referred to as “making major progress” but I just don’t buy the cliche “you’ve made a breakthrough” in an isolated session in the office."
1054,I keep making myself upset on purposed/having intrusive thoughts and it's getting worse,"I will give a example on how this usually goes. In the two most comum scenarios. Scenario 1: I will remember something that made me upset in the past and I will try to stop thinking about it. But I can't and these thoughts keep poping in my head more frequently until I can't think about anything else. Like reappeating a mean thing someone said to me im my past over and over non-stop.

 Scenario 2: I'm living my life normaly and them I see something that makes me upset. For example, seeing some triggering content on the internet. Instead of feeling bad and leaving it, I will start thinking about it more and more. I will go on google and try to search for more triggering content on porpuse and them I spend hours consuming it. After I stop what i just saw will keeping coming to my mind even if I don't want to think about that subject anymore. And them becomes all I can think off, just like in the first case.

I know that the obvious answer for the secound would be: ""don't research for/or seek things that make you feel upset"". But I can't help it. These urges keep coming back the same way that the intrusive thoughts do. And the more I try to not to, more feel the nees to do so.

Sorry if the post is confusing or something, English isn't my first language."
1055,I seem to have a tendency of thinking people are manipulating me,"I often worry that my friends or someone I'm close to is a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"". I'm afraid that the people I'm close to are in fact tricking me into caring for them when they don't really care for me. I have no evidence or  reason to think, but something triggers in me that makes me legitimately worry that my closest friends that are like family to me are in fact sociopaths that for some reason have an interest in fooling me.

This makes me paranoid and makes me worry that I might limit myself in my relationships or act on my paranoia to see if they really are manipulating me. It's like I'm not comfortable with before I know their exact psychological constitution. 

How can learn to be content with this uncertainty that obviously originates in me?"

1059,How do you deal with your anxiety?,[removed]
1060,I’m so sick of feeling like this.,"I don’t want to kill myself but it feels like the only option for me. No one around me seems to be as insistent about my recovery as me. It feels like my parents, therapist, and psychiatrist are all okay with me suffering.

I’ve been diagnosed with depersonalization and derealization, MDD, general anxiety, and social anxiety.

Here’s how I feel; disconnected, hollow, hopeless, alone, empty.

There is nothing rewarding about life right now.
All of my energy is focused on me getting better. 

I told my mom yesterday I’m done waiting for a solution.  That I want a med change or I want to go to the hospital."
1061,My spouse has fallen down a rabbit hole of paranoia and it's destroying our lives.,"(warning very long)

My spouse was diagnosed with epilepsy last fall and in turn put on medication (topamax). About a month in she started to act different but it wasn't too bad. Most of it revolved around being overly worried and some suspicion of the people around her but it wasn't severe. One issue however was that she was having some seizure activity still, although it was much less frequent. So the doctor raised her dosage to try and knock them out completely.  Things started to get a bit worse not long after but I chalked it up that she needed to balance out. Well they didn't during the covid shut down we had some ""oddness"" going on with the school district. And some other weird things happen with my son getting harassed online. This is when I knew that she wasn't OK and her behavior became disconcerting.   Due mostly to her connecting everyone up and them working together in some kind of over arching plot. This even included her past employer who she quit on bad terms with. She legit thought (and thinks) that they contacted my sons school and initiated some type of revenge plan. 

This all went on for months and kept building, it seemed like every few days someone new would be included. Even my mom, her family, her friends etc. She also started to accuse me of putting things in her food and at one point frantically wanted me to call 911 which begging me to tell her why I was poisoning her. I did and she checked out fine, although afterwards she told me I must have used something undetectable. (this is when she started to come down on her meds after I made a breakthrough and she agreed something was off)

Fast forward more. The suspicion of the school district, her old employer and pretty much everyone she could think of now were building cases against her / us and all were (are) secretly working together. She has moved into territory that is scaring the hell out of me now. All her devices and accounts have been hacked and she is being watched. She thinks people planted bugs in our house to listen to us. She thinks my daughters friend (who's mom works for the district) is spying on us. And a cherry on top... the fire department is putting things in neighbors mailboxes to gather information on us... yes the damn fire department.

She ended up completely free of topamax about five to six days ago. But as of the past week she and I have not slept, she wakes me up at 2am going on about this crap. Constantly cry's (literally) about how people are trying to get CPS involved and how a ""somethings going on"" (catch phrase). She also calls me 15 times a day at work, usually to bring up all of this BS going on (adding more to it). =(

So we aren't doing well for obvious reasons. I this entire time have tried to stay ""logical"" and talk to her about things and how this or that might be plausible. I try not to dismiss everything, but as things have gone on I find myself raising my voice and straight going ""none of this is true, nothing is going to happen, this is insane"". This leads her to say things like I am gas lighting her, being degrading, naive and not caring. When I do try to stay collected and make sense of things I tend to repeat it back. Like ""OK so you think that the fire department is doing X"" which triggers her to respond with ""stop repeating everything it's weird"" AKA I am recording her. At this point I am completely destroyed emotionally, without sleep and the constant effort to put out the fires (which doesn't work). Her talking about divorce, telling me not to come home etc has triggered me to lash back on my own. As when she accuses me of knowing something or being a part of it I instantly go ""fine, whatever I will leave"". She also tells me I have been unsupportive and more or less an ass during all of this, and to be honest due to getting angry many times I am not in the best state of mind anymore. 

There are two big problems going on right now with all this, one I know this isn't her and two we have kids. I feel like if I just leave it's going to push her to max insanity. And her having a full breakdown would crush the kids. For better or worse my daughter is almost 18 and see's whats going on, as well as gets targeted. So sadly I have someone to back me up on her behavior. 

In the end I love her to death and we have been married coming up on two decades. I know this isn't her, but I don't know how to deal with it anymore. I am really hoping she is temporally messed up due to coming off of the medication, and perhaps one day she will just start slowly getting better. But even so how the hell do I survive this and how should I handle her delusions and paranoia?"
1062,Whats gonna happen to her kids later in life?,"My sister, and I dont like saying this but I dont know any other way, is a terrible mother. She had her first at 17 and is now 24 or 5 with 3 of them. Almost every day she ends up screaming at at least one at the top of her lungs and cussing at them.(one is with their dad, the other two are only 4 and 1ish.) After she freaks out on them she tries to just ignore it and continue business as normal. Sometimes with the really bad episodes she gets slightly apologetic. The older one she still has and the one with her father already display signs of anxiety, which I know all too well. What kind of effects is this gonna have on them as they get older? I worry for them."
1063,I don't know what's going on with me,"hi. I'm 15, and I don't think I'm doing too good lately. basically, I came out to my extended family a couple months ago and it's been a rocky ride since then, but just a couple weeks ago I went to my grandparents' house to have a conversation and resolve some stuff with them. they had no intentions of working anything out, and my grandpa was very emotionally manipulative, yelling, interrupting, and saying horrible things about my parents in the process. it was really scary because I had never seen that side of either of them, and I left the house sobbing and I felt so numb the whole way home. I knew that that was the end of any relationship with them, people who I loved so much, and the end of relationships or normalcy with the rest of my extended family. since then, I've felt kind of flat emotionally. I'm usually a really happy person with lots of motivation and inspiration for art and writing but I can't find any inspiration. I don't do any of the little things that bring me joy because they don't anymore. I cry almost every night after I go to bed because I feel really sad a lot and that's the best way to get it out. I also get inexplicably angry, almost to the point of rage sometimes, without any triggers. I feel bad because I lash out at my parents and say things I don't mean, and that makes me feel worse. and I've been dissociating too. last night, I was listening to music and I suddenly started crying, and then I kept imagining myself dead and I was worried I might do something to myself. I would never, I'm not suicidal, and I don't want to die at all. but I was still afraid. I would reach these points where I felt like I either wanted to scream or pass out, and I was so scared that my hands were going to do something I didn't want them to do that I laced my fingers together and clamped down super hard to keep my hands locked in place. at one point, I got up and took the Swiss army knife off my desk and shut it in a drawer because I didn't want that within range of myself. just in case. and I was dissociating the whole time too. no other symptoms, but I think it may have been a panic attack? I don't know. that's just based off brief research this morning to try and figure out what the hell was going on with me. I guess all that's to say that I don't know what's wrong with me. do you guys have similar stories, or feel the same as I do? how do I get better? I don't want to feel like this anymore."
1064,I'm a complete mess,"I don't know what is wrong with me, I've been trying my best to deal with the everyday life and for a few years everything seemed fine until now, well the past few months.

I know I have mental health issues but I just don't know where to turn, my only close friends are jerks and i don't have a strong enough relationship with anyone else I know, at least not enough to ask for help.

there are some nights I'll sleep like a baby where as others I'll be crying myself to sleep because I just can't take the pressure I'm putting my self under.

it always feels like i just need someone to slap some sense into me some days, other times I feel like I need someone to tell me it's all going to be fine, some days I tell myself it'll all be fine, that one day I'll be free from the shitty life I live now and I'll finally be able to feel normal...

regardless of my intentions to seek help it never works, I always sink into my pit and wallow in sadness thinking that it's just what my life is meant to be, regardless of how many happy days I have i always feel like it's meaningless 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I expect from posting this, but I really wish I knew what I'm meant to do, how to seek help when I feel like I have no one around me.

1065,Why am I always so extreme with everything,"I can never just have middle ground with ANYTHING. Im either ridiculously reliant on my bf, really clingy, needy etc. But then when he points it out I can’t just be normal, I get so distant, I don’t text much and don’t ask to go over. I used to get takeaway like 5 times a week, eating crap constantly, i used to binge like crazy. Now I’m onto eating 800-900 calories a day and I’m just slowly wanting to eat less and less, I know it’s not healthy but I actually look disgusting. I either look at myself in complete disgust and cry about my appearance, then go a complete 180 and think I’m so pretty. My mood can go from being extremely happy and pushing myself to doing 100 things in a day, or being in bed, depressed, crying, wishing I was dead. I wish I was just normal, I hate being this way."

1067,TW S@I€ID€: Is anyone else triggered by due dates or really just school assignments in general?,"I don’t know why, but my suicidal and intrusive thoughts are amped when there’s a due date or something I’m having trouble on that’s due soon. I always just want to kill myself before it’s due. Or say something crazy or threaten to harm myself so I can end up in a mental hospital so I can be there and don’t get in trouble over the assignment. It’s so stupid and crazy. I don’t know why my mind works like this. It’s probably because I don’t know how to handle stress."
1068,finally feeling that’s i’m moving forward.,"this is not a lot, but i finally got a job interview for doing something i actually enjoy!! :) and i really hope it goes well so i can finally earn money and move out again. when i move out i can finally start looking after myself and live a happier life. i literally feel like crying thinking that the near future may not be so dark &lt;3"

1070,How can I date around my problems?,"Firstly I'm 24 and also have general anxiety, almost no social life. While that needs to be added it's not the heart of my problem.

I for a very long time always wanted to have an innocent relationship with a girl, where we got to experience everything together at a slow pace, not even sex but just dating and learning about each other, everything being new. On the other hand I can't deal with the opposite. If I find out she had an ex or did anything sexual with someone else it kills me. And don't get my wrong I tried to deal with it, but the thoughts of her with someone else just ate away at me to to point i could barely get a few hours of sleep, was always angry, and didn't want her to touch me.

Obviously that didn't last, I was able to briefly date a virgin when I was 17. I was not as desperate at the time so I sort of just lost interest because we weren't a great match, I actually never even kissed her but I remember at least being calm. I ended up seeing a total of 3 psychiatrists for this(I was 21-22). Two of them suggested I find a girl who is inexperienced like me as the simplest solution(spoiler: I failed from social anxiety). The third put me on medication which didn't really help.

Now I'm 24 and getting too old. I'm thankfully good looking, I have a good job and I've been working out. I'm so scared that I've considered just ending it if I don't manage by 30. There's no chance whatsoever I'm getting over this, I just so desperately want to find a girl like me or who's just a virgin so I can date while staying sane. At this point I'm willing to try almost anything, even other countries if the US is too promiscuous now?
Is there anything I can do?"
1071,I want an undo button,"I was depressed in July. Depression and boredom led to introspection. Introspection led to me being concerned about my paraphilia and so I decided to lay off porn for a while (and looked up withdrawal symptoms to prepare myself, which I shouldn’t have done). I spoke to my therapist about it. He told me it was fine to be into that sort of stuff. But I’ve never spoken about it out loud before. It made me question things about myself and intrusive thoughts took over. Intrusive thoughts that led to not feeling like myself, to feeling different. This led to panicked googling of things, which led to worse and worse depersonalization and more intrusive thoughts. My emotional connections and empathy started to fade and so did my passions. I feel less mentally sharp. Existential thought in this state led to me turning that intrusive thought into something worse, a trigger. And that trigger became more and more vague and all encompassing. Now it has overtaken my passion. I feel like the world isn’t real anymore and that nothing matters anymore. I used to have strong opinions and beliefs. I used to enjoy things. Now I can’t. I didn’t know how to explain what was going on to my therapist until it was really too late. I’m living an empty existence now. There were times earlier on during this where I wasn’t as bad as I am now. I wish I was able to convey what I was going through then. 

I just started an SSRI for my depression, but then I heard that it has the potential to cause even more emotional and empathetic decreases. I’m afraid I’ll never be the same again. I’m afraid I’ll never live a life of rich emotions again. I’ll never be tethered to reality again. I’ll never have passion again, I’ll never feel love again. I’m afraid that this is my life now. I could have just not looked deeply into myself, I could have decided not to talk to my therapist and just mention the depression, I could have not let google become a compulsion, I could have done things to occupy my time. I had plenty of videogames to play and Netflix shows to watch, but instead I chose to destroy myself."

For example when I go grocery shopping and the stores a little crowded it’s so hard for me to concentrate and I most likely forget something or get too overwhelmed. Then I noticed I’ll get very aggravated or irritated because of it. I just want some clarity and want a moment to just relax and calm down because it’s very hard me to do so. I won’t even get started on how hard it is for me to be a student which I currently am.

My mental health is deteriorating rapidly, I do suffer from depression, anxiety and mania but I've never felt so paranoid in my entire life.

Maybe it's because of the fact that my trustwent out the window after past traumatic experiences and I've never been able to stabilise my trust issues.
What's even worse is that, alot of the time, my suspicions turn out to be true so I kinda feel like my gut feelings are spot on and I'm the type to bottle shit up so when I get paranoid thoughts, I rarely let them out.

Any suggestions? The quetiapine hasn't been effective with me even though I've been on them for a looong ass time now."
1080,My coworkers mock or misuse mental illness terms and it’s really starting to bother me.,"I’m still in my first month working this job so I’m still learning everyone’s personalities but nearly every coworker claims to have anxiety (which, to be fair, it IS the most common mental illness so... I let that one slide) and a few of them use OCD to describe their desire to organize messy drawers or clean something. To top it off, many of them seem to mock depression. There’s a guy who used to work for the company who will be coming back and they are already gossiping about this guy to me. He has depression and they just go on and on about how weird he is because of it. Look, I’m pretty tolerant of people and I’m also new to the job so I don’t want to stir the pot but I also have ALL 3 of those disorders and I’m just standing there tight-lipped not saying a word (thank goodness for these face masks because they can’t see much of my facial expressions). When I come into work and someone asks how I am today, I usually say I’m fine or I’m tired. Tired is code for having a bad depression day but they don’t know. I just blame it on being tired (which I am all the time anyway). I don’t think I’ll be at this job long-term but for the time I am there, I’m just trying to tread lightly. I’m fine not sharing my personal stories with them and keeping my shit under wraps but... the mockery and the “oh I have that too!” side of it really bothers me. It just makes me feel like if I DID try to confide in someone if I was having a rough day, that it wouldn’t be taken seriously and they’d just use it as an excuse to start talking about themselves. I burnt out HARD at my last job and didn’t work for two years so I’m really trying my best here. Thank you for reading. I just needed to tell someone."

1083,[Giving advice] Coping with grief,"Hello 

Read through a bunch of grief related posts, so wanted to share coping skills 

Acronym to remember TEARS 

T- Talking. You can’t hold it in, no matter how much you might feel embarrassed or awkward, eventually you need to talk to someone and let it all out...a friend, therapist, family member. Typing it out does not provide the same benefit!

E- Exercising. There’s so many intense feelings swirling around inside you. Sometimes an outlet for all that energy is needed. 1) it may tire you out and feel good endorphins rush in - 2) if not it will still release some of that intense internal energy - Mental energy expended as physical energy. 

R- Recording or writing experiences. Yes writing does play a helpful role. Maybe you have all these thought whirling around your head and it’s overwhelming - get it down on paper, just let the words flow, it doesn’t have to sound good or make sense. Putting thoughts/feelings onto paper will allow the mind to feel a little less cluttered with intensity. 

S- Sobbing. Yes, cry it out. Cry out as much as you want, as often as you need, and remind yourself there is nothing wrong with it. 

I hope this helps some people, stay strong, take care 💙"
1084,"What do you do when you have a bad day, feel like giving up and need a boost?","I'm having a bad day today and just feel like crawling into bed, eating a fuck tonne of junk food and pushing away all my friends.
What do you do to give yourself a mental boost when you need to stick to your good habits?

I am in the UK if that matters"
1085,"I need help. I do not understand my own emotions, none of my thoughts make sense. I feel like shit and I desperately want to feel better but I don't know how. I think I am lying to myself."," Ok, hi, so I am going to be rambling about how i've been feeling for a long time. It won't really make sense. But they have been causing me great distress, and I want to understand them and overcome them.

Putting my thoughts into words.   
I think my life is a mess. My brain is at war with itself. I am barely able to function day to day. I am lagging behind in college. I quit my first ever part time job, after only a few weeks, a few months ago. My sleep schedule is destroyed completely, I can't do anything all day, so I lay in bed staring at the ceiling or blank minded looking at YouTube on my phone, and I have to psych myself up to do the simplest shit (cleaning room, chores, homework, ect. ect.)  and I have withdrawn from the people who made me happy to ""protect"" them from me. (Even though it hurts me, and it probably hurts them as well.) I graduated this year, but ever since the pandemic my life situation has been getting worse and worse, because I can’t do well when I am left by myself, because I think when I am alone I cannot function and I at all. I need other people to distract me, because if not I am only thinking bad thoughts about myself.

A lot of my thoughts are rationally contradictory and self defeating. I know that they are untrue, but why do I still think them? 

If I logically know that I am telling the truth about the emotions I feel, but then I say I feel like I am lying, even though I know that I am not lying; does that make me an attention seeking liar because I am asking for solutions for a problem I have already solved myself, and I am only asking for a solution even though I don’t need one, because I don’t care about the solution but only want to be recognized???

Even that what I said up there!\^ I know that it’s fallacious circular reasoning, but for some reason I can’t help but feel that way?   


I really hate talking about myself, and my problems, because it feels like I am being selfish. Like I am manipulating whoever I am talking to, emotionally. It feels like I am playing the victim, and blaming all of my problems on everyone but myself, and that I am painting myself as a martyr. Even If I am talking about real emotions that I actually have, I feel like I am lying, even though I know that factually I am telling the truth about my experiences, I can’t help but second guess myself.. This isn’t only when I am talking about my emotions with other people, but also when I try and think about them myself. And here is the thing; I even get the feeling sometimes that I don’t have pure intentions in withdrawing myself from them, maybe I am just selfishly trying to get them to feel concern about me and pay attention to me; that this purity act of me “hurting myself for their own goo d” is just a sham and deep down I am a horrible, selfish person.  If I be honest. I don't even know what type of person I am at all. I don't know anything about myself. 

I used to be much much worse about this type of stuff (abusing other people’s empathy), but for years now I have been able to manage my “clinginess.” Introspection told me that I was being very emotionally tiresome, and that I was only in some relationships because I selfishly only wanted help and reassurance, and not for anything else. It feels disgusting saying that, but it’s true; they were worrying about there own problems but I was only looking out for myself. They had my back but I didn’t have theirs. They were good people, and honestly my relationship with them was toxic and I was the only one who kind of benefited from it, so I am glad that we are apart, for their sakes... But that was years ago and I vowed not to hurt anyone in that way again. I did at one point after driving a few close people away with my insecurity, find some middle ground between the two extremes, where I did try and be mindful about the people I was venting to, and where I did the same for them, and we respected boundaries, and that I would only ask for help for things I couldn’t figure out for myself… But eventually I became subconscious, so now even me having a healthy conversation about my feelings makes me feel guilty. LIke I am doing it again, being a emotional leech. I even feel like I am doing it right now, by writing all of the shit out.

I do not have access to any health care, therapist, or anything. I am not currently in the financial place to get insurance or whatever I need in order to get help. I don’t even know where to look for it if I could. But I desperately want answers, so I have become my own “therapist.” But because I am not a medical professional, obviously, this has only made the problem worse. I think I am a million different things. Maybe I am BPD and I am gaslighting myself? I don’t have a sense of self whatsoever, I used to be so emotionally dependent on people that I drove them away, and I am angry all the time, I feel empty, and I need attention and validation to feel real. Maybe I am a narcissist who Is just making excuses for himself because I can’t take responsibility and I just don’t want to get better but I feel ashamed about it so I try and hide behind blaming some theoretical external alement instead of my own failures, and I just use this as narc fuel so I can like get attention. Maybe I am just a psychopath in denial, and all of my emotions really are fake, and I really am lying to myself and lying to you. Right now I am writing this in a non emotional state, even though I was crying yesterday and I was crying earlier but now I am numb. Does that mean I really am lying? Was I lying the whole time? Am I dissociating? Maybe all of the symptoms I say that I am feelings are not really what I am feeling, and I am only saying I feel them because I read about them, and I am feeling something else entirely?

But I could theoretically get a job and get access to therapy, but then again, why even bother? I don’t even believe myself about my problems, so how can a therapist help me? They’d probably dismiss me. I really don’t even think I can ever be happy. I have thought about dying, but not killing myself. I do have a lot of things that I am grateful fore. Or atleast used to have. So usually the thoughts I have of dying are just benign, but I think they are getting worse as time goes on and I sink deeper into this self defeating rabbit hole, and I think one day I might actually do it.

But I need help.

I have only thought for the past couple of days that I am in pain and that I am suffering; but It is self centered for me to think like that, because I feel like none of my problems are real, so what really is happening Is I am just a narcissist who has stagnated in life and wants to make excuses for himself. THat I am some sort of psychopath who doesn’t even feel pain for himself or others so I am just asking for pity party points. Maybe I am some sort of monster amalgamation of all of those things, those things that I hate. That I am trying to be a special snowflake motherfucker who is like “I am in so much pain so look at me and feel bad for me and you cannot understand my pain.” I feel like a snake eating itself.

I do really  have a lot of things to feel bad about. A lot of shame, a lot of anger, A lot of trauma. A lot of shit that I used to blabber on to myself and to others in the past, but then I just realized that just constantly ruminating on it is not doing me any good. I used to be as bad as I am right now, but then I got better, but now my life is falling apart again. I have isolated myself from my friends because I don’t want to put them through the burden of dealing with whatever the fuck I am dealing with. I have a lot of issues that I used to talk about all the time, but I don’t think that ever helped me. I am not going into specifics, because honestly my trauma and shit isn’t tangible at all. Or maybe it is, but it’s not like one big thing, but its like a bunch of little things, and feelings, and a bunch of shit that has been slowly and steadily been wearing me down for years and years. Namely, I hate my dad. Alot. And for good reason. But I won’t get into it because I have reflected on my hatred on him so many times before and all it does is just make me feel worse. It’s even more fucked up because I don’t know if he’s still a bad person or if he’s a good person now… And even though I hate him, I am still financially dependent on him so I feel guilty. (And he likes to through that in my face a lot.)

I never really have been able to function before. I never could be good at people things. I was unable to focus on school (still aren’t), I couldn’t hold my job. But I was happy because atleast back in school I felt like something. Because I used to be able to act out and get attention and make people laugh. I don’t know why, but I have been extroverted even though It is exhausting for me. Maybe It was all for attention, maybe it was because when I interacted with OTHER people, it felt like I was real… Maybe I was just extroverted and happy because I was a kid who didn’t have to worry about any of his problems until now, but now I can’t goof off all day and I feel lost and confused because now I have to be a man now. 

I don’t know how to conclude this. All i want is answers.

I want to know the true intentions behind my emotions, and if they are good or bad. If they are bad, then how do I change them so I can be a good person?

How do I believe myself, how am I supposed to feel secure in my own emotions?

How do I not be a selfish person?

How do I stop being so angry all the time?

How do I have self esteem?

How do I feel vulnerable around people without feeling like I am manipulating them?  


How do I stop worrying about all of this stuff and just be happy?

I don’t want to talk about the problems anymore, I want to take action and I want to have solutions now. I don’t want to feel the way I am feeling anymore."
1086,Feedback/Advice for new medications,"Hello again! I reached out months ago with advice on whether I should start taking Lamictal for my BPD2, and itbwas incredibly helpful to me, and taking it was a positive improvement. I have a lot of anxiety when starting new medications and I like to know firsthand experience instead of relying on reviews or doctor info (I had a bad experience once and it left me over cautious)

I expirienced a traumatic event in June, and since then my sleeping has been horrific. I either can't at all or can't stay asleep due to nightmares or racing thoughts. My therapist prescribed me a low dose trazodone to help, I'm to take one before bed, and I was wondering if anyone could let me know how their experience with it was, if they expirienced any major side effects and if it would be truly beneficial to me. I am still on my 200mg of Lamictal, if that makes a difference. 

Thanks in advance for any help!"

"""" I should have done something different ""I get frustrated and cry.

Sometimes I drive and think ""I wish I had an accident"" or I wake up at night wanting to get sick and die.

The worst thing is that I have everything and I don't know why I think that. I live with my boyfriend, he makes me happy every day, we live in a small but very nice apartment, my family cares about me, we are not millionaires but money is not a problem, we both have stable jobs and although we have not achieved everything, we work every day to obtain it.

I can have the best day but out of nowhere a sadness seizes me and I feel alone and afraid. I have imagined myself dead, hanging ... Now it's hard for me to talk to people, I don't like going to parties or meeting new people, and although I was never the most outgoing person, I was different but something changed. Now I even avoid talking to my friends or sharing things

yesterday for the first time I was able to talk about this, I talked to my boyfriend and he got angry because he didn't understand why I wanted to die if I had everything.

1091,What is the scope of a therapist’s “duties/responsibilities” to you as a patient?,"I saw something a while ago that said “millennials expect their therapists to solve all of their problems when the only requirement of a therapist is to be there to listen.” And I’ve been seeing a therapist who hasn’t really been giving me “advice” or really even talking much at all, so that fact along with the quote from above have been making me feel guilty for wishing I was getting more from my therapist.

But when I go to therapy, I feel like I’m literally just talking to myself and it’s not very helpful at all. Is this normal? Am I expecting too much? She normally asks me maybe 4 questions in a 50-minute session and gives like 2 points of advice max. My issues are not extraordinarily deep, but I do still need help."
1092,Think I've got anger issues or anxiety or something,"Well whenever I'm out in public I always feel scared and tense and once when I went out for a meal with my family, I noticed I was shaking when I picked a drink up.

1093,Mental Health as Crime,"Before you read, note that the following is a copy-paste from The New York Times daily email publication, The Morning. It has been posted in its original state. With those caveats, this article has what I consider to be important and relevant information and I wanted to share it with the community in a more accessible medium.

On March 23, just a day after having gone to the hospital for mental health problems, a 41-year-old man named Daniel Prude bolted out of his brother Joe’s home in Rochester, N.Y, wearing few clothes. Joe was scared about what might happen to his brother.

So he did what many Americans do when facing an emergency involving mental illness. He called 911.

In the hours that followed, police officers found Daniel Prude walking down a street and handcuffed him. One officer held a knee on his back for two minutes. Unable to breathe, Prude lost consciousness and died a week later.

On Thursday, after the Prude family released a video of the confrontation, the mayor of Rochester suspended seven officers. (For a more detailed account, [you can read this reconstruction by Times reporters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/nyregion/daniel-prude-police-rochester.html?action=click&amp;campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20200904&amp;instance_id=21905&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;regi_id=121149626&amp;section_index=1&amp;section_name=big_story&amp;segment_id=37455&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=1b49de3df3a2d0a074c88f6a5e678298).)

The case has raised many of the same questions — about racism and police behavior — as some other recent deaths of Black men. It has also highlighted a specific issue that many experts believe is crucial to reducing police-related violence: mental illness.

“Americans with mental illnesses make up nearly a quarter of those killed by police officers,” Pete Earley, whose mentally ill son has twice been shot with stun guns by police officers, [has written for The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/15/mental-illness-is-health-issue-not-police-issue/?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20200904&amp;instance_id=21905&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=121149626&amp;section_index=1&amp;section_name=big_story&amp;segment_id=37455&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=1b49de3df3a2d0a074c88f6a5e678298). As Earley also points out, “115 police officers have been killed since the 1970s by individuals with untreated serious mental illnesses.”

Are there any promising solutions? There appear to be.

Some cities have had success moving more mental health treatment — including emergency response — out of the criminal justice system. And many advocates for better policing have called for an expansion of these efforts, as part of shifting some police funding to other areas. “This is the only medical illness that we use criminal justice to respond to,” John Snook, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, [told Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azkeb/police-are-the-first-to-respond-to-mental-health-crises-they-shouldnt-be?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20200904&amp;instance_id=21905&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=121149626&amp;section_index=1&amp;section_name=big_story&amp;segment_id=37455&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=1b49de3df3a2d0a074c88f6a5e678298).

One alternative: Eugene, Ore., routes some 911 calls — like many involving mental illness or homelessness — to an emergency health service, the White Bird Clinic. Last year, the clinic received 24,000 such calls [Ebony Morgan, a White Bird crisis worker, told National Public Radio](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/10/874339977/cahoots-how-social-workers-and-police-share-responsibilities-in-eugene-oregon?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20200904&amp;instance_id=21905&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=121149626&amp;section_index=1&amp;section_name=big_story&amp;segment_id=37455&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=1b49de3df3a2d0a074c88f6a5e678298). In fewer than 1 percent of those cases did White Bird need to call for police backup as part of its response.

It’s hard not to wonder whether Daniel Prude would still be alive if his brother had been able to call medical professionals instead of the police."

I told him I’d help him get a therapist but he’s says he’s afraid to talk about anything. He has slowly let out more and more to me and talked about some of the pain he’s experienced. All I say is “your feelings are valid, this feeling won’t last forever, it’ll be okay, I love you, etc” as he cries on me. I don’t know what else to do. I care about him so much, I’m the only person who has ever talked about his mental health, I try to bring things up so that he will get used to talking about his feelings while reminding him to tell me if I cross any boundaries. He’s been suicidal and I just lost my cousin a few days ago to suicide. I’m terrified I will lose him. I don’t want to push him too hard to get help and have it damage him any more.

1104,I have extreme paranoia about others,"As the title says, I am extremely paranoid when it comes to others. Recently after my parents divorced a few months ago, my mum, who I'm living with, began dating a new man.
He's extremely charming and funny, but to me hes TOO charming and funny, to the point where I cant see him being that way without some motive. I have currently barricaded myself in my room with a chair and cupboard along with sound traps and have locked my window. I'm also sleeping with a knife under my pillow (would be a gun if they were legal here).
This isn't the first time this has happened. Whenever there is someone in my house that I don't know I become extremely agitated and nervous. I begin carrying my knife with me in the house and I check and clear rooms as I go, checking wardrobes and behind doors, under beds, everything. This occurs as well when I'm home alone and suspect someone is here without my knowledge. I try to keep these behaviours hidden from my mum because I don't want her telling others, in case they figure me out and get the drop on me.
This happens in public as well, though to a lesser extent. I never go out at night, and I have admittedly broken the law before by carrying a weapon for self defense (I do not care for the laws in Australia, they restrict innocents too much) should I be attacked.
Even my close friends I do not trust completely. I feel as though one or more of them are playing some kind of long con where they get to know me and get friendly with me, study me and figure me out completely so they can kill me completely off guard with no resistance. I know it sounds ridiculous. I've known them for 10 years, if they wanted me dead they've had plenty of chances to do it, but maybe they really want to solidify that ""innocent friend who would never harm me"" bit?

Look, I'm assuming this isn't normal? I don't see other people researching police and military clearing tactics to feel safe in their own home. I don't think I'm crazy but Im not entirely sure about much anymore.
And if it's of any note, I do not have schizophrenia or any of its symptoms. I dunno if that's related but if it is, there you go. 

What do I do? Should I just talk to my GP or see a psych or just keep on keeping on? Advice?"
1105,Life's been kicking me down,"First of all, I apologize for any grammatical mistakes that could be present in this post as English is not my  1st language.  


I don't really know where to start, but I guess it all started when my parents had a ""divorce""...  
I wrote it like that because even tho they went their separate ways, they are married on paper and still live in the same house, however, my dad usually goes away for a few weekends and my mom doesn't tend to sleep at home, but that's not why I decided to write this.  


So, when my parents got divorced, I was beginning high school (being 15 at the time I didn't know very well what it meant for a marriage to end). In the beginning, not much was wrong, I went to school, came home, videogames, sleep, school, that kind of cycle... But I think that was there and then, it all started... I started to feel lonely and sad, and to surface from the sadness I started smoking, cigarettes at first and then marijuana, for a year straight, I woke up, got on the bus, got high, and went to school, smoking, being lonely, suffering bullying from my classmates, getting heartbroken and used by anyone I cared about until the last year of high school came, I finished my education, with shit grades, I had an internship that was horrible giving me 11/20 because I did nothing all day, even tho they didn't give me anything to do all day.  


So, I finish High School June 2018, didn't do the entry exams for college, so my last option was to find a job, but people don't like to employ 17 years old teens, so all I had to do was wait. But no, you see... it happens that my parents have a bakery, so I was forced to work there, at least I would make a few euros I thought, but it seems that my parents wanted me to be perfect, and I was essentially trading mental health for money, which isn't so good.  


Eventually, I got myself a girlfriend, and she got me off the drugs, life got a new meaning, I knew I had to things for her because that was about everything I had, we've been together for 2 years now, with some ups and downs of course, but I think it's going ok even tho she said she wanted to break up a few times now, and honestly, I think it would be best for both, but neither I nor she has the guts to end it.  


Back to my life, I worked for my parents until I turned 18, made some money, but got kicked every day because I either wasn't fast enough or because I did something wrong... but anyway... I got a job, call center, 13-21, good payout, everything was working out until COVID came and I got fired due to budget cuts, finding another job doing the same thing but for a 3rd party company, worked there for 3 months, making about 500€, but being paid about 140€, and I decided to buy pc parts and try to sell it assembled, spending 340€ on a computer, with the help of a friend of mine, he sold it for 650€ but is trying to keep the money, so right now I have about 800€ owed to me, having my bank account with 0.25€.  


So being jobless and in need of money, I turned to my father again, thinking ""this will be different""  
Well.... it wasn't, 1st days it was okay, but then I was prohibited to drink either soft drinks or alcohol after working, demanding me to pay for anything I consume inside my fathers company, which I think it's completely stupid. After a fight with my dad due to be drinking soft drinks, he fired me, leaving me with 160€ on hand and a bus to go find a job.  


So at the moment I'm sending curriculums and actually got an interview that went great, but I'm still waiting for a response, I'm left at home playing computer until it's late into the night, and of course, my parents don't like that, insulting me, calling me useless, that I won't be anyone in life and that without them I'm nothing, and now they are demanding I go work because they are short-staffed,   


Oh, I was about to forget, my parents also like to call my girlfriend and tell her I'm not worth shit and that she doesn't deserve me, even telling her I'm no good for either husband or for being a father, leaving her with second thoughts about the relationship, having talks with me, and leaving me in sadness  


I've found myself several times thinking about ending it all, even tho I don't have in me to do it, I don't wish to be alive, but I don't want to die as well...  


so, its 17:40 PM, and my mom is demanding I go fill in for a shift at 18 pm, saying if I don't do it that she will call the water and the electricity companies to cut the supply off, and I don't doubt it,  


when my father is present he likes to turn the router off at 22 pm and currently he cut off my mobile data,  


I don't really know what to type more, but I'm not good to vent anyways...  


I've been through several shrinks and I just don't find the ability to talk openly, even with my girlfriend I tend to keep me to myself having a hard time to crack my shell.  


All I wanna do all day until I get a job is be left alone, playing with my online pals, who are able to get a smile on my face.

1109,"""Why can't you, just, get rid of those damn 'emotions' of yours?"" (Warning for mentions of, well, bad things)","Says my mom, soon after I started experiencing negative emotions so to say and asking if I could stay home again (instead of walking outside to exercise). If I had the magical ability to just temporarily remove any negative emotions I'm experiencing, trust me I fucking would. But oh no! Turns out I'm not a fucking psychological wizard who can control minds, let alone my own. I don't even know why I have anxiety or social awkwardness or why I'm paranoid of what every single person I talk to could be thinking of me. I was never physically, verbally or emotionally abused as far as I know. Yeah I encountered some creepy guys but I was never inappropriately touched. Well, my mom touching me in an innocent mom way when she still doesn't know I'm a guy makes me feel really gross for sure. Yeah there was a time when we couldn't afford much food and we had to live off of smaller bottled water, but that didn't last long. Yeah we used to live in a normal house only to move from one shitty apartment to another but at least we actually have a fucking place to live right now. I even finally got my own closet and drawers again which to be honest aren't mine anyway because this place is rented. I have my own phone and laptop and other gadgets, I still have my old childhood video games with me. Yeah my parents don't understand mental health well enough even though they've been through some very scary things in their life (bullying, abusive family, near suicide, etc) SO WHY THE FUCK DO I ACT LIKE I'VE HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE LIFE WHEN I'VE LIVED LIKE 10 BILLION TIMES BETTER THAN MY PARENTS??? Was it because of the way I immaturely behaved when I moved to a new school (likely because of the previous school's shit teaching) only for everyone to never want to talk to me again apart from like 3 people until I graduated which made me this way??? There are SO SO MANY people, even people I am or was friends with, who have faced so much worse shit like being groomed or physically/mentally abused or getting beaten up at school who act so much more reasonable than me (my dad was frequently bullied at school and he still turned out better than me, someone who just barely had anyone to talk to and got teased sometimes, at least I had a couple fucking friends). What the fuck have I dealt with??? I had some uncomfortable moments and that's fucking it. I don't think that makes me qualified enough to cry every single day from irrational scary thoughts, or think that every single person I meet instantly hates me before they even know me or that they want to kill me because of how irritating I am, or that I do so poorly in school and have trouble concentrating or ANY OF THAT SHIT. Is it genetics??? Did the combined trauma of my parents pass on to me despite growing up in a better environment??? I don't fucking get it!!! I feel so bratty and needy and I'm scared to ask for literally anything from my parents like a binder or free computer game because I think I already have too many privileged things to ask for anything more. I just feel like every single dollar I'll make on my first job should all go to my parents instead of me to make up for all the stupid bullshit they had to through because of me. Or some shit. Fuck.

1112,"Mom needs to leave Mentally I'll Dad, but he can't live without her.","I (23f) don't know if I should be  posting this in the R/relationships thread or here, but I will try to make this short.

My dad(52M) has a long history of mental illness stemming from a traumatic childhood. He has borderline personality disorder, ADHD, and Anxiety. My parents have been together since they were 16.

My mom(51F) is as selfless as they come and has dedicated much of her adult life to getting him help &amp; walking on eggshells in order not to trigger any episodes. 

His episodes are either depressive or explosive anger. In the depressive episodes he will sleep for 5 days straight &amp; demand not to be bothered. This makes it complicated when it comes to taking medication as you need to be awake to do so. His explosive anger episodes are terrifying, he becomes someone other than himself. He won't hit anyone but he will do his best to destroy things inside the home... ex: shatter my moms iPad, shove keys into the wall, throw protein shakes at the ground until they burst open. Nothing seems off limits to him when he is experiencing a rage filled episode.

The situation is heartbreaking all together because that IS NOT who my father is. That is what his mental illness is. My father is the life of any party, the funniest man I know, he's caring, he's thoughtful, he loves so deeply, &amp; he desperately wants to be the man my mom deserves.

7 years ago my mom had had enough &amp; they separated for a few months. They ultimately got back together after his failed suicide attempt where he had made a playlist titled ""DEATH"" with Stay by Rihanna being the only song on there multiple times.

Since then things have not been easy. He takes his medication irregularly &amp; has sold his business &amp; is now unemployed. He has episodes more frequently than ever &amp; has expressed wanting to kill himself more and more. He feels worthless &amp; broken &amp; even worse about himself when he is on medication. My sister is into holistic things and has started to help him microdose with shrooms which was working well, until he didn't take doses because he was sleeping all day. He said he would be open to go to a rehab center for a month or 3 but it would have to be holistic because he doesn't want medication, we just don't have the money &amp; when it comes down to it I don't know if he will go. 

Basically my mom cannot do it anymore. She can't pull his dead weight, walk on eggshells all of the time, endure the silent treatments, or be the subject of his fits. No one should have to live under these circumstances, however she is the only thing keeping him alive. 

MY QUESTION: How can my mom leave my dad &amp; him still survive? He has no job &amp; no will to live. He attempted suicide the last time she left."
1113,I’ve solved it,"Hello. This is the last thing I will post on my account as I’m going to actively pursue being as uninvolved with my ego as possible, so don’t worry about me. This isn’t a cry for help, and I also don’t want to force this view on anyone else. This is just my personal revelation.

For months I’ve been trying to look in at myself and wondering why I am the way I am. Trying to understand myself and why my needs cannot be met. And just recently it’s presented itself to me.

I’m driving myself crazy looking for something I don’t have. That’s the source of my unhappiness. I keep trying to find needs and wants and desires to match the people around me, but I don’t have a lot of those things. And what I do have is immense control.

I control every aspect of myself, how I present, feel, react, and think. I know most people don’t have this but I do and I need to use it. I have no needs because my purpose is to help others meet their needs. When I don’t spend time being self centered and thinking about what my desires are the weight is gone. I barely have any symptoms.

I’m leaving Reddit and most social media and living life to the fullest for the people around me. Love you all 🤘"

1120,It's Hard to Talk About Mental Health as an Asian American,"I’ve always felt that mental health was a taboo topic. Even when it came to emotions, there ones that were “okay” to show but others that weren’t:

* Angry? That’s normal.
* Happy? Show more.
* Sad? Hide it.

One of the reasons I felt this way was because of my pride. Talking about pain was a sign of vulnerability and I didn’t want others to think that I was weak.

Another factor was the pressures I felt as a male to “man up.” Men didn’t cry. Men shoved their emotions down their throats and bottled them up tight. Strength was the ability to endure anything and the less pain you showed the better.

But one of the biggest factors was the cultural pressures I faced growing up in a collectivistic family.

# The Pressures of Collectivism

Within collectivism, the three values of prioritizing community, selflessness, and group achievements manifested into two specific forms of cultural pressures that made it difficult to talk about mental health:

1. Dishonoring my parents
2. Not wanting to burden others

## Dishonoring My Parents

Growing up, I was very much aware that my actions could affect the reputation of my parents. This was especially true at church and so I was always cautious about how I behaved.

On Sundays I made sure to wear my cleanest clothes and to pay attention during the sermons. I tried my best to memorize the assigned Bible verses and to be engaged during Sunday School. I went out of my way to bow to all of my parent’s friends to show respect. I did all of these things because I knew that the teachers, the pastors, and the parents all would all talk with each other about how I was behaving. And the better I behaved, the better the reputation my parents had.

From a mental health perspective, this was a difficult cultural dynamic to navigate. Not only did it feel like I was constantly being watched 24/7, I never really felt safe talking about my problems.

I was afraid that if I shared what I was going through at home, it would reflect poorly on my parents and that they would be perceived as terrible parents. I was also worried about how they would react. Sharing personal family information with outsiders was huge violation of trust.

Because of the collectivistic values of [filial piety](https://heem.substack.com/p/when-the-fear-of-conflict-meets-collectivism) and prioritizing the family over myself, I felt pressure to prioritize protecting my parent’s reputation rather than getting help.

# Not Wanting to Burden Others

Another core value of collectivism is to extol selflessness and to place others first. Because of this, I did not want to share what I was going through because I felt like I was burdening others.

It felt wrong to ask for help and I was ashamed that I needed to rely on someone else.

In order to cope with the pain, I ended up creating a vicious cycle of minimizing my problems and created immense Emotional Debt that would randomly erupt and get unloaded to the people around me.

For the longest time I had no idea that this was an unhealthy pattern.

I thought bottling up my emotions was normal. This is how people dealt with pain. I thought I was doing something good by keeping all of my problems to myself because talking to someone about it would just be selfish. I shouldn’t burden others with my problems. I just needed to get stronger.

# Seeking Help is Okay

One of the biggest lessons I had to learn as an adult was that seeking help was okay. I had to learn that sharing my problems wasn’t a burden to others. That there are people in my life that I can trust and rely on.

One of the tools I used to overcome this cultural pressure was therapy because it gave me something I never had before: confidentiality.

Previously, my parents were connected in some shape or form to all of my social circles. From school to church to tennis club, the Korean American community is incredibly well connected. In light of this, I was aware that anything I said or did had the potential of dishonoring my parents.

The only place I could truly feel safe was in therapy because my therapist was professionally and legally bound to keep everything we discussed private. (As a side note, this is also one of the many reasons why there is such a strong resistance to therapy in collectivistic cultures.)

Confidentiality provided me the freedom to process everything I was struggling with without the fear dishonoring my parents and affecting their reputation. This laid the relational foundations of trust that I was later able to build on with other people.

Whenever i look it up it says something about schizophrenia but it doesn’t run in my family and it said schizophrenia is very rare in teenagers my age.

1123,How can I tell my mom i need to get some mental help?,"I have a mother that doesn't realize she's part of the problem, I might vent a little in this and I apologize for that, im very new to this subreddit.

(Btw im 15m in the southern US)

First off I have social anxiety, generalized anxiety, two sleeping disorders (insomnia and another one i don't remember the name of) that are runoff of my generalized anxiety, and I believe I have some sort of depression.

My mom doesn't realize that I have any sort of mental health problems, when I had my latest panic attack all she said was ""just calm down, stop the drama,"" when my regular doctor told my mom I have really bad anxiety and insomnia she said ""well he hasn't been using his lavender i gave him."" 

She doesn't accept my disorders and I'm honestly scared to tell her that I want to get a psychologist or something along those lines, im scared she won't accept that i want help.

I dont know what to do, she screws my mind up and wonders why im crying in my room and not being ""manly,"" I need to vent to a human being who won't go and tell my mom which starts the damn cycle all over again."
1124,"how i stopped dissociation, at least temporarily","this worked for me but i don't have diagnosed anything yet until upcoming appointment so don't attack me if it doesn't work but definitely correct me if I'm objectively wrong

background.

basically i sometimes unconsciously split myself into multiple people/voices internally. and it's kinda hard when one keeps attacking me, physically and mentally.

so i began to feel disconnected, like I was playing a really realistic game. it took me sometime to realize that it started when i felt like i was pretending to my family. and when I didn't feel safe alone with myself, it got so much worse. if you've seen lateral spaces and felt how bleak the energy is, then you can kinda see where i'm going.

basically started a little less than a month ago, but recently it got bad to where I couldn't tell dreams from reality from memory.

how I reconnected.

it was hard, but I had to put my feet on the ground mentally and emotionally. I realized after talking with my mom how quickly I crushed my dreams for various reasons. after realizing this, I decided for now i'mma roll with my goals instead of burying them so quickly and now i'm determined to finish/restart my projects, in tiny steps. I hope it's enough.

that wasn't quite enough, though. I had to connect myself through my senses; i had to remind myself of things affecting me directly. what do I smell?  how do my feet feel while I walk? what am I touching? being hyper aware of what's going on around me surprisingly disconnects me more. so I became aware of what's going on... me? I don't know. just aware of my relationship with my environment instead of just the environment itself, because then I ignore my part in the environment and feel like I don't quite belong.

finally I kept screaming in my head that I'm here world, I'm connected, I'm real, this is all real. it didn't bring immediate or even noticable results, but I noticed later that it helped to clear my mind when I'm only focused on a mantra instead of a thousand racing thoughts and different internal personalities. and a clear head definitely helped.

it took a couple days and sometimes I still have moments where I feel like reality silently morphed into a dream state but that's all I have. still figuring out all my triggers with this because, even though it's not a new experience to me, it does happen very rarely for me.

I really hope this helped someone today"
1125,Is it normal for a teen to go through some period of depression due to change in brain chemstry?,"I'm gonna be a senior in high school in 2 weeks. A friend of mine, who serves as a private tutor, has recently graduated from college and is pursuing a Master's in education. Aside from work, she and I talk about a lot of other things. You know, things like drama and stress and parents, typical teenage stuff. It's great because I'm in the teenage phase right now and she has just passed it. We were talking a lot about mental health and depression and what not. Despite not being a therapist, a lot of what she talks about seems interesting.

She gave me this saying ""the straw that breaks the camel's back"", which means that when you add one thing (stressor) on a camel's back (you), the camel can easily walk it off. But when you add more and more things, eventually the camel can't carry the load and it breaks.

We were talking about some of the stressors I had, such as school, drama, parents, worries about the future, etc. One thing she also mentioned something about brain chemistry, and how weird stuff happens in the brain during those teenage years.

So Reddit, a couple of questions.

\#1: Does every teen go through some sort of depression/anxiety? Like is that a normal thing?

\#2: Is it normal for weird things to happen in the brain as a teen grows from childhood to manhood?

\#3: External stressors aside, is it normal for depression/anxiety to be caused by these weird changes in the brain?

Thanks."

Then a little bit later when I was 13 I masturbated about if we were having sex but never pictured anything in my head of actually having sex, just the thought I guess? I always would take her underwear and masturbate with them but never thinking about her really. Then I go into her Instagram one time when I’m 13 and find a picture and start mastubrating to her body parts, then midway through I realize that it was my cousin and that this was wrong, didn’t do anything ever after that. I feel guilt like I can’t go on, like I have to pay for what I’ve done. It seems like these guilt thoughts will never go away.

(keep in mind that im only in highschool)

1. i keep confusing letters that are similar, for example s and z; d and b; p and q; m and n;  m and w. i sometimes replace letters in words with letters that look similar to them, (and i just did while writing this) for example them and thew.

2. i forget how to spell words. my whole life ive been a good speller and ALWAYS won spelling bees at my school, but now i keep forgetting how to spell words correctly and usually have to rely on google or autocorrect. i only forget the more complicated words though. 

3. confusing there/their/theyre. again, my whole life ive been good at grammar and always knew the differences between theyre their and there. ive only made a mistake with those words once or twice in my life up until this point. 

4. now this one is the most confusing to me, i sometimes tend to replace words with words that sound similar. for example today i accidentally replace news with nudes. 

why is this happening to me? should i see a psychiatrist?"

Over the years I've contemplated suicide many many times but I was always never willing to go forward with  it does me writing the letter mean that I've come to terms with everything?"
1133,Frustrated about care in my area,"I \[18F\] am making the transition from pediatric to adult care. At my old pediatric office, I had been prescribed fluoxetine to manage my OCD I have been dx'd with since I was 14. My therapist (separate from the pediatric office) also speculates I have BPD but I need to see someone qualified to diagnose and treat me since she isn't. I no longer go to my pediatric office and no longer take fluoxetine (I stopped taking it when I shouldn't have, my bad and my fault, but when I tried going back on it, my suicidal ideation got worse along with my mood swings). When I first went to my new family practice's office, I asked them for a psychiatric referral. They were unable to refer me to any specific office so I was instead given a paper instructing me to call my insurance and ask what psychiatric care was covered in my area. I called and scheduled an appointment with my local mental health clinic to see a psychiatrist. After my screening, I was taken into a room with these two women who wanted to discuss a financial plan with me. They had decided I needed med maintenance and further screening to get a diagnosis, but had also concluded I needed to be on part-time hospitalization. Problem is, the hospitalization program they wanted me to do would cost &gt;$500 a week with my insurance and they were unsure how long I would need to be on part time hospitalization. I can't afford that! I'm a community college student and part-time fast food employee.  I had to reject hospitalization, but the clinic refuses to further treat me because they concluded I needed a specialized level of care and refused to lower their level of care so I would be able to afford medication and further screening.

They gave me a couple doctors names and numbers written down for me to call to get screened and medicated by them. So I had a bad experience and wasted $50 on an introductory screening. I'll have to spend another $50 on the next psychiatric screening I get. $100 and I don't have a diagnosis or any fucking meds for my OCD symptoms and BPD-adjacent symptoms."
1134,Depression and hygiene,"I've been dealing with depression gender dysphoria for a long time, and I feel so guilty for letting my dental hygiene go downhill, I'm taking better care of it now, but the damage is done. And now I'm too anxious to see a dentist, because I hate being judged and I'm really sensitive to pain and loud noises. It's getting too much.
😭😭😭😭😭"
1135,Think my feelings are being belittled and I don't know what to do.,"Hey guys, lately I've been struggling to get a lot of negative thoughts out of my head and nothing seems to be working. I have them everyday and my parents are beginning to get tired of hearing them and I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. I think I need help, but my counselor hasn't been doing much and I genuinely believe there's nothing I can look forward to. Sometimes during the day, I'll be jittery, said to be moving too fast and dancing and laughing extremely loudly and then I just think a thought and I feel like I'm extremely stuck, like nothing can pull me out of the negative things that make my life and I'm not sure how to cope, or how I can cope with these excessive feelings of self-pity, anger, sadness, and fear that everyone hates me much longer and I don't think I'm ever going to get help for this.

I feel really strange for having these feelings and it would be nice if someone could somewhat relate to me. At this rate, I don't think I'll ever be labelled into a category of whats wrong with me despite it being very obvious that something is - I just don't think my parents think I'm sick enough because I can be happy at times, and I feel frustrated, because they think its normal, but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. Anyone else feel like this?"
1136,does anyone here know if i could get a job at pinerest if i only have restaurant experience?,it says you only have to have a high school diploma. trying to get out of the restaurant industry and do  the work that i feel called to do.
1137,Everytime I take a shower I have deep anxiety depressive thoughts,"Why is it that way? I have PTSD, it is because of this? Is it the relesing negative thoughts like in medidation thing? Thats the reason I always shower with loud music (which I really love) to focus on something else snd not going insane."
1138,Coping with anxiety,So I have been having bad anxiety lately causing my heart beat to rise up. Just looking at my heartbeat on my Apple Watch go up cause it to go up even more. I try to relax and I end up feeling fine shortly after. How can I learn to control when I start having these anxiety attacks.
1139,How do I get diagnosed and treated for borderline personality disorder,[removed]
1140,I’m scared of making friends,I feel like they’ll just leave me eventually. Or I get extremely paranoid. I even feel jealous when they hang out with other people then I start to feel ridiculous.
1141,My dad thinks the government is out to get him.,[removed]
1142,Does anyone else have issues with Mindfulness/grounding or have it completely not work at all?,"I am (17f) and I have allot of anxiety related issues like PTSD, ADD, and Anxiety.  I've been to therapy for about a year and my therapist always tries to get me to do it but I feel like it makes it worse/ doesn't work at all, does anyone else have this issue?"
1143,How to help father who is losing touch with reality / has high anxiety?,"I've always known my dad had anxiety, he has panic attacks. he's a hypochondriac, and is always worried and panicking about everything. 

My dad has not been handling the pandemic well, he's been extreme isolating and was convinced he would die if he left home. Recently he's been in a 'bad mood'. Yesterday, he told me to get ready because he was going to jail. He said he received a letter from the municipal court and it didn't have his name on it so my mom returned it to sender (that part is true) but he's convinced it was for him that he must have committed a crime in the past under a fake name. I asked follow up questions, and they made no sense. He says he never used a fake name before but he probably did for the crime and doesn't remember. I asked him what the crime was. It was total nonsense, it didn't make sense nor was any part of the story a crime at all, but he's convinced it is. He started to cry and I discussed anxiety and catastrophising, he seemed better. He agreed that he should get help. 

But later that day he told me again that he was sure he was going to be falsely accused and go to jail and we would lose everything. He then called my aunt. My aunt called me afterward and told me that he had totally lost touch of reality, but it wasn't the first time. He had a psychotic breakdown when I was very young (I heard the same from my mom once, but I don't really remember it) and eventually he got better. He asked her for help too. 

So what I thought was just extreme anxiety seems now to be more serious, like paranoia and psychosis. He seems to be totally fine otherwise. I don't know what to do now... What do you do when someone is paranoid and losing touch with reality?"
1144,I (19F) believe my ex/friend (20M) needs psychiatric help but his best friend (17M) and I have no idea what to do,[removed]
1145,I feel so alone,I know I have friends and family that care about me but it really feels like they don’t these days I just want wake up one morning and not have to force myself to be happy I wish being sad wasn’t my default. I’ve been feeling really anxious lately also so that isn’t helping last time I tried talking to one of my friends about how I was having a bad day she cut me off mid sentence to talk about something completely different which normally I wouldn’t mind but the mind set im stuck in just takes it as further evidence that people don’t care about me
1146,What do you do if you get the urge to punish yourself?,"I'm no stranger to self-punishment and I haven't harmed myself for a long while now. I thought that I'm fine now, that I'm probably over it, but recently I realized that there are some things that trigger my self-loathing or I feel things I think I shouldn't and I get the desire to do something. I feel the need to punish myself for thinking certain things, because I'm being stupid and selfish. 

Because I've found something to do now, I'm deluding myself to think that I'm of more value now than I was before. But I think my mind knows that it's a lie. If I take away my work, I'm nothing. I'm still nothing. I don't know what I am. And I don't know the *when, how* or *what* of finding 'me' or the thing that is missing in my life. If I take away my work, I know I'd be back to being pathetic and worthless and miserable."
1147,Taking Digital Steps towards Mental Health,[removed]
1148,Anyone else feel worthless?,"I don't know what to do. 

I've always been an average joe. 

People have told me in the past to follow my passion. To do something I love. The sad part is, I don't love doing anything! 
I am not good at anything! I've loved playing video games. And I suck at them. I used to love programming. Now I don't. At a point learned the piano. Was even a bit more than average at it. But just stopped playing it out of the blue. Astrophysics has always been close to me, something I've enjoyed learning about for the longest time, but now I study Computer Science and even though I took CS out of passion, now it has faded away. Life feels pretty pointless when you don't have a passion. I've never done something for a long time and enjoyed it. Always told myself I was too curious. But guess I am not. 

Tell me if anyone else feels the same."
1149,I failed a module at university and I'm not sure if I will get a second chance but I feel so depressed.,"I was studying Japanese and Linguistics at university and I failed a component to do with the language because my computer messed up and was slow. I know that's not an excuse, first semester I don't take things seriously but the second half I tried to push my grades up, learn and study well and then there was another hurdle. Due to the pandemic and home life issues/mental health, I messed up really badly and they are bringing me into another meeting. I'm still waiting on my resit results for the other component to see if I can progress further, but I just saw that there was a Chinese course and I am slightly more passionate to do with China than Japan, although I really love the language. I think my university will just let me to a degree in linguistics but this is going to make me unhappy as I really love East Asia and I'm okay with learning Chinese because I have knowledge on the politics and culture. I don't want them to kick me out because I'm generally someone who is good academically and just had a bad year. 
What should I do?"
1150,Is there something wrong with me,"I’m a college student (21M), and I’ve felt quite unhappy for a long time.  I guess during our pandemic quarantine I had a lot of downtime away from overwhelming myself with school work that I started to try to get to know myself better.

I’m gay, so first I thought that coming out to my parents would be the first step toward becoming more open to the people around me about my bottled up emotions/ what not.  The gist of what they told me was, “well that sucks but you always have a place to come home to.”  I thought that it was supposed to feel good (it feels good for other people right?). But I didn’t feel any relief.  Instead, I just felt overwhelmed with a surreal apathy, and when I looked at my family it felt like I was looking at strangers and the whole world just felt like I was watching it from TV or something.  It’s kind of hard to describe.

That was about a month ago.  Afterward, I started to feel mood swings of a few days of mild depression (I felt hopeless, unmotivated, etc but not suicidal). Then a day of intense anger.  Finally, I felt a day or two of feeling fine (ig I felt happy enough to somewhat enjoy my day).  The mood swings got more severe.  I would feel a few hours of deeper depression and fantasize about killing myself, and then suddenly start to feel happy.  Like, actually happy.  It’s very confusing because I would think that I have the thing beat until I just start to fall into a downswing again.

I don’t show any of this outwardly except for one friend who has a past of struggling with mental illness.  I would try to get myself to ask my best friend, who I live with, if he thinks that I might need help.  But, I simply can’t, even though I get worried that my mental state somehow comes out anyway.

I haven’t seen a therapist because that would go on our family insurance plan and I’m sure my step-father would shame me for it (he’s mocked me for having a bout of depressive behavior growing up).  

For the past couple of days, I’ve been feeling back to normal.  It’s because school has started and Ig the work stabilizes my mood.  That’s the frustrating part.  Normal for me still includes an anger that comes and goes all day every day, and I don’t even know if this is how normal people feel.  I mean, I like to think that other people experience life similar to me, but how would I know?  It’s confusing how I can feel so dark and depressed with mood swings and all and so quickly be back to my normal self.  I mean, I’m glad, especially because I think that other people have it a lot worse than me, but also a little concerned.  To be more specific about my anger, I can go into short fits of rage when I know that I am alone, but it’s mostly internalized.  There’s other similar small stuff that bother me, but now I’m beginning to wonder if I just have a hard time noticing myself.

In a nutshell, that’s been my ride for the past month.  Any advice or details about whether I’m okay or not would be much appreciated.  I find if really hard to talk to people.  Ik this is a long post.  Thanks man"
1151,schizoid personality helpppp,"im pretty sure i have SPD. i feel emotionally flat, prefer being alone, cannot react to praise or criticism, have trouble expressing my feelings, etc. are there any strategies to ease the severity of these symptoms? i want to break this pattern of behavior. hopefully i am just overreacting and this will all blow over (and maybe im simply depressed), but i honestly believe i have SPD as ive experienced these symptoms so long without any explanations. if anyone has suggestions as to how to alleviate these symptoms, id love to hear them and i appreciate ur time"
1152,How sick can coming off of or changing an antidepressant make you?,
1153,For those of you mentally suffering because of COVID -- stay strong. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.,"At the beginning of the summer, a first year engineering student at my university died as a result of pandemic-related emotional complications. She was only 18. 

When I heard the news, I was heart broken. This virus has wreaked havoc over our world—socially, physically, economically, and mentally. Even when a successful vaccine is developed, we will still be faced with the “fourth wave”. The fourth wave of this pandemic is often described as the lingering mental health consequences and emotional turmoil that will plague our world for many months to come. To combat this fourth wave, we must support one another and look ahead to a brighter future. There IS a light at the end of this long, bleak tunnel. I know that sounds corny, but it is absolutely true. 

The 18-24 age group (my age group, as well as the age group of the majority of the people on this sub, I’m sure) has been especially affected by COVID in terms of mental health, and will be the predominant sufferers of the fourth wave. 18-24 year olds are legal adults, with all the responsibilities and stressors that adults face. However, our brains are still not fully developed or equipped to handle these stressors in healthy ways. 

We struggle with impulse control, stress management, frustration tolerance, and risk assessment compared to older adults. This means that when confronted with difficult situations (like a pandemic!!) we turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Alcohol, drugs, too much screen time, over-eating—you name it. That also means that some among us will take unnecessary risks, like partying, going to bars, and not wearing masks. 

Additionally, we are going through a time of a lot of “firsts” in our lives, whether it’s moving away from home, attending college, getting our first jobs, having our first serious relationships and heartbreaks, etc. These rapid-fire milestones can be exhausting and are associated with neurological and emotional intensity. 

To top it all off, we honestly haven’t had a lot of life experience yet to put our struggles into perspective. Every generation has experienced national tragedies, pandemics, wars, and economic recessions. But for many of us 18-24 year olds, this is our first experience of international panic and turmoil. It’s totally understandable that we are freaking out. We feel depressed, isolated, anxious and hopeless. But life will always go on, so it may be helpful for us to look to our elders for emotional guidance in this time. They have experienced a lot of terrible stuff, yet they’ve successfully gotten through it all. It ain’t their first rodeo!

Considering all these factors, the pandemic has hit our age group’s mental health harder than any other. We lack the life experience and brain maturity necessary to navigate these troubling times. But that doesn’t mean we should give up! It should only encourage us to accept our limitations and actively seek to better ourselves. 

When everything seems like it’s out of our control, that’s when we need to commit to self-care above all else. We need to prioritize exercise, getting sunlight, nourishing our bodies with healthy foods, meditating, limiting our news media and social media use, and calling our friends and family frequently. I wish you all the best in getting through these tough times, and I want each and every one of you to know that life WILL get better, no matter how painful it seems now. I wish I could have told the engineering student at my university that. 


Sending love and positivity to everyone reading this. Stay safe! ❤️

1154,I laughed for real again after more than a year,"A while ago, I couldn't truly laugh anymore. I would chuckle and act like I was laughing. But I wasn't. I don't know how long it's been. More than a year for sure. Maybe two. Maybe three. But today...I laughed again. With pure joy and no holding back. My mom pointed it out. I didn't even know she realized I wasn't laughing for real and I didn't realize that I was laughing at that moment..I felt kind of free and proud. The moment she pointed that out I went quiet..and then tears ran down my face and I laughed more, I smiled really brightly. I hadn't felt like that since forever. I earned some confidence today. I learned that I don't have to be afraid to laugh and make jokes, I can be proud and enjoy things too.
I'm so happy.
I want to cry of joy more often. It's such a free and light feeling."
1155,Am i weird to talk to myself about everything?, .
1156,What is wrong with my mom?,"My mom acts very childlike. She loves to get dressed up, puts on her makeup too heavily, wears gaudy jewelry, etc. She doesn't comprehend things you tell you. She will ask you a question by text and then you respond and she says ""what are you talking about?"". She still can't use a computer and I tried to teach her when I was 7 (almost 20 years ago).

She is obsessed with religion. She switches religions every few years. She sends me sometimes 100 to 200 images via text and like 60 written messages to accompany the images. This is a daily occurrence almost. I tell her to stop sending me so much and that I dont download her pictures and she says she won't do it anymore. The next day or two days later, she's back at it. She'll send me pictures of random crap, or herself, or wherever outing she went on, or pictures of text from her religious books she's reading. I tell her almost daily to leave me alone and stop trying to convert me to her newest religion. She says she'll stop and I'll just have to learn on my own and then she's back to it the next day.

Before text messaging, she used to send like 25 page letters in the mail to everyone she knew. She wouldnt take a hint that people were done talking and ready to leave in person. She also knows no boundaries. She was texting my sister's ex boyfriend in highschool after they broke up, telling him things about my sister.

She's afraid to drive alot of places. She won't drive on the interstate, etc."
1157,I think my brain is broken,"I (26f) have been dealing with a issue for the last 3 years.. I have reached out to doctors and reached out to a therapist (wasn’t helpful at all) but it seems to only be getting worse..
-When I go anywhere I make a mental note of where all the exits are and I make sure to try to remain along the perimeters of places.
- if I’m in a store longer than 30 mins my heart starts racing and I get really sweat and depending on the crowd size I will cry
- my brain feels like 🤔 a giant room with file cabinets and sometimes those file cabinets break and then everything is everywhere. And I have to organize it all again with weird elevator music playing in the background and it changes all the time and too often
- I get nervous when people tell me things hat are going on in their lives (bad or stressful things) because afterwards I feel physically tired
- when I try to explain how I feel or what I’m thinking (even if it’s not bad) I feel like crying and like no one cares so I should just shut up
- I work from home because I feel like if I had to actually go to work... if anything bad ( no matter how big or small) happened I would just stop going
- I sometimes completely zone out losing time  (up to 4 hours) and I don’t know what’s happening during this time; I’ve tried to record myself and it just seems like I’m sleep with my eyes open but I’m not sleep"
1158,I need an advice on how to help my girlfriend,"Please, she is strugling so hard with anxiety. She had depression and she used to harm her self for 3 or 4 years. She is doing realy bad and her parents think she's making it up. They even make fun of her for it. She strugling realy hard and I have no idea what to do. Any advice is apreciated. Thank you!"
1159,How to know if you need therapy or not,"How do I know if I need therapy or not? For a couple of months, I planned on killing myself. I went with my plan but failed. It's been a month and a half since I stopped planning my death. I still wanna die sometimes and find myself questioning if it'd be better if I stopped struggling but I've been able to chase these thoughts away. 

My mental health has improved a lot these past month and a half. I no longer think about killing myself everyday. It only crosses my mind about once or twice a week nowadays (I stopped planning my death but sometimes I catch myself imagining if it'd be better to die). 

Anyway, the suicidal thoughts is not the reason why I want to seek therapy. It's how I cope with things that I want to seek therapy. I won't get into details with how I cope because I feel really ashamed and embarrassed just thinking about it. But basically, I started doing this six years ago. I would only do this for like, 15 to 20 minutes max when I was young but now I spend most of my time doing this (I would say, 4 to 5 hours. Sometimes, I would do this all day). 

I've been trying to stop this by finding new hobbies and by keeping busy. And I'd like to say that i'm successful in doing this but i'm not.  I still find myself spending 5 fucking hours doing this thing, and I'm not even sure if I want to stop doing it and that's what terrifies me. 

I guess my question is, do I desperately need therapy? Now that I'm rereading my paragraphs, I know that something is wrong with me. But I just feel so silly. I feel like my problem is minuscule compared to others and I feel like i'm overreacting."
1160,I’m so drained by being an ethnic outcast,"I am a mixed race person, a literal product of colonialism, slavery and genocide.  I am part Black African, part White European, part Brown Native American, and part Jewish.  Growing up my skin tone was always attacked by everyone, either for being too dark, or not dark enough.  I have been called the N word, called dirty for my skin tone, been told to get back on a boat (I’m born and raised in the US), and yet I am still not dark enough to “qualify” as being oppressed.  I am sick of it all.  I have never felt like I belonged anywhere.  Racism is stupid, basic knowledge of human history can tell you that were all part of the human race despite our ethnic differences, and yet we seek to cast others out as not being enough of one thing or another.  I am so sick and tired of being told I’m not black enough, white enough, jewish  enough, or native enough.  I really wish at times that I hadn’t even been born."
1161,"I'm not happy, and I hate it.",[removed]
1162,I feel like I've clocked out of life,"I feel like this occasionally but this last week has been especially difficult. 
I can't do the things I need to, I lay in bed all day until someone tells me to do something. My mom's mad bc I don't get my chores done, but it's hard to getting things done when I'm like this. 

When I'm in this type of mind fog it feels like I'm not real, I get surprised when I remember Im an actual human who can think and move. It's like this weird dream like trance, I'll be scrolling through social media or just being with my thoughts and it will randomly hit me that I can think, I'll look down at my hands and be confused about how I got in a body, it's all really weird.

But I can't really stay like this, people need me sometimes. Im Your classic ""Therapist friend"" but it get really hard to help people work through their Emotions and problems when I'm struggling as well. I have responsibilities around my home as well, I don't have time to space out all day.

The worst part is when Im in these fogs my impulse control is especially lower. The urges to self harm are louder and it's really hard trying my best not to give in. It makes me so tired all the effort I have to put in to stop myself, all the effort I have to put into displaying Emotions so I don't look zoned out, it's exhausting."
1163,Sometimes the loneliness is deafening,So loud it makes you desperate and nobody wants desperation for a friend
1164,"I can't go see a therapist to know what's wrong with me, what do I do?","Hi! This is my first time posting here and I hope I'm not breaking any rules.

I'm a 20 year old woman who lives alone in a foreign country, my two friends left when quarantine started and I don't have any family in the city I'm in rn. Spending the last six months alone with my thoughts made me notice some worrying behaviors and recurring thoughts, but I may just be exaggerating so I haven't told anyone in my entourage about it. 

As the title says, I can't go to therapy mainly because of financial problems and my insurance doesn't cover therapy sessions, I'd ask for help from my parents but I don't want them to know I'm seeing a therapist because they were against it when I was living under their roof. I would really like to make sure I'm mentally okay before the new school year starts, I have a feeling it may not be anything serious but I can't help but worry and think about it everyday. 

I'm currently living in France so if anyone knows of any ressources or ways to check if I'm okay I would really appreciate it!"
1165,talking to people that aren’t there?,"i only just remembered (i have a really bad memory due to ptsd) that a while back, when i was really drunk and high, or on drugs (i know i wasn’t sober), that i’d be with friends, and i would start talking to people that weren’t there. 
i would get into these episodes of talking to people that existed but weren’t with me at the moment in time, or i’d call out their name. 

i would be really out of it, but after snapping out of the talking to imaginary people, my friends would ask me “who were you talking to?”. i’d always be really confused and have no idea myself. i know for a fact that i wasn’t sleeping, as my friends told me i was wide awake. as i know that if you’re asleep you can dream and end up sleep talking / shouting... but this wasn’t that.

this happened on several different occasions if my memory serves me right. 

does anyone know what this is?? is it some kind of hallucination?? pls help my brain is a mess"
1166,I’m quite young but I’m considering suicide,I’ve been suicidal for a long time and now I feel that no one can care less about me. I have a growing gap between me and my parents and friends. I would tell the people I know but I’m scared that they wouldn’t understand (my family has had great mental health). I also feel that I’m worthless and nothing I do now makes me happy.
1167,Overly attached to a teacher,"I feel as if I'm almost grieving because I didn't get put in a class with my favourite teacher this year. That sounds dramatic, but I've realised that over the past couple years I've formed an attachment to him which I think is sort of unhealthy, like he represents a father figure for me (but he's obviously just a teacher who I was always going to have to leave). And now I won't get to see him I feel like I've lost something huge, and I'm really upset. I always felt like he was the one adult who made me feel like everything was going to be alright as I got older - everyone in my community loves and respects him so much, and the fact that he had a soft spot for me made me feel like I was actually going to be okay in life. He seemed like he had everything under control, and like he had life figured out (even though logically I know no one really does) and so even just being in his presence made me feel safe. Now he's gone it all feels really scary again. Is this normal? How do I stop feeling like this?"
1168,Why am i such a coward?,"Hi. I really don't know what to do. When i was a kid, i was very outgoing and kind of a litle imp, to the point where my parents actually considered buying one of those leashes for kids. I never really did something bad, though, i just wouldn't stop running around and talking and joking. But after growing up, i've changed 180 degrees, I'm scared of interacting with people, even my own family. I'm always that weird guy who sits by himself and doesn't talk to anyone, and when i try it comes out some mumbled nonsense. It's gotten to the point where more than once i've sat by myself for hours instead of walking into the room i was supposed to go to and doing what i should, and that's even for more serious things like job related stuff. I also never had a girlfriend and im 29. Just two days ago, after a long time of creating a profile and deleting it after some minutes, i finally got a match on tinder (god knows why, she must have hit her head or something), she sent me a message yesterday but i hadn't had the courage to open the app since. I do want to, iwant to talk to her, i want to talk to people, i can't stand being alone anymore, but im just such a fucking coward. I don't know  what to say or how to say it, im not smart nor funny nor creative to keep a conversation going. I just wanted to be normal."
1169,I have no one else to say this to,"A couple of days ago I asked some friends to refer to me as Taylor instead on the name they already know me as (my deadname), I know it takes some time for people to get used to using that name after years of calling me something different but hearing it out loud seems a lot different especially when it comes from my girlfriend or close friends. I’m just hoping that I’ll be referred to as Taylor soon. 

Second: 
Despite losing some weight over the quarantine months I still feel the same and I gain a bunch of weight every time I eat. When I eat something I instantly regret it and want to throw up, I’ve been exercising but it feels like I just can’t lose anything. I’m constantly sucking in my stomach so I feel a bit thinner but it just makes me feel even more sick. I’ve started to think ahead of time what food I know will be given to me so I can avoid eating anything around that time. 

Third;
My brain is telling me to ruin every relationship I have by being a bitch because I might be dead in a week. It scares me and I don’t want to talk to anyone because I’m scared I’ll hurt someone by lashing out and unable to think of the right words to apologise correctly. I’ve been relapsing on SH a lot and I can’t go a day without hurting myself. No one seems to care or notice so I’ll probably do it until someone realises but I’ll still probably continue because they’ll only help me out of pity and they don’t want to feel responsible if something bad happens to me. 

Anyway, thanks for reading."
1170,"How, and how much of this should I communicate to my boyfriend? Long vent blah deep breath and post as is","I have CPTSD and it's been really bad again lately. I was in an unbelievably toxic relationship for 7 years, 4 years ago that mostly contributed to me becoming a broken human. I was doing really good, all my signs of stress went away until just recently (the severely painful cystic acne, loss of appetite, night terrors, crazy anxiety, paranoia, aches and pains, exhaustion, ect.) And I met the nicest guy possible. He's my best friend and the love of my life, I seriously couldn't ask for a better human in my life. He holds me and rubs my back like my life depends on it when I have meltdowns.

I had a bad meltdown last night you guys, I am not doing very well. I think stress from work is contributing to triggering it, but I'm working so hard to keep okay. I'm eating, keeping a dream journal, taking vitamins, self caring religiously; I've taken up crocheting cute amigurum, playing ukelele, finding new music and movies I like. I've been reading books I love...

You see, we got an appartment a little over a year ago that is very nearly the exact same layout of the last (very bad) few years of my last relationship. My childhood best friend helps me decorate (beautifully, he's awesome) it's lovely, and we rearrange things so there's no resemblance because he worries. 

Sometimes when I walk in the door I have flashbacks of memories, even though my life is so dramatically different in the best way now. It sucks, but I can usually deal with it really well. Ususally it just a a feeling like waiting for my old dog who was killed to come greet me or something less insane. Last night my guy worked late and when I heard him come in the door it threw me right into one of the worst attacks I've had in a long time. I had so much anxiety like I was expecting him to scream at me and hurt me, 
I knew it wasn't like that but it just hit me like a train. 

It's hurting him a little when this happens and idk how to explain it to him, I dont want to scare him or make him worry more. He does know our appartment gives me some trouble sometimes (we plan on moving again when we can) but he's never seen it. He doesn't know why I was sobbing last night. All I could manage to tell him was it feels like I'm going back in time because that's often how it feels. He's so supportive and wonderful, he's doing a pretty good job understanding that it's nothing he's doing, it's just.. me, and he's so encouraging. Do I need to tell him some of this? Am I making it worse for myself by not? I really don't know how to handle this anymore you guys. Like, I'm not even sure why I'm doing so poorly all of a sudden again. 

I'm becoming a bit discouraged because I'm not even sure how much a different appartment will help...a little, but noises, waking up, there are things I don't think will ever go away and I'm scared. 

...My boyfriend does also know how toxic my ex was because he tracked us down and broke into his house a few months after we started dating. The cops were there in seconds, luckily and everyone involved got all of the state regulated help we needed. He also kind of knows how bad my parents are and he knew through a mutual friend who worried for me back then why I was never out or hung around anyone. I was dealt a really good hand /s and he knows. I feel like that's all his wonderfully supportive butt needs to know, right? And I do tell him calmly when I'm not doing well usually, he asks how he can help if he can or if I want to talk about it, but I find it so difficult/nearly impossible. I just feel like I'm pushing him away and I don't like it. But I also don't want a therapy session with him. But I could also really use a good talk like this with someone who knows me, maybe that's wrong though? 

Sorry this is a mess. Ive made a few friends but its kind of hard to ask them to go out to my favorite book store/coffee and tea joint these days. My best friend (the good decorator:"") )is moving acorss the country for awhile and I'm feeling really alone in all of this. My moms not doing well, but is reaching out again and that's triggering in itself. Other family is much worse but I've been doing a damn good job breaking this cycle :"") i am proud of that. Maybe I'm expecting too much from myself."

1172,Can PTSD cause hallucinations? Possible TW- domestic violence,"In July, my mom and her then-fiancé got into a fight. Everyone came out physically ok and he was arrested. I witnessed essentially the entire fight. He was arrested on a Monday night and was released on bail on the following Wednesday or Thursday. My state mandates a no contact order as a special condition of bond in domestic violence cases so he was not allowed to be near us or talk to us. 

On my first night home alone since the fight (my mom works nights), I fell asleep around 8:30pm and woke up at 10:30pm because I heard a lot of yelling. I jumped up and opened my door and saw my mom yelling in her ex fiance’s face. I can’t remember what she said besides “...put your fucking hands on me”. The fiance’s daughter &amp; niece were in the house as well and they begged me not to call the cops and my mom also asked me not to so I went back to my room. 

I brought it up to my mom the next day because I wanted to know why she had stayed home from work and joked about her being so worried about me that she couldn’t stand to leave me alone but she got such a concerned look on her face and she was like “misseselise, I left for work at 8:45 and didn’t come back home until I got off at 6am”. I would’ve shrugged it off as a realistic nightmare (I was having inception like nightmares for a few days before the fight) but I found posts on my private story on snapchat talking about what happened so I was awake to some extent. 

Can PTSD cause hallucinations? Or could this have been just a really fucked up sleep walking half dream? I do plan on seeking therapy for what happened once I have insurance again but I’m not sure when that’ll be and I’ve had this question on my mind for a while now. 

I’ve had PTSD diagnosed before (first time was when I was 11/12, most recent was when I was 16-17, I’m 19 now) and never experienced anything like this. The most recent PTSD diagnosis was technically C-PTSD and it was also related to a domestic violence situation but I didn’t actually witness the fight, just dealt with the aftermath. 

I’m also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, oppositional defiance disorder, and clinical depression in case those are relevant. I appreciate any feedback or responses. I don’t take any medication daily for anything, but I do have a Nexplanon implant in my arm for birth control (though it is bent so I’m not sure if it’s working properly, if at all)."

For some context, I am a 15-year-old female and I live with my Mother, Father, and older brother in a two bedroom apartment. For quite some time now, my mental health has been getting worse and worse. I've been trying to find some ways to cope (Most of them are unhealthy) like isolating myself and self-harming.

My Mother is affected by the slightest things. (she's on anti-depressants) She ends up getting mad at me and acting distant/rude for the rest of the day. I can't talk to my Father because I already told him about this and he basically told me that he didn't care if I was suicidal. My brother isn't even an option at this point (He's autistic and doesn't like me either, plus he thinks that my Dad is some kind of super hero so he tells him about everything I say.)

I'm at my breaking point guys, no one gives a crap about me anyway I'm just a burden to my entire family and I would be better off dead. I just can't do this anymore, I can't live like this..."

1178,a resource that helped me :),"hi everyone! i just wanted to share this one resource that helped me before i was actually able to get proper therapy for my mental health issues. [7cups](https://www.7cups.com/18399456) is free and easy to access, and i used it all the time and it honestly did help me. i do want to say that this is definitely not a substitute for therapy and isn't a good option if you're feeling suicidal. and as a pro tip, i'd personally recommend staying away from the group rooms (hopefully that's changed but in my experience it's too unmoderated) and making sure you look for listeners that have pretty high ratings, to make sure you're getting good support. it's not perfect by any means, but if you need something to help you stay functional until you can get professional help, i hope it helps you like it helped me :)"

I always feel stupid. It feels like every day I just prove it more to those around me. I just want to be able to be myself, without worrying about every single thing that I do/say.

I end up having to stay up watching TV or on my phone because otherwise I can't distract myself from my own thoughts.

1186,not sure what to do about these dreams,"tw sexual assault


For some background, a year or so ago I had this friend who was really touchy and wanted to hav a sexual relationship with me but I didn’t want to and she didn’t really listen when I did tell her no. It wasn’t r*pe or anything but it was uncomfortable and we aren’t friends anymore


so I (f17) keep having dreams about being sexually assaulted, it varies from being brief to being rlly graphic and it’s really fucking me up. last night, within my dream I thought that if I said “no” it’d be fine because in some dreams I don’t explicitly say it but obviously the person in the dream didn’t care - for some reason this one has really affected me. In the dream I felt so hopeless after not being listened to and it extended to me being awake and still feeling like that. what happens is that for a few weeks at a time I consistently have dreams like this, it falls off for a while then picks up eventually. I hate it and I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend is telling me to seek help with a therapist or something but I’m 17 and I’d hate my mum to find out.

1187,Dealing with illness-induced depression.,"I'll make this short. I'm 20 years old. Roughly ever since my 17th birthday my health I have been dealing with terrible health. For whatever reason, I started getting erectile dysfunction; no morning erections anymore and overall more difficulties getting and upholding erections. No physician out of the around 15 I have seen were able to help me or even diagnose me with the underlying ailment that causes the ED. It comes even worse, a year ago my hair also started falling out. Alopecia diffusa, a type of hair loss that is usually caused by a disease. Again, doctors' appointments were to no avail. Since this has started, I have been feeling extremely depressed. The prospect of never being able to build a healthy sex life or even going bald due to illness always sends an intense feeling of dread down my chest. My heart sinks whenever I look into the mirror and I see the bald spots on my head and whenever I think about the future where I won't be able to build a love life properly because of this disease or I may never have children inevitably makes me think about suicide. Words cannot describe how goddamn unfair this situation is; for my quality of life getting compromised so heavily while everyone around me is happily living on makes me jealous. I've thought about suicide so often because of this that I don't even know for how long I want to suffer through this illness. I know the proper sentiment would be to stay strong and never give up, hoping that I may find a cure in the far future but I'm honestly not sure how to keep my composure with this going on. It's terrible. I'm suffering every living second, reminiscing the days where I was healthy, praying I'll get my health back so I can be happy again."

Girls are not interested in me and never have been. It bothered me so much so I joined the gym. I have currently been going for over a year, lost 80 lbs and it didnt make a difference. It has completely destroyed my self esteem with girls because it seems like no matter how much I self improve I'm never good enough. Even with friends in general.

I have been targeted multiple times by pretty much alot of people. School teachers, coaches, police officers, doctors, former friends, co-workers and even therapists. I understand perception doesn't always equal fact, but even if I try to be completely objective there is something about me that brings people to victimize me.

Is it due to my personality or my diagnosis?
To be fair I wasn't necessarily treated right to begin with, without my diagnosis... But now that is through the lens of having symptoms of the current diagnosis. 

What makes me so susceptible to this and how do I fix it? How can I trust people out of the blue and have them not stab my back? I am not gullible either btw, I'm a pretty imposing guy and I'm smart enough to understand bad from good so... I tell people the truth. I try to be genuine and people walk over me, although *I don't act like a doormat*.

- ""I hate you"" 
- ""Go kill yourself.""
- ""I don't understand you""
- ""Let me check your backpack""
- ""You don't have PTSD""
- ""I want to kill you""
- ""You are not [enter positive trait] because I hate you.""
- ""I will bully you because you are weird!""
- ""I hate poor people like you.""
- "" I disbelieve your [interests of discussion] because I hate you and you can't possibly have the same interests""
- "" Are you crazy for feeling [enter negative emotion] because I don't understand.""
- ""Do you lack empathy? Are you retarded?""

Does it have anything to do with being an INTP? (Personality) Or the C-PTSD? How can people be so... Machievillian around me but humble around other people?"

1199,"I just feel hollow, and I just want something to push me","So first off, I just wanna say, no I didn't get a therapist, I am self-diagnosing myself which I know is bad but I have no other explanation to everything I've been feeling for the past 4 years.

So for years is when it first began, I first thought I suffered from an inferiority complex from my brother who always seemed like Mr Perfect (don't get me wrong, I don't hate my brother, I love him to death), it seemed like he could do nothing wrong. So I started and made my life goal to study college in America (I live in Saudi Arabia). 

I would always talk about it and so my dad signed me up for a program called the Tamayuz (tamayuz means excellence in Arabic) program, it's basically a program provided by the government to teach students who are interested in studying in the west. I signed got accepted and started looking forward. 

But then problems started rising up, My parents had unrealistically high expectations of myself (it could've just been my mind blowing things out of proportion but idk) and I started hating every part of myself that could exist, I was prone to snap more, I'd hide in my room more, I was more insecure, and I started avoiding my parents because I was just scared of them

It hurt so much during that time, there were times where I contemplated suicide and was this close to doing it, I picked up vaping Salt Nic to numb the pain, I started hanging out with people I barely knew just to feel as if not everyone hated me. I started being lazier in school because I felt like it's impossible to meet my parents standards, I would get progressively worse marks which would anger my dad more, making give up even harder and the cycle continues. 

One day I had enough of it, I told everything to my mom, vented about everything that's been plaguing me while bawling my eyes out, to summarize what she told ""The devil is just whispering to your ear, go pray and you'll be fine"" this infuriated me at the time because it felt like all my feelings, everything that I felt throughout those years was treated as just something that will come and go. 

Over time, after talking with mother more throughout the years she finally told me she'll look for a therapist I could talk to. So I waited, and waited, and waited and in the end nothing happened she didn't book an appointment or anything, she got busy with work and forgot. And I continued to suffer. 

Around Grade 12 is when I started to get my shit together, I saw it as my make or break moment, if I don't do this now, whatever little motivation left I had would crumble. I put in work, got a SAT score I was  happy with, got straight As on my report card, things were looking up for me. 

Fast forwarding to about 9 months ago, a miracle happened, I got accepted into UC Irvine in the middle of the night, I jumped out of my bed and ran to my dad to tell him... Barely any reaction, if anything he seemed apathetic about it. I was confused, this was supposed to be my moment of triumph, my justification for everything I went through, yet every single member of my family seemed like they didn't care. 

Later on I'd find out my dad was never planning on making me study outside, he used the prospect of studying in the US to motivate me to study, I was shell-shocked to say the least, all of the work I had put, all of my suffering felt like it was for nothing, it hurt on so many levels. My dad told me told me to put work in for my Saudi colleges. 

I did the bare minimum work, just to keep my dad satisfied, and in the end, I got accepted into KSU for medicine, I told my mom, and I can't remember the last time she was that happy. On the surface I was happy because my family was happy, but inside it broke me, this garbage degree that I barely had to put any work into got my family mind-blown, while the degree I worked so hard for was met with cold solemn stares. 

I started KSU this week and it feels off, I barely pay attention and I just wait for the classes to end so my parents don't question anything. I suffer from consistent insomnia and every night I just feel hollow, I feel purposeless. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to achieve with this post, do I just want to vent, do I want help, I don't know but thanks for reading my ramblings"
1200,Worried my therapist may enable my bad behavior?,"I’m worried my therapist may be enabling me. I have been looking for a therapist for nearly two years and struggled to find someone in-network.  About 2 months ago, I finally found one with a local network of providers. I’ve gone weekly since mid July.

However, I’m starting to realize that she agrees with nearly everything I do, including when I say I am worried about a behavior. For example, I have a bit of a temper and said I want to work on managing my stress so that I don’t lash out at people when angry.  I pointed out that this is a pattern for me, and that I have done this repeatedly throughout my whole life (family, coworkers, friends, and partners). My most recent example was with my boyfriend last night, and she said he was disrespecting me but asking me not to swear and yell during disagreements because he “isn’t honoring my anger.” When I pushed back that I don’t feel disrespected, she said he was but didn’t explain why or how. 

When I’ve talked about my depression (I have a hormonal mood disorder that causes me to be depressed, paranoid, and prone to mood swings before my period), she says my depression is positive because it is “self-awareness.” When I mention that I feel paranoid when I over analyze everything, she continues to say this is “a strength.” 

Do I bother continuing with her? I feel like she dismisses my issues as being non-problematic even when they are openly harmful to the people in my life and make me feel worse about myself. Of the 8 sessions we’ve had, one was very beneficial but the rest have had little to no impact, and one had some cultural differences that I can’t blame her for. 

TLDR: my therapist is kind and wants to help me, but seems to encourage my problematic behavior by saying my feelings are valid. (I feel my feelings are valid, but mistreating other people because of them isn’t.)"
1201,Overthinking and low confidence can be a deadly combination...,"
(I decided to type this after just lying in bed trying to sleep for two hours overthinking if you want to imagine it from my perspective…)

I’m a 22(M) virgin and I’ve finally realised am in a pretty deep hole at the moment. I believe am I a position where my low confidence has prevented me from speaking to girls or attempting to get a girlfriend due to the fact I’m scared of ‘shooting my shot’ as they would say these days. This can be in positions of where I may be attracted to a girl and don’t have the guts to message/DM them, or even approach them if I was on a night out etc. This can be quite complicated though… as if the roles where switched and a girl was to message me or approach me for example, id have no problem talking but obviously this happens in a blue moon and most times I’ve not been attracted or into the girl.

I can’t deny, I’ve had multiple opportunities to speak/pull/have sex with girls on nights out, lads’ holidays and through my friends’ girlfriends’ friends (if that makes sense) and on multiple occasions I’ve kind of just played them down. 

I do feel as if it’s time to make a change.

My first step I feel I need to take is accepting an offer. So recently, a close friend of mine has said his girlfriend’s friend has been asking for single friends and he’s basically put it on a plate for me. The problem I have with this is I can jump straight onto it I just generally have no clue what I would talk or say to her over message etc. However, as mentioned before I would rather meet her in person straight away but nowadays it’s not a simple as that and I feel as if I’d need to talk to her for at least 2/3 week minimum before meeting her. I will admit, the fear of rejection is a massive problem of mine and this may be playing a bit part in my overthinking of outcomes from talking to her. As previously mentioned on some of my old posts I think I’m being completely dominated by the fact that near enough all my friends are in relationships at this point and I’m just waiting for the time to come for it to be my turn but, while am sat here doing nothing that time will never come.

I just don’t know what to do..... any tips would be massively appreciated, and I do see myself to be in an extremely fortunate position compared to others with a solid group of close knit friends and family around me at all times, however deep down am too much of a shithouse to express this out and just suppress it all massively. I do believe it’s time for me to change and be better for the future, ideally I think this should be now.

TL;DR Overthinking and confidence can be a horrible mix."

1205,Opinions on Zoloft?,"My partner and I have been taking Zoloft for the past year. For me, I’m on 37 mg and it’s made me feel crazy and I’m trying to get off of it. For him, he’s on 100 mg and has as-needed anxiety medication on top of that. I feel like his medicine is negatively affecting his ability to process emotions and I think it is having a negative affect on our relationship and communication skills. Does anyone have a similar story or feel similarly? I am in no way saying I am against all medicine. Please remember this is a personal experience for everyone and it might not work for him or me! Thanks everyone."

1207,Sometimes life and circumstance keep you from being yourself - mostly a motivational reflection,"So, I've struggled with severe insomnia my whole life, which has several symptoms that are similar to schizophrenia after prolonged sleep deprivation, and then ended up with ptsd when I was 20. Luckily, I got that diagnosed and have done therapy and found ways to mitigate the negative effects of these issues. Slowly but surely, always moving forward. I'm 29 now. 

I've realized that while those issues would have and will always influence my life, who I am, and how I respond to life, I've realized that my circumstances and situation have kept me from becoming myself and figuring out what brings me joy in general. My mental health problems sort of compounded and I have spent most of my adult life homeless, begging for meals, literally living outside and off of handouts when I couldn't couch surf. I became an alcoholic because there's nothing like it to get you to sleep while you're freezing in a train yard, ya know. 

Well, about a year and a half ago, a couple of my long time friends offered to let me live in their spare room in a better town than my hometown. Since then, I've finished the bachelor's degree I had to abandon back after the traumatic event, get and keep a couple of jobs, and figure out what I want out of life. 

Turns out I love metal working and working with machinery and cars. I'm sure I would have always loved these things, but I never got the chance to even own a car for more than a couple of weeks. I've found my passions and they happen to be things I've just never had the opportunity to even experience. I'm working to learn to weld and have been working on cars and trucks for the last several months and I've never felt happier and more fulfilled with my daily life. 

And I never had the chance to even know that this brought me happiness, because I didn't have access to it. 

If I hadn't grown up poor, in a dead little town, maybe I would have found out and been able to work toward it before getting ptsd, but we can never know. Maybe if someone had offered me a safe place to exist earlier, I could have gotten a job and a car and learned back then. But that didn't happen. 

It's made me realize in a very real and significant way that as people say, our environment really does influence who we are. 

So I wanted to say if you feel like you have no purpose or if nothing brings you joy, or if you don't know what you want to do, or you don't have any skills, it's not too late. I didn't get the chance to even find something I loved till I was almost 30 years old.

Felt like that might be worth sharing. Seems like it might help someone. 

I'm open for questions and whatever too."

1212,Rough week,"Hello everyone,   


I hope you are doing as well as you can in the current climate. I just needed to vent somewhere but also feel like there is somebody that cares at least a bit cause I really need some company just now. Corona hit hard and I had issues all throughout it but recently I came back from my home country to the place where I live. I knew that things would get tough again as I assumed my anxiety levels would increase due to university getting closer, coronavirus getting stronger, trying to figure out my future etc.  


I was not able to get in touch with my psychiatrist since April, I was supposed to have an appointment back then but it got cancelled and then I have never heard from them. I was still waiting for the call as I was just supposed to enrol into therapy. The call never came. So I finally called my GP and found out that this was the second psychiatrist within two years that left the hospital and therefore I will start from point 0.   


I have been having some darker thoughts in the past week as lots of things went wrong. I had issue when moving and some other things. Currently I feel overwhelmed and lonely and I just really wish I could have someone that would sit with me here and that would drink tea with me. The thing is though I ultimately also usually run away from people as they sometimes make my mood and situation worst.  


I don't know. I just really really really need a good hug."
1213,Having a hard time coping with news about ex Possible t.w.,"My mother called me today and informed me that an ex boyfriend of mine was just arrested for first degree murder. I don’t know how to feel. I feel sick. I feel sad. I don’t feel safe. He was always a little...different. He wasn’t violent at first. When he turned violent is when I left him. I tried warning the next girl about it. But she didn’t believe me until he did it to her too. She pressed charges against him and got away. I tried being his friend for a while hoping that he’d go to therapy and get help for his anger. I don’t know the details of his charges, what really happened, other than it’s first degree murder. Are these feelings I’m having valid? I just don’t know how to process this."
1214,Why don’t i have empathy?,"Am i the only one who thinks they don’t really feel/have empathy? And if you also think the same can you  share it and share your experience? Because it always causes trouble, people say that it “hurts” them or some stupid shit like that and i truly don’t give a fucking crap tbh. But yeah if anyone feels the same can you share your experiences with it?"
1215,Life has been starting to feel harder for me,"I never been someone who would suffer anxiety
But lately I been feeling anxiety and feeling stressed
Over simple an Daily stuff mostly about online school my school doesn't really do zoom or anything like that they mostly send stuff and chores for us to do 
The thing is that because of this even when I have done most of my work I still feel stressed and feel like I should be doing something today I had to re do something I spent a few hours in and ended up criying I feel bad for crying about something so simple and so dumb but I just been feeling so bad this year I don't even know how to talk about this to my family their approach is more saying that I should just do everything I have to but even when I do I can't seem to feel peace is just not that simple is getting harder to do my jobs just because of my emotions at the moment and it hurts me even more the fact that I can't stop thinking that all of this is dumb and i'am just making to much of a problem over something so simple"
1216,Anyone else yearn yet dread intimacy?,"I've only ever had one GF, and she dumped me 6 months ago and it made me feel like shit. To this day, I have no idea why she did so. I've always been good to her and I tried my best to make her happy. In the end, she treated me like shit when she wanted to leave and made me feel like everything was my fault. Heck, I was the ultimate simp for her. I've lost so much money and I stressed out too much for her and because of her during the relationship. After she left, I became extremely depressed but I managed to pull myself out of it after like 4 weeks of misery. Then came a period of a couple months of happiness. 

After that honeymoon period ended, I've been up and down, having some relapsing moments and other times hating her will all my soul moments. I've tried to move on, but it's like she emotionally scarred me. 

Right now, I really yearn for intimacy. Not in the sexual way, but in a way that makes me feel safe and happy. You know? Like someone to talk to or even hug. However, I dread the process of asking someone out and starting the whole process all over again. At this point, I'm too numb to even like someone. I'm too numb to even give 2 shits about anyone. Believe me, I try to like people but I'd rather not spend time with anyone nor see anyone.

I don't like the feeling of being alone. I am over the person who treated me like shit, but I'm not over how I was treated nor am I over how things happened."

1220,The Significance of Compassion,"One of my favorite quotes in literature comes from John Milton’s Paradise Lost. Upon being cast from heaven, Lucifer rallies his despondent followers, invigorating them with a thrilling speech proclaiming that, “The mind is it’s own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” Despite coming from the Prince of Darkness, this quote is one used to inspire optimism. In many ways, it holds a great deal of truth, but misses out on one important detail: minds, like places varying by location, vary by individuals, and some cannot make a hell into heaven alone.

A truly awful symptom of mental illness is the fact that it’s often dismissed. Human society is dominated by customs and ideals, dictations on what is acceptable, and what is not. This has the significant role of maintaining order within society. It’s useful in preventing reprehensible such as rape, murder, wanton theft, and so many other social anathema. Those who follow society’s cultural laws are often rewarded, but those who act out of turn may become pariah. Unfortunately, this is where the great failing of many customs comes into play. For reasons they cannot control, many find themselves before the judge of society, not as perpetrators, but as unwilling victims.

A common, and far too misunderstood illness is ADHD, a disease I am intimately familiar with. In my opinion, one of the most harmful false equivalences in the world of mental illness that ADHD is stupidity. Execution dysfunction (and if you don’t know what that is, imagine your own mind is a cage that your trapped inside of) was the cause of extremely harmful social stigma directed towards me. My ADHD manifested in odd behaviors that often attracted the ire of those around me. I remember one day hearing classmates of mine refer to me as, “stupid and crazy.” I once had a teacher tell me that I would become a criminal someday and end up in jail. I was told by another teacher that my brain was broken. All of which severely harmed my self esteem, but one of ADHD’s most insidious symptoms made this blow to my self esteem so much worse.

Individuals who have ADHD have a nervous system that is wired in a manner that is different from what you might consider, “the average person.” We experience something of a stimulus overload that can magnify feelings of pain. This pain isn’t just limited to the physical, it also envelopes psychological pain as well. 

Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria is said to be one of the hardest, if not the hardest part of having ADHD. Rejection hurts us all and that pain is always a valid feeling to go through, but for those with ADHD it is like that pain is magnified ten fold. I remember times when I found myself on the floor, unable to move, feeling as if white hot metal was piercing my back because of what someone had said to me earlier that day. I developed an obsession with intelligence and not appearing mentally ill. In turn, resulting in my unwillingness to seek treatment, in turn only worsening my experience. Yet at the same time, everyone else assumed I was just acting that way, as if I had full control over it. I now know that that was not the case at all, yet I still believed that it was my fault. Though every day I wish someone would just choose to understand me, I wish they would give me the benefit of the doubt instead of treating me as if I was either a menace or irreparably stupid. 

When faced with people who seem like not all the lights are on upstairs, acting in disruptive manners and/or are generally a nuisance it’s easy to simply disregard them as “choosing” to do so. This is understandable, because as self aware as we all are, we sometimes tend to forget to be “other aware.” We often don’t realize that consciousness, pain and emotion are experienced differently for each person, but they are, and that is the most important thing that one can understand.

I don’t have OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dissociative personality disorder, mental retardation, psychosis, paranoia or many of the myriad of ways that one’s brain can be made different. I can’t imagine what it’s like to suffer from many of those, but I do know what it was like to be stereotyped and dismissed. I wasted *years* of my life, missing out on opportunities and experiences because I had a disease I didn’t even understand, but because no one was willing to understand me I suffered, and no one should have to go through pain like that. The mark of failure is not poverty and illness, and the mark of greatness is not simply prosperity and health, but if there is a true indicator of a person’s worth, it lays within their compassion. 

The strong and privileged have been given a great gift: the opportunity to lift up the weak and disadvantaged, but so often is it wasted by ignoring and pushing those below them down, and there is no greater waste of a gift. So be the caring person in someone else’s life. Help those who cannot help themselves, be a source of inspiration rather than envy, show compassion to those even who struggle with expressing kindness. The difference between compassion and cruelty is the difference between Heaven and Hell, and it is better to serve for Heaven, than to rule in Hell."
1221,Ideas to help cope with tragedy and work through grief?,"My dad’s brain cancer is growing back and my aunt’s tumor’s spread... and I just can’t figure out the best way to handle it. Do I let myself cry until my heart stops, or do I just hold it in and live in this dark space in my mind until it goes away. I fear the pain that is to come, and I don’t feel equipped to deal with it."
1222,Really can't cope atm,Main social group blocked me because i posted 1 thing about how dumb covid conspiracies are. After her posting things i disagree with for months. Even got her kid to block me. Like i genuinely care about all of them. The daughter in particular (aka the one they got to block me)... There's few people in the world i care about more than her. Like i genuinely don't mind being friends with people i disagree with. But apparently they do
1223,Just need to vent.,"Im underweight and my family and my so called best friends let me know about it, my parents (my dad especially) talks about it everytime I try talk to them about anything. The problem is, it's physically impossible for me to gain weight, I have a high metabolism so my body burns through food quickly. My friends and family remind me of it too much, they make rude nicknames about my weight. As well as this, I feel like I have social anxiety (I don't know if I do but I do feel like I do), everytime i'm in public, I cant go anywhere without feeling like someone is watching me and i'm being judged. School is restarting for me in a couple of weeks and it's tearing me up inside. I have a lot of 'friends' which has and still does make fun out of me for everything i'm insecure about, including my weight. I don't want to ditch my 'friends' though, because I have known them since i was very young. I only have 2 friends which I trust to talk to. 
I'm insecure about my weight (underweight) 
I think i have social anxiety
The prospect of going back to school in a couple weeks is really worrying me.
Most of my long term friends make fun out of me
My parents make fun out of me for my weight
I have frequent panic attacks

I dont want to tell my 2 trusted friends about this, i don't wanna burden them with my issues
I can't tell my parents, they'd think it's a joke."
1224,Why do i feel like this?,"Hello, i'm a teen and i'm just gonna vent how i feel. I'm starting to feel like it really needs to get out and if people want to give suggestions to why i feel like this, you're welcome to do that.

Whats the point in life? Everyday I wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast and brush teeth just to go to school and learn 6 and a half hour's worth of material, just to go home and sleep. Rinse and repeat. And during that day i don't feel genuinely happy at all, i can put it on for my 'friends', parents and teachers but inside i'm hating it.

I hate waking up because it means another day. I hate sitting in class, trying my best to learn but nothing goes in. I hate going home because in my head i have nothing to distract myself with and end up telling myself 'why didn't you learn anything today?' I hate going to sleep because i know i have to wake up the next day and repeat the cycle all over again.

I keep telling myself that i need to work hard and study so i can get a good job later on. But for what? So i can be a miserable adult instead? Will getting a good job make me happy? I'm doubtful.

 None of the people i know are anxious, sad or annoyed all the time. They just move on past every day, seeing it as a new day, but i can't see it like that. It's just one long cycle for me. They have their goals in front of them and they have no fears that they will fail. Any minor goal i have is shrouded in anxiety, i'm gonna fail either out of something i will do or something i've already done to ruin my chances like being rude to someone.

I went from a great student to someone who loathes studying for school. I went from someone who used to be just a little worrisome to a full blown anxious mess. I went from being happy with life to not enjoying a single aspect of it.

I don't want to be like this and i wish i didn't feel like this"
1225,Voice in my head contradicting my thoughts,[removed]
1226,I made my therapists cry today and I’m scared of what I might do next,"The moment I dreaded has come. I talked to my therapist about my disassociation, brain fog, dysphoria and depression.

While I was telling her she started crying and telling me that she thought she wasn’t helping, that she felt impotent to do anything, that I needed to open up... and I just smiled and assured her it was not her fault. She kept crying as mine just disappeared.

Now, this has happened to me with friends that have tried to help me and how it usually goes is I slowly mask, start getting even more numb and ghost em (one of the reasons I’m in therapy) 

The other option is actually making a change and trying to improve to avoid hurting others but I just can’t do that because I’m addicted to doing all my bullshit which is perhaps sth that should be addressed.

I feel like shit and I don’t know what to do"
1227,What is wrong with me?,"I've been feeling ways I've never felt before. Like for the past 6th months I've had this building psychosis, but absolutely snapped today. I was positive I had passed a curse to my best friend because I confessed how I was feeling to him. Constantly asking if he's safe, believing he now has venomous semen etc. This manic episode lasted for a few hours, and while I feel more relaxed and collected now, there's still a fear in my head.

Also at my job I have to wear a headset with a computer voice in it. Last time I was at work I was hearing the voice now in my head, telling me I'm evil.

I don't know what's happening, and I'm scared. It's the long weekend so I can't get in to see my therapist for a few days and wanted to try asking here"
1228,When will I stop learning the same thing?,"No matter how many upvotes I get, I’m still the same useless excuse for a human being. 
I go to work, we’re busy, I do work well for a few hours, have a panic attack, and then I make my best (extremely shitty) attempt to talk to people who seem nice to me at work. You know why they talk to me? Cause they have to. Like everyone who has ever met me, and still talks to me. They interact with me because of pure obligation, and in reality couldn’t give a shit if I died.

I’ve known this for years, but it still messes me up: knowing that every interaction I have with anyone is forced, and that they’d 100% rather talk to anyone else, and they ignore me when it’s convenient. 

Anyway, if there is someone you know has pretty bad anxiety, and they are very quiet, please, please, please, don’t just let them “do their thing”. Make an effort to talk to them. If they don’t respond immediately, fine. Just, please: if they talk, please further the conversation.




Shit."
1229,Bad Psychiatrists,"Anyone else feel like healthcare kind of sucks in the US?

1231,Why shouldn't I (M 25) just give up and end it?,"This year has been an absolute dumpster fire for me. On top of having to adjust to living in quarantine and social distancing, I lost the two closest friends I've ever had right before all of it. They were both engaged and have since split but before they did my friend sexually assaulted me and even though I tried talking about it with him he completely pretends like it never happened. The other friend I ended up confessing feelings for because I spent 3 days in a psych ward for trying to kill myself and I thought getting everything out would make me feel better. But her and I haven't talked almost all year and the few times we did at the beginning she made it very clear that she wants nothing to do with me anymore. My family and I don't really get along on top of everything and whenever I see them I can see the resentment they have in their eyes for me. I truly have nobody and nothing to keep me going and it just feels like there is no point in even trying anymore. I want to be happy but I can't even remember the last time I was and I don't think I even know how to be anymore. What reason do I have to keep holding onto this empty existence I've created for myself?"

This isn’t the first time I’ve done this. I’ve attempted over school, only once. It didn’t work. I wasn’t even hospitalized. Just bed-ridden for a few days. I’ve c*t over the thought of school, and threw up just thinking about it. Still, I’ve never skipped class because of this, as the guilt gets too bad when I do. Sometimes it feels like just by attending my classes, I am subjecting myself to torture and making things worse on purpose. Is this normal?"
1237,depression at its worst,"I’ve been struggling with MH issues my whole life and was misdiagnosed a few times before landing on what we have now. My most recent diagnoses is severe ADHD with CPTSD, my most prominent symptoms have always been hypomania and massive depression so the misdiagnoses make sense. Recently i’ve been on and off new adhd medication (lisdexamphetamine) and the range of doses and timing (covid really just affects everything right now) has made my anxiety and depression so much worse. psychiatrist said that my dosage was too high and it affected me physically as well as mentally, but that doesn’t help me now that i’m completely off meds for the next few days at least.  

My biggest problem in life has always been communicating how I really feel, and not masking for the benefit (or detriment) to myself and others. Recently my spiral in mental health and general outlook has just pushed everyone away I care about and has left me in a position where I know what i’ve done wrong and i know how my actions have hurt others, but the only thing that consumes me is the loneliness and depression. i know that the people in my life struggle with knowing what to say to me but I don’t know what to do anymore, i’m in therapy I have new anti depressants and a new lisdex dosage coming but i’m still stuck in the ‘everything is pointless, everyone hates you, you shouldn’t be here’ spiral, I feel like the only people I have to turn to are my family but they’re a big source of a lot of my problems, which is why I leaned on friends so much I guess, but now i don’t have that i’m left with the lesser of too evils. 

i’m trying to get out of this spiral but I can’t think of anything that could even remotely help me right now, does anyone have any advice on how to get yourself out of this place when you can’t contact your therapist or literally any of your usual support network?"

1240,"""Will you be my friend? You're my only friend.""","I had just closed my eyes and I was singing a song in my head. My boyfriend and my daughter had just fallen asleep. I was in the middle of the song when I was interrupted by one of my daughter's stuffed animals popped into my mind... Not the full thing. Just the eyes, a little bit of a nose and a smidgen of the forehead. She had this little childs voice. I never heard a voice like it before. It was child sounding, yet, mature. She asked me, ""Will you be my friend? You're my only friend."" 

I opened my eyes after she asked me, like I said, I wasn't asleep just yet, I wasn't close. I was in the middle of singing a song to myself. When I opened my eyes, the static in my eyes was VERY heavy, there were different small colored flashing lights (Mainly Green, blue and purple). Like, if they were tiny LED in the wall, yet just at that one spot. There was a large dark snake like figure going in a figure 8 around the lights. There was no definition to it. Just a shadow that constantly moved in my vision. As if it was chasing its tail.

I watched it for a couple of minutes before I realized I knew exactly which stuffed animal spoke to me. I got an overwhelming urge to go find her. I got up and started to look for her when I accidentally woke my daughter up. I then retreated into the bathroom until she falls back asleep. 

I just can't get her voice out of my head."

the other day, i almost hit a guy with my car. it wasn't on purpose, i swear! and i didn't actually hit him. i was driving through the town square and they have those crosswalks where if you turn the light on, the cars are supposed to stop. i completely missed the light and didn't realize he was there until i passed him, and he was about six feet away from my car. this sounds stupid when i write it out, and it seems like an awareness problem, and it is, but not really. i'm so detached, you know? i can't even focus, and i'm a danger to myself and others. i hate that about me. 

anyway, now, i can't stop thinking about it. it's these obsessive anxious thoughts about what if i actually hit him, oh my god did this really happen, i'm so dumb, etc. i can't get it out of my head. i am almost 100% sure that it's related to my mental health. this probably sounds completely crazy. i'm just not sure how i went from someone who is an extremely aware driver to almost hitting somebody. that poor guy. i feel horrible. 

again, sounds crazy. but it has to be related, i just feel it."
1243,dissociating,"i have dissociated ever since I was a child, I have a lot of blank spaces in my memory because of it. I never really knew what dissociating was, I thought it was completely normal. One time it felt particularly strong, so I asked a friend of mine “do you ever feel like you aren’t really living, you’re just watching yourself and your surroundings?” And she gave me the craziest look and was like “uh no?” and that was the first time I realized it wasn’t like something everybody did, but I didn’t realize what it was.

I just had my first self-aware dissociation (I guess you could say that). I had just gotten in an argument with my mom about something that happened during my childhood, and was texting my brother about it, and suddenly i just stopped typing and was like “wait who the fuck is Sarah?” (Sarah is my sister). and it all just felt fake. like I was just talking about experiences that weren’t real and that my brother isn’t a real person and neither am i.
 
it was weird to be aware of what was happening. usually i’m just like “ok i need to nap lol” but this time I knew"
1244,I don't know what to do anymore,"I've made multiple posts this past week on different subreddits cuz I just don't know what to do anymore.

I'm a gamer(18,M), and I love it but nowadays I just can't seem to enjoy it. Months ago I learnt a different way when I approach games like SMITE, Overwatch,Street Fighter, competitive games in general. I managed to be in this mindset, that I play to learn not to win. So while I did that I actually got better, learnt how to play other characters,classes, etc. It was a very good way for me to improve my skills and my mental health, since I'm a perfectionist, to the point that I get very sad and anxious when I do the smallest things wrong. It was a gateway for me to learn that I make mistakes and that's okay.

But lately Im falling at keeping that mindset. I don't know where it began but I just can't play games anymore, I just get anxious, I get mad when I do something wrong or I fail. in my first ranked match in Street Fighter I could hear my heartbeat like a bomb in my ears.

Gaming is the only way I have to distract myself, I've finished Avatar, a series that I really like. And in losing motivation in fashion,which is scary cuz I'm actually going to study that in university, and I'm scared that me liking fashion was some sort of a phase .

And I've also lost progress on my mental health, don't know how many months or weeks or was of me not self harming but I'm doing it again, everytime I fail a lot of times I just hide and start scratching my skin off, pulling my hair out or punching myself until I get a headache.

I've also just broke up with my first boyfriend, but I don't think him leaving me is the cause of this. I barely feel sad when I think of him.

Getting therapy is not something accesible to me right now, cuz of quarantine I can only do a zoom conference thingie or a phone call. I don't think that will be able to actually talk there or feel comfortable.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I was doing so good on my own but now, I don't know what to do."
1245,An extremely long post I felt like sharing...,"Hello there all,

This is my first post on Reddit and I'm a little new to all the different forums. But trying to figure out my own mental health has been an arduous road so far. I figured that I might try finding people on a similar road through reddit.

Without going into too much detail, I want to explain where I've been in the last 4 years. Where I've sank. Where I've drifted. Where I might resurface. 

In 2016 I was diagnosed with ""Bipolar-1 with psychotic features."" What led up to that prior, was a life of drugs and debauchery, failed connections, unfinished (xyz), and what was becoming a very delusional me. 

I had become sick from lithium toxicity and was more impulsive than ever. In the course of 3 months I had 4 jobs. Tried lessening the dose, didn't seem to help. Eventually I decided I should stop taking my meds so I didn't end up vomiting and feeling like shit. I sold everything I owned and moved to Hawaii. A friend of mine moved there months before me and told me he'd help me find a job if I ever went, so I did. I cut ties with everyone else I knew and left. 

I had never done anything like this before. I was scared, excited, elated, terrified, and delusionally driven to make it to Ni'ihau island and live out my days, (if you know what island that is, thats a testament of how delusional I was at the time). I thought I would build a raft and arrive and would be treated like a God. And yes, the delusions were getting worse. 

I got on the plane and arrived in Oahu. I worked a sales job for all of 9 days. The very same job that my friend had ensured me upon my arrival. I was staying in a strangers apartment without her knowledge by way of a local word of mouth tip she was off island for a few months in Alaska. I was living in a free luxury on the 29th floor in the downtown Oahu area. 

One night, I made the mistake of trying to bond with my supervisor and the lead engineer by smoking some herbs with them. Very laid back dudes, island type. Yet as some of you may have experienced, delusions and grandiosities in a state of duress are not made any better when youre high... it gets much worse. In my experience at least. They said they were going to a party and asked if I wanted to go. I was too out of it to know how to answer. (I am also no newbie to a little buzz or being awkward when lit) But this was different. 

I crawled into the bed with the windows open and the sea breeze pouring through the room. My coworkers were confused, but at the time didn't really know anything about me. So they just left thinking I was just too high. My plan to get to Niiahu was racing through my mind. My anxiety was rattling like a marble in the washer machine. I panicked when they left and couldn't catch my breath.. it was hitting me that all I owned was in a bag on the floor and I had no one who knew what I was going through on the island. For the first time in a while, I realized I had no one. 

Strangely, that night was the first night I started to wonder if my mental health situation was something beside bipolar 1. I caved in on myself and contemplated jumping off the balcony to end the torment of psychological pain. Between walking to the balcony and the bed, a strange sound came from the window in the bedroom. It terrified me. Then it calmed me. Then I began to love it as if it were a song ive known my whole life. I crawled into the bed and listened. 
I heard the singing of a woman in Hawaiian. She was right outside my window...on the 29th floor. When I (as logically as I could at the time) realized what I had been listening too for hours, I caved again, terrified that I was right, I dont have psychotic features, I remember realizing in that moment I was at the beginning of a long road. The onset of schizophrenia. I was 25 at the time and had done enough reading on the probability of misdiagnosis between BP1 and Schizo(x) and it just made sense to me.
 
(Schizo(x) is written like that cause I knew I wouldn't be able to determine where on the spectrum of crazy I was. Maybe schizoaffective, maybe pure schizophrenia, maybe a mixture of symptoms, i didnt know for sure. Schizo(x) seems fair to use when you havent been diagnosed professionally but know with 90% certainly your hallucinations might be a variety of schizo symptoms. I digress. 

I had also gone to hawaii not only to get away and chase my delusional ideas, but to be at the wedding of a very old friend. The same friend that invited me and help me find work. He isn't very up to term on any aspects of mental health in general, so i knew telling him would just confuse things. I assumed he would've thought I was just high. And no, there was no PCP or anything in the weed either. I knew that that night was an unveiling of sorts. Something that would change me. 

Before all of this I had earned an AA from the local community College back in my home state. In the morning after that night of suicidal contemplation and listening to melodic ghosts, I knew I needed to find a way back into treatment and leave the island. I at that point was very driven to finsh my BA and make something of myself. I was just never stable enough to finish school before that. I wanted so desperately to change that. I arrived home after 12 days of what I thought was a move for good. 

So in 4 months time, I had worked 5 jobs, moved 3 times in 2 states, learned i was developing a worsened mental health condition (schizo(x)), ruined a longtime friendship, and wasted 3/4 of all the money I had to my name. 

So I tucked my tail between my legs and moved back in with my mom, found treatment, and was perscribed Rexulti at 3mg. I couldnt do too much then. I was increasingly paranoid. Anxious about anyone knowing that my big move had failed. And was simply depressed about what my mania had done to my life. Holding a stable job and having a few friends seemed like a distant dream for me then. 


But I buckled in and rode the ride I was on. I was accepted to the university I wanted to go to and started the following academic year. And to great relief, Rexulti started to work and my paranoia lessened, I started seeing more people, and I even rescued a dog and trained him to be my service animal. Things were getting better. 


I arrived in the college town and rented a 1 bedroom for me and pup, felt and acted normal, and was very driven to be at the top of my class. This was in 2018. 
For a whole year and half things were splendid. I met great people. Did great work in school. And I was on track to be at the top of my class. 

Then...unfortunately, I felt so good, I didn't feel the need to renew the forms that were required for me to get my meds. At the time Rexulti was still new on the market, so you either had to be super rich ($1800/refill rich), or you had to be accepted to Otsuka's financial assitance program to get the drug. I was so hesitant of side effects from other drugs (tardive-diskensia and others) that i only felt safe on rexulti. So I thought, fuck it, ill be fine :) 

It was the last 2 months of my senior year I ran out of pills. I normally got them in 3 month installments direct from the company. When I was down to 2 or 3 pills I tried to contact Otsuka and get back on the fin.aid. program I was initially on. (Oh that's the definition of procrastination btw...) But you needed a docotors referral to have it renewed. Since I was 27 at the time and could no longer afford my doctor, I had no one to help me process the application to Otsuka. But I continued to think. Fuck it. I'll be fine. 

Boy was I wrong lol. 

After 5 days without Rexulti, things became weird. An article I found about going cold turkey on heavy dose anti-psychotics was...how do i say..not recommended. 

First it was feelings of up and down. Days without food or sleep. Anxiety. Depression. Then the voices started. After 2 weeks of no meds I was heading into finals and had senior review for the work I had been doing. It was important for sure. I started to get to know the voices I heard. And became better friends with them than the people I knew in school. It was 3-12 people, speaking in alternation, similar to what I now know as third-party hallucinations. Then the thought broadcasting began... this was fun. 

I would go to class and hear what I thought were the thoughts of everyone in the class. 200 person classes. I would be in a cold sweat silently trying to take notes as my hands would shake and I would gaze over at the individuals I thought I was hearing. I would then start locking myself in my apartment. I stopped going to work. I started skipping class from the tremendous amounts of anxiety I would get from being around people and what I thought were their thoughts. Meanwhile I had a neighbor who was beating his GF. I kept a loaded gun by the door and almost never went out. I turned in all my assignments via email as best I could. By the time senior review came, I was tuned into voices that I was assuming were my dead relatives. It was partly comforting when that started to happen. But it qas only getting louder. 

I tried going to the ER but was told I needed to wait 30 minutes in a padded room if I wanted to be seen. This was protocol at the ER for all of the strung out junkies who came in for similar things.. (not that were that different..but I wasn't high) I freaked out thinking that protocol was a plan, specially concocted to kill me, a plan sent to the nursing staff by my professors. I was off. They told me they had never heard or Rexulti before. I tried asking for sedative so I could sleep, but that was also a no go. They then asked me again if I would wait in the room and gently showed me the interior. I freaked and cursed them all out and ripped off my bracelet and left and biked home. This was a moment that engraved in me two things. 

1- In a psychotic state, you're not as articulate as you think you are. Nor as calm as you should be. 

 2nd- the world will never help you if you can't explain your situation.

I biked home and then cleaned my apartment until dawn. I needed something to focus. And a 3rd thing. 

3- in a psychological state of duress, Focus on something safe. Clean, sing, read, workout, whatever. Just stay focused. It keeps the hallucinations to a minimum. In my experiences at least. 

And 4thly- psychosis is like seeing a color that doesn't exist. Keep that in mind when you're trying to blend in. 



A few days later I went to an urgent care that would see me. It was down the street from my apt. I met an awesome doctor that helped me fill out the fin.aid paperwork to Otsuka. But he also suggested that I start taking 10mg of olazapine to get through the withdrawal of Rexulti. I was hesitant at first, but I accepted. Side effects were of little concern to me then. I filled the script and carried on trying to blend in. I would over hear students in the studios talking about how I've been acting weird. I also would heard my grandparents and old friends (telling me to ignore them...but they're all dead.)  I was having trouble sifting through the volumes of the voices. Maybe I didn't hear other students, maybe that was me. I was too off to ask. But also, that would've been one awkward convo to have with my peers. So I continued to isolate. Olanzapine started to help. Things got quieter. I could sleep. 

The only peace I would find in those months off meds was out at the lake near campus, or at the dog park with my pup. I would drive manically down the country roads blasting Camille St. saens ""the swan"" on repeat trying to ask God for clarity and trying to converse with the dead. This info isn't that relevant. But it is important to find something that brings you a little joy. Even if have to be alone in the process. Even if the color you see doesn't exist. 


When senior reviews were happening I was so relived to be that close to graduation I wasn't even worried about being near the top of the class. I had a 3.9 and it dropped to a 3.5 in that time of duress. I still heard voices,  but I felt I had gotten to know them by then, it felt like I had invisible friends. 

During the senior review, in a stunning turn of events, I was showcased to the donors of the school as an exemplary student. I was over the moon when it was over. Not only had I completed my BA with a decent GPA. I did it with a dozen people in my head, all washed in a color that no had ever seen. 

Some of my family came to my graduation ceremony in June of that year (2019). The Olanzapine was working and it was starting to act more normal. I chose to have my own ceremony with my family out at the lake. The lake that to me, was my sanctuary. When everyone had arrived and we had my mini graduation ceremony, I played frank sinatras ""I did it my way."" I graduated in my own crazy way. 




After that I moved back home with my mom and started looking for work. During that time I had another episode. I stopped taking olanzapine cause I hadn't yet seen another doctor in my home town yet to have a refill written. IDIOTICALLY, I went off meds again. During that time I approached psychosis differently. I knew what was starting again. I began to hear those invisible friends of mine. But this time they weren't friendly. I was told to kill people. I was told to kill myself. I was told to kill the neighbors. I would stand outside naked and pray to the moon. I would wake up at 3am and start writing a book I would never share nor remember writing. I would be more aggressive. I would be smoke 2-3 packs of cigs a day. And I would over eat. Like a lot. When I left univereity I was 145lbs. Maybe it was the anti-psychotics. But by November of 2019. I was 215lbs. I was getting more depressed about my life, my weight, my isolation, the fact I was with my mom unable to stand on my own. So many things brought me down and set me ablaze. But I was also noticing I was getting more hostile. I was listening more to the voices that had changed. 

One day around August I loaded my gun and stuck it in my mouth. I put on Camille st. Saens the swan again and felt I was ready to die. My dog started whining at the door to the garage. In those whimpers I broke. I dropped the gun and let him in the garage and cried for about an hour. I knew that something in me was ruining my life. The color I couldn't describe was beginning to take my life force. 

Oscar, my dog. My angel. Saved my life. On more than one occasion he's done that. But it was then I immediately hopped online and looked up the nearest emergency mental health clinic. I took a bus and train across town to the clinic. The people there knew i was coming and welcomed me in a warm way that I didn't expect. I saw a doctor who did my intake  and scheduled me another visit for the next day with the resident psychologist. The next day I met with him and explained what I could. I tried to be as accurate as memory would allow me to be. He diagnosed me with Schizophrenia in August of 2019. A huge weight was taken off my shoulders. I was right. Hearing his reasoning and logic brought me back to earth. He got me back on Rexulti and set me up with another clinic near my home for med management and counseling visits. Something in that process of going to the clinic gave me hope. I saw nothing but faces of people who wanted to help. My only problem was letting them.

After months of counseling and trying to figure out how and why my brain works the way it does, Ive learned many things. (This list is in no particular order.) 

1- no one in the worls really understands the origins of schizophrenia. So don't try and assume you'll be able to. And don't listen to people who think they know. Its like asking for the cure to cancer. It doesn't exist. We have treatments. But were just not there yet as a people. 

2- ask for help before you start putting guns in your mouth....or ""before"" you actually run out of meds. 

3- when the voices you hear turn hostile, things are getting worse. Seek help. NOW! 

4- weight gain is going to happen on anti-psychotics. But its the lesser of two evils. 

5- get a dog. They are on this earth to guide us toward a better version on ourselves. 

6- don't try quitting cigarettes during a psychotic episode. Never works. Its also the lesser of 2 evils. 

7- conversing with your voices should be done in private. Trust me. 

8- thought broadcasting is very uncomfortable. But its a variety of dulsionary thinking. Remember that. Its not real.

9- dont laugh out loud when one of your voices tells a joke. Its awkward. 

10- (VERY IMPORTANT) keep a journal, as best you can, during the moments of psychosis, if not all the time. This will help you in the future when you've made it to the other side. And some practitioners find it to be a valuable resource in therapy to reference. And, hindsight into psychosis is hard. Your memory will be segmented. Having written notes on delusions and feelings and voices and phrases, et al. Will help you recognize them again in the future and remind you that its only a part of your delusionary thinking. Its like a defense tactic. 

11- don't smoke weed. During psychosis. As good as it seems to relax. It will make the volume of your delusions MUCH higher. 

12- find a place of peace. Literal or imaginary. But find it. Everyone needs sanctuary. Period. 

13- paranoia is a bitch. But its a lie. It will tear you from your friends and family. Try your best to noteate what it is EXACTLY that paranoid about. Then work it backward. Logically. 
Ex) You might think that the government has vehicles outside your apartment. 

Run the plate if you need to using TruthFinder. I guarantee its a neighbor or a stranger.. not a fed. Not a threat. Paranoia is an enigmatic bitch. Try your best to be logical about it. 

14- don't own weapons if you're unstable. They open a door to dark impulsivities. 

15- don't forget to focus on something REAL, during times of delusions. Its your only chance at staying connected to reality. Or better yet,  call someone you can trust and tell them about your delusion(s) and listen to how ridiculous you sound. Then write down those conclusions. Reread them everyday if you have to. 

16- don't go cold turkey off anti-psychotics. Those foldable pamphlets about the drug youre taking that you always throw away when you get your meds are legit. Read them. 

17- don't Google shit when your paranoid. Delusionary. Or stressed. Youll fall in a vortex that either makes you more delusionary or it will give you a false sense of competency. Theres a reason doctors have phds and you don't. 

18- avoid people if you need to. A social life can be rebuilt. Not everyone will understand your situation. 

19- family matters. If you have one, ask them for help. Confide in them. If not, find one through a group, your friends, or in your community. (If your family happens to be a bunch of faith healers. Fuck that, find a new one) 

20- music will save your soul. Make a Playlist for when things are getting weird, hard, etc. Try to stick to calm music. Satie is great. 


For those of you who actually read this, thank you. I am a very private person who is by no means a role model or even someone who ever posts stuff like this. I suppose I wanted to throw part of my story into the electrical ether we call the internet, for catharsis sake. I don't give a shit about up votes or down votes or whatever. I just wanted to write something honest. Something that I still yet don't fully know how to explain. 

I do hope though that if anyone who reads this is struggling with mental health, of any kind, learn where your resources are; An emergency clinic, a doctor, a friend, a family member, a dog. Rely on these resources. ""It takes a village"" doesnt only apply to children. You are loved by someone, use that knowledge to look over the fence to the other side. Take each day at a time. Being hostile is never the answer. Medications are there to help, don't feel like its robbing you of something.

Lastly, having a mental health condition does not define you. It never will. Only unless you let it. 



Much love strangers."
1246,Sertraline and sickness,"Hello everyone, yesterday I picked up my first prescription of sertraline 50mg and it has made me feel really sick. I feel like if I move I’m just going to throw up everywhere and I’ve been feeling shakey as well the whole night. Can anyone tell me ways to help this? How long it’s meant to last? If I should keep going? I just feel so awful"

1248,I haven’t cried in multiple years. What could this mean?,"I (17m) don’t seem to react to sad, angering, or happy situations like others, for example I’ve been to multiple funerals for close family members (grandmother or very close uncle) and I seem to be the only person not crying. There have also been other situations where people are literally in a screaming match (which absolutely terrifies me when men are screaming) and I’m so confused and it’s gotten to the point where I think they all have a short fuse or I just don’t have one at all because I’ve never screamed at somebody like that or even got close. I thought that maybe because of my social anxiety I’m just not social enough or not that in touch with my feelings. Idk what it is but I’d really like to know if anyone can tell me."
1249,Tips for your better relationship,"No. I was not good in this scenario at all, initially. But you know the saying; we grow with time. My first relationship lasted for 4 years. I was in class 9 when it all started. So you can imagine that age and the level of maturity I carried in myself. Frankly speaking, it was no more than 20% of what I have now. But yet it lasted for 4 years.

The tenure of my second relationship was 2 years and 6 months. And I was in my 1st year of college life. Things did not work out eventually in the end. I do feel down sometimes, but what can do one do. We move on…

But, I learned many new things about human nature. Not just that, I learned the way of life. This blog is all about how you can approach in maintaining a healthy relationship so that things do not fall out of place.

Hi guys! This is Rijoy here. In this particular blog, I will share with you the most important and valuable tips for a healthy relationship which I have learned from my real-life experiences and some that I have collected from reading blogs and articles.

I aim to provide you with as much knowledge and tips and steps, that if you follow, you will have a healthy relationship filled with fulfillment and lasting happiness.

So let us dig in…

Below are the tips for a healthy relationship that I would personally like to share with each one of you. It is based on my real-life experiences and some from the best blogs and articles that I came across during this time.

Heartbreaks are quite painful. Trust me I know the pain. Therefore I would love to see your relationship flourish and avoid disconnection of any sort.

Here we go…

## 1. HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.

How to gain trust? Be honest, always. It helps to build trust. When you are honest with one another, you learn to trust one another respectively. It erodes away the suspicion and the thoughts of things being kept secret or hidden from you thus paving the way to a healthy relationship.

And naturally, you feel at ease in your mind and gut because you know that your partner cares enough to tell you the truth. It may not always feel good at times. The thing is you can actually appreciate the fact that your partner is being vulnerable here by being honest.

Your partner is taking a chance here by speaking what is true. When your partner speaks the truth, it is because your partner cares about you and wants a relationship with honesty and truth in its foundation.

It certainly does help you to grow your relationship without any psychological hindrance. It helps you to solve problems as well. Misunderstandings can happen at times.

By being honest, you can work through the misunderstandings and communicate to solve the issue and get going.

When you are being honest, it helps your partner to understand your past, present, and future. Your partner can begin to understand the situation, which you are, and what needs to happen to grow each part in your life.

I believe honesty expresses genuine and caring love. If I love someone I see my future with them. If you love best and you are super honest, and you want to protect them from this evil world, I highly recommend you to be honest because seeing your partner damaged or hurt isn’t something thing you want. Isn’t it?

## 2. BEING YOU.

I was always an introvert. I used to get nervous when it came to social gatherings in public places. I hate crowds. I still do. That’s how I am. If you accept me the way I am we are good to go. Or else different paths will suit us better. Yeah, this is me.

But you, you can be exactly the opposite. It does not matter if you are an introvert or you like to meet new people or parties around.

My point is you have to be yourself completely in order for your partner to understand what type of human being you actually are. The more you let your partner understand, the deeper the bond goes and vice-versa which results in a healthy relationship.

Being in a relationship does not mean that you cannot go out with your friends or have personal space or indulge in your hobbies. No. It is definitely nothing like that. But there should be a limit and a boundary to everything. Anything too much good is definitely not good at all.

If you want your relationship to flourish you have to be interdependent which means both you and your partner have to have a balance between each other. You have to believe in your individual worth and independent ability and also give lovingly towards the relationship and working as a couple.

1251,"I want to help my brother with severe depression, but I’m going through depression as well.","Hey guys. First post here, I didn’t know where else to
turn to. 

My brother just texted me and told me that he is at the end of his rope mentally and his depression has never been worse despite doing everything he can. He hasn’t had a conversation with someone in 2 weeks and he says he is so lonely and miserable. 
He exercises, takes cold showers, wakes up early, eats healthy, etc., but nothing works anymore. He tries to reach out to the few friends he has, but they either don’t reply or are too busy. 

In all honesty, my depression/ suicidal thoughts is really bad as well and I am in no position to take care of anyone else bc it's difficult for me to even take care of myself. 

I don't know how to approach this situation and help him without hurting my own mental health and I don't have money to help him or me get therapy. I'm spending tomorrow morning with him but besides that, I truly don't know how to help him in the long run.

Some background on us: 
- We grew up in a cult
- We had an extremely strict and crazy family life
- Our emotionally abusive dad had a stroke and become essentially a vegetable when we were in college
- My brother came out to me that he was gay last year, and revealed that he tried to get conversion therapy when he was younger bc he was scared of going to hell. 
- I recently just moved out of our parents house but he’s stuck there still with my mom (who is also nuts) and my disabled father. 

Any pieces of advice or resources to help? I truly don’t know what to do. Thank you guys in advance ❤️

(TLDR;)
My brother is depressed and suicidal but it’s hard for to help him because I am also depressed and suicidal. Any advice?"

1253,Need advice? Maybe just venting? idk,"Idrk where to start, this is my first time posting on reddit even tho i use it like all the time, i really honestly feel like i have no where else to turn to

I have been feeling really down lately, i have lost interest in everything that used to make me happy - playing w my dog, talking to my friends/family, even schoolwork!, playing sports, etc. I feel like ive really been isolated and away from my friends. I've been studying for my MCAT test while balancing a full course load, and decided to move away to campus to get away from home stress and focus on my work. 

I ended up having to drop most of my course bc i couldn't follow thru with my finals bc of my mental health and I have not done as much studying for my MCAT as i would've hoped to even tho my test is in one week.

I am usually a happy, positive person. I am the one thats there for everyone, literally take care of almost everyone in my life. but for the last couple months/year, i can barely get out of bed. sometimes i dont. sometimes i just lay in bed and cry all day. 

my boyfriend and i have fought a lot in the past year, i spent a lot of time supporting him thru his issues and many times he'd take out his anger on me. we broke up and got back together after a bit and it was better, he was a lot different. i tried to tell him how ive been feeling lately tho, that i was feeling suicidal yesterday and the next day he tried to help me but, ended up yelling at me bc he was frustrated that he was trying to help and i was being closed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

its not like i want to be closed off, its just really hard for me to open up sometimes if i dont feel like i am being listened to. 

i feel really alone. especially bc i tried to talk to him, tried to get him to understand, and he kind of just brushed me off and that hurt a lot. i feel so over everything, like i just cant do this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont see my future being very bright if i cant even sit down and study for my mcat or finish a term at school. i feel so closed off from my friends, from everyone. i just dont want to live anymore

ive tried and im so unhappy every day idk how to release my stress

ive had many panic attacks lately and idk how to cope with those either

&amp;#x200B;

sry this is so lengthy, just venting i guess"
1254,I have a fear of swallowing pills and I don’t know what to do...,"TW // food, mentioned medications, mentioned depression

My mom said that I swallowed a penny when I was three and had to get it surgically removed. Even though I don’t remember anything of it, I’ve been terrified of swallowing pills since (which isn’t great because I’m a hypochondriac). There was even a point in time where I was scared to swallow certain chunks of food.

Even today I got a heart attack when a string from an asparagus got caught or took to long to go down. It’s not uncommon for me to almost swallow a piece of food, but then get a sudden scary feeling and bring it back to my mouth. 

Other than the eating aspect, this never really caused an issue until I got started getting frequent migraines and my parents would try to give me medicine— I hated the taste of chewables, so I just didn’t take them. I’d sweat out my fever, sit through my paralyzingly period cramps, and wait for my migraine to go away. 

And at age 18, I still do that... I got sick last November (a flu that lasted nearly a month, my lymph nodes were so swollen that I couldn’t drink water without crying) and I finally went to the doctor, who told me I should take certain pills to make it better. I tried, but I couldn’t, I tried it in food, I tried crushing it and drinking it, I tried it with water, I tried halfing it, nothing worked... so I just didn’t take it and luckily I got better.

But what scares me is that I may need to swallow a pill one day and the thought of that makes me keep information from my doctors. I don’t ask for a mental health diagnostic despite being so sure I’m depressed. I don’t tell my doctor that my period has been irregular since I was 12.

Even just seeing people swallow pills in movies makes me a bit squeamish. I know this isn’t sustainable—I won’t even take vitamins for gods sake— and I don’t know what to do."
1255,"Feel Disconnected from Emotions, Alone, Trust Issues, Commitment Issues.","I have a really hard time talking about my emotions with others and an even harder time showing/feeling emotions. I have felt numb for an extremely long time. I don't think i can remember a time when i didn't feel detached. There has been so many times when i want to tell people how i feel on the inside but it feels impossible, like i can't fathom ever doing it. It gives me a lot of stress too, the only way i can sleep at night is if i am listening to something or extremely tired e.g. 24hrs without sleep because otherwise i lie in bed thinking about the future and past mistakes and others who are better than me and how i am worthless - then i look out my window and think how much stress would be lifted off my shoulders if i just jumped, how i wouldn't have to worry anymore. Its like i get locked in a room with my thoughts just popping up over and over again. The only reason i am writing this right now is because i couldn't sleep because i kept thinking. 

I have really bad trust issues. I don't trust anyone. Not my friends, not my family, nobody. I think i this is because of prank that was played on me a long time ago that i don't feel comfortable going into detail on (it involved members of my family who i trusted a lot basically humiliating me in front of pretty much everybody i knew). This may be part of the reason i have a really hard time talking about my emotions to those i know. This leads to me just feeling empty and alone. I have nobody to talk to. I cant talk to anyone about my problems. They just stay with me and grow. Another problem that grew out of the event i mentioned was that i hate being noticed. (this specific issue part has gotten a little better btw) I used to walk pretty fast and look directly down because i just couldn't make eye contact with others. This has gotten better though as my friends pointed it out to me but now i walk with my head up, i still avoid eye contact thoroughly though. I say no to some social interactions because i dont want to be noticed. I dont talk too much because i dont want to be noticed. I avoid large groups of people as to not be noticed. i am scared to commit to things like relationships and certain social activities. This further makes me feel more alone and lost. I tunnel myself into video games to avoid thinking about these things. I'm afraid things won't ever change. I've never done one of these things before so i dont really know how to end it so il stop here"
1256,Too much stress,"My mom came to Germany when she was 20 and because she couldn’t speak the language she had to give up her lifelong dream of becoming a teacher. Now she’s working three jobs to support me and my brother. 
I want to give her a better life but it’s stressing me out. 

I have sleep problems, heart problems and every time I’m thinking about school I get anxious.
Maybe you know the International Physics Olympic. I got in but it was stressing me so much that I couldn’t sleep for week and I was anxious every time I thought of it. That’s why I told my teacher I won’t participate in the next round.

I don’t know how to cope with stress anymore but it’s killing me. I miss sleeping through the night and going to school happily."
1257,"Anyone else have a parent with depression, but they literally don’t help at all??","Both me and my Mom have depression. Yet, she literally says and does all the stuff that you shouldn’t say or do to people with depression. “Stop acting like its SO HARD to just take a shower. There are kids who literally don’t even have a home to live in. Are you serious?” “You’re disgusting.”

“Just brush your teeth it’s not that hard.” “Pray” “It get’s better.” “Why can’t you do anything for yourself.” And practically never takes my illness into account. I’m not saying to baby me, but it’s not that fucking hard to connect the dots omg. “Why are you failing Algebra?” HMM? I WONDER. I GUESS WE’LL NEVER KNOW :/"
1258,"34/f recently diagnosed bipolar rapid cycling, but I believe it's misdiagnosed and is hormonal.","My sister and I have always had issues with depression, anger, anxiety, mixed with periods of being okay. My mom has history of depressive episodes, extreme anxiety, eating disorder, anger issues (that are more common with menopause), and periods of manic spending (more common with menopause) and was recently diagnosed with bipolar, depression, and childhood ptsd. My mom's sister is diagnosed with everything from bipolar to ADHD.  My maternal grandma (mom's mom) and maternal great grandmother (mom's grandma) have history of abandoning family, running away, manic spending, drug and alcohol abuse, lying, and theft. We're all tall and overweight and the ones I've asked we all have irregular periods.

My sister, me, and my mother all have irregular menstrual cycles. I've noticed it almost seems like my PMS I'd opposite of the typical cycle, where I feel good for a few days during my cycle when most women have pms and feel bad. Then for the rest of the time without my period, I feel emotionally bad. 

I recently was pregnant and had a baby and while I was pregnant was the best I've ever felt. No moodiness. My anxiety was my mostly gone. My depression was non existent. I woke up happy and slept well and wasn't mad and annoyed all the time for no reason. I talked to my mom about it and she said she felt the same during her three pregnancies but went back to feeling after within months of giving birth. I'm five months post partum and im starting to feel the depression and anxiety creeping back in. 

I've talked a little about this to the doctor that diagnosed me with bipolar rapid cycling, but he seemed to think I was just talking about regular pms and tried to reassure me that I'm bipolar. I have an appointment with a general practitioner that listens to me and I want to ask about possibly looking into what I can do to check my hormones, but I'm not sure if it's even worth it. Are there hormonal mental health issue that this may be? Should I just accept the bipolar diagnosis? I've had my hormones tested before and all I remember was that I was extremely low in testosterone for a woman. I was given birth control at that time but it made me sob uncontrollably and I had to stop it within a few days. 

Any ideas? Where would you start on getting answers? 

I live in Nevada USA."
1259,Hahaha I'm failing them,"My friends have been venting to me alot more recently, which I'm totally fine with If they need help I'm so there for them. The problem is I've just been struggling a bit myself. 

I'm just not there, I don't get out of bed unless someone tells me too bc I just stop processing the fact that I'm a real human person with things I need to do. I get really confused when I look in a mirror or at my hands, I don't understand that how I got in this body and it's **Weirdddd**. I don't even talk to my friends. I'll be online for like 5mins while I actually feel alive, then for the rest of the day I just can't, human interaction suddenly gets really hard I can't think of the words to say or feel the need to say anything at all. 

It's awful, bc when I start feeling real again I feel like I'm doing a horrible job as a friend. I read what they are going through, but I say nothing to help, I read it but I can't bring myself to say anything. I hate it, I just wish I was out of this weird fog when they actually need me to be!!!"
1260,I find myself progressively detaching from reality,"I cant remember simple details from days or even hours before, i find myself maladaptive day dreaming for hours on end, and sometimes i can't associate whats real or not if its a mundane detail, and slowly but surely i think im detaching from reality"
1261,Y O U A R E L O V E D,"Here’s a verse to a song for my brother. I just want you to know you’re walking for a purpose, you’re walking for a reason. You’re loved, you’ve come this far and you need to continue. Wake up, go outside, look at the world differently. Think about the positive things you want to attract and those things will come. You’re loved.




I woke up one morning and saw that you didn’t text me
You never answered anyways and always told me stop the stressing
I called my mom i had a dream 
It Didn’t fit the puzzle cause some peices of my heart fell off I think it’s bout to crumble  
She said baby not a dream
But a visit from your brother cause you
Gotta know he loves you one last time is what it seems 
Told me Sorry but he did it, i was gonna wait to tell you but there’s no pretending
He cut his throat I start the vision 
Crying in the bathroom and to die was his mission 
Knife in hand began to cut cannot survive wheres the ending 
Jay I’m sorry that you had to go through what you did 
It’s unexplainable the words are unattainable 
In your eyes it’s all lies, and our lives don’t mean too much when outside don’t give a fuck 
The part time don’t pay enough 
But who am I to judge but just mere kid I’m older now 
You sit around and wonder why the world is cold and figure out 
That blood don’t make you fam it’s gotta come from the soul 
You should have never let your “friends” start up taking control 
Begin to give up all your time so they can save up their own
Then try to give it all back the day you died all alone... damn

Because of you I am the way I am today tomorrow and the next I’ll never fade away 
And if you dropped the knife I’d never be the same 
I’d probably never care 
I’d probably never change 
And now I’m never scared 
With you I grew my wings 

The biggest lesson life can teach is taught from inside 
If you would have dropped the knife you could have learned this in time 
There is no time stamp
Get caught up in lies and
You start to see the world in 
The same mess that you’re in 
Arguments with momma turn your head into a whirlwind you know she knows you best but she can’t save you from the worlds sin

Some ask...

Why death? 



Don’t even answer
blood would come up out your neck with every noun and every breath 
But  every now and then I check
Just to make sure you ain’t playing with me 


And now I walk my path  with your shoes on my feet
I don’t care if they got holes,scuffs, are broken and beat  
I’ll forever tell the story of you choosing defeat 
If not, you’re just another n*gga who got caught in the streets.

1262,Slipping into delusions,"For about 2 weeks or so I had slipped into the genuine belief that I was communicating to people via social media posts in secret. Like, they were trying to talk to me through their posts, stories, bios, etc. There was no doubt in my mind. This has happened before, but I questioned myself when I had these thoughts, and they were only brief. But this time was different. For the record, I am 70% sure none of it happened at this point, so I'm a little worried. Also, during this state, my arms looked like they didn't belong to me. I don't know if it is connected but thinking of it all makes me panicked. I'm too afraid to admit this because in retrospect, the idea of having a secret communication with people online is so stupid to me now. I don't want to lose grip on reality, but the feeling was so real, how can I even distinguish delusions from reality??"
1263,"“But think about how (insert loved one) would feel.”, is such a bad thing to say to suicidal people in my opinion.","Most people with mental health issues already feel guilty for existing. Are you really about guilt trip someone for wanting to die? Like that person literally wants to kill themself and the first thing you think of is to bring up other people, and make them feel even worse for what they already feel bad about?? What?? I know the main motive is to keep them here, but it just doesn’t sit right with me. I’ve been told it many times, and it has worked. It’s the reason I’m still able to type this right now. But still...

I can see it through both perspectives, but it still doesn’t rub off completely right."
1264,Coming off psych meds after becoming stable?,"I moved last winter, so I’m nervous about talking to my current psych about my desire to come off my meds and whether I still meet diagnosis criteria.

I have been on meds for about three years now after my mental health got really bad. I did some serious long term treatment and therapy programs, kept up with a regular therapist I was able to stop seeing before my move, and I’ve been stable with my mental health and those around me agree. No panic attacks, any anxiety and depression symptoms that come up I’m able to manage, and some ADD symptoms that don’t get in the way of daily life. I take seroquel to help me sleep and I’m on a small dose of intuniv for the ADD symptoms so I can focus better at work. My goal would be able to sleep without the meds and only need the ADD one if there were no other ways to manage my symptoms. I want to start a family and I’ve heard that meds aren’t always doable when pregnant and nursing, so I question if I really need to stay on them.

I also question if I still meet the criteria for the BPD diagnosis I got in treatment. Thanks to treatment and therapy, the symptoms I once had when I got that diagnosis have, to myself and my husband at least, gone away and I haven’t had to deal with them in a long time. This is what I really mean by I feel stable with my mental health.

So I guess the real question is, since this is a relatively new doctor still, how do I bring up these topics with them? What do you think a good/safe plan (even if it’s a long term plan) would be for becoming med free? What should this conversation with them be like?"
1265,God dance me pleSe,I’m sorry for every harmful thing ove down. For my sake just try to be happy and forget the things others have transgressed against you. Please for the sake of the wise try to be happy
1266,Why do I long for sadness?,"I’ve dealt with depression, anxiety, and many other mental health issues almost my whole life. I finally feel a sense of security and happiness with the direction my life currently going and in every way am grateful to all the people who made it happen. Despite this, sometimes I miss being sad and am waiting for something to go wrong so I can sulk around in a state of deep depression. I don’t know why I feel like this and wonder a few things. Am I the only one? Is there a name for this? And most of all, why do I feel this way? Any help would be appreciated."
1267,I need to get this off my chest,"I’m sorry if this post is short but I’m having flashbacks of previous events and I can’t stop them, I’ve tried everything. I keep having these thoughts and believing they’re visions of the future, my depression has dwindled but whenever these thoughts pop up i just go into this unrealistic panic, my heart stops and i feel so helpless and scared"

1269,Why does nothing feel real?,"I know that I might be experiencing disassociation as I've had it before but nothing I do matters anymore and people online just don't feel real. I'm always ""switching"" personalities however theatrical that may sound. I am noticing that regardless of who I am talking to I'm never truly myself even though I don't even know who I really am. I wish I could know and other times I wish I could just take every pill in my Fluoxetine bottle and maybe feel happy for once. I've never self harmed besides maybe hitting my head against the wall in desperation to feel anything other than sadness. I spend a'lot of time alone especially because I tend to self-isolate myself from other people in an attempt to protect myself? In order to lower my self-esteem I tend to say ""you like it"" to myself. There's a'lot of cycles running through my mind at all times and it feel's like i'm running on all cylinders constantly. I'f anyone wants to know what I'm diagnosed with it's ""Major Depressive Order and General Anxiety"". Sometimes I experience these bursts of wanting to help myself and do good things, but generally it never works. Maybe I've been misdiagnosed but it's all speculation. Sometimes I feel guilty because I think I use people to satisfy some sick need for attention and love in my brain even though it's probably not any real connection but it might just be me keeping myself down, cause you know how depression works. I'd like to improve but I just don't care enough to care to improve. I just applied to a job in order for family members to think more highly of me even though I can't even get myself to school without having panic attacks which is just pathetic. I'm so jealous of other people my age because I think they just have it figured out, I don't understand how people can just be so happy all the time or just feel normal like It's such a foreign concept to me. I don't understand doing something because you like doing it. I have hobbies sure but I think of them distractions rather than enjoyable things I ""like"" doing. Sure I ""like"" doing them, but is it because its enjoyable or is it because it distracts me from my other feelings? I think I really need therapy, but I don't? because I don't want to die, I just don't want to be here and ""here"" can be anywhere and it can be a feeling. Thing's aren't going to work out for me and I know it. So i'm coasting in life until I cannot anymore."
1270,I can't seem to think at all," Hello, I am a female in mid 20s, I have depression and I don't really know nor diagnosed but I think I have social anxiety. And my childhood is pretty bad, I was physically abused by my parents but as I grow up, they started to mentally abused me, not physical anymore. Everyday I passed the day, waking up, sweep the house, getting yelled at by my mom saying that I'm dumb etc etc. I've been depressed for almost 2 years now, and good news is I'm starting a new job last week (yaay!) as my last job is full of toxic people. Right now I haven't start to do any task yet but instead my company is giving me and some other people with me who just got hired, an online training using zoom. The session started at 07.30 am to 4.30 pm, every weekdays. In this online training, there is a mentor and their helper who helped with the power point slides. We do discussion a lot, but the problem is, I can't seem to think anything at all. I also can't speak out like there is nothing in my mind, to think, to say, to absorbed any lesson into my brain. I can't even answer to some simple question as ""what comes into your mind when you hear a word ""support""?"". Like, I know what ""support"" means, but I really can't say it, can't elaborate more, I just can't think. I just feels like a body, with no connection to anything at all, I can't feel happiness, or sadness, can't even grasp any words. I just empty. I really wanted to change but my brain seem can't cooperate with me. And also some people who on training with me are very active. Discuss a lot, speak up more. But why can't I? I also easily forgot, so I was constantly writing notes while on my training session. But the words are just words, it can't seem to get into my mind. I've tried to watch all youtube videos about leadership, people management which are some of the training lesson, but I still empty like I can't even remember what the youtube videos says. I've had some bad memories that I've been trying to block for a while, is that affecting how my brain works? Or am I just dumb?

I really hope anyone, could help me or at least tell me what to do :( Going into therapy or psychologist are sadly not a chance right now as covid cases are still going up in my country.

also sorry for my poor english grammar mistakes. Thank you."
1271,i cant get over a past mistake i made,"i cant stop thinking about the time i rear ended someone in traffic. it was my first accident and it happened months ago but it still bothers me so much.

i was 17, driving home from my high school. my memory is cloudy but i believe the upcoming light had just turned red and everyone was slowing down to a stop. i think i made a complete stop and saw this as a chance to look down at my car radio and change the music. i must’ve let my foot come off the brake or tried to inch forward a bit but wasn’t paying full attention to how close i was to the car in front of me, and before i could brake again, i rear ended the car in front of me. i followed her to an empty parking lot and checked for damage which turned out to be minimal (a few scratches on both our cars). i was a mess since this was my first accident and the car i was driving was my aunts, not mine so i really had no idea what to do. i gave her my parents phone numbers and later that night the lady i hit called my parents letting us know that it was nothing to worry about.

she was very kind and i’m so grateful for that and the fact that no one was hurt, but i feel so much shame still. there were 3 people in her car, two children. i feel terrible knowing i could’ve hurt them with my carelessness. sure it was a hit going less than 5 mph but i still feel so stupid knowing i could’ve avoided it all together. i definitely learned from it, and after that incident i drove with a lot more attentiveness and caution. i know i can’t do anything about it anymore and it has no effect on my life right now, but i can’t help but feel ashamed. if anyone has any advice how to let go, it would be appreciated."
1272,"Not a troll post, genuine post hoping to help myself.","I *hate* white people. My family immigrated from the Middle East to the US, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve had a serious distrust/fear of white people which has developed into full-fledged hatred the older I’ve gotten. It’s not something that was taught to me by my family.

One example of how this affects my life is that I have minimal (if any) patience for white people. For example, If I encounter a POC in public, say they accidentally bump into me while walking, I really wouldn’t bat an eyelash. If a white person did it, it would leave me at rage.

I say all this not out of kindness and sympathy for white people by any means.. I couldn’t give a shit if I tried. I say this because I live in a white majority country and I owe it to myself to at least be at peace with them so I don’t go crazy, but I honestly don’t know how."
1273,"Help finding a subreddit for narcissism, please!","Long story short I've been in a toxic relationship with a narcissist. He's now seeing a therapist and is trying to turn his life around. A big part of that is having a good support system, but I can't always be there to help him and his therapist is not on-call 24/7.

I have found a lot of help and support here on reddit throughout my battles with depression, anxiety, and PTSD and so I'm hoping there's a subreddit somewhere that he could utilize in his time of need."
1274,Mental illness and academic concessions,"I suffer from borderline personality disorder. I’ve done a lot of dialectical behavioural therapy and have managed the worst of my BPD, but I’m in grad school and I want to fucking die, I’m crumbling under the stress. I spent the last week in bed seriously contemplating and planning my suicide so I’m very behind on school work and my anxiety is so bad I can’t focus on zoom lectures or readings. I talked to my counselor today and she wants to work with me to overcome my problems and said that “I’d be happy to write you a note if you need an extension on some assignments but I’d rather leave that as our very last resort.”

I'm in the process of getting tested for ADHD and I also JUST started prozac for my anxiety/trichotillomania. So my only ""real"" diagnosis right now is BPD. 

I want to apply for academic concession at my school but idk why my counselor thinks it should be the very last resort when I’m panicking about school every waking moment of my life to the point I want to kill myself under the stress and pressure."
1275,I am sad,:(
1276,I feel like I skip right over sad and default to hysterics,"I have GAD &amp; some depression. I think I'm just not very good at emotions. They've never been highly tolerated in my family, and it's the same for my friend group. They're there to have fun, but if something is real they peace-out. I get it but I'm trying to make the better kind of friends now.

Other than Covid, I've been hit with a ton of extreme emotions about members of my family.
I literally don't know how to respond to it. To what I'm learning about them. I don't live in the same state as most of them and we're not super close, so I basically coast through my days like nothing has changed. And it feels weird that I'm doing that. Or I try to talk to someone about it, and it's so MUCH I just start laughing because it's so bad it doesn't even feel real. It's actually kind of funny it's so awful. I think I get a little hysterical. Same with some things that make me angry, I don't get angry, I just get hysterical where I'm explaining it like I need to prove it's real but I don't really feel anything.

Anyway, I'm not sure what to do and hoping for tips on being able to get through it, see it and etc. without the hysteria part."
1277,Sleep,"I've been sleeping for about 3-4 hours every 30 hours or so for about a week now, and I can't be prescribed sleep medications anymore. Just laying around and trying to sleep isn't an option because I need to be constantly distracted in some way. The only way I can sleep is to wait until I'm so exhausted that I fall asleep watching something, and when I do manage to sleep, I have weird dreams, wake up constantly, and can only force myself back to sleep so many times before I'm awake for good.

I've already been to hospital a few days ago, they pretty much just gave me a leaflet and promised me an assessment soon.

How long do you think this can go on before it does something horrible to my health?"
1278,Is imagining self-harm a form of self harm?,"When in heavy distress, I have the urge to punish myself for whatever I did, cause I often blame myself for my own distress. The only actual self harm I did to myself did not contain any permanent tissue damage.

However often (and by that I mean nearly every day) I imagine self mutilation, ranging from small scale cutting or burning up to dismemberment and other morbid stuff. And I need to emphasize this: these aren't mostly intrusive thoughts, I imagine these scenarios so that they give me some kind of release.

Probably related, and unsurprising, I have passive thoughts of ending my life hanging around casually. Sometimes more intense, sometimes less.

Now I try to open up to trusted people step by step, trying to communicate my distress before it completely takes over, I am still having difficulties in doing so. These thoughts though? I feel I am completely alone with them."
1279,Giving up,"The day that I gave up everything became easier, I immediately felt liberated and freer. 
Well it has probably been a gradual thing, everyday loosing a little bit more of the hope that I could turn my life around, that I could still be ""redimable"" and that I could be finally normal. But no matter how hard I tried I could never be normal, I could never measure up with those around me, I would always be the ugliest in any room and I was always going to be the stupidest person I know incapable of achieving anything substantial by myself.
So giving up on trying to fit in, leaving everyone behind in the process, sure made my day to day life easier, I no longer had any more unfathomable goal to reach, no more trying to reach a weight goal, no more trying to appear put together... it felt absolutely liberating.
And in a way I'm still glad I stopped chasing others expectations of me, but at the same time it feels orrible to know that I'm bringing everyone i know down for association, because now that I simply don't even try anymore things have just gotten out of hand.
I know I'm not enough, and i don't pretend to be, I just want to fall even farther down.
But now I just don't have anymore drive, there's no more life left in me, no more goals to power trough everyday life for... it feel empty and sad, even sadder to think that now i'm old and useless there's even less chances for me. 
People like me are supposed to be on the background, out of sight, and that's were I've made sure I've been all of this time, probably i'm just scared cause the light in me is fading and I have nothing.
I probably just need to learn to accept becoming a little worse every day, I just hope that does that are left obligated to be related to me don't suffer too much having to deal with me."
1280,My cousin was just murdered.,"She was shot. She was only 21 and was a mother to an infant.

We were very close growing up, like sisters. 
She was younger than me. I wish I could go back in time to protect her. To tell her to stay away. All of these memories are rushing back of us spending time together. Biking around the neighborhood, swinging on the swings, chasing around boys we had crushes on, watching Santa on the radar on Christmas Eve, and so on. I just saw her last Christmas. I had no idea that would be the last time I'd ever see her.

I'm so upset at this man that murdered her. I'm also so upset at the city. This was a guy that was involved in starting fires and looting in Minneapolis. If they would've arrested him he wouldn't have been able to murder her. 

I can't process death easily, let alone a MURDER. I don't understand how someone could take another person's life. 

I don't even feel emotion yet. Just shock.

Please, if anyone has any advice to help with dealing with something like this I would be so thankful."

1288,Being manipulated,"Hi, 

I knew there is a lot wrong with the situation I'm in and I know they do it on purpose. My mother has been using pretty much all of the manipulation tactics. My stepfather is using them also. Even worse they have made others join them. My psychologist is gaslighting me. And the state wants me to voluntarily go to a mental health hospital, otherwise they will make it happen against my will. For example. My mother's boyfriend called me a whore. I told my mother. She just looked at me weird. She didnt tell him to apologize me. She went to his house to fuck him. I got mad and destroyed a few things in the living room. Which landed me in the group homes. When I talked about it with her 3 weeks ago. Since they all like to say that there is something wrong with me and that I have issues. When I said it wasnt normal to just let your boyfriend call your daughter a whore. She said 'and weren't you?' Now I'm out of group homes after 4 years. I'm staying with my mother and stepfather. They like threaten me with passive aggressive comments all the time. Or with body language. Yesterday my stepfather was saying that he would know how and like to help people like me (when talking about how he would ""help"" the people from the homeless shelter I was at). He was saying he'd get some chains big like a fist and chain them in the shed. He'd beat them and stuff. Even got a broom stick, made gestures with it and said that it would do the job. They talk about me when I'm not around, but do it so I can hear them. Always complaining about me and saying I'm ungrateful. My mother was talking to their friend on phone and she told him about the message I sent her. I asked her if she wanted me to go downstairs. Their friend was saying ""tell her to come and then tell her to go, then she will learn"". And that people around me will know that I'm fucked up. My mother was laughing all the time. She opened the door to the upstairs on purpose so I will hear the conversation. My psychologist says that she has a gut feeling that there is something I'm hiding. I told her I want to know what I'm hiding. She says she doesnt know. She just has a gut feeling. My mother told me that the other psychologist sees straight through me. They want me in the mental hospital very bad. They threaten me that if I dont go they will make me go against my will. I read an article that said I should speak to someone about this. I cant even talk to my psychologist since they are doing this too. What is the best thing I can do. They want me in the mental hospital really bad. And I've heard that for people like me it's worse than prison. What should I do to not end up there. Police took my ID (pretty much stole it when they were searching through my backpack) I found out it isnt there at the homeless shelter. My stepfather told me that I cant go anywhere without my ID. Since I wanted to move abroad. I live in a country where the average wait time for a house is 8 years. I got 6 more to go."

1292,I feel like I am a covert narcissist,"Lately the more I research into it the more I think I am a covert narcissist. I don’t consider myself superior to people and actually have some pretty low self esteem but I always feel that first itch of jealousy or envy or “how did you manage to do that?” whenever anyone I’m close to accomplished something. I never vocalise it and it’s just a fleeting thought but I am disgusted by it. 

In my new relationship with my boyfriend, I’ve noticed a lot of old bad behaviours resurfacing. For example, me getting easily irritated by what he says, getting annoyed that the conversation isn’t going in the direction I want it to. Shutting him out emotionally/lashing out. We talk over it and I always say sorry if I know that I was in the wrong or if I definitely overreacted. It’s been completely eating at me the way I’ve been behaving with him and he told me he feels like I’m pushing him out the closer we get ready to go back to university (we’re planning long distance). I’m terrified that I’m turning into an emotionally abusive person and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been doing things that I KNOW are unreasonable and I can feel how stupid I’m being but my anger just takes over. 

I’ve been up all night just feeling an intense amount of sickness at the possibility of being a covert narcissist. Everybody always says how I’m one of the nicest/most thoughtful people they’ve met but secretly they don’t know that I have a lot of intense negative thoughts (to be fair, mostly about myself). Sometimes I think I’m just giving a very inaccurate version of myself to people - I enjoy being nice to people and helping out, it gives me a sense of accomplishment but I also do genuinely want these people to be happy too. But I second guess myself and wonder if I’m doing these acts of kindness because I’m secretly a narcissist who feeds off of good impressions."
1293,"My depression is never leaving, she's a friend now.","There are some days, like today when i feel my mental health going back to shit again. Its like an onset of a migraine, starts with a dull pain and then its a proper explosion of pain for god knows how many days or weeks. 
I always try to be stay happy but its really difficult because my brain wont let me. I've always been an anxious person as a kid and i have trouble adjusting to things that are not in my plan. I expect the best from myself and if i don't do my best, it takes a huge toll on my mental health. 
A lot has changed in my life, it feels like its been uprooted and i cant help but feel helpless. I've become numb, I've stopped feeling things but suddenly out of the blue while working or just in between some chore, i get this sudden burst of emotions and theyre not good ones. 
When the depression starts to hit, i start to get productive. Like really really productive. I work on projects, study. So thats one good thing i get out of it. 
I feel trapped in my head, i want to be set free.
I want to know what its like to be happy and i want the anxiety to vanish. 
And the fact that our lives have no significant meaning and everything we do will ultimately make no difference to the universe is terrifying. 
I know it'll never leave, it'll always be a part of me and i guess i just have to live with it."

1300,Obsessive Love Thoughts?,"So, Im looking for a direction to be pointed into for what Im dealing with. Im located in Michigan &amp; have no clue whats going on with me or why Ive always been like this. Also, Im curious if there’s anyone else that has these same problems. 

So, at the beginning of the year, I had a guy take me out to dinner a few times. After I realized he considered it a date, I pretty much became obsessed with thinking about him. I wouldn’t text him first or constantly like his posts online or anything like that. I think I do a good job at just keeping the obsession in my head &amp; not harass them. However, I will spend hours going through their pictures &amp; things like that. Anyways, things just didn’t work out (we wanted different things in life) so I agreed with him &amp; we stopped seeing each other. I did continue for the next month to obsessively think of him. Im talking every waking minute I was thinking about him. Im not sure when or how I stopped thinking about him, Im guessing I found something else to do?

The most recent deal happened the other day. I watched a musical for the first time (wont say which one, though it could probably be easily guessed) &amp; here I am obsessed with the lead actor. I mean, **obsessed**. I know he doesn’t know who I am, I don’t think that he’s in love with me or anything like that. But Ive watched the musical every single night since then &amp; Ive had the soundtrack on around the clock. I think the part that got me was I spent 4 hours tonight going through his pictures on twitter. Last night after I got done with the musical, I was on YouTube watching every video hes in. I was up until 6am just watching video after video. Like I said earlier though, I dont reach out or anything because I don’t want to harass anyone. Tonight I figured whats the point of going to sleep when I could stay up &amp; listen to the music. I know this is just a “me” thing. I just feel like I need to see pictures/videos of him constantly. When Im not looking at pictures of him, Im constantly thinking of him. I know he’s not the character in the show, I know the persona he puts on in interviews probably isnt who he is. But let me tell you, my brain just doesn’t care &amp; just takes whatever it’ll get. He could end up the worst person on earth &amp; I would still be so obsessed with him. I get that I dont have a shot, but that doesn’t shut me down. 

I had a friend mention that maybe its quarantine or the “honeymoon phase” when dating irl. However, Ive **always** been like this. My last relationship was 5 years &amp; I was living with him for a few of those years. But all of those years, I never stopped obsessing. He was all I would think about—all day, everyday, nonstop. When things would get rocky, I would spend all day, everyday thinking about anything that could’ve caused it, or what to do to make it better. It was so intense that when I’d be in class, I wouldn’t realize that I stopped listening to the professor &amp; I was in my head. Like my thoughts were so loud in my head that when Id catch myself &amp; stop it. The sound in the room would be dead silent but then have the effect that someones turning the volume up. Ive spent many classes just in another world &amp; I cant seem to stop myself. I just zone out &amp; eventually I catch it, try to focus &amp; at some point I just go back out. Its not like my classes aren’t interesting either, they’re everything Im interested in &amp; doing in my career. 

Ive always been in long term relationships (2 total). I think the first one was 4 years, the other was 5. Both I was absolutely obsessed with, but apparently neither guys have ever known. When I left my last boyfriend I told him I couldn’t be with him for many reasons, but the big one being that I couldn’t stop thinking of him &amp; it was exhausting &amp; took such a toll on my mental health. At some point I just stop thinking about them though, but I apparently find something new to obsess over. I haven’t pinpointed what though, because this seems to come in waves. 

I will say I decided I needed to stop dating after the last guy I went out with. I just worry that these obsessive thoughts are going to drop my grades or that I’ll lose my career over it. I thought that was going to solve my problem, but here I am months later obsessing over a celebrity. This hasn’t been the first time obsessing over a celebrity though. 

When I was a kid, I started with the love obsession with Zac Efron in high school musical. My walls were covered in pictures of him. I had all of the HSM merch, I would watch the movies over &amp; over, I had the bedding, everything. I remember I was always thinking about him. I think I was about 8 when I started this. My mom always worried about it, but everyone told her it was just a phase. But the phase of obsession just hasn’t left. 

When I was in middle school, I became obsessed with Michael Jackson. I owned all his albums, movies, documentaries, pictures, magazines, etc. I listened to his music on repeat for 3 years. I wouldn’t allow any song that wasn’t MJ on my iPod. 

Ive never met anyone who’s had the same problem. I think the scariest thing is the loud thoughts that completely drown everything out (which, I already mentioned). I don’t realize they’re loud until I stop them &amp; then the sound of the room hurts my ears for a minute. While typing this up, Ive probably zoned out 5 or 6 times on my celebrity. I just apparently kept typing while zoned but then would realize I was trying &amp; snap back to it. So, this post is probably all over the place but Ive tried to reread what Ive typed to make sure it was what I was trying to say. 

I just think the older I get, the more intense &amp; louder these thoughts get. They’re not negative thoughts &amp; I can control them to an extent. They’re just....made up scenarios, pictures, scenes from movies they’re in, anything. I did see a therapist when I was a teen but she never brought up anything obsessive. She just figured I was obsessed because it was my first relationship/breakup. 

Im open to anything to cope until places start opening up a bit. Im back to school &amp; Im falling back into the thoughts 24/7 &amp; struggling to focus. I tried cutting off all connections/music/movies before in the past, &amp; for some reason it just doesn’t help. It seems to just intensify the thoughts &amp; make it so much harder to get out of. Id love to say “oh these waves only last a month” but they all vary. This one could be a week, or could be the next 10 years &amp; itll just get more intense as time goes on."
1301,How long does it normally take to be seen by a counselor? I'm working on a project.,How long on average does it take to be seen by a mental health professional in America?
1302,Is this a narcissistic personality?,"I have a friend who was very normal before her crush who we thought would be her boyfriend, suddenly introduced a new girl. Anyway, things started to change from here. She would always eat at fancy restaurants and was always concerned with how people saw her. 

This year she started getting botox and fillers, going to expensive gyms, and so many other expensive stuff. She said she’s investing in herself because she wanted to be an actress and an established social media star (like charli d’amelio)  someday. Her credit card bill reached 2k USD and borrowed money from various different people (even people she did not know) just to pay it off. Now here, I though she paid off the card. Unfortunately, she didn’t. Instead, what she did with the borrowed money, she used it to fund her expensive lifestyle. Her debt now to the card and from the different people is now at at least 5-6k USD. She’s not paying for her rent, her bills because any money handed to her would automatically go to her face and body (she’s planning to get breast implants too even though she can’t afford it). She’s sleeping with different wealthy men just to fund her lifestyle. She would even save a cheeseburger for 5 days just to save money for botox. She’s very messy in the house and is only clean with herself.

I am very afraid for her because the people whom she borrowed money from is starting to harass her but she just can’t see the importance of paying them first instead of paying for her expensive treatments. She said she will become a star someday and will be so rich from being a movie star/ social media star and that’s when she will pay them. Who knows how long this will take? I’m worried this will eventually kill her because her debt is so huge now. I don’t even know why she’s so obsessed with her looks! She’s already a very beautiful girl.

Do you think this is becoming a mental disorder now?

TLDR: Friend was heartbroken, borrowed money (5-6k) to fix her face and body and can’t stop and would not pay people she borrowed money from. Also, obsessed with becoming a movie star and social media star."

Am I the stupid one for getting attached. I just don't understand. Did he just somehow stop liking me in that short span of time? I really just feel quite low right now. It really doesn't help that I was already feeling depressed before hand"

1308,How to eat when I only feel good when I’m feeling “skinnier”,"So i’ve been struggling with weight and body image issues for a while, and it recently has been worse when my partner told me they are not as attracted to me as i put on a lil weight over lockdown. However they apologised but the thought stays with me. 

Despite this, they are still encouraging of me to eat 3 meals a day and to eat what I want, but I don’t want to anymore?

I was ill for most of last month (that time of the ... month (but not really)) so i haven’t eaten much for around 3 weeks (i’m very irregular) , i’ve probably had around 4 full meals during these weeks, and just an apple once a day or cereal for the other days. However now i’ve been feeling better for around 2 weeks but now i just do not want to eat at all because i felt so skinny and good when i only ate one meal.

But i also need to go to the gym which makes me feel sick on an empty stomach.

Does anyone just have any words of encouragement or ways they managed to increase their appetite again over time?

tldr: i was ill and didn’t eat and now i don’t want to eat at all because i felt better about myself"
1309,Is this a tic?,"Sometimes when I think about painful or embarrassing situations I can’t stop myself from saying things “I’m dying“ or „kill yourself“.

1310,"I don't feel like I exist, I don't have any memory capacity, I have no idea what's going on. Can anyone offer insight, please?","Hi all,

This is my first time posting here, and I'm getting into the swing of reddit. I'm 26 and from the UK/Ireland. I've had a perusal of the subs rules and guidelines and I think [hope] this will be fine.

I suffer from a chronic pain condition that is in a 'permanent' flare-up state due to breaking my back when I was 21. According to my doctor, this forces my brain to shove me into a disassociated state to try and gain a 'break/rest'. I'm fine with the pain aspect.

But I would really, really, appreciate any help you guys can give to try and help with disassociation. I can't cope with it. I have no memory, I have no wants or desires, I just 'exist' but I don't know who it is that is existing. I am struggling to even detail this post because unless I'm 'me' again and in full cognitive faculties (which is happening less and less), I can't actually know/understand what the full extent is.

I guess right now all I'm able to verbalise is that I would really appreciate any helpful tips/tricks/mechanisims/habits that would help me actually live my life, and not 'wake up' every couple of weeks and be in an emotional black depressive hole where I feel like I'm dying, and then go back to watching my life pass by in blank confusion.

1312,I’m terrified for my dad and brother,"Me myself have struggled with eating problems for a while, but on the other side of the spectrum(I’m a recovering anorexic). My dad has always been overweight, but the past three years it has pushed into category 3 obesity. My brother has also always been overweight and my mom is a little overweight(nowhere near obese though), but recently my brother has been getting even worse. I am in no way body shaming, I love my family(couldn’t care less about how they look), but I’m seriously worried about their health and it’s making it a lot harder for me not to fall back to my old eating habits when I see my 10 year old brother eating 3 hamburgers, 6 piece nuggets and a milkshake for dinner.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not only afraid for them, but for myself aswell as others overeating around me has always been a trigger for me not wanting to eat. I’m also worried that my brother will get bullied at school. My dad knows what he is doing and how it is affecting his body(he’s also working out a couple times a week and I’m so proud of him), but my brother just eats and eats. He’s just a kid, he doesn’t know how this affects or will affect him long term. My parents should take more responsibility, and I have confronted my mother during a breakdown about this, but she hasn’t done anything. I’m starting to freak out about this behavior."

1317,"Me (23f) trying time be there for my niece (13) TW: ED, family drama","I hope this is an appropriate sub. Any advice/ encouragement would help.

I have 2 half-brothers on my dad’s side that are all 10+ years older than me, who have never been a big part of my life. 
As a teenager, my mental health was a hot mess. I had undiagnosed autism and a whole lot of trauma. My extended family was never involved or even really aware of all the psych wards I was put in/ all the pain I was in. My parents were very old fashioned about not talking about mental health with anyone. I wasn’t even allowed to call myself depressed. 
When I was a bit older, the one brother (referred to as B) and his family moved closer to where I lived and I saw them more often. By then, I had already moved out, become a lot healthier, was getting the correct therapy, was properly diagnosed ect. I was/ am pretty happy and stable now. 

My niece was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD when she was 7. B and his wife (let’s call her SIL) have always been incredibly supportive. She goes to a smaller, private school, has a tutor + extra lessons, has seen a a psychologist for years, and they’re incredibly kind and gentle with her. 
She’s 13 now and, with lockdown knocking her anxiety sideways, she has become severely anorexic. I could barely recognize her when I saw her after 4 months. 

Although food was an issue for me with autism, it never got to the point she’s now at. However, I am one of the only people she is willing to spend time with (think she sees me as a ‘cool aunt’?) 

I saw her today and just told her she can always call me and she can talk to me about whatever she needs when she’s ready. Everyone in our family is trying to give her advice and I think it’s making it worse, so I told her I won’t do that. I’d just be there for her. We made art and watched the office and talked shit. She laughed and seemed okay. 
But when I dropped her off, her maternal grandmother started saying she is going to have a ‘serious chat’ with niece and it set off alarm bells in my head. 

I don’t know 1) what I can do to help other than reminding her that I’m here for her [which I needed someone to tell me when I was 13] and 2) how to tell B and SIL to tell everyone to back off. She has a psych + good parents + a best friend + now me, who I guess she trusts just to hold space. But think everyone else trying to help is making it worse? 

TL/ DR: my niece is really struggling with anorexia and trusts me because I’m the ‘cool aunt’ who doesn’t make a big deal about it. Any advice on how to help her, and any advice on how to tell extended family to back off?"

This is due to the trauma brought by my past relationshop that resulted into physical, emotional and financial abuse. My parents already has their own families and I have lived for the past years through multiple part-time jobs.

As the pandemic came, I lost all my jobs and my only source of income is the allowance from my scholarships. Even though I have financial assistance, it goes into my monthly rent, food, laundry and other university fees.

I have tried to reach through my local government but then the supplies of the medicines rarely come since we are still on lockdown here on our country. I also tried to reach into women support groups but then their supplies are very limited.

Please, help me. I know I am just a stranger on the internet but every help means a lot to me. I will attach my prescription and diagnosis here as a proof. Please do not hesitate to send me a message if you want to talk.

Any of your donation will proceed to my medicines. Here's my paypal: [paypal.me/helpapoorcollegekid](https://paypal.me/helpapoorcollegekid)

Thank you and have a good day!"

1320,Lost In my mind,I feel like my mind is slipping into a void every day. I can’t understand it but I haven’t been able to talk or even look at other people. I try to interact with my children but I’m numb. My relationship is on thin ice. How do I pull myself out of this dark place?
1321,How to deal with losing all of your yoinger siblings in week?,"   Good Day. This is actually my first time here in Reddit, so I really don't know to start. 

   I am the eldest child of our family (F, 40) with a younger sister (F, 38) and brother (M, 37). We live in different places now since we moved out after college but still maintain to contact each other through the years. 

   Now a month earlier the present day, expecting my second child, my old friend had to call me from the Philippines and told me that my sister was tested positive for COVID-19, and was admitted to the hospital, together with her husband and my brother.

   I was unable to react at first from disbelief, that feeling of dread filled up and clouded my thoughts; I couldn't possibly go back home, it's too risky at times like these. Although I can't bear having just to stay here and do nothing. 

   I was very stressed and experienced insomnia, my husband was so worried about me and our baby that he took a leave from online work just to take care of me and our daughter. 

     Then the news came.

   All three of them died days apart from complications with COVID-19, and was quickly cremated after their deaths. 

   And now, as I'm tearing up writing this down, How could you even have the power to cope and accept about when all of your siblings died before you? For me it's just so unnatural and that feeling of emptiness that in a matter of a short time, you've just became the only living relative alive from your generation? People of Reddit, please help me.

1323,"I Get It (a list of random ""in head"" rants I've had so far today)","I was annoying as a toddler
Even more so as I child. 
I was loud, rude, obnoxious
And, no, not everyone is. 
I've been told. 
It's ok. I get it.

I wasnt particularly good at sports
Cricket, maybe, but even then 
I struggled to do anything useful for
A team. I even gave one of my own batsmen out once, as an umpire. Correctly, but that's not important.
The chairman demanded that the objectionable 17 year old be removed from the field for doing my job correctly.
It's ok. I get it.

I picked up a few facts and
Tidbits of general knowledge over the years.
Everyone does, it's nothing special.
And I annoy everyone by getting quiz questions correct and 'deliberately' making them feel stupid.
Not knowing stuff gets you laughed at, by some, but knowing stuff gets you hated.
It's ok. I get it.

I have some amount of talent in some things. I can act, apparently. I've never noticed. 
I can write, too, or so they say, but neither of these are 'real jobs' and I've been told quite recent that they will never make me enough money to support my family.
It's ok. I get it.

I get tired after doing stuff. Not always a lot of stuff, but I get tired. I cant help it. 
I used to smoke so maybe I'm unfit. That one is actually my fault, but despite not having a cigarette in 36 months, I apparently only 'porperly' gave it up a week ago. So I guess vaping at 0-3mg means no other effort counts for literally anything.
I dont drink anymore though. 
It's ok. I get it.

I have ""mental health"". No, that's not a slur. Other people have actual mental health. I have ""mental health"" because it gets in the way. Of other people, not of me. I'm ok with it.
When I had a really down time a couple of years ago, my old boss made fun of me (in front of the entire team) because all I had achieved that weekend was rearranging my room. Someone else had been fortunate enough to save a life.
So it's right that I was humiliated in front of my peers. 
(My old boss had suffered with mental health too, by the way.)
It's ok. I get it.

I also know that writing something like
This is, largely, self centred, unfair,
Heavily biased, clearly affected by
Mental health, and ultimately pointless.
Its cathartic, and it saves me saying any
Of this to the people that it might offend. 
But all it does is make it seem like I think
All of my problems are the only problems
In the world.
Which they aren't. I know they aren't. 
Its ok. I get it.

But by God it would be nice if just
Every now and then people also realised
That THEIR problems aren't the only
Problems in the world.
We are all suffering and struggling in 
Our own ways, in our own situations.
No-one is perfectly happy all of the time.
It's ok. I get it.

I'm better than when I started writing
This. So, I guess that's good. I still feel
Shitty though. And I'm honestly not sure
When I won't feel shitty. Because I have
To step back into new problems,
Like everyone else,
And I'm sure there will be new verses
To this added over time.
But, for now, since I have very little
Other choice.

1324,Help -- I may have been molested.,"Hi,  


I've recently been having trouble regarding something I've begun remembering a few months ago. It's always been a weird memory for me, the part that I've always remembered. It was something my parents joked about after we moved into a new neighbourhood when I was very young. I estimate I was around 5-6 at the time.   


""We met Mr. Neighbour (censoring name), and he asked if he could take you on a ride on his 4-wheeler. We said yes, but just to the end of the road. He took you to a country club to feed fish, though.""  


That was all I was told. Again, they treated it like a joke. But I never really thought of it, not ever. I knew I used to go to his house too, sometimes alone, which I can't remember much of either. I remember going over to hang out with his granddaughter/niece/unsure of her relation, and we were friends. But other than that, and going to pick blueberries in his backyard, it's all a blur.   


A year ago, I was sexually assaulted. I'm 19 now and had just turned 18. The woman was on drugs, called me a girl and harassed me and my boss (I'm a transman), and touched me sexually, also implicating with her words that she thought I was a child. It took me months to accept with the help of my therapist that I was actually sexually assaulted.   


I know I am a victim of grooming at age 15, though the farthest this man got was asking me out; he is in jail now for CSEM and statutory rape. And I know when I was around 12, a woman tried to get me to leave a store with her. However, I began to get a lot of nightmares about sexual assault and rape semi-recently. I have OSDD-1B as well, undiagnosed, but with all of this happening in the world, I haven't gotten a chance to see my therapist to finally admit it to her.   


And then I remembered the 'joke', the story my parents told me. And it was no longer so innocent. See it from my perspective as I look back on it as an adult, one who has PTSD, dissociative disorders, etc. and can recognise trauma now: I meet a stranger. I get on a vehicle with him.  


He takes me into the woods near our house. I can't remember anything. And then I'm on a pier with him. What are we feeding fishes with? There isn't a country club near our house. It was in someone's backyard. He was talking to me but I don't know what was said. I don't know when or how I got home.   


I never felt safe around him, when I think of it. I'm autistic as well, and I don't like strangers, but it felt different. I think I believed in my parents, that Mr. N was a good guy. He was an elderly man, and in my parent's eyes, they do no wrong (I have a recent situation that occurred w/ one of their church members, but I'll spare you. He was just creepy and they excused it).   


Not long after this, I began to become extremely sexual to the point of masturbating 5+ times a day. I tried to get my 'boyfriends' to kiss me and have sex with me. I did sexual things with my best friend, who was a girl. I literally would masturbate IN class. In youth group. Every. Single. Day. But...how did I know what it was? Why did I try sneaking peeks at Cosmoplitians' sexual pages? Why did I insist for years to sleep with my parents? Why did I develop OSDD-1B (other than other private reasons)? Why did I have the mindset that I was so mature, that if ANYONE asked to have sex with me, I know I would have said yes? 

I think my neighbour molested me. I don't remember anything. I know I shouldn't remember. I know I have OSDD-1B to not remember. But yet, I am. And I'm scared. I'm so fucking scared. This neighbour passed when I was still in elementary school. I'm afraid, however, that I'm disgracing the dead if this did not happen to me. But it feels like I'm right. It would explain everything.  


I will be addressing this with my therapist soon. Please, however, lend me your thoughts."
1325,What is this feeling?,[removed]
1326,I sent my friend a concerning message last night that I don’t remember sending?,"I’ve recently gone through increasingly bad mental health spurt, I got diagnosed with BPD and am currently dealing with psychosis - I hear voices fairly frequently but I’m on medication which helps. Also have very bad anxiety. 

The last thing I remember last night was hearing really really bad voices, at around 1:10am I sent a tweet on my private twitter saying ‘voices are increasingly bad tonight, I want this to stop, I’m going to go to sleep now, I hope it stops’ and I remember going to sleep after that, I don’t remember waking up and I fell asleep very quickly from what I remember. I even put my phone on my night stand. 

I woke up to a bunch of missed calls from my friend and I realised I’d send a message at 1:45am saying ‘I’m sad’ and ‘scars’ which is super weird. I don’t remember sending this at all, I have however struggled with self harm since I was 12 years old. The fact I don’t remember and that this ties into that just made me even more concerned considering I would have had to unlock my phone and go onto his messages to even be able to send that in the first place.

Has anyone experienced something like this? I’m seriously trying to make sense of it. It can’t have just been like I left my phone unlocked bc my phone unlocks every minute and that’s way too specific for me to have just accidentally typed it. Plus I put my phone on my night stand. I’m super confused, someone help me make sense of this?"
1327,Seeing injustice and speaking out is a good thing - adding to hate and anger is not. Your words carry more weight when spoken from peace,"We see injustice around us every day; discrimination, bullying and exploitation are commonplace. We have a responsibility to use our voice to highlight injustice and reduce the suffering of others. But in shining a light we can speak out of anger - we're often told we should be angry or to ""get angry"". We should acknowledge our anger, listen and accept it, but acting directly on anger (even when we believe we're right) can escalate hate and violence. Speaking from peace can make our words heard, more powerful and ultimately have more impact in the world.

1328,Me and my brother are my mom’s only reason to live,"My mom told me a few times that she doesn’t like this world, nor mankind, and that without us she would have no reasons to live. I don’t think she had depression because she told me she always felt this way (she used to tell her parents as a kid that she was a bit mad at them for giving her life..). This makes me sad and distressed sometimes, I hate knowing that my mom isn’t pleased with life. It also makes me feel pressured because I want to do my best to make her happy but I always feel at fault when she isn’t. it’s all a bit depressing really, also knowing that her dad committed suicide.. I’m scared of becoming like them"
1329,Just diagnosed with NPD.,Where do I go from here? Every time I Google NPD horrible things come up. People talking about abuse and manipulation and violence. I have aggressive tendencies sure but I'm not like that. Is that what I'm going to become? The doctor who diagnosed me said I needed to see a specialist but couldn't recommend any so I don't even know if I can get professional help. Am I better off dead?
1330,Today’s the fucking day,"I’ve made a bunch of posts on here begging for help none of them get any attention open waiting for my partner to get here from Texas for the past four months and he only started working on the exemption process at the end of August but like he promised to The moment that I got back home to Canada 

My mental health has been declining for the past four months waiting for him because I’m scared his family is going to hurt or kill him but he won’t do anything till you and I just want him to be safe and I just want to be happy 

But I realized today that I will never be happy 

He’s not trying to get here he got the cat carrier today I told him to start working in June 1 day of June I told him to start working on getting here he applied to school here at the end of August I got the cat carrier yesterday I just want him here I just want him to save it hurts it hurts to wait 

I was already so sick I was already so mentally ill his mother traumatized me so badly

I already had PTSD I already have severe OCD I already have severe anxiety I already have depression and I relapsed into my eating disorder at the beginning of August I don’t eat very much anymore and often I just have to throw it all up today I told my mother I wouldn’t be able to eat and she told me to fuck off I asked her to apologize and she said that she has PTSD from me telling her that I wanted to kill myself and I told her I only want to kill myself and have only ever wanted to kill myself to make the pain stop and that I wasn’t trying to make her feel bad because I don’t care how she feels about it she tells me that Im an adult even though we all know all of us every single one of us in this fucking family know that I got so traumatized my brain reverted back to that of a child and I can hardly cope with anything but she told me to be an adult 

I know this post won’t get any attention but once Im dead maybe they’ll find it and they’ll read it I don’t understand a little better but no even once Im dead they’re just gonna blame me for everything 

If you see this Robert I love you with all my heart Im sorry for yelling at you and fighting with you I just wanted you here so everything would be better I just wanted you to be here so I would be able to keep you safe and take care of you I wanted you to be away from your abusive family I wanted you to be safe and I wanted you to have a life 

I just wanted her to apologize I was already crying I was already hurting myself this morning and she told me to fuck off I thought she was changed I thought she understood better but shes the same old bitch she always was 

I love you Robert I just wanted you to be here Im sorry for all the fighting Im sorry I hurt you  

I just want the pain to stop 

I love you I really really do 

I just want you here I just want it to be better but it won’t get better I just wanted her to apologize I told her that and she just yelled at me and then she told me to leave her alone because she knew she did wrong she always makes me leave her alone if she knows she did wrong and she doesn’t want to apologize 

I love you Im sorry"
1331,GO DO IT,Wake up and do something differently today! Break your cycle 🌍🖤
1332,I feel like my mind is killing me,"I can’t describe how mentally exhausted I feel with myself. My anxiety, overthinking and worrying is killing me. I don’t even know who I am anymore or what my purpose is, I just feel like my entire life is run by these intrusive and overpowering thoughts, and so many of them are pointless and irrelevant. 

I’m not living my life, I’m 20, with a steady job, a caring family and a loving boyfriend, I have nothing to complain about but I can’t seem to bring myself out of this dark hole. I pretend everything is fine to my family and try put on a brave face most of the time to my boyfriend. But when I’m alone I just feel lost and so empty, I don’t own my life anymore, it feels lost to these thoughts. 

I’m scared to be happy because I know it doesn’t last too long before some controlling thought runs anxiety through me. It feels like my mind is purposely on the look out to find something for me to overthink or panic about, no matter how hard I try to stop it.

It doesn’t feel like it’s getting any better, I feel awful all the time, and it just feels like it’s never going to stop. I can’t describe how much I want it to go away

I hate this so much and I just want to be normal, it feels like I’m at war with my own mind."
1333,anyone else imagine them selves dying young ?,"I always imagine my funeral and me dead at a young age for no reason it’s weird, it’s just negative thoughts I guess"
1334,Why do I think about bad things happening to me after something bad happens to someone else?,"I find that whenever someone I love is feeling really bad, experiences something really painful, or even something traumatic, my brain always ends up going to “what if that happened to me?” Or “what if something just as awful/even worse happened to me?” And I end up fantasizing about it. I feel like it’s really narcissistic of me or just shitty to do, but I can’t help but always think of things like that. I want to say it’s some sort of coping mechanism, but why that of all things? Recently a few very close friends of mine and myself went through something horrific, especially just one of my friends, I can’t help but think of what it would be like if that happened to me. It just makes me feel selfish because it’s as if my brain is trying to say make me say “look at me, I went through something worse,” when I’d never ever want to flaunt that if I even thought it was true. I think my friends have gone through more than me anyways. I don’t know, it feels kinda difficult to explain. I’m just really tired and feel guilty, I don’t want to be a bad person."
1335,Why do I feel like I did something bad and I don’t remember?,"I, especially lately, feel like I’ve done something bad and I just don’t remember it. I’ve been this way since I was a kid, but it’s just much worse lately. I feel like any moment something horrible I did is going to be “revealed” and my best friends are going to leave me and I’ll have absolutely nobody. I don’t know what I apparently did though, I can’t think of anything, or why I’d want to do something mean. It’s always things I think I did with ill intentions too, it feels unlike me. It stresses me out so much though because I just feel any time now my friends are going to drop me."
1336,"I don't know what is wrong with me, does anyone recognize any of this?","I used to be outgoing, active. Decisive. These days I find myself questioning everything I do, I feel down, sad, angry.

I've been seeing a neurologist who diagnosed me with bipolar, but I really don't think I am, I feel like she stretched things to fit. I was put on lithium which made me fat, more depressed, I lost my creativity, my drive. I took that for 6 months before I stopped, against her advice. But I feel a little better in one way, and worse in others.

My main problem is that I'm sick and tired of fighting fires I didn't light.  My life feels like a struggle, I work, I come home, I'm tired, I soend a lot of time fighting charges from a bank or an insurance company, or calling up one of the tradesmen that didn't do their job properly to come put it right, I have lots of problems with my internet that my provider can't or won't fix so I'm allways fighting with them.  Then there are the occasions when I'm outright lied to by companies about the service they offer, such as O2, and now I'm in a legal battle to get out of my contract that is costing me money. this feels like my life for the last 20 years. Constantly having to fight to simply have what I'm legitimately entitled to.

I think it's normal that this would make me angry, frustrated.  I talk to friends and they say I need to stop letting this stuff get to me, or I'm being negative, or it's not that bad, look at all the companies that you don't have these problems with... 

This is my problem. I've seen an analogy I cannot unsee.  I'm the victim of various small transgressions by companies or organizations, most of us are, they don't happen by accident, and it's not right. If you scale it up a little or a lot, thd principle applies. Someone is being wronged by soneone else for their gain, like a mugging. But you would never dream of telling the victim of a violent mugging to think of all the times people didn't mug them. And what is more, the amounts of money I lose every year ftom this kind of thing us far higher then any amount ever lost to a mugging, and clearly has also had more of a mental impact on me. 

People are ripping me off. Stealing from me, lying to me, to all of us actually...  Yet I'm the one who needs to be on meds, I'm the one with sonething wrong. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that so many people just don't see it, they don't see any of this as a problem, which makes it easier for this shit to happen. 

Then this spreads over to work, my rich as fuck CEO boss turning up to work in a helicopter, but we can't possibly have a pay raise.  The amount of money he wants to make decides the salary the rest of us get, decides our standard of living, our class, what possible reach we have on life. And why? Because he worked hard? Or because he took over his father's  company and got lucky with the internet boom? 

I'm just sick of getting shit on from a great hight, and sicker from looking around at everyone else looking to the skies with their mouths wide open. 

I've been in the medical system for a year now, and I feel worse, no one has really done me much good and I constantly feel like I'm being rushed so they can get to the next person, I've been passed around, it's costing my health insurance a bomb, but it's not benefitting me at all, just the doctors getting paid. More of the same shit. 

What is this? 

I'm really struggling to feel calm, I'm always anxious or on edge I bob my legs like crazy, I can't sleep properly. I'm making my family miserable but I can't help myself. 

Any advice... Or anyone recognizing any of this."
1337,Helping a friend who can't be helped,"Lately I've been getting more worried about my friend. She didn't have a very good start into the year: a few mental breakdowns and a failed suicide attempt.. I think she is doing a bit better than before but she is still in a very bad place and I just don't know how to help her.

A few months ago she actually stayed at a clinic for about a week and she finally opened up about her struggles, but not in much detail. She's slowly and steadily getting to a place where she can talk about her mental health with me and her other friends.

I'm just trying to be there for her even though I'm very depressed myself. But I feel like no matter what I do, it won't change anything in the long run.
My advice is straight up ignored and all the positive things I tell her are forgotten, her mindset is just too negative. And I know that it's not her fault at all.
But it's just so discouraging to witness all the progress she makes be nullified immediately after.
And I feel so selfish for saying this since our other friends are so supportive and always seem so positive. I don't have the courage to bring up my worries because it would make me seem like I don't understand.

Seeing the scars on her arms, hearing her hyperventilating and seeing her teary eyes just hurts me so much. But how can I bring that up without overstepping boundaries?

Another thing is, she has a huge crush on her co-worker who is 10 years older than her. She gets so excited over basic human interactions and tells us all about it. The thing is, that age gap is very significant since we are in our teens.
My friend seems to be really emotional at the moment. She feels like she doesn't have a chance with her co-worker but at the same time she can't stop thinking about her and probably won't give up. But she won't ask her out either, which is very understandable.
I don't know whether I should get her hopes up or tell her to give it up. Both options would end up hurting her.

I'm very careful around her in general. There are some things and topics I can't talk to her about. I don't want to hurt her."

1339,"Hearing voices in my head but they are extremely weird, what is happening?","For a long time I’ve always heard voices in my head but it’s like those crowd ambience videos you can find on YouTube. It’s so loud and there’s so much going on at once and it makes no sense. A lot of it I can’t make out, but sometimes it’s audio from things like video games I’ve played a lot that day or a movie I’ve watched. Sometimes the voices are very distorted or just random words, but sometimes the sentences almost make sense or make sense if the context has nothing to do with me. Like one sentence could be “did you water them?” I have no idea what that is referring to. Another sentence could be “the mouse trap really ate all the schools paper, didn’t I?” It doesn’t make sense but it’s almost a regular sentence, it’s not like “plant bark going places,” which is just a jumble of words. Sometimes I’ll hear screams, scary noises, random noises, etc. Those only tend to happen more when I’m stressed out though. They’re sometimes hard to “hear” with all the other voices in my head and I very very very very very rarely hear a voice in my head that sounds like it came from outside my head and is extremely clear. I know this has happened more than once but I only remember one instance where I heard a boy yell in my head, “do you need help?” And I jolted uptight. I was trying to sleep at the time. It hear it more when I’m trying to sleep or when I first wake up and it drives me crazy because it’s this constant noise and I can’t fall back asleep always because of it. I can’t always fall asleep at night either because of it. It’s hard to meditate too, any time I don’t have sound as a distraction I hear everything. What is this?"
1340,How do you get through life when you have been neglected and unloved by your parents?,"Warning: I will be vaguely discussing toxic situations and painful experiences. If you want to skip these, you can start by the 4th paragraph. I’m sorry if I sound so disoriented I am really in pain and I need help. 
I’m not asking for resources in my region; I know a lot of them but due to the pandemic they are booked. Besides, talking about toxic parents is taboo in my country. 

[TLDR: My parents do not love me, and it is a hard pill to swallow time and time again. Despite this, I want to come into terms with it so I can live better and stop feeling this immense pain. Please help, what can I do about it?]

I need help. I have been struggling time and time again because of two horrible people — my boomer parents. I often find myself praying to God to take me so my suffering could end. I often idealize self harm because I do not want to be in this house anymore with them. 

I love them but they don’t love me. They would often get my (22) name wrong with my older sister (32) and often hang out with her than me (we live in the same house). They waited till I was in my 20s, graduated from college, before they would give me my own space in the house THAT IS if I had not fought for it. They don’t tell me anything regarding the house, or even talk to me about my life. They will just dictate what I should do with it. When I confessed my mental problems they keep dismissing me. 

I am a good student; I passed on the top uni in my country and I’m on my way to law, as per their wishes. At first I was really against law because it was being forced on me. But then I worked hard to pass that exam to get in so I could use law to get me out of my situation — so I could live peacefully on my own. But then this pandemic hit and law is about to start and I’m still in this house. I cannot take it anymore. 

I am feeling this intense abhorrence towards them: for giving me life when they will just neglect me, or force me to do things in my life; for never being there; for never listening and respecting how I feel; and a lot more. 

My chest hurts so bad while I’m crying because that’s how much pain and suffering I’m experiencing. It’s such a hard thing to talk about because people often think they should love their parents. But I’m having a hard time fully loving them because I know by their actions and their words that they do not love me. I am just a waste of life brought onto them when they were in their 40s.

I want to tell them how bad of a parent — of a person they are. I keep hoping that they see how badly they have treated me. Now I am forever damned to be alone because of them. I can’t get friends or significant others because of the damage they did to me.

Nonetheless, I am hopeful that I can get through this but I would like to accept it first. So I am humbly asking if anyone knows ways or coping mechanisms to get through this damage and hatred? Please."

1342,Quotes To Get You Through The Day,"Hi, hello, hey! 

How are you? Apologies for not posting yesterday, I was extremely busy and before I knew it, the day was over. So, today, I will post some motivation and inspirational quotes that’ll hopefully get you through the day. Also, remember, my PM’s are open if you’re in need of a talk. God bless you. :)

- To that one soul reading this, I know you’re tired, you’re fed up, you’re so close to breaking but there’s strength within you even when you feel weak. Keep fighting.
- My dark days made me stronger. Or, maybe I already was strong, and they made me prove it. 
- It’s okay to not be perfect, it’s okay to make mistakes, it’s okay to do something that you hadn’t done, because if we don’t do those things, we never grow. 
- And if today, all you did was hold yourself together, I’m proud of you. 
- You’ll have good days, you’ll have bad days, overwhelming days, tired days, I can’t go on days, I’m awesome days. And everyday you’ll still show up.
- Isn’t that brave of you, to silence the voice inside your head, that yells and doubts your worth.
- Choose, everyday to forgive yourself. You are human, flawed and most of all, worthy of love. 

Thank you all for reading. Keep fighting and keep pushing yourself to thrive. Have a wonderful day! :)"
1343,I need advice,Im a 17yo male who is suffering from severe depression and anxiety and its destroying me ive been on so many pills that do nothing or make me worse. Some days everytime I close my eyes i see myself committing suicide and only 2 of my friends know about it but I feel like they hate me and now I'm pushing them away I just don't know what to do any more
1344,Afraid To Breath Other People's Air,"Hey there. My name is Lynnsey and for the past 5-6 years I've been crippled due to my ridicilous fear of breathing others air they exhale. I'm not scared to get sick or that they smell bad- I'm just terrified their air will be trapped in my lungs. It has gotten to a point I developed a tic. I was wondering if anyone else struggles with that. I have started a FB group so I know I'm not alone and people have a place to go to talk about it. Please join if you do have it, I want use to find a cure, diagnoses, symptoms, anything together.

1345,is it wrong to not always comfort my partner when he’s upset,"we are both mentally ill, and a lot of the time he is dependent on me but sometimes I need to talk to him about issues that he needs to work on fixing and he just gets upset, which is one of the issues (i.e. you need to stop getting upset whenever I talk to you about things you need to work on) and it’s just frustrating because I feel like a mother rather than a partner sometimes. i just don’t know what to do bc we live together and it’s hard for me to work on my mental health when he hardly bothers with his"
1346,I finally stepped out of the house after five months of quarantine.,"I went to the mall and bought some ""self-care"" items, ate at my favorite restaurant, and got a hair cut. I had a nice day though I'm still coping with the new normal."
1347,(possible trigger warning) Some of my worst anxieties turned out to be true and I don't know what to do,"I think most of the people here struggle with the 'what if my friends secretly hate me' thoughts. Well, I guess you know where this is going.  
 About a year ago my life turned for the worse. I don't want to get into details but let's just say that in the span of a year I got broken up with after a serious relationship, all my friends slowly left me and also told me that they actually didn't want to be friends with me for about two years now and that they just stayed around because they felt sorry for me, the one person out of that group that didn't betray me is still friends with them as well and I really don't want to talk to him anymore because it reminds me of them but I'd feel bad if I pushed away the one person that stayed. I was left with the total of three friends, but one of them is the one I don't really want to talk to after everything that happened, the other one is in love with me and turned full on nice guy mode on me and is pushing me into a relationship after I've told him that I'm not interested several times and the last one has been my best friend the whole time, so I guess I'm left with one true friend but I don't want to push him away too by being overwhelming. 

That's not all that happened, there's more but I don't want to get into it all. But after all that happened in this last year I just can't bring myself to trust people, to trust anyone except for that one friend who's always been there for me. I'm alone and sometimes I feel lonely but then I push people away and I wanna be left alone but at the same time I need someone to be my friend, someone to talk to.

I don't even know what this all about. I'm so hurt that the people who I've considered best friends weren't actually my friends at all. I feel like I can't trust anyone after this. I can't bring myself to feel anything, I'm just emotionally numb and empty and... I just don't know what to do.  All I really want is someone to hug me and let me cry in silence.

I... I can't even put my feelings into words properly. I don't know how to describe anything at all."
1348,Can’t get anything for my boyfriends birthday and I feel like shit.,✌🏼
1349,I think sleep deprivation is making me mentally ill...,"I've had sleeping problems my entire life, and also very terrible depression. 

When I was kid, I had a fear of dying in my sleep so I never slept. I would be up until 3AM everyday, go to school, and just run on like 3 hours of sleep each night.

While I outgrew that fear, I still as a young adult fight my sleep- just out of habit.

I have a feeling this is where a lot of my mental turmoil is coming from. I recently had a week during which I slept normally- and I felt normal for the first time in so long. I was able to make decisions, avoid mental breakdowns, didn't feel a huge sense of despair. 

But that lasted a week and now I'm back on my bs. I won't even let myself nap or sleep in because I feel I'm not being productive. I just push through. Go to bed at 3, wake up at 6 and go about my whole day.

I don't know how to fix it. I have begun taking melatonin, but I even fight that. I will get so drowsy and just won't let myself sleep. 

Wish I knew how to fix this problem. I want to heal and feel normal again."
1350,I wish I could wipe my own memory of all of the toxic people who left my life,"I wish I could forget their faces and who they were, and only remember the lessons I learned from dealing with them.

I hate that I still remember them."
1351,ADD or laziness?," I'm exhausted. My psychologist told me that I have ADD and I honestly don't know if that's what's making my life so difficult or if I'm being dramatic and using it as an excuse for problems that I cause for myself. I'm late for school almost every day (three minutes or so every time) because I lose track of time when I'm getting ready, no matter how early I wake up. I also procrastinate a lot and right now I should be doing my Finnish assignment but I haven't even started. I feel like I don't have any free time because I think about my school assignments all the time but can't bring myself to actually do them until the last minute. During the school week I only sleep for about an hour every night because once again, I don't know how to start getting ready for bed until it's 4:30 AM. I feel like I'm not even alive at this point. 

Is it ADD or just laziness?  Also, any advice on how to stop procrastinating or not being late?"
1352,I don't make sense.,"   Nothing makes sense, ***I*** don't make sense. I mean, really. The more I think about it the weirder and fucked it gets. I don't even know when it all started, probably when I was around 9 years old, which is like 7 years ago considering I'm turning 16 this year. That time I used to think that mental illness was cool. I mean, not that kind of cool, but as in ""people with mental illness is so admirable and cute, I wish they suffer forever so I can keep watching and fantasize about them"" or smth. It's creepy, yeah, and I liked being creepy. I was pretty sadistic and insensitive back then. I'd only read, watch, and stuff if the main character in said story were to suffer. That includes gore videos and photos I found online. I thought to myself ""damn, I'm so fcked up."" And honestly I thought it all would stop there, but no. I didn't realize it back then, but overtime, I've slowly became jealous. Although I didn't want to admit it, I wanted to be like them. I wanted to have it, to have an illness.

   Then I turned 12, which is like the peak of chaos for most people, or me atleast. I started becoming more and more obsessed with this whole ""I want to become ill"" thingy. I'd spend my free time to read about psychology stuff and fantasize having them. I'd purposefully fuck myself over then pretend that I have problems (eg : intentionally making shameful mistakes in front of the whole class, then forcing myself to think about it again and again until I couldn't even sleep, or intentionally and impulsively cutting off friends from my life so I don't have anyone to share problems with). I had even almost committed murder, just so that I could feel the guilt of killing my own best friend and blame myself over it. Point is, it was a bad time, and unfortunately, it might have worked. I said ""might"", because, the worst part of all this shit is, It's gotten so out of hand that I couldn't even tell if I'm pretending or if I do actually have problems anymore. I don't know if I actually really want to die or if I wanted to feel like I want to die, I don't know if I really do feel anxious and panicky or if I'm just pretending to be anxious, and stuff. I really can't but doubt myself. ""Am I really sick, or am I just a bitch who wanted to burn in hell for my own amusement?"".

   It's addicting. Hurting myself and breaking myself down is addicting. I wish for nothing but to get broken and sent to hell for eternity. I don't know why, but it's just like that. It hurts, I want to scream, I want to cry, but that's it. I don't want to be helped. I told my problems to people and seeing their worry, saddened face drives me crazy, it makes me feel even more guilty and suicidal, but when they tried to help me, I look away and pretended I never heard that. I showed and told my parents about my suicide attempt, and their saddened worried face makes me sick to the bottom of my stomach, but I just want more. I want more of it, more of that guilt. I kept telling myself, ""this people are liars! they will manipulate you, and your life is fucked, and you can't do anything about it."" even though I know damn well that everyone's just trying to help. I don't know, I just liked seeing myself suffer more and more. It's unbearable enough already, but I still want to suffer even more. I really can't wait and am looking forward to how much more pain will I experience in the future. I hate it, I hate everything about this, I just want everything to stop, but I kept doing it, and I'm at loss for words, because nothing makes sense anymore. Do I want to suffer or not? I don't fucking know. It doesn't make any fucking sense, goddamnit.

 I don't make any single fucking sense."
1353,I need advice,[removed]
1354,I feel like a robot in a fucking container,"Now I must clarify that this is unrelated to quarantine, my life has in fact been this way forever. I have no friends, and nowhere to go, it's a small town so I can't go anywhere like a club or a bar, plus I'm not old enough to. I have stayed within the small area of my room for as long as I can remember and it is finally driving me insane. I have no social skills, no place to go other than the gym or my classes. The youtube recommendation algorithm has me convinced that there is absolutely nothing more than the 10 videos it recommends me. So right now life is consistent, wake up, go to school, go to the gym, come home, sit perfectly still in a chair for 14 hours because there is not jack shit to do, I would love to learn how to drive a car but id practically have to steal one to get some experience, I wish I was taught social skills and how to drive and stuff when I was younger. if I was taught these things I wouldn't have ever been stuck in this place that my parents clutter up to a ridiculous level, I want to leave, I want to become a success, I want to be a big shot that can just toss it in my parent's face and say ""I made it without yall""  
I'm tired of being alone.  
I'm tired of this isolation."
1355,Help with mania,"I am in the uk, are there any otc medications for mania?"
1356,I'm so fckn toxic.,"I liked mentally ill people. I loved them so much, as in ""I love how they suffer and I hope it'll never stop"". I often get jealous of them. I've always wanted to become like them. I've attempted suicide several times to get an idea how it feels like to be suicidal. And I couldn't get enough. I want more of it. I want people to hate me and kill me. I hope some day I'll be shamed and break. I want to break. I'm so toxic, to everyone including myself. I hate it, so much that I like it. I'm looking forward to experience all the pain I'll hopefully be getting in the future. I hope this never stops. I love this. I think."
1357,I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me.,"I’ve always dealt with major depression but lately my mood swings are crazy. I’m on 100mg of Zoloft, which doesn’t really do anything now. One second I’m okay and the next I feel like bawling my eyes out or i get extremely angry at tiny things. I go through times where I’m super depressed, but I couldn’t think of anytime I’d consider myself having a manic episode. Now all of the sudden, I’m getting the urge to delete all of my social media accounts and just cut everyone off. I’m not sure that would count as anything, but the same urge came about a month ago too. I generally hate being sober because I constantly don’t feel right so I smoke a lot and have been drinking more these past two weeks. I’m aware of Bipolar Disorder, I’m just not sure if any of this would actually count."
1358,"Has anyone else noticed that some people who face mental health problems of their own tend to be the most eager to help others, at the expense of their own well-being?","Got on this thread because I started to notice that my friends who deal with diagnosed mental health illnesses, from depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder have literally all gone into social work. Also, I’ve noticed that they tend to offer help (too much help, even if I don’t indicate any need for help) while avoiding/burying their own issues, when it would be in their best benefit to address what is on their plate (not limited to their mental health) rather than attempting to be overly involved in what is on mine. I consider myself to have become emotionally stronger due to COVID-19 and therapy, and know when to reach out if I need help. I just get baffled when I’m overstimulated with help that I never ask for while simultaneously knowing that my peers are going through a lot. Altruism is admirable, but I hate to see it come at a cost with my friends avoiding their own growth, progress, and responsibilities.

This post is not meant to insult or generalize this community whatsoever, but I wanted to see if anyone has made a similar observation."
1359,Ways to deal with bad intrusive thoughts??,I have intrusive thoughts almost everyday and they can be very troubling has anyone found a techniques that helps with them?
1360,"Bad mental day TW:sexual assault, pedophilia","Today I remembered my ex and the horrible shit he's done, it's been a while so it's weird but I'm so angry, he groped me multiple times, people seen it, I wasn't believed, his ex friends Texted me about the underage girls he slept with, one as young as 14 (he was 18), I snapped and dragged him publicly without using his name, made it obvious who he was, I wasn't believed again, I was shut out, I had a break down, went to therapy got put on antidepressants which I'm still on, Im so fvkin angry he's walking around doing what he pleases with no consequences and everyone expects me to just be cool about it , I'm not I'm so pissed, people ik still speak to him and are friends with him, nothing will ever change"
1361,I told my parents I need to see a doctor for my mental health today,Idk if this is a good idea or bad one. They were understanding. I don't want them to suffer because of me and I have decided I need help.
1362,am I a JOKE TO U😐????? lol jk jk,"
Guys I didn’t know September was Suicide Awareness Month... I legit started September with suicidal thoughts LMAOOOO THE IRONY... Same people posting about how to spot a friend with suicidal thoughts are the same people that can’t spot it in their friend AHAHAHA oh how ironic.. anyways I’m good now just thought it was funny



also I see a lot of my friends or mutuals posting stuff like “how to spot if your friend is depressed” “what to do if your friend is anxious” and I’m just sitting there like...😐👈🏾👈🏾👈🏾????? I’m good at hiding it tho... but I just find it SO IRONIC"
1363,I feel so alone despite having friends.,"Recently, I had a falling out with this guy I was talking to. He was my best friend, and....he was there for me. He gave me support, encouragement, attention, love, etc. However, he decided to go back to his ex and now I’m struggling mentally. I thought my friends would be here for me but it just seems like they want to know the latest drama. No one is actually here for me. I’m going through a difficult time. I’m crying a lot, I’m being triggered a lot, I’m barely keeping up with my hygiene, and I’m genuinely struggling. I have no one to really vent to, and even if I do vent, they just won’t get it. They’ll tell me things like, “it’ll get better” &amp; “look at this as a learning experience” but they’re not actually listening to me or asking to see if I’m okay. 

In the past, I’ve been everyone’s therapist, friend, supporter, etc. And here I am at my lowest, and my “friends” aren’t actually friends. I used to be really close to my friend Freddy, but he hasn’t even once reached out despite me texting him about the falling out. I told my friend Karen, and she barely reaches out. I told my friend Greg, but he just... thinks so logically and... it’s hard for him to relate. 

And I just sit here and stare at the wall for a while because I keep thinking about how much I missed that guy. He was there for me, listened to me, and actually cared. And I lost him. And I have no one. My family is fucking toxic, my mom’s a narcissist. And I feel like I really don’t have anyone to talk to. Like no one really understands. And I’m genuinely struggling."
1364,I don't know what is wrong with me today!!,"This is a good post people. :D  


I feel so much love towards all the people posting today and I truly feel empathy and sympathy for all of you. I just might be in a kick-ass mood because (and please don't take this as bragging) but we had gotten so much food stamp money this month that we actually bought filet mignon for us. This is such a rare occurrence that I was excited all the way home from the supermarket! I have only had filet mignon a handful of times at restaurants...never made it at home. So wish me luck lol. Thank goodness for Chef Ramsay! I had to look up how he makes it so I would know. Heh.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, that is not the point of this post. I just feel so danged happy today for some odd reason. Maybe it is also because the sun is shining and it is just warm enough to wear shorts. Fall is coming here, and coming fast. The leaves are already showing signs of changing and Halloween stuff is already out in the stores. We just moved to a new area, so I am excited to go Halloweening with our youngest, which I haven't done for years because it was just too strenuous for me. I have severe anemia, which means I don't have enough iron in my blood to properly carry oxygen to my body, which, in turn, means that I get exhausted and out of breath very easily. I can't walk much, and even a trip to the supermarket is a challenge a lot of the time. :( I feel good and strong today though, and, even though I don't normally eat red meat, I am looking forward to having the steak and potatoes and a veggie (we have corn on the cob!!) tonight. The meat will boost my iron again. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I hear my dear husband watching ""Mary Poppins"" in the other room and I hear birds outside chirping away in the trees. It is just a nice Saturday here--Labor Day Weekend. We might go up to the State Park for a picnic with the family on Monday. Oh, speaking of birds, I bought myself a 4th parakeet! Its name is Nanners (it is yellow and a bit of brownish-gray) and believe it or not, I have it hand-tamed already after one day! It kind of flew into the fly-paper trap thing and I had to bathe it gently with vegetable oil and then mild soap (looked it up) and then I kept it warm and calm for a while before letting it go back with its cage-mates. It is acting perfectly normal now and is eating and drinking and pooping fine. Whew. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take care all my friends. I am going to go and fantasize about this steak dinner we are having. This is such a rare luxury for us! We almost never have such a meal...our meals are mostly casseroles and leftover pot-lucks. :D Wish me luck!!!"

1366,Ask for being declared work invalid or wait even more for a job that fits my mental healt needs,"So, rn I am 28.  
Finished highschool and decidaded to take some time to enjoy life. Ended up spending 2 or 3 years doing drugs and going to raves every chance I got. Finally decided to get a job at a factory, very stressful, started having a anxiety problem where I would constantly feel the URGE to pee. Go to doctor, prescribed anti-stress medicadition and 2 weeks of work to see how I would react. Still was in trial period at the factory and got fired. 1 or 2 years later decided to go take a 2 year course at a university in my small city. Final semester was an intership. Started to have this kind of attacks where I couldn't concentrate, barely read and barely talk, where thoughts would repeat endlessly in my mind. Go to doctor ""don't pay attention to them, you don't have anything"". Go to terapist, 2 years go by and the ""attacks"" are more frequent and much more intense. One day I wake up and intantly get one, to the point that I ask my mother for help to go to the hospital. Undress my sleeping clothes and then was unable to think what to do next (how to pick up clothes and dress myself). Finally dessed, I go to the hospital with my mother. When I get to the doctors office I can't talk at all, so my mother tries to explain as best as she could what was going on with me. Get diagnosed with paranoia and thought echo/rumination, both part of schizophrenia. Start to take 8 pills a day to try and control it. To this day I still have this ""attacks"", some times they are easyer to deal with and I can still do simple stuff, some times they hit me so hard that I think of suicide. During the last few years I had a couple of jobs, but none longer than 2 weeks. My grandfather only became aware of this condition of mine recently and told my mother that maybe I would qualify to welfare for maybe being considered work invalid. The monthly welfare for invalids depends on a number of factors, and is almost always less than minimum wage. But being unemployed, or having a job for 2 week in god knows how long is worse than receiving less than minimum wage, atleast I would have my own money for my stuff instead of being totally dependent on my mother for everything.  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you ever been in the same position as me?

Sorry for the long ass text."
1367,Life sucks but my boyfriend make it worth it,"Life really tends to be a pain in the ass since I was born

Family sucks, I would get beaten up/ yelled at for nothing

But I found my half, who drove an hour just to be with me

And I learned life is worth living when you find someone who appreciate the fact that you're alive

Stay strong, one day you'll find someone that will make you feel that it's okay to be in pain

Today I feel loved, and that's priceless"
1368,suicidal intrusive thoughts,"It's been a rough year for me (18F). went through my fair bit of trauma, repeatedly. The last few days I've been overwhelmed with so much work, university and I'm packing to fly home as well. It's been a mess, because ya know, covid-19. I don't know why but I've been horrified of feeling vulnerable, the thought of depending on someone terrifies me. I think of myself as a massive burden on my parents, on my friends. I feel like im always asking for help and I never reciprocate. I've been getting these suicidal intrusive thoughts, about how much better my parents would be without me, especially financially and they can start taking care of my brother. saving up for him. I started smoking again after a few months off and I'm a borderline alcoholic now so I've been spending most of my money on cigarettes and alcohol (almost a bottle of vodka every 2 nights). It's been a massive waste of money. I cannot stop thinking about how better it would feel to just, kill myself. I can't see myself getting better. I'm stuck in a toxic cycle where I keep convincing myself that happiness is a fraud. 

Of course I know how devastating my family would be if I committed suicide, it would break them apart. I'm holding together and lately it's getting so much harder to do so."
1369,I’m talentless and life feels like a burden,"I’ve recently realized how talentless I am.  I’m can’t do anything whether that be working out properly or trying to have fun playing games.  I also have trouble finding motivation to do stuff.  A combination of lack of will and lack of talent has made me angry at myself.  I don’t like living, it feels like a burden.  I repeat the same routine for this body that I hate so much.  I don’t like my family that much, that doesn’t mean I hate them or they’re shitty, I just don’t like them.  The only times I find happiness are when I hang out with this one female friend of mine and do stuff together.  But it seems like my shitty mood and shitty personality is making me feel like a burden to her.  I’m a teenager and I don’t wanna tell my parents as they would make the situation worse.  I feel like ending it would be easier to do but I don’t have the balls to do it.  I don’t think I’m depressed, just mad and sad at my reality.  Can someone please give me advice on wtf I should do."
1370,Just a question,"So I don’t really plan on being active on here, this is a throwaway account because my phone is broken and I don’t remember my password but I just had to ask this. Context: my whole life my living conditions have sucked, I was born in a crappy neighborhood in Havana,Cuba (yk gangs, drugs and the diy guns every once in a while) and in between there and living in the u.s I’ve seen people get stabbed,shot,robbed to the point it doesn’t really affect me, not Bc I’ve lost compassion it’s Bc that’s how normal it became in my living conditions. So as a result of that a d multiple near death experiences I’m really anxious and always paranoid and always have dark scary thoughts for a few days until I’m happy again. I never tell my doctors this because I always think I can handle it myself, so I’ve never been diagnosed with depression, anxiety,ptsd or whatever else I might have despite all my Symptoms (I tried to not go into too much detail but feel free to ask me questions) so I came here because it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deal w these things myself and I wanna talk to a doctor but I don’t want to do it Bc I don’t wanna be a “weirdo” for having to take medication or anything like that for it especially in a city like the one I live in that’s really judgmental. What should I do?

Tl:dr grew up around violence as drugs so I’m anxious and paranoid now and always feel like someone is trying to set me up and idk if I should talk to a doctor."
1371,Why do I get unreasonably agitated from weird little things?,"Hey guys,  
Another redditor suggested I post this here, so here we go.  
I'm not entirely sure how to word this because it's such a bizarre thing that I don't fully understand it myself.  
I've had this thing throughout my life when someone makes a noise, touches me in a certain way, etc. and I instantly get this sensation, a sort of tension like feeling all over my body, me mind catches on fire and I either want to scream, or cry, or just fucking destroy something to alleviate 'the pain'. Let me elaborate.  
My husband often comes to my desk when I'm working and massages my shoulders a little because I deal with pain a lot. Then other times, he comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, gently squeezes me shoulder, like BARELY and stops. And my mind is FUCKED. I'm seeing red. I'm ready to kill. I'm in physical pain and mental pain. I want to scream. This lasts for hours, I can't concentrate, it absolutely fucks me up.  
Some nights he gives me a kiss before going to bed if I'm staying up late. He does this thing where his lips barely touch mine and wow, again, I'm fucked. The sensation of the skin barely touching is so triggering, I'm almost crying just thinking about it.  
Same thing with my mother. This used to be a problem when I was much younger and living with my parents. At mealtime, she would do these weird mouth noises and I would lose it.  
Often times I would start crying and clench my fists so hard my nails broke the skin and I bled. It would ruin my day, I absolutely couldn't think of anything else for hours, it interfered with my ability to concentrate in school.

Or my brother used to have this stupid habit when he was little, he would repeat a word again and again ALL DAY. Even several days. This would set me off so bad that I would get physical.

I know these things sound very unreasonable and stupid. I'm painfully aware of this. What is this and why am I having such irrational feelings to random things?  
I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit for it."
1372,How do I not feel bad for my friends when I'm suicidal? (TW: suicide),"I had a really bad night last night and was gonna kill myself. I wrote my note and texted a friend how much I cared about her and then she called me a few times and I picked up after the fourth time or so. She really helped me out. I'm worried what would have happened if I didn't pick up, but I also feel ridiculously bad for worrying her. I know it was probably really scary for her. I just need some advice on how to accept that she will worry and it's not my job to fix that. All help appreciated.

1375,What Comes Next? PTSD Recovery,"I have ptsd due to an abusive father. Have been diagnosed with it since I was 20 and now I'm 22. I feel like the worst is behind me and I'm truly living now. I live with my mom and bf who are the most supportive and loving people. And I have a couple of great friends. 
I'm trying my absolute best to recover but I know things like this take time. 
I have taken the biggest step I think I can take, which is to forgive my father for what he did to me and my family. As I've spoken to many people he was most likely mentally ill as well but since he was very narcissistic he would not take any advice from anyone.
I have stopped all contact with him years ago, but as I reflect I think something was wrong with him that I could not fix and that what happened was not my fault (it took my a very long time to come to terms with this). 
But with forgiving comes forgetting..
And well my PTSD makes that very, very hard. 
I am constantly scared of noises, soft or loud. I get startled really easily. Nightmares every single time I sleep, even if it's an hour nap. I dissociate constantly and miss moments in the day. Paranoia every time I leave the house even if I'm just on my front porch or checking the mailbox..
I want to overcome this. 
I want to live my life without constantly being in fear.
Will this ever go away fully?
Are there some at home treatment that I can do?
Do you have any experience with PTSD?

Thank you in advance for your responses~"

Is there another class of medicine to help not caring about anything besides (ssri)? I saw on discharge papers from hospital, they think I should see a nuero psychologist.

I can't think, I have memory problems, I can't complete simple task and alot of times I don't recognize my family members or where I'm at. That's why I don't like going out and driving. Im going to start bringing sticky notes with me. When I went to the hospital a couple times, I had to keep asking where I was because I couldn't remember.

I don't want anything sedating I have bad sleep apnea and heart problems. I know there are experimental drugs that people do for depression, like ketamine. That would literally kill me, I don't ever want to try that. What other class of medicine are out there? I can't handle sedative especially anything that's respiratory depressant because my lung and breathing problems. And I can't handle anything that's to much of a stimulant because heart problems.

Please don't tell me I need serious help, I know this. But I don't have insurance and money right now.

I start to feel like ''aware'' of everything around me and in me, its really scary. Anything gets me off guard.

1387,A toxic family member and the impact on my mental health.,"Imagine, being 25 years old, in a big family where only one of your family members is a consistently toxic person.
That’s the case with me and my family. Ever since I can remember I was never happy in my childhood, my parents worked a lot so we didn’t really get to spend time with them unless we were on holiday in Florida, US. Even when we were there, there was always some kind of argument going on about something trivial. 
I was in the hospital a lot when I was a child because of my health conditions. I had heart surgery and was diagnosed with asthma from a very young age, too young to remember so I only remember being in hospital all the time. From a young age I was never happy being left to one of my sisters who we will name as D. D was never nice to us, we were always looking over our shoulders in case D would attack, either verbally or physically with us, especially towards myself and my younger sister, A. D would always shout at us for the smallest of things, she would smack, push and pinch us if she was angry at something, we were always the target for her. I remember being age 12 or possibly younger, D had run away, left me and my youngest sister A alone one the home and we awoke to find that we were alone, D had escaped through a window and we had no idea where D had gone. Me and A were worried so we called our mum, who then had to leave work, and call the police to help search for D, this happened more than once. There was another occasion where D had her friend round and drank the entire liquor cabinet and had vomited endlessly, woke me and A up through the night, and forcing me and A to clean up, A wasn’t even 10 years old yet, D was about 16/17 I believe at the time. If we ever refused to do anything D would shout at us or hurt us in some way so we had no choice. We were always bullied by D. This type of bullying and abuse carried on even more so after my father passed away when I was 14, a high school kid, already being bullied by my classmates and then got it when I got home from my sister, D. I don’t have a happy memory with D, she was never there or she was out drinking all the time. Refused to do anything and used us as slaves. Forced us to clean up her messes even when we got back from school. When I say me and A, it was only us that got the worst treatment from D because we were the youngest. D’s treatment of us has had a nasty and negative impact on my mental health to the point I don’t have a lot of trust for people, I don’t have a lot of friends and I’m quite reserved most of the time. I was abused by a friend of the family when I was 8 years old and I put that to the back of my head, only for the memory and the trauma to resurface when I was 24 years old when I saw something that triggered that memory to return, I was also sexually assaulted at work on shift last November 2019 and I never got offered help for my trauma. I have battled prescription drug addiction for the last remaining years of my teenage years, from age 17 to somewhere in my early 20s and I have been sober for 3+ years. I don’t remember the exact date I went sober. I used drugs to suppress my emotions and I tried to numb whatever it was that needed numbing. When I was 15 I was sexually abused and I never trusted anyone until I met my husband, and we’ve been together for 8 years. I have depression, anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder. All of which stem from the abuse myself and my sister A suffered at the hands of D, my trauma from when I was 8 years old, the loss of my father at age 14 and the drug addiction road I was on at age 17 after I attempted suicide at age 14, age 18 and age 24. In terms of D, we have never had a good sisterly relationship because she has never taken accountability for her actions to me and my sister, A. She has caused chaos in my family and battled my mum into oblivion by blaming her for her own issues and how my mum was horrible. D has always sought out men to make her happy. She got married and divorced before she’s 30, she’s 28. D has a habit of disappearing for months on end but will call my mother to pick her up when she’s been dumped by a man we’ve never met or if we did, he’s gone within a few months to a year. When D is back in our lives, there is always some kind of drama that occurs and the same outcome will always the same: D blames my mum for her issues. And D will go away again and we won’t hear anything from D unless she’s got a new boyfriend, will meet the new man and that’ll be it until the next storm arrives and D is back again. Whenever I’ve tried to help D, it’s the same thing- “mum said this, mum said that blah blah blah” and she won’t listen to me. The amount of time myself and the rest of my sisters have had to deal with D and her issues is unreal. “D is back at mums again, D is with a new guy, D is back at mums again and D has left again and left all her stuff once again. D has said this about you and D thinks this about you” and the list goes on. I wrote an 18 page letter (FRONT AND BACK) to D detailing and telling her about the abuse and bullying she put me and my sister A through, all the arguments and the way D treats my mum and how D needs to get some help, take accountability for her actions.... she hasn’t and she continues to be a problem in this family. I have disowned her completely because it’s everyone else’s problem, not hers according to her anyway. I let D stay with me and my husband only for her to bring her drama to my house, big mistake. She stayed my sisters house, never paid rent and was going between men like it was a pass the parcel at Christmas time, she threatened to call social services (cps) on my sister a few weeks/months after giving birth to her child because D is dramatic and will do anything for attention because she’s a bully. My niece is absolutely amazing, very smart and is loved incredibly by us and her mum. D has faked miscarriages on more than one occasion and is apparently pregnant now but is currently out going to different bars drinking.... if you’re pregnant, stay away from the alcohol. The last time I told D to go back on her antidepressant medication, she does and then goes off them again, because you can’t drink alcohol with antidepressants, alcohol is a depressant.... D has never had a place of her own, she sponges off of men who have no idea who she is until she blows up, verbally abuses them and she either leaves them or they dump her when they figure out what she’s like. This is what happens when D brings her drama back to our family, she’ll blame my mum when she’s called out on her problems and D will flip it onto either me, my mum or someone else in my family. Most recently, as of yesterday, September 4th 2020 I got a message from D asking me to be there for her, before I get a chance to respond she’s blocked me, she’s sent the most disgusting messages to my mother as usual and to my sister, A. I responded to D through my mums phone as D is blocked on mine now, she has no way of contacting me. I told her the truth, she uses people, she only contacts you when drama is happening and she won’t contact you again unless she wants something. That’s the way it’s always been. I don’t know who she is anymore and I don’t care. This is just my way of venting and hoping someone else can relate to me on some level if they have this problem with a sibling.... I have gone through years of therapy to help get myself back on my feet. I have a mental health professional and the support system I need. There is so much more that D has done to me but we will never get off of this app. I hope that whoever reads this, you’re okay and you’re not alone."

Hey, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this; 

Recently me and a flatmate of mine have come across videos online talking about D.I.D ( Dissociative identity disorder) and after discussion with my flatmate about it all, we got onto the topic of internal voice or so and at this point I already knew that I can't really picture things in my mind, I can sort of see like vauge shapes and very faintly colours but picturing something mentally doesn't really work for me. But then I sort of realised that I don't think I really have an internal voice either. It's hard to describe but my thoughts feel like forced? And as if they take active effort to sort of conceptualise? There's no version of my voice in my head sort off doing things, it just sort of happens? 

It's really frustrating and vauge to explain and to try and describe it and ever since thinking about it, I have sort of felt Dissociated from my body to some slight extent, like detached and not totally their with my extremities feeling strange. 


I was really wondering if this is normal or should I seek help from someone or if anyone at all has anything like this, it scares me quite a bit thinking about it, frequently getting my upset for no real reason and any sort of help would be greatly appreciated. I’ll respond to any questions if it helps clarify"
1399,I don't know what's wrong with me and why I feel the way I do,"I [21M] have been going through some stuff recently, and have been taking a real look at my mental health and what I feel. My first thought is that I might have depression, but the more that I read about depression the less it really lines up with what I'm experiencing. I don't have any urge to hurt myself or commit suicide, and I wouldn't say that it's something that constantly weighs on me. However, usually something triggers it for me and I'll go through periods of severe distrust and anger towards people that I think I know should be there for me. During this time I'll also hate myself, have panic attacks (difficulty breathing, shaking, heart racing, headaches), and find myself talking to myself without realizing it. I get so bored but I just can't get myself to get out of bed.

My point is that for depression it sounds like your outlook is generally that people shouldn't care about you. For me, I feel like I can't trust anyone, I desperately want to trust and feel accepted, and I wonder what is wrong with me that I can't be accepted and why it feels like even my closest friends are trying to hurt me. These feelings aren't exactly continuous; I do think I feel an overall sense of distrust and self loathing at all times but it's very slight and doesn't really affect me. But when I have these episodes these feelings explode and take over to the point where even though the one thing I want is to be accepted and asked what's wrong, I can't trust anyone and in most cases hate the people who would ask me that.

This time, it was triggered by my girlfriend coming back to live with our friends and I. I asked her out before spring break, not realizing that quarantine would happen, and then was forced to stay in my hometown and I didn't see her for months and months until a few days ago. We did an okay job of staying close but over time it just got really hard and I was having these episodes very frequently. Without her being there to defend herself I started to believe that she hated me and wanted to hurt me or that she was cheating on me. Once they ended, I'd feel normal and miss her but I'd also feel incredibly awkward because during these episodes I usually wouldn't talk to her at all; she wasn't exactly asking me to talk to her or texting me during these times. If she had, I probably would've responded. This isn't me blaming her, but rather explaining because the dynamic of our relationship was very weird.

I got back from my town a month and a half ago to help move our stuff in to our new place for the beginning of August, and I packed a lot of her stuff and moved it all for her, and genuinely just did a lot of things for her to try to make coming back as easy as possible. I was feeling a lot better with my friends around. She came back and instead of thanking me for helping she didn't even tell me when she got back, instead talking to all of our friends first. When I finally did see her I got a hey what's up before she walked away again. She talked to me once when she wanted to find out where I had packed some of her stuff. Then we didn't really talk at all for the next couple days, even though I was trying to start talking again. She'd shrug me off or sometimes outright ignore me, so I started to distance myself from her as being near her was really hurtful. Then my friends would make plans with her to go and do stuff and not tell me at all, and I'd just be left inside all day alone. They know that I get upset about that stuff.

Hoping to get things back to normal, I sat her down and told her that it wasn't working out. I thought maybe things were just awkward between us and we needed to sort things out. We ended up breaking up and that was a lot harder on me than I thought it'd be considering that I was pretty emotionally checked out to begin with. That was a few days ago and I've barely interacted with my friends since and I don't know how I can. I still try to talk to them, but none of them will say anything to me without me saying something first, and even if I do say something to them it'll just get a quick dismissive response. They must know something is wrong but they just don't care. A couple weeks ago on my birthday they threw a party and got me a really sweet card saying that they were my family. I don't know which it is but their actions speak so much louder than what was written on a card. 

This kind of turned into a venting post rather than a question, but I acknowledge that my risk for some sort of mental issue is pretty high; my mother has bipolar and depression and my father has some depressive tendencies as well, although he was never diagnosed. On top of all of this, I was abused as a child by my stepmother when my mom took me and left my dad when I was about 6. The abuse got worse as I got older but I was emotionally and physically abused while also being denied food etc. I take adderall and guanfacine for ADHD so once she stopped paying for my stuff I began selling my adderall to older friends of mine for some spending money when I was roughly 12. By the time I was 14 or so I finally got out and stayed with my dad. When this happened though, I discovered that nearly all of my friends didn't like me at school because I was annoying (probably because I wasn't medicated and ADHD). They felt bad for me and didn't have the heart to tell me that. This was more damaging than anything that my stepmother had ever done to me, and caused me to have nightmares and panic attacks for months after. I think this is the source of my issue honestly, and I don't know what I can do about it. I might've told my previous doctor about it but my current one I've had for exactly one visit and I don't know him well enough.

Does anyone else feel like this and have these symptoms? If yes, have you found any ways to overcome it and feel better? I just want to feel normal and it makes me so angry that I can't deal with this myself.

Idk if anyone is going to read this but thank you if you've gotten to this point, sorry for being so rambly."

So this has been going on for a while now. Like, 2 years maybe. But its been getting exceptionally worse for past few weeks.         
         
I have been having recurring thoughts of suicide again. I get very irritated when someone enters my room (home because corona). I don’t want to have a conversation with family. And anything that involves interaction aggravates me. I don’t have anxiety, I can manage to talk to anyone but I’m too tired to do it.          
All I do is lie in my bed and listen to music, sometimes draw. God I so fucking want to die. I often imagine myself driving off cliff, hanging, eating pills and imagining how my acquaintances would react to this news.            
        
Sometimes I punch walls, kick stuff, burn my palm or waste a whole matches box to watch the flame burn. My parents used to get worried, because I’m not antisocial.       


Maybe its worth mentioning that from people’s perspective I have been doing good in life. Studying in top law school of my country. Doing above average in grades. Upper middle class family. Have couple friends too.           
            
Am I depressed? I sometimes feel like I am a poser and its just a mood. But like.. please tell me"
1403,Are you fucking kidding me? Why did nobody tell me about goodrx?,"I just scoured old post on this sub and checked out goodrx for some antidepressants. 12$ for some pills? I'll happily pay that to not feel like shit. 

Unless it's something I'm not reading that seems like a great thing. 

Sorry for the rant I'm just ready to stop feeling shitty"
1404,Am I wrong to call into work because my cousin was killed?,"TW: DEATH/MURDER

I get the news last night that my little cousin was murdered. I was very close to her growing up and very close with her mother. Obviously I'm shocked. My family is torn up. 

I call into work. Then I message my boss and supervisor to explain to them what happened and that I'll need 2 days off to cope and help family.

They both read the message but didn't reply.

Either they think I'm lying or they're upset that I didn't come in. Probably both. 

Am I lame for not going into work?? Should I have suffered through my shifts?? Someone please enlighten me."
1405,Somebody to talk to,"Hello
I doubt this post will get much attention but just sharing makes me feel better. I really have nobody to talk to. I had a best friend of 16 yrs but I have recently cut her out of my life because she was a very toxic person. I have a sister, but every time I want or need to talk or vent she just yells at me to leave and calls me names. I often feel alone because of this, and I have a hard time opening up to people because I don’t want to feel like a burden. This has cause me to create this false image of myself. I act like nothing bothers me and I don’t need help and I don’t need share my feelings, but deep down I do. Many nights are spent in my room crying about all the things I wish I could tell to someone. Anyways I hope everyone else has a better day."
1406,my anxiety is making me physically ill for weeks. what can i do to try and help it,what can i do to help it. i normally get nauseous and sick to my stomach but it takes forever to subside. my house is the only place i dont feel ill. i cant go to school. go on dates. go shopping. without feeling sick to my stomach anxious
1407,"How do I tell my therapist about suicidal thoughts, etc?","I finally caved and told my parents how bad my mental health is. I’m already in therapy, but my therapist doesn’t know how bad I am. My parents told me I need to tell him everything by next appointment. Do you guys have any advice on how to tell him? I have trouble expressing myself and I feel like I might end up saying nothing at all. Also how much should I tell him? I don’t want to get sent anywhere. I’m struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts and self harm rn. I almost committed a few days ago. I’m also not medicated so I’m hoping if I tell him more I can get a prescription to help me."
1408,I’m hungry,     I’ve had an eating disorder for the past year and lately i’ve been pushing myself to eat at least something. I try to eat things that seem softer on my stomach or whatever like crackers or apples or small stuff like that. But my dad never buys stuff I can keep down. So I just get stuck in this cycle. And when I complain he tells me to get a job. I’m only 16 and I don’t mind getting a job but it’s hard when I throw up almost 30 times a day. I know this isn’t that big of a deal but I just needed to vent because I always sound inconsiderate when I mention it.
1409,At my wits end after over a decade of trying to get a bachelors degree,"I (32M) just had another mental breakdown after a month at my new university. Here’s my history: I was diagnosed with chronic major depressive disorder at age 17 after a suicide attempt, but I don’t remember ever feeling happy before then either. After picking myself up, with help from meds and counseling, I attempted to go to a university the next year. I made it about 2 months into the semester before my depression and anxiety got real bad again and then I dropped out. I moved back to my hometown and got a job and despite being poor and miserable as an 18 year old on his own, I was somewhat ok. I tried going back to community college at age 20, made it about 2 or 3 months then had another breakdown and dropped out. Same thing at age 22, 3 months of community college, breakdown, drop out. At this point I had been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder as well as depression. I stopped trying for school and just focused on myself and finding a way to feel like a human who could just live. I spent the next several years working kitchen jobs, and my anxiety and panic subsided while my depression remained. Kitchen work was less existentially pressuring, but the low wages and being surrounded by addiction and alcoholism and negativity wasn’t helping me feel like I was in a good place either.

So after years of becoming more balanced and functional, but not really any happier, I decided to go back to community college at age 27. This time I worked full time and only took 2 classes at a time. It took me forever to get my associates degree but I finally finished it last year, and with a 3.7 gpa. I felt like I was finally functioning and getting somewhere in my life. I received a full scholarship to a 4 year university, which required I attend full time, and I started school there this year. I wouldn’t be able to afford this school without this scholarship. 1 month into this semester, I had another breakdown, my first real/complete mental collapse since I was 22. 

I haven’t dropped out yet and I’m currently waiting to hear back from the administration to see what my options are, but I haven’t felt this low or this broken in a decade. At age 32, i feel like I’m running out of chances to get where I want to be. I’ve been able to do part time school but completely crash and burn whenever I try to take a full courseload. If I go part time to this school I’ll lose my scholarship and that’s the only reason I’m there right now to begin with. If I transfer to a cheaper school and go half time like I did in community college, I’ll have to take out loans, commit to going tens of thousands of dollars into debt, and I won’t finish my bachelors degree until I’m 37, at which point I’ll have spent a huge portion of my working years just surviving paycheck to paycheck and pursuing a degree, with years of paying off debt ahead of me well into my fourties, maybe even fifties. I feel hopeless. If I had given up on school a decade ago, I could be a head chef somewhere by now, making ok money and maybe even getting close to being able to buy a home. But I always told myself I was going back to school and didn’t want to get sucked too deep into the restaurant world, which I find depressing, unfulfilling, and unhealthy. What do I do when plan A just isn’t working, and plan B seems like a black hole of despair?

I don’t drink, I don’t do recreational drugs, I eat fairly healthy, and I exercise, but all those things just keep me treading water and prevent me from falling completely apart. I’ve never been able to get to a place where I feel happy or I feel good in my life and in my place in this world. I’ve tried so many different medications and they only help in times of extreme distress. When I’m functioning more normally, meds just make me feel really off balance and lifeless and uncomfortable and when I go off of them I eventually start to unravel again. My whole life I’ve used the idea that I have a future ahead of me and that things will be different to sort of push myself through the days. But now that I’m nearing the end of my youthful years that feels more and more like a lie and I’m worried that without that hope I’ll fall apart and won’t be able to put myself back together this time.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe I just needed to dump my thoughts and feelings and fears into the void. I’m going to go back to therapy and work with my school to see if my academic career is salvageable at all, but I’m beginning to resign myself to the fact that my brain just isn’t cut out for full time study. I know so many people have it worse than me, and that being able to go to school at all is a tremendous privilege. I just know I have so much passion for life and I’m really freaking smart and it’s so endlessly frustrating and painful to feel like everything I’m capable of doing or being is consistently sabotaged by my own mental fragility. Thanks for listening."
1410,Help...,I’m terrified of death but I just want things to end
1411,I'm growing tired of going to therapy,"I'm getting tired of having psychiatrist appointments because I'm starting to see it as a reminder of all the verbal abuse from my dad. I'm starting to feel that every visit to the doctor is a reminder that my stepmom always gets what she wants. She won. 


Background story: I was verbally abused and kinda bullied by my dad and his wife during my teenage years, with most of them starting because of my stepmom. My stepmom would find the most irrelevant things to complain about with my dad, making him treat me like shit. Because of those shitty memories, I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I'm currently taking antidepressants."
1412,Too many flaws/obstacles,"I feel like I have an unfair number of difficulties in life, and I’m having a hard time understanding how to work through my mindset. My looks aren’t great, my social skills suck, I seem to be highly sensitive, it was suggested that I have a learning disability while I was growing up &amp; I find it hard to retain any information I don’t have a lot of interest in.. I don’t know. I know it’s a catch-22, and by thinking a certain way, I’m staying in the cycle. But when I see people annoyed with me because they can’t understand me, it creates this intense feeling of not being a functional human in any way and then I spiral and just want to die. 

I’ve tried working out, (tried) making friends, taking courses, read self help books, get into new hobbies (but a lot of the time I get bored and frustrated that I am not further along and/or have the courage to give it 100%). I just feel like I’m a weak coward and I’m not sure how not to be that. I feel like I did better before, but nowdays I just feel like I can’t do anything right."
1413,Cancelling plans due to insecurities,I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life and have always been insecure about the way I look. I used my time in quarantine to eat better and workout and I ended up losing 20 pounds. I haven’t seen any of my friends because I keep cancelling. I keep cancelling because I’m still insecure about how I look and am afraid of people secretly judging my body. Even though I’ve lost weight I feel bigger than ever. I just don’t want anyone to see me how can I get over this?
1414,Im being Self destruction (I think/know),"I'm very self destructive atm. My Ex dumped me 2 weeks ago and I've had to move out into temp accommodation and have to find somewhere else to live. I'm starting my postgraduate next week and it's going to be intense. I really want to work in this vocation but I'm self sabotaging at the moment. I have GAD and Depressive disorder with EUPD traits and I'm just feeling these intense lows. 

Yesterday, I went to the gym and felt amazing afterwards. Had 4 hours sleep but woke up the most refreshed I've been in ages. Throughout the day, my mood has been dipping but I'm trying to get it back up through drinking alcohol and energy drinks. I'm planning on going back to the gym tomorrow morning but I need to feel the elevation in mood again

I've started drama with my family members and posting outing information about how bad my childhood was on social media to try to get a reaction out of people. I feel so alone in what's going on with nobody to be there to just care about me. 

I feel like a waste of space. I already tried to commit suicide (not wholeheartedly) the day my ex broke up with me and I'm scared I might do it again. But also at the same time, it would end my suffering. 

I dont know what this post is supposed to mean, just venting my feelings really. The last couple of days I've been getting high as a kite (on cannabis). Yesterday and today I havent touched it but leaning back to giving it a try. It's so good with focusing my mind on something else and not the reality of my horrid, dreadful, lonely life right now"
1415,I think I cracked today,"I screamed at my family today.  They’re only trying to help me.  I’ve turned into such a piece of shit.  I hate everyone I hate the world.  I’m so angry all the time.  I don’t know what happiness feels like anymore.  I’m cynical,  I have trust issues.  I also left my closest friends.  They have tried to help me time and time again, but there is no getting through this.  I can’t keep bringing them down.  They are all so special, and I’m, just Not.  I feel so guilty for disappointing them time and time again.  I have tried medication, therapy, everything.  Because of my depression and my anxiety I couldn’t finish college, my memory is shot, I have no future, no plan.  I’m absolutely screwed.  I know there is no hope.  I feel like I’m going insane, and I know my family looks at me like I am.  I just don’t know what to do.  I don’t know why I’m posting on here.  I really hope that everyone else on this sub finds happiness.  I just realize now I won’t."
1416,Break it down,"To stay in the moment and not consume myself with thoughts tumbling out of control, I make it a challenge to do one thing at a time fully and completely. I do not write a long list of things to do. I write down exactly ONE task that I am going to do next. And it has to be a simple task. It can be something that is part of a larger goal or not. It does not have to be called a task. It can just be what I like to call, “a moment to catch.” A moment to catch/task for example: wash 3 plates in the sink. This is something I can complete and see completed in a short amount of time. The goal isn’t completion as much as staying in that moment.  I like to catch moments, even if it involves things I have to complete. 
When the task is done, I cross it out/erase it, completely discard of it and write the next thing I’m going to do. The length and size depends on what I’m capable of that day, hour or min. There is not pressure to do large or small tasks. It’s whatever you can handle. Here is another example. I write down: eat an apple. So that is all I do. I just eat an apple. I think about the apple, I feel the texture of it, how the smooth parts feel on my fingers and how it crunches in my mouth. Everything is about the apple. When I’m done, I cross that out and move on to the next. It’s very freeing to have one thing to do and one thing only and to focus on that one thing. It’s ok to have a long list off to the side and refer to it  but I find I stay present with one resounding TO DO or TASK or MOMENT TO CATCH in my face at a time. Do literally one thing at a time mentally and physically. Write it down, do not make it too complicated...if you are overwhelmed make it smaller, then do that task, complete that task, cross it out and write a new task. Other rules I use to stay present and forget about things I can’t control/slew of other anxieties that rob me of my well-being is to also make sure I’m slowing down my mind and body so I’m able to proceed. Not rushing. Rushing I find takes me out of the moment. Rushing I also find takes me longer to do anything or enjoy anything or complete anything because my mind is not paying attention to what’s right in front of it. That apple, that dish to be washed, a moment with a friend or family member, a nap!! Naps should be on your of your the side list if possible. 
I use a small slab of dry erase board and dry erase marker. I write once again ONE small task. Complete it. Erase it. Write the next one. It may sound elementary but it’s my favorite. It hyper focused my mind."
1417,I feel like killing myself today,"Even though I’ve had such a great few hangouts with my two good friends these past few days... I feel like killing myself. 

I have a plethora of trauma that I deal with daily, sexual abuse, isolation(youngest and black sheep of the family), mental illness, etc., 

These past few days I’ve been feeling absolutely suicidal. I’ve even started to day dream about my funeral and how I would kill myself. Maybe jump off the Golden Gate Bridge or slice my wrist. Maybe just run in front of a bus. Anyway, it’s bad. Probably the worst it’s been in awhile. I’ve started to push someone I really care about in a romantic way away. Make him hate me so when and if I decide to do it, maybe he won’t be so sad. 

I’m thinking of calling the suicide hotline number today. I need to reach out to my healthcare to schedule an appointment to get on some medication because I think I’m started to become bipolar or at least now realizing how bad it’s getting. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder before but I’m not sure anymore."

1419,"Men with depression, I’m so sorry and I’m here to listen","I don’t mean to exclude girls, I’m a 20 year old girl and have had my fair share of mental health issues and parental abuse. I just think men’s mental health really needs to be normalized. I really feel for young men who experience depression. I was told similar things you may have heard “grow up, don’t be a sissy, you’re being selfish” but I was lucky enough to be allowed to be emotional by societies standards. If anyone needs a judgment free person to vent to or for advice or some motivation I’m always available. I recently lost a family member to suicide. He never seemed depressed, he never went to anyone for support. Depression itself makes you want to isolate but having pressure from family and society itself telling you that you’re gay or a sissy or not man because you experience this is so backwards and wrong. I wish that I could change that but all I have in my power for now is to be there for as many of you as possible. You’re not alone, you’re strong and you are loved."
1420,Feeling like I’m going to snap,"Hi everyone, I’m 21 years old and feel like I’m going crazy. All my life I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression but it was never bad enough where I wanted to hurt myself or anything like that. I was just diagnosed with anxiety and depression last year after having a meltdown at work. Honestly I just want some help on how to deal with it. I’ve been having more attacks and my emotions and moods have been all over the place for the past couple weeks. I miss work often to just lay in bed and hate myself. It’s to the point where I get physically sick, sweats, shaking etc. honestly I just feel like most of this is coming from this isn’t what I want to do with my life and I just feel like I getting old and I’ll regret it when I get older"
1421,Tw! Paranoia and suicidal,[removed]
1422,Messaging Anxiety,"TW: talk about anxiety, relationships, recovery.

TDLR: get anxiety when someone reads and doesn’t respond, want to stop having this response.

Does anyone else get anxiety when being left on read by certain people? I fully understand that people don’t owe me a response and have lives outside of me. However, this feels like an automatic response that I just can’t rationalise. If someone doesn’t read the message and doesn’t reply it’s fine but as soon as that message is read I get so anxious.

I have the most amazing partner that I trust and when he reads but doesn’t respond I worry that there’s something wrong (in terms of he’s upset or something, not something wrong with us). I feel fully secure in the relationship but I panic everytime out of control even though I know it’s ridiculous. I have had this for a long time and I just want it to stop because I don’t want to be an exhausting partner.

I have general anxiety disorder and am starting therapy soon and counselling (I want to get better so badly).

Does anyone have advice on what I can do to help me rationalise when this happens?"
1423,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"For the past 3 years I’ve been struggling with my thoughts and emotions. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I’ll try to explain it. I haven’t been very happy for the past 3 years. I’ve felt like everyday I’m getting worse and worse. My friends tell me it. My relationships have all failed because of it. And everything feels so gray. I haven’t had much happiness and everything seems to be making me sad or mad. I feel like today should be the start of trying to get help for this. My mother has bipolar disorder. And I likely have it too. But it also might not be bipolar. I want someone to help but at the same time I feel like no one will understand. I’ve tried a lot of things to try to make me happy like drinking and marijuana but they never help. They just make me feel even worse. I’d ask my mother but I’ve distanced myself from so many people including her. My moods always swing from left to right. Mad then sad or sad then mad. I try to be happy but it never stays long. This is my first time asking for help I don’t really know where to start to look for help professionally but I’m hoping right here is a good start. My home life never really was terrible so I don’t think people did this to me. I’m almost positive I have anxiety due to all my thoughts and worry’s. I don’t know if professional help would actually help me. Being junked up on tons of medications doesn’t sound extremely pleasant but if it could bring back happiness I’d do it in a heartbeat. This quarantine made me feel even worse. But it probably did to many others too. If anybody could help me figure out what’s wrong with me and could tell me the next steps to take mentally would help a lot. Also, what seems to really soothe all my thoughts is music. I literally listened to music 5 hours straight the other day. It really helps me. But I don’t want to listen to music to get me motivated to live life. Listening to music for that long of hours really just makes the days go by even faster. I’ve lost motivation to do lots of things and recently it’s been getting worse. That’s the reason why I figured today would be the start of the journey of looking for help. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you &lt;3."
1424,A happy do my favourite things day!,"I have the house to myself for most of the day today... i got a full good sleep and woke up at 8. I tossed in a load of laundry in the morning with no pressure to do it quickly (I have roommates and weekend laundry is an issue so though its not a favourite thing, its nice to not have to rush..) I went to the grocery store which was NOT busy and got all my favourite comfort foods. Then I went for a decent hike in the woods. During the hike an owl landed nearby and we wanted each other for a bit. Thats never happened before and it was magical. Now I've had lunch and am going to veg out and play the Sims  till my fiance comes home from work at 9PM  :) it's good to be alive today and I have so much to be grateful for."

1426,Is it possible to improve my mental health alone?,"I'm 20, male and a I live alone. I can't afford therapy, I don't have close friends to talk to and I'm not close to my family so there's no one I'd feel comfortable talking to there as well.

I'm realising more that how I feel has affected what I do and what I do, is really concerning... because it's nothing. I'm literally moving nowhere in life. Throughout the year I've improved on nothing about myself and I know that it's my fault and I'd like to work on it."
1427,Covid restrictions and mental health in children,"This may be controversial but that's the point, to spark conversation about it.
My 7 year old daughter is a social butterfly. She is usually very friendly, happy and absolutely loves people. Our school went back to in person teaching now but with extreme restrictions. The kids must wear a mask all day, they must stay 6 feet apart at all times, they can not share anything etc. She came home friday VERY upset. She tore her mask off (they are required on the bus as well) stuffed in the garbage and when i asked her what's wrong? She went off in a way I've never heard her talk. She said and i quote ""I fucking hate covid I fucking hate this mask, I fucking hate not playing with my friends, I fucking hate school. I'm want to kill covid""
""I got yelled at for giving Elly a hug at school""

This upset me quite a bit. She has never shown anger to that level before. All of this stuff going on has me worried about not only my kids mental health during this but all other kids too. I've brought it up amongst people I know and their responses were juvenile at best."

My boyfriend might leave me because I'm dragging him down too: ""there's no change; you promised me things would get better.""

things aren't getting better

I've already lost so much due to my mental illnesses. I'm about to lose everything all over again.

My heart hurts and my eyes feel with tears- but this is normal.

I'm lost. I swear I'm trying. I swear just because I start petty fights, just because I'm costing us money at work, just because things don't feel right between us;  doesn't mean they never can. and it doesn't mean I'm not trying.

It is a constant battle just to stay alive- that's me trying.

1433,I told my family to go forth and multiply,"Trigger warming abuse, self harm.

Apologise for the foul language.

So I told my family about a hour ago to fuck off. I haven’t lived with my sister and parents for about 12 years after my sister wanted a bigger bed room so they made it a point (not so subtlety) to make the house uncomfortable for me. Things like “your pets are too noisy at night” or “they use too much electric” I had several pets in my room, this has multiple since moving out.
So I haven’t felt like part of the family ever since they rarely invite me to meals, family visits etc or tell me about medical issues.
This is the spark that lite the keg for me today. So my dad was diagnosis’s with bowel cancer about 2 years ago which I didn’t find out for many months after he was diagnosed and that’s as only because a letter for his hospital appointment came to my house by mistake (we live in the same street about 20 doors apart). I was pretty livid at that but I kept it bottled up a S that’s my bread and butter. 
My mam had back surgery and it left her with nerve damage and drop foot. She had been going to appointments with my sister for about a year and never told me, when I found out and said I was coming to her next one the response was “oh, well nobody can come with me” when I asked about my sister my mam didn’t have a response beyond “she drives”. 
My aunt has kidney failure which I didn’t find out about until over a year after she had a kidney transplant. Yesterday my dad slipped up and mentioned she had a mri and has motor neurone disease and they were going to see her today. 
So I waited for a phone all about what time they were going  and never got one. I went to their house about a hour ago and asked what happened.
My mam and sister just nonchalantly said “about what”. When I said about aunt they said we went for a meal with your nan. I asked why they never called to ask if I wanted to come they said “oh well you can only have 5 people together at once”. 
And I tell you I was PISSED now. 

It just erupted. I shouted about not being told about medical issues (I’m a registered general nurse), about them not asking if I want to go and see family, about them never asking how I am (I’ve been epileptic for 4 years, have a history of depression, anxiety and suicide attempts), about how my sister was always spoilt, about how I was basically bullied out of the house, how they used to smack me with with wooden canes when my sister would cry and say I hit her even if I was upstairs.
Then my mam asked “what happened to your arm?” I said “oho fuck that you do t get to ask now”. 

God damn it felt relieving."
1434,Illness and meds taking over my life,"So, do to my mental illnesses I struggle a lot to find and keep jobs. In 6 years I've been actively searching for jobs I have maybe 5 ou 6 and never more than 2 weeks each for various reasons.

My mother earns enough to provide for both of us and some extras, so I am not in social security disabily, atleast for now.

The thing is I rarely go out because my very small group of friends are either far away or simply don't want to go out. They even don't play online with me, because of lack of time on their side or only being available late at night.

You might think I play a lot and watch netflix etc, but I don't. During the day my meds make very unmotivated for anything, and I sleep from 9/10pm to 9/10am because the night pills make me really sleepy, even if I take a expresso post dinner.

I just wish I would learn how to enjoy playing alone or watching netflix during the day and have a bit more energy/motivation to do so.

Every day is almost the same and I feel like life is passing me by."
1435,What are some suggestions for things to do daily for one to feel happy? Here are some things I do that work for me.,"\- **Get into nature**. Take a short walk, eat lunch outside, go to a park for a half hour, even open a window and listen to the rain. Taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed.

* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I’d clung onto.
* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass — your intuition. If something feels right, you’ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you’ll know for certain. When you’re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.
* **Ritual.** For me, it’s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It’s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).
* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren’t going to tolerate it. We don’t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.
* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce «flow.»** Flow is the term for that magical time when you’re so immersed in what you’re doing that you don’t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.

1436,Missing what positivity that I thought would happen,[removed]
1437,I had an horrible experience with the mirror,"It was about one hour ago. I was going out of the bathroom, I looked only one second in the mirror and I didn't see myself... I saw an old man face with empty eyes and white hair (my head is shaved). The right cheek was totally chewed and blooding. I don't have the courage to look at myself in mirror anymore. Next week I have my first session with a therapist, but for another reason (I feel like I'm living the life of another one). Should I talk about this? I'm afraid of psychosis or schizophrenia diagnosis."
1438,Previous post asking: AM I OK?,"I can no longer see the post because I blocked the user.  This person is openly expressing a desire to harm, sexually assault, and kill in the future.

I am new here and was disturbed at their reaction to people’s honest answer to his post.  Is there anything to do in this situation that’s appropriate?  I understand he hasn’t theoretically done anything wrong yet but if this person won’t get help it seems something terrible will happen.

How do you all approach this?  Is there anything to do as a random internet user concerned for h the physical safety of people I may never meet or be able to warn?

Thank you."
1439,"Years Later, Still Affected","So this is pathetic.  

I've been separated from my ex boyfriend (were together for nearly 4 years) and it's been about 4 years since the break up. 

I've been dating someone new for about a year, and I love him. 

However,  I still think about my ex. I still miss him...sometimes horribly. Occasionally I'll check up on his social media.  He's been with someone else for a couple years now. 

I just ( very stupidly) read a few of our final messages which left me literally sobbing in the bathroom at work.
What's wrong with me? I should be happy. I shouldn't be thinking about him, or giving a fuck about his life. 

It just hurts.... So bad still. 

How long is it supposed to take to heal? I was single for 3 years before I even thought about dating and met my current partner.

I did a lot of work on myself , grew as a person,  achieved goals I had always wanted to. But this old relationship is haunting me. 

I don't want to feel so hurt anymore."

1441,Have you had any breakdowns lately? Loaded question I know.,It’s been awhile but sometimes I feel like my emotional weight is too much to bear and something happens that pushes me into a full on breakdown that lasts for hours. Crying so much that my eyes swell and I get a migraine. It hasn’t happened in a long time but I wanted to hear your thoughts and experiences if you guys wanted to share. These moments are good and bad I feel like. I always feel so emotionally drained after to the point that I feel nothing and it’s kind of nice but also weird.
1442,Lamictal and Memory,"Hi! 

Has anyone had memory problems while taking lamictal (lamotrigine)?

I feel like my memory and focus are completely gone. I take 50 mg/day (couldn’t take the 100 mg because I got headaches and a rash). It somewhat helps my bipolar depression but not really. 

My psychiatrist is extremely frustrated that I hate every med I’ve tried. We’re running out of options (I have other medical issues so I can only take certain meds). 

I’m dreading telling her I want to stop this one too because I know she’ll be upset but the memory loss is driving me crazy."
1443,Online connections with strangers,My 17yr old daughter likes to meet boys online rather than in person.  She tends to open up and spend hours in these online relationships and never wants to have a relationship with someone at school or another social circle.  Is this a fear of some kind?  Maybe people she knows finding out something about her so she seeks strangers?  Maybe she is trying to prove something to me and her dad?  Not wanting us to get to know someone until she is emotional committed to someone?  Any idea what this is and some advice please
1444,I literally just had a mental breakdown because i couldn't FC a song on osu,"Yeah i couldn't FC a 3 star song, and after failing my 10-15th retry, i slammed my head into my desk and started crying and the only thing i could think was ""I'm never gonna be good at anything. i'm fucking useless.""

1445,Too much change,"So my foster sister moved out months ago, she’s 8ish months pregnant now and her and her boyfriend moved back into the house and into my other foster sisters room. My other foster sister is now down stairs. The house is a mess and too much is changing.  I have severe social anxiety and it affects my eating since I can’t eat around people comfortably. Everything’s being changed, everything’s being labeled or moved or replaced even the dish soap has changed now because now it’s in a glass jar with a pump and it makes me feel uncomfortable washing my dishes because it’s so different and it’s overwhelming for me. Usually my food is labeled with my initial but now everyone else has a initial and it stresses me out cause now I don’t know if I’m allowed to eat something if it doesn’t have any initials on it. No one is home right now and I’m super hungry but I still can’t eat because I’m afraid they’ll come home while I’m eating. I feel like I’m being over dramatic but it’s extremely overwhelming for me."
1446,Someone wanna talk?,"Im on alcohol and an overdose Medikinet (That ADS/ADHS kind of stuff. Most likely be called ""Retalin"") Im german so it might take a while to answer your questions :)"

1448,I need Advice - i'll make it quick.,"Okay hi, new to this  subreddit but i dont really have anywhere else to turn.

Basically, i have one very depressed, suicidal sister who has self harmed for years. After many years of giving her support, she started to get better, let go of her traumatic break up and slowly heal. 

about a year ago she relapsed and my other sister started to feel very guilty about the whole situation, saying she didnt do enough. But it was pretty bloody impossible to help her anymore.

Anyway, now i have one suicidal sister and one sister riddled with guilt to the point where she has insomnia and intrusive thoughts.

The problem is, the suicidal sister is hiding that there is anything wrong with her, but she writes everything down on a public blog that my other sister found. So we know how she's feeling, she just lies to us about it. Which hurts my sister alot.

My insomniac sister believes she would 'heal' shall we say, if my sister was honest about how she truly feels instead of hiding it all the time.

I dont know what to do at this point. im so bloody sick of this mess, all over a useless fucking man.

I just want them both to be happy, and they're the furthest from it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

How can you make someone talk about their feelings when they're so caught up in their own lie of being happy?"
1449,TW: self harm,"when I first started having issues with my mental health I self harmed by cutting and pulling my hair out. Thankfully I stopped cutting even though I still had the urge, overtime that went away I never stopped pulling my hair out I still do that. But now its coming back I haven't cut in years and I don't ever want to do it again its just starting to get hard to ignore it, I'm afraid I'll start again and this time it'll be more difficult to stop"
1450,Post graduate life,I’m in the situation in my life where I’ve just graduated with a first in computer science. I’ve been applying to loads of places but yet to get a job but that’s ok it will come. My problem is that all my friends from home as well as my twin brother has all moved to the same city and are living together. I’ve been left to work in hospitality in a very very rural area. I have nothing to look forward to in the evening and literally do the same thing ever day. I wouldn’t say I feel lonely but each day gets hard. My mental health has taken a serious hit and I don’t know how to change it. I just don’t feel like me anymore
1451,I just hate feeling like I can't be happy or proud of myself,I'm going to University on Wednesday and I am sort of excited for it but it seems as all my family are really happy for me and I just have to pretend and go along with it and put on a fake smile because it's how I should be feeling and how I want to feel but I just can't I'm pretty sure I'm suffering with OCD and moderate depression (for longer than I think) but I'm not saying I'm right but I'm pretty sure that it is I'm just so annoyed it happend during the biggest change of my life sort of ruining it. I know I shouldn't be throwing myself a pity party but I just really wanted vent. Also with my mum wanting me to get to uni before I see my doctor so I can get settled in and see if that helps which I'm sure it will but I just feel like I should have gotten a proper diagnosis first before but hey can't change the past. Even the stuff that desperately needs doing I can't pull myself together enough to do it I'm just so frustrated and really needed an outlet  all the self help books help but I just keep falling flat and getting into bad habits over and over again it's like a never ending cycle of disappointment and getting up again and keep trying

1453,Mental health,"Hello I joined this subreddit because something really bad happened to me causing me to go to the mental health hospital and now I have a 5150 on my record, curious if I can get if off my record and if not does it go away in a couple years or so?"
1454,Scared of becoming who I was,"I've battled with my mental health for a while, I've sought help but only when I reached breaking point,  said breaking point was me punching myself in the face repetitively infront of friends and family til I couldn't see any more, I paid for counselling and things got better I was able to create boundaries I stood up for my self and for the first time in years I was happy.

I can feel myself slipping again, I was never officially diagnosed with anything I just worked through some issues but a few weeks ago I was folding clothes I got annoyed and started slapping myself in the face as hard as I could, I've only ever told one person (a friend not my partner he has no idea) about this as I know it's not healthy, I know I need to go back to counselling but I can't afford it right now, I feel happy  generally but I just don't like myself. 

TL:DR I hurt myself realised I needed help started to again can't afford help just need to get this off my chest."
1455,Some guy I've been talking to has just apologized for having sexual fantasies about me (I'm underage) and I don't know how to respond or what to think.,"He's 26 and I'm 13. I was helping this guy, who I'll call Dave, with his problems. We talked for a while and soon started helping each other out. One day, he said something about getting turned on by something I said. I felt uncomfortable, but didn't think too much of it. 

I felt uneasy talking to him at one point, and I said that I didn't want to talk to him anymore because of the age gap. He understood and we stopped talking. 

But about an hour ago, I got a message from him saying that he was watching a video about some dude that acted like a kid online and exposed pedophiles. Dave said that he saw some similarities with the people wanting to meet the younger girls, and that he was disgusted at himself. He told me that sometimes he would have sexual thoughts about young girls in real life, too. It was normalized for him because of his family, but he stated that it didn't sound normal at all. Afterwards he apologized to me. 

I don't know how to feel or what to say to him. I said that I was shocked and wanted to take some time to think about it. Does anybody know what to do? I'm scared."

1457,My sister persuaded me to start a job-training,"I was too young to decide to leave or switch schools when I was in a horrible traumatic situation back then. I was trapped in a hell, or so it felt like. So now I'm scared to remain trapped again. Unable to escape a horrible situation. So I quickly leave new jobs, trainings, studies and so on. Usually either with a mental breakdown into average BPD symptoms (I suffer from it since I'm 15. I'm stable now (26) unless the outside pressure overwhelms me). I feel like I have to be on the run and be super careful and sensitive and analyze everything, to possible become aware of a new hell and to quickly escape this time. I feel like I can not survive getting trapped again. I feel like I'm unable to be aware of being trapped. I become hyper-sensitive. I did not help myself back then when the trauma happened. This time it's a difficult job-training again. I will have to put in a lot of effort. Like never before. And without the effort it already was hell!!! My sister persuaded me to accept the job-offering when she visited and put me down. She compared me to people who abuse the system and are just lazy. I believed her. The state wanted to put me to long-term sick/free money every month (enough to survive)/little work is still possible to at least live okay-ish. Every country will have different names for a system like that. Pension. Disability. That stuff.

I wanted to go that route with the state. But then my sister persuaded me again. I'm torn between sick and health for so long now. I don't know how to decide or if it's possible to decide that."

1459,What are the types of mental self harm?,"So I was recently told that one form of self harm is looking at content that you know will make you angry or sad. I do this all the time because in my mind, I think that I'm being educated by whatever I'm looking at.

I was wondering if there's other types of mental self harm so I can keep myself in check and better myself. Thanks :)"

1462,I’ve lost interest in everything,"I can’t get interested in books, movies (don’t have the attention span for them anyway), tv shows, video games, even music, and that’s what used to help me the most. I don’t get excited about anything. I feel empty in a way. Part of me wants to go back to work only to escape the boredom I feel at home, but at work I stress a lot more about everyone being able to see how stupid and pathetic I am, which makes me dislike myself more.

Is this normal? To feel uninterested in pretty much everything. I don’t even know what I want to do with my life anymore. I mean there’s part of me that doesn’t even want to exist, but I’m also too scared to do anything to make that happen. My junior year of high school was when I thought I had a plan for what career I wanted. Now, I’ve don’t even want to do that, I don’t think.

I know it’s okay to not know what you want to do or study. I know tons of people change their majors, or take some years off, but it really seems like I won’t find anything now. Part of me doesn’t think I’m cut out for a career. Sure I have a job now, but it was basically handed to me. Some days I can barely handle it because it brings out my negative thought a lot, and I end up despising myself. Besides, even if I did have the confidence in myself, I still have no idea what I would even want to do. Everything seems so dull right now."
1463,"Can anyone find me a specific Self Help ""Quiz""?","It wasn't exactly a ""quiz"" but more like a guide in the form of a quiz. It would ask you these questions and would give you solutions for most of your answers. I don't know if it helps but I remember I found it one day when I was searching up ""i feel physically dirty"" or something along those lines. I think the website had a purple background and a poop emoji symbol?? I don't really remember it well but it helped me a lot during one of my more tired moments and I would really appreciate it if someone found it for me :D."
1464,Fuck the suicide hotline.,"I’m sorry Im boring these people with my hatred of myself.  All these stupid fucking mental health clinics? They give me a different number to call every time.  And therapists?  They sit there in silence and give me fucking pity eyes, or they go off on some bullshit experience they had that they’re probably lying about, to make it seem like they can understand me.  If I wanted that shit I’d go to my high school teacher.  If it’s an immediate emergency call 911 right?  So they can send police to your house to “check” on you and leave.  Fuck you.
People talk about all these resources and how you can get help if you need it.   It’s all fucking bullshit.  These people couldn’t give a rats left nut about me.  It gets better my fucking ass.  At the very least stop fucking lying to me and say you’re supposed to help when you don’t."

1471,Just ranting... not looking for answers. Maybe just your thoughts. I’m seeing a psychologist Tuesday,"I have no diagnosed mental illnesses, I have ADHD (learning disorder) however. Stimulants do not affect me, and I don’t just mean my medicine. Stimulant drugs don’t affect me either. I have done cocaine, Methamphetamine, adderall, Ritalin... all stims you can think of in both pills and street I’ve done. None really do anything to me aside from Ritalin which made me suuuuuper slow and sleepy. Middle school age 11 was when the social anxiety happened. I had no friends until age 16-17 in high school. I was a kissless virgin until age 18 but by then diabetes had already mostly rotted my genitals. I can’t build relationships with people no matter how badly I want it. I feel absolutely no empathy, I’ve even drugged my best friend and watched him OD and nearly die. I apologized... but I didn’t feel it inside and he could tell. My social anxiety is totally gone, I’m not a narcissist I hate them. One of my closest friends was one... he’s a piece of shit and I hope he sorts his Demons. I have extreme mood swings and random thoughts of suicide daily for years. I don’t feel deep emotion on the suicidal thoughts but they happen almost as if I’m subconsciously telling myself to do it. I don’t care for my diabetes. It bothers me that I’m gonna die... but for some reason I’m okay with it. I pace for hours going over thoughts in my head every night (the pacing is worse at night). I get insanely hyper right at bed time and can’t sleep until like 3-4am. I won’t go into detail about the empathy/remorse I lack but I can tell it’s not there. I’ve done a lot of things are aren’t okay yet I’m okay with it. I know somethings wrong and I’m not here looking for answers I just want your thoughts. I’m seeing a mental health doctor next week."
1472,i’ve been so depressed the last three weeks i can’t remember anything that’s happened,"i remember my results day and a couple other significant events and that’s it. looking back it seems like fog, i felt like i wasn’t there, but during the weeks this felt normal, even though in hindsight i was hugely depressed.

i also don’t know what i really look like, which is really scary, i keep think i’m people that come on my feed on tiktok or insta (i think it’s a photo of me, not that i am them) and my body doesn’t feel like mine.

i’m calling camhs (the child mental health service on nhs) on monday, but this is baaaad bad.

i’m suicidal and worried i’ll have to call a helpline, my life feels like it’s over, i don’t care anymore. just help me please."
1473,Alcohol and marijuana and antipsychotics,"My adult son (23) is out of the hospital for schizophrenia just two days and defiantly drinking alcohol and smoking weed while taking his antipsychotics.  I can say nothing since he is also oppositional and that just makes it worse.

Can this put him in a coma? will the antipsychotics work? Not even sure if he’s actually taking them.  He doesn’t believe he’s sick."
1474,I want to disappear.,"Except my two dogs, I have no one. Zero friends. Co-workers who think I’m weird and talk about me behind my back. Parents who rarely call me. Siblings who are busy and have their own life. And now, a fiancé I’ve been with for over 12 years, who told me today “you’re ALWAYS negative and you are the main reason I’m miserable and unhappy.” Oh and don’t forget, my fiancé’s family who think I’m the anti-Christ because I’m an atheist.

I feel like the only person who cares about me is PAID TO SO (my therapist). What is the point of my existence? Im a miserable person and I make others miserable. Idk where to go from here but it’s undeniable that not being here would be more humane that suffering through the remainder of my life. The pain and emptiness I feel on a day-to-day basis is unbearable. I’m so numb, I’ve lost the ability to cry. No one cares and I’m now a burden to the ones who once cared."

1476,Mind goes blank a lot for some reason,"Whenever doing something creative I may try to use my imagination or start thinking in order to get ideas.  Instead of doing any of these two things my mind goes blank and I can't see. Like no matter how much I try I just can't think. After a while I just give up.

Maybe this was caused by how I used to react to OCD when I was younger. I feared that the obsessive thoughts would harm what ever I was doing. In response to that I would literally force myself to stop thinking or imagining in order to prevent harm towards whatever I was working on. It got to the point so bad I would literally black out of existence for a while.

Well, now I can deal with OCD and am medicated for it. But now the issue is what's just been explained. Any ideas on how to reverse this?"
1477,I Googled again...,"I didn’t mean it, I was in a panic, trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I feel like I can no longer connect to the person I used to be. I feel like my passions are gone. My emotional connections are gone. I feel like I might have made myself into a sociopath because I googled it and I now I feel like I have no emotions towards people anymore, and I’m questioning if I ever did. I feel like I can’t enjoy the things I used to, like I no longer know what I’m comfortable with. I feel like obsessive googling and obsessive thoughts have permanently ruined my life. I can’t tell what’s real anymore and what I did to myself. I know I’m supposed to love animals but now I feel nothing. I’m afraid of myself again. I feel like I brainwashed myself with all of this googling and I don’t know how to undo it. It’s been like this since I first questioned a paraphilia I had back in July, and got a disturbing intrusive thought. From there I went down the rabbit hole. 

I feel like I lost myself. I lost my emotions, my daydreams, my connection to reality, I feel like I’ve driven myself insane and I don’t know how to stop. I want to be in love again, I want to feel emotions again, I want to love my dog and my mother, I want to worry about my family’s wellbeing, I want to be connected to the real world again. I feel like it’s too late for me though. I can never be the person I was again. I feel like I can never go back to enjoying my passions, my loved ones, being in nature, or even reading a book, because I don’t feel connected. I’m afraid I did this to myself and I can’t undo it. I’m afraid that this is now permanently a part of me. I’m afraid and paranoid that there really are signs of sociopathy in me, and that reading about it and other mental disorders brought it to the surface. 

I know it’s all bullshit that I scared myself with since I’m prone to do that with all sorts of things, but now I feel different. Like I feel like I’m emotionally disconnected. I feel like I can’t connect to a good story or comprehend people anymore. I feel like the fantasies of falling in love or taking care of a cool animal or helping people are all gone. I feel like I can’t relate to anything or anyone. I feel afraid of myself. I feel like I lost my passion for science and the environment. I feel like I can’t ever be myself again. I’m afraid that I keep making it worse with my stupid compulsory googling."

I dont have friends or family I can talk to, I can't do certain activities like a normal person, I can't live my life. It gets extremely harder by the second. My mental health is so bad. I can't bring myself to move anymore, to do anything. I can't even concentre in school as I once used to do. I don't have the same love anymore for anything. I'm not fast anymore. I can't do this. Why won't it stop? Why cant I just live my life the way I have? Why cant I move? Why cant I do anything anymore? I have no one, no one. And my close friend is gone. They left me.

1481,Help to Diagnose myself?,"Hi guys,  


I know this seems vague, but I need help and I am not sure where to turn. Sorry this is kind of a rant. But  a while back when i saw  a video about a girl talking about alexithymia, and it stuck with me. I could relate to ALOT of what she had to say. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5bagmADe4&amp;list=LLHryDBVn7mwMpC94uvEmaWQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=1530s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5bagmADe4&amp;list=LLHryDBVn7mwMpC94uvEmaWQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=1530s)). I am not sure if that is what it is but i can say for a fact that something is wrong with me, in the head. I can't explain it. It is just a fact. I go long periods of time where I... Honestly I am not  sure how to even explain it. I don't feel anything. I react to my emotions but i don't feel them. And so i thought it was alexithymia. But lately... something else has been happening. and the best way I can explain it is that.. I have these moments. Use rally well i am driving, which in itself weird, but where I just.. notice my life? I notice the world around me. I will flex my hand and notice the veins for the first time, and my brain slows down and i start to think. Which I know does not make sense, but when i have these moments i notice little things. Its like my head comes out of fog. I SEE Things and actually experience life. I will look down at myself and notice little things that normally i would not notice. And in these moments I realize that most of my life its like I am in fog. Something in my brain does not allow me to process, well, life. In these moments of my life I realize I look back on my life and its Almost like i am on auto pilot,  I know it sounds crazy, but i am having once of these moments right now. When i go back into the fog I do not even realize that I am back in it.   
I am a 30 year old male, and well i do not consider myself a hermit, I have always had problems making friends. People have told me that i come as a robot, and I come off an asshole, and i never understand why until i have moments where i come out of the fog so to speak.  
  I spend most of my life not actually Realizing life, i think that is why i do such big and stupid  things like i do. (Went to Egypt by self for 2 weeks, Ran a marathon, Tried to ride my bicycle   across the United States, Skydived) its because i am trying to feel something. But i CANT. unless i have these weird moments like right now. I get these ideas stuck in my head and I spend years getting everything ready and become almost obsessed with doing it.    
I have never been a ladies Man. I have had 1 relationship in my life. And i have never enjoyed Sex. Sometimes i think i am Asexual. I just don't get aroused really. I went through Puberty really late in life. (like 15) but i never saw the increase in sexual energy like most Guys do. I talked to my doctor about it and he ran a blood and hormone sample, and everything came back normal.   
These are just my thoughts, sorry if they don't make sense, but If Anyone has any ideas please let me know, or shoot me a private message with any more questions."
1482,Feel like I'm losing my mind.,"I'm trying to recall a moment where my friend said something in a certain way. Every way I replay the memory of them speaking sounds wrong. This probably doesn't make sense, but it's really getting to me."
1483,"How do I explain my ""sudden"" mental illness to my partner?",
1484,life is okay right now and yet i’m feeling suicidal again,"i don’t know what to do, there’s nothing wrong right now and yet i feel like this most of the time. i don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me"
1485,Environment effect on mental health,[removed]
1486,"Im not diagnosed or whatever, but lately I feel scared and I can feel how my mental stability is slowly crumbling.","I have never been a happy cheerful person. I mean if you were to ask my friends they might say that I am,  because with them I feel that way, u know, it makes me forget my problems when Im laughing my ass off with them. But in my house especially in quarantine, were my only friend is my brother, things have gotten a little out of hand. Maybe my teachers would tell you that theyve noticed something off about me, or my parents. But the thing is, no one truly knows me. All of my issues and stuff ive been going through all happen in my head. So even if I appear normal or dull, you cant know for certain whats going on behind the scenes. And thats how its been all my life, if something bothers me I bottle it up and toughen up because they are my problems and nobody elses. Im emotionally cold/strong like that, or used to be. Im not so sure lately.

Ive been abusing weed since quarantine started. From my experience with weed, I wouldnt say its bad, but it can definitely make things worse if you dont control it. Ive smoked a lot of weed for like a year give or take, and I had control over it. But now I feel like its the only thing messing up my head. It makes me lazy and life is easy but being lazy makes it hard. Weed now makes me feel lonely, anxious and depressed.

I also feel depressed even before smoking weed, but Ive managed to fight that properly whenever ive detoxed weed for some weeks. But then I get tricked into smoking again because weed doesn’t make you physically dependent like cigs do, its all mental, your brain tricks you into thinking you want to smoke. But in reality all you are doing is sacrificing your natural joy for momentary happiness, and I hate it.

Just to clear something up, weed is not the cause of my depression or loneliness. I do think it caused my anxiety but my depression and loneliness come from different experiences my live has put me through. But instead of learning from them Ive learned to smoke them away. Last week I went a week with out weed, and I felt great in a weird way. It was like a different sort of high, I felt pure and clean and sharp. 

I realised what I had to do a long time ago, but I was stuck inside an ilusion, now after seeing what I could be, (without weed) I started to hate weed, I fucking hate it. I also hate that I spent so much time in love with it.

Something worth adding is that two weeks ago I tried mushrooms for the first time, and I had my first real bad trip, and it sort of fucked with my head because once it was over weed didnt feel the same, its like mushrooms made me realise something about me."
1487,I give up,"I’ve had major depressive disorder my entire life, and I finally had a handle on it. These last two weeks have been downhill for me. I’ve stopped taking my medication, and I’ve become chubby over the last couple years of recovering. I stopped eating again, I can’t seem to pick myself up anymore. I can’t get out of bed. I don’t want to be here anymore.
I think I’m just going to let it happen this time"
1488,How has your mental health changed for the better recently?,[removed]
1489,Need help for my brother (psychosis),"Hello there. My brother was diagnosed with psychosis about 5 years ago and he has injections every month for it. The problem is his voices seem to come and go and I think this is because along with the injections he takes, he also smokes weed. 

I am very scared because my brother lives with my mum who is very vulnerable. He has had violent outbursts and every time my mum tries to say no to him, he smashes up the house and start hitting or threatening my mum. He has always been violent and always wants his own way. If anyone tries to tell him something that he is doing wrong, he just flips out into his rages. 

He does dangerous things too such as going up to strangers and asking them if they sell drugs. He stares at random women and he plays loud music on his phone when he is on public transport. If we try to tell him that these things make people uncomfortable or that the music is loud he has a rage in public too which really upsets my mum. It's very hard for him to take advice and listen , he just does what ever he wants , when he wants. 

I really need advice on what to do because it's dragging me and my mum down. My mom is a single parent and my brother is 24 years old. He should be out there living a good life, earning his own income, have a partner but instead he is using all my mum's money and hasn't done anything with his life. It's frustrating because I'm trying to get on with my life and do good things but my brother is just mentally draining me and behaving like a child. It really hurts me to see how his life has turned out. I really want things to go well for him but it just seems to get worser and worser. 

Thank you for reading and I hope that someone can help me. I really appreciate it."
1490,How can I ask my doctor for medication,"I have tried everything. I've been with multiple counsellors and tried different grounding techniques, therapies, CBT, mindfulness and literally none of it makes a difference at all. It doesn't even begin to crack the surface of making me feel better, it doesn't even touch me. 

It is frustrating, I have tried so hard to get better but it is hopeless. I'm losing my sex drive, I'm growing further and further away from the people I know, my literally constant disassociation is killing me slowly. I feel like I'm drowning. 

I want to try medication, I know a few people with the same issues who tried it and it worked. How do I ask my doctor for it? How do I convince them to find the right one for me? A friend of mine told the doctor she would kill herself if they didn't give her a prescription, and it worked, but I don't think I could do that. 

I just need to know what to say to let my doctor know that this is what I need to try and I have done my time in other ways. Maybe some time I'll return to therapy but right now I don't have the time or the energy. I just need something to help get my brain back on track. Please advise. I'm being treated by the NHS if that makes any difference."
1491,I want to stop having outbursts,"I'm 15 m and I live with my close family in the same room. I'm the only boy in the room. I live with my sister and mom and I just can't help but notice their flaws. Don't get me wrong, I love them and they love me, but almost each and every day they do or act in a way that doesn't seem right in my perspective. An example, my mom's view on marriage. She says get married right away and never get a girlfriend. This was the kind of mentality that made her a single mom. And my sister, she's so immature sometimes and more sensitive than me, and I often dislike the her voice even though everyone loves her accent. My mom likes to keep the lights on in our room at night even though I made the commitment to sleep earlier from now on. And other flaws I see in them. Point is I don't like their behaviors and beliefs. Just today they made fun of me for not knowing Filipino even though I gave up learning the language I loved just so that I can get good at Filipino. A good analogy would be me fighting obesity and my mom and sister being thin all their lives and made fun of me being fat. This broke into an argument where I vented about me abandoning the language I chose and loved to learn and put a lot of time learning Filipino because it was more practical. And I just keep seeing a pattern of me having outbursts because I finally chose to say something about what I don't like about them. In hindsight, I'm probably not being tolerant and should just accept them for who they are, but it's so hard for me not to feel irritated with them. I don't wanna be one of those stereotypical teenagers who bemoan that no one understands them and their struggles, but damn it's so hard not to think like them when you live with people who don't really relate to you and your interests and struggles. I've never had a room of my own so that might be a big factor into why I'm so irritated and feeling so terrible. Especially in my age, being forced to share the same room with people isn't gonna be good for my mood and or mental health. What I want is to stop having these outbursts and arguments with my family"
1492,you have no worth,"if you ever have thoughts of being ""worthless"" or a ""waste of oxygen"" or anything of the like, you may catch yourself defending these views in your own head with flawed logic. this is because you cannot quantify human value. you can buy human body parts, skills, or services, and that will be of worth to the buyer, but is that what makes you who you are? what are you referring to when you say ""i""? is it your physical self, measured by the immediate value of what you can provide to other people? or is it the complex and intricate reality of your being? thoughts, emotions, and ideas are priceless. you are priceless, not because i just know youve done a bunch of great stuff your whole life, but because you always have been. by the time you were born, you had already made a significant impact on multiple lives. every time you see someone, connect with them, say anything at all to them, youve quite literally changed their life. you have caused so many good things, possibly bad things too, but the people you impacted wouldnt be where they are if it wasnt for you. nobody can replace you, simply because theyre not you, and never will be, no matter how hard they try. the fact that you are an individual, seperate from everyone else, different from every other person in one way or another, makes you priceless. 
take that as you please, just remember that its on you to decide what you believe and think of yourself and the world around you. 
with love"
1493,I made myself throw up after being clean for 2 years,"This past summer I've been having these urges to make myself throw up after I eat ""too much."" I haven't done it since July 2018 until today. I'm scared to tell my mom because she got really mad and made my sister monitor me for almost a month. I don't want to go through that again because I don't want to bother her again but I'm scared in going to rebuild the habit."

# Lions and tigers and bears...oh my!

Today is the first day of our course...or at least it should have been.

Course number 9. Welcoming a new, energised, nervous, excited and ready-to-go group of performers. Alas, it is not to be and in spite of the disappointment and heartbreak this year, we have against all odds come together even more. 

From chatting to friends and scrolling through a boundless amount of social media over the last few months, I have sensed an abundance of clarity, heart, passion and determination surfacing more than ever. I'd say that's pretty special and a sign that those rainbows really have made us stop and 'check in'. 

It has been a turbulent year for all of us, with our own physical and mental hurdles to overcome. Some days the white flag has been propped up, yet when a glimmer of motivation shimmers through, that glimmer has kept us battling on. We like to think it's the latter where we have truly shown resilience, strength and the determination to not take 'no' for an answer which I do believe is true, but the others have in some way perhaps been more significant. Allowing us to ponder on our thoughts, reflect and work through challenges in a way we often wouldn't allow ourselves time for. It's these times that can and maybe have been the scariest, most revealing and hardest to face, but in the long run will help create that clarity and direction we need. 

### We are all sailing on the same sea, yet on our own little boats going at very different speeds.

As we move forward, there is an evident imbalance in people's situations. Some are back at work, many are not and we have to be incredibly appreciative, mindful and understanding of this. The next few months will continue to be unpredictable and the only way we can get through this is by standing side by side and helping each other out. 

### Have the courage to push forward, but the heart to look behind. 

At this time, it is important to focus on you. Do what you need to do, but also reach out to check in with those who may be feeling left behind. With different responsibilities, commitments and living situations, non of us can compare (yes, we all know we still do) and need to keep reminding ourselves of this. 

### Where we're at now is not a testament of our talent, it's what we've done to survive. 

If you've been motivated for months and starting to feel that momentum flatten out, that's to be expected. Give yourself a break. If you're only now gaining momentum, don't feel guilty about that couch time. It was needed (and seriously, next time you get that might be when you retire).

If you've stayed motivated and still going strong....you deserve a holiday. If you've had to temporarily step away from your craft and the industry, then that's been 100% the right decision for you. Come back when you're ready. You never know there might be a stronger fire in your belly and a drive like you've never known after shifting focus for a while. 

Yes it's been pretty rubbish for most of us. Heartbreaking for many and a real challenge. 

But I think we can all agree there's a bucketful of goodness that has come from this that we need to carry with us and trust it will help us find a new and improved 'normal'. 

### Let's not forget, we wouldn't have the Hollywood we know and love today if it wasn't for the last pandemic. 

The cameras stopped rolling. There were no new 'movies'. Studios were shut down and headlines read 'The beginning of the end' for Hollywood. 

Yes, thanks to the 1918 Spanish Flu, Hollywood was hit hard. However, this resulted in the consolidation of multiple smaller film companies, making the big companies, BIG and giving us the Hollywood we know today.  If it wasn't for this, I'm not sure some of those magical movie moments we all know and love would even exist. And, I don't think life would be quite the same without 'There's no place like home' and other one liners that make us all warm and fuzzy inside. 

So, if we're going to learn anything from the past, it's that we will get through it, we *are* getting through it and we're doing it together, because together, 'we got this'. 

Let's look forward to when the industry is thriving once more and we can indulge in that moment in the theatre when you get all goosebumpy and emotional. Jeez, it's gonna be something else. 

No, we're not in Kansas any more, but at the end of this long road we might just end up somewhere kind of magical."
1495,I want to know what's wrong with me and what I can do to control myself,"I no longer know what's wrong with me or what I can do to keep myself into control, I do fear maybe I will end up to lose all my control and mess my life more than it had been.

Here a little resume of me:

I feel so lonely surrounded only by people that has something against me even including my own family and sometimes walking in public for me is a hell since I feel like people are staring at me seeing me weird or wanting to hurt me; I always feel my brain like being tired and have episodes in which I feel my body so full of energy but brain dead; my mood keeps swinging; I can't feel some emotions like sadness or normal joy; I'm so ignorant and sometimes too calm like I'm drugged; I'm having talking problems or I barely can start a conversation all because in my head is like a battle between ideas of what to talk; I'm so easily irritable sometimes and I become violent verbally in some cases even physically towards people no matter their relation towards me till I'm making myself having the last word; I'm so over confident yet to self hateful; I'm laughing with no control when people are suffering or passing a dramatic moment; there are simple stuff which reminds me easily about some sad moments which may drive me destructive/selfdestructive

If you would like to know more about me I'm up and comfortable to ask to any type of question."
1496,Intensive outpatient program vs partial hospitalization program? Alexandria VA area,"Hi I was wondering if anyone has experience with either of these programs? All advice and recommendations welcome. My mental health has reached a point where I think I need to be making it my main priority and getting back on medication and in therapy. I have done weekly therapists before and it hasn’t been enough and the idea of a structured program sounds like it will be extremely beneficial to me and help me turn my life around. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the last decade or so and have tried antidepressants etc but have been quick to give up when I found they weren’t working and my suicidal thoughts/ideation as of lately have been much more difficult to control and more active rather than passive, which is obviously scary. I also struggle with panic attacks and could potentially have another mood disorder or something else. I called a helpline today and the lady also mentioned looking into ketamine treatment if anyone has experience with that. Also I am not employed at the moment and think it’s a great opportunity to really focus on my mental health that I’ve overlooked far too much and make a change. 

My other question is: do you think this will all be done via telehealth/video because of COVID-19? It has made everything so much more difficult. 

Please and thanks in advance xoxo"
1497,Health Paranoia (is this normal?),"TW: illness (physical and mental), paranoia, mention of psych ward, and therapy. 

So, to start I’ll give a quick one over of me. I’m 18F, soon to be 19, I currently have been diagnosed such PTSD, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and physical health problems. The problem I have is I always see symptoms for syndromes/diseases (mental and physical) and stuff and I’m terrified I have them. But I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or if I actually am dealing with stuff?????? Like is this normal? I’m so scared. I’m not afraid of germs, but my heart races a tonnn when I stand up and I think it’s POTs but I saw one dr and they didn’t think anything was wrong with my heart. But I also have symptoms for autism but I’m afraid to get tested because I asked my mom and she got angry. But as I stated above, I have ADHD, and some of the symptoms overlap. So I don’t know if it’s paranoia or do I have a reason to worry. I also think my PTSD is C-PTSD. I never knew that was a thing until I saw someone mention it, and I fit the symptoms for that perfectly like a damn puzzle piece. I’m in between therapist and see a new one on September 18, 8 days after my birthday. And I don’t know when I should bring these worries up. Since it will be the first time I see them. I was just hospitalized in a psych ward for 3 days after talking to a social worker in Intensive Out-Patient. So I’m all over the place. Sorry if that didn’t make much sense. Any advice?.... 

TLDR: I have mental illness already diagnosed and physical illnesses too, but I also see symptoms for other illnesses and think I have them but don’t know if it’s paranoia?"
1498,Not sure what I’m feeling. Does anyone relate or know what I could be feeling?,"It is now week 3 of this hell. When it started 3 weeks ago I had a random out of the blue panic attack due to feeling extreme weakness/heaviness in my arms and a light headed heavy feeling in my head (I’ve been having that while falling asleep almost every night for a month before this) after eating. The panic lasted 3-4 hours with hysterical crying and thoughts I was dying. I calmed down eventually and went to sleep with the weakness and fatigue still there. 

I woke up the next morning and (this is where it gets tricky for me to describe what I’m seeing/feeling) everything looks the same, no hallucinations, no out of body vision, no weird shapes or sizes of myself or things in my view, but something just feels off? Nothing looked/looks the way it did before the panic attack when I was “normal” living my day to day life. Everything looks and feels different. I haven’t been able to watch anything, be on my phone, look outside, be outside, cook, clean, shower because it doesn’t look how it used to. It’s like I can’t fully grasp what I’m looking at.
That’s the best way I can explain it. 

After waking up with this I cried all day, my boyfriend tried driving around with me and going to a park to enjoy the beautiful day and hopefully calm me down, but all it did was make me more anxious and depressed. The next day was the same, I noticed I had no appetite, and didn’t care about anything other than feeling normal again. Not even 1million dollars can make me feel better. I cried all day to the point I couldn’t open my eyes. I ended up going to my moms and have been here ever since. I can’t bare being at my own apartment for some reason. 

There are moments I have been able to handle this, where I calm myself down or can zone out for a few minutes and tell myself that it’ll pass soon, but this feeling in my gut absorbs me and tells me otherwise. 

My family has been able to eat, watch movies, work, and laugh while I find myself feeling dead inside with fear and lack of enjoyment. I feel like I can’t enjoy anything until I’m better. I can only tolerate looking at the tv or my phone at night, it’s like my anxiety goes to bed before I do. 

I went to the ER two nights ago to see if something like my thyroid was out of wack or some sort of physical problems, and everything came back normal. I finally have been eating more than just turkey meat, yogurt, and soup. Everytime I try eating in general I get weaker and my anxiety starts up a bit. I was having yellow watery liquid stools for days but now I’m doing better bathroom wise. I’m now on my phone typing this because I want to know what this is or if anyone relates/has advice."
1499,The Authorities came in my house today,"It was the 2nd time they came (the one was 2 months ago) after I called the Hotline...

Scenario when the Cops were knocking in my house:
&gt;
Stepmom: ""WHY IS THERE POLICE?""
&gt;
Me: ""I called the Hotline tonight... I was depressed.""
&gt;
Stepmom: ""OH MY GOD! WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GONNA BE DEPRESSED ABOUT!""
&gt;
Stepsister: ""FOR FUCKS SAKE. It's 1 IN THE MORNING!""
&gt;

&gt;
Today my Dad talked to me but pretty much blamed me for having depression and told me I'm the one who thinks this way &amp; I only think about myself.

I told him you guys don't understand me but he just invalidated my feelings yet again which triggered my suicidal thoughts yet again.
&gt;


It made me feel worse... But the authorities came to me today and asked me if I need to go to the hospital I refused it. But they talked me out to it."
1500,I can't eat,"Every time I think of eating,  I feel sick. I'm hungry but I have to force myself to eat. I don't know how to fix it"
1501,How do you know you need help?,[removed]
1502,"If I'm severely depressed and suicidal but I don't tell anyone and act on it, is it my fault for not telling anyone or their fault for not noticing and not doing anything about it?","I'm not saying anyone is literally at fault because I did the action, I would have made the conscious decision to do it.

But, I know everyone blames themselves and others no matter what. If you think about it from that sense, is it my fault for not telling anyone I'm struggling and for those who I did tell, is it their fault (again not literally fault, but is it on them, in a way?) for not doing more to help, and for those who didn't know but were friends with me, their fault for not noticing?

But again, at the end of the day I know it's me making the decision to do it."
1503,Suicidal ideation after the end of a long term relationship,"TW: s*icidal thoughts, self harm, substance abuse, abusive relationship dynamics

I have no idea if this is the right place to post this or not. I don’t use reddit often, but I can’t seem to find anything about this topic online. When I search “bpd breakup s*icidal” or something to that effect, I just get all these awful pages about how a neurotypical person broke up with someone with BPD and now the BPD ex is threatening to kill themselves. This is not my situation. 

I am a pretty quiet borderline, who has always just been the hallmark for self destructive BPD. I experience the classic symptoms of intense fears of abandonment (both perceived and actual), impulsivity, anger and suicidal ideation/self harm. Those are the big ones for me, but lately I’ve been swimming in suicidal thoughts even more so than usual due to a breakup that has left me feeling, truly, that there is no point to living. In my head, my only two options are to repair the relationship with my ex and win him back or to kill myself, because no one else will ever be him and without him, I am nothing. Clearly the first option is not possible because it’s been nearly five months since our breakup and he has moved on. 

We broke up simply because we grew apart, or rather, he told me that we did and I had to just accept it..to this day I do not believe his reasoning was valid. He knew my ideals and life goals and basically told me “well I’ve come to realize the things you want don’t align with what I want.” No further explanation, as he told me he didn’t have to go more in depth than that. Naturally I have spent the past 5 months wondering what was so catastrophically wrong that he had to leave me after all of the time and love I invested in him. But I suppose that just wasn’t enough. I know it’s typical of someone with BPD to say that they weren’t at fault for something like a breakup, but in this instance, I really do not think it was anyone’s real “fault” that this happened. My most toxic trait in the relationship was codependency and constantly grappling with mental health issues that I often discussed way too much, without consideration for my partner’s well being. 

Anyways. I have had a history of physically, emotionally and sexually abusive long term relationships and this was the first one where I had a partner who didn’t treat me like shit or abuse me..well, not until the end when he stopped communicating and would verbally degrade me and get mad and yell at me or tell me I was just “dramatic” and “irrational” and needed to just “suck it up and be an adult.” But in comparison to the abuse I faced at the hands of previous partners, this relationship was perfectly fine and healthy— quite literally the best one I’ve ever had. And now it’s over for no real reason and it’s permanent and I can’t get it back and it’s all I think about. 

I have had 3 different overdoses and one other incident over the past 5 months. On top of that I’ve spiraled back into regular sh and substance abuse because if I’m not drunk or high or hurting physically, then all I think about is planning my own death. And I don’t want to keep thinking about it. I am actively seeing a psychiatrist and therapist on a weekly basis, I am taking my meds and have even called a suicide prevention line recently, but unfortunately I am still struggling.

So, yeah, idk, that’s where I’m at and I was wondering if anyone on here has been or is in a similar situation and could maybe give me some form of advice or even just tell me that I’m not completely alone with these intense, seemingly irreversible feelings? 
Everyone I’ve talked to has told me I’m just being dramatic and have other good things in my life and I should focus on those, but I honestly don’t have a clue about how to shift my focus from my ex and our dead relationship to literally anything else. I feel like I truly can’t live without him, and now he won’t even talk to me because we’re “taking a break” from each other. I’m sure he’s already found someone else, and if that fear gets confirmed, it might just be the last straw for me. I can’t handle any more abandonment right now."

1505,"I need to get this of my chest. (M,16)","I have been talking to myself a lot about my mental state and about talking to someone about it and I hope talking about it will make me fell better.


I recently moved from ksa ( a first world country ) to Egypt because of taxes and my family's shit financial state. My dad has been unemployed for more than a year. After going to Egypt everything started going to shit, I with my family moved to my grandma's house because our isn't ready. My mom is always either crying or angry. My grandma also is always crying. The mood is very negative. That plus my 3 younger siblings ( twin girls 14 years old and a 6 old boy ) that always make me angry.

1506,How do I ask my therapist to be medicated?,"Hi. So I am a minor (17) and this year I started going to therapy, where I have been working through my anxiety and depression. In retrospect it seems I have suffered from terrible anxiety since elementary school, but just didn't know it. 

Anyway, my anxiety has been worsening and nothing that my therapist recommends to help is actually helping. it has gotten to the point where I believe the nausea and GI issues i've been experiencing- which have gotten so bad I just had to go for an endoscopy- have been entirely anxiety-caused. I, and my parents, believe I have reached the point where I should be medicated. 

My problem is that I don't know how to bring up this conversation with my therapist. I am doing therapy over the phone currently and have been since march, and because of this I haven't been able to delve deeply into my mental health or really make any breakthroughs because of a lack of private space where my family members cannot hear me. So I don't know if my therapist even really has a grasp on how bad my anxiety is, if I've been able to convey that to her or not. so how do I ask about medication?"

1509,My Sisters Emotional Stress,"I think my sister is dealing with her emotions in the wrong way. My sister has horrible anxiety and mild depression. She used to tell us this, but she didn't really ever show any symptoms of this, at least none that were concerning. But suddenly she started to just blurt out everything that was bothering her, like family stuff and emotional things. My family and I thought this was good because she was finally telling us how she was feeling and how to help her. But suddenly she started to do things that I dont think are normal. She started going around the house and finding random objects to inspect. Every object that she would look at, she would come up with some crazy story about or family based on the object itself. Let me explain; one of the objects she inspected was a model boat. The boat modeled after the type of boats that conquistadors used. My sisters best friend is half Hispanic. She for some reason saw this as an ""other worldly"" connection and now 100% believes that her best friend is our long lost brother. Not only that, she also believes that our family is either related to George Washington or Harriet Tubman (she doesnt know which). If we try to tell her that none of what she is saying makes sense, she says we dont listen and have never been the family she needed. Aside from the object thing, she also believes 100% that all of our dead family members reside in our house, that they drain her energy, and protect us from the many demons in our home. She made us leave all the lights on in the house while she walked around and with water and blessed every room. And last but not least she believes that she can predict when something bad is going to happen. She made my whole family wait in her room for 45 minutes because she was too scared to be alone. She said she ""knew"" that at 9:45 something was going to happen and that she wanted us to be with her. Nothing happened. Oh ya, and she refers to herself In the third person. She also claims that she has never felt better, but my family and I are very concerned for her mental health. We are getting her a therapist, but when she believes in something she is very stubborn, so I'm not sure if it's going to help. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, Is this a normal thing to go through with bad anxiety?, Is my sister having a mental breakdown?, Is there something bigger at play here?, and How can my family and I help her? 

I'm open to any suggestions."
1510,I feel no one will ever love me again,I don’t know how normal this is or if I’m just going crazy but I had a relationship 3 months ago and I’m still torn up and I feel like I will never be happy. I feel empty like part of me is gone forever and nothing can fix it. No one even cares if I try to reach out and they all just say get over but I can’t no matter how hard I try.
1511,"Is it normal to become very chill and have few emotions despite being a happy, energetic person in the past?",[removed]
1512,Is there something wrong with me?,"I’ve had a lack of empathy and emotion my whole life and just low mood, I’m never happy and I’m mostly just sad. I don’t care about anything and I try my hardest to change that but it doesn’t work. I recently broke up with my gf of 2 years who was a large part of my life and basically one of my only friends,because I find it really hard to talk to new people and make friends, and I don’t know if it’s worth going on anymore. I have no goals, no passion, and I’m just sad. Am I fucked up or something"
1513,i don’t feel okay.,"i feel so annoying. i always talk about my interests so much and i feel like my friends are getting tired of it. my friend said she didn’t like a show, and when i asked why, she said “because you talk about it too much.” and now i keep wondering if i should just stop talking because i know it’s annoying to talk about the same things over and over, but i dont have anyone else to talk about them with. i feel like my friends only hang out with me because they pity me."
1514,What else can I try?,"Three months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD and a generalized anxiety disorder.  I have reached the lowest point in my treatment (thus far) and really feel ""backed into a corner"".  I have been put on multiple medications, one of which took away my short term memory but helped with anxiety (which I ended to salvage my mind for my college career), one of them made me exhausted and did literally nothing for the anxiety...and the other upset my stomach.  I have also tried two different sleeping pills one of which made me feel HORRIBLE for a full 48 hours and the other is a controlled substance that sedates me, but so far I haven't noticed it working and I have been unable to sleep soundly.  I have been combining my medication with weekly therapy visits to try and learn techniques that will help calm me down, or completely stop an anxiety attack caused by constant memories from a traumatic experience that took place in 2018.  The last few days have been really difficult for me.  I have had minimal sleep, none of my techniques are working anymore and I can't calm myself down.  My frequent nightmares have returned at full blast and I am probably more anxious then when I initially began treatment.  I really feel like none of my meds have worked for me and therapy takes a while to work, we are only just now getting to the core of my problems, so much has yet to be uncovered and understood.  I am also dealing with some worries that my husband will be killed at work and I can't handle the thought of something like that.  I have tried many times to explain my discomfort with his line of work and my growing concern for his safety and our future as more and more close calls happen.  I really feel like I only have my husband on my ""team"" and I am very scared someone is going to take him away from me.  It is difficult to constantly hide my constant worry and support his career choice, but I do it because I love him and I know he was born to do his job, and at one point I had a very similar career path that I felt strongly about and excelled at, so I understand why he does what he does.  It doesn't really make it any easier for me to accept, and as each day passes, I grow more and more sad that it will be our last day together.  I do not know how else I can help myself, I am still taking meds that don't work and seeing a therapist weekly as I've been told to do.  I talk to my husband to a point, but don't want him to give up what he loves or make him choose between myself and his career.  I have no idea how to balance everything, let alone how to calm myself down.  I have been drinking more and more frequently and fear that it could become a habit for me because when I drink I feel numb and I can sleep soundly.  Does anyone out there have any suggestions? Has anyone dealt with this in the past? I am not really depressed I am just VERY anxious and can't shake the intrusive thoughts and memories no matter what I try.  What else can I do? (Sorry for the many run on sentences and grammatical mistakes)."
1515,tornado of sh!t,"i make this a vent worth reading, I think....

back 5 year. got a good jobs loving if, finally getting our finance in line. enjoying my 2yo. wife got a new better job. fantastic.....
here come the tornado of shit.

i get injured at work. lower back. no biggie we have DRs on site. at fires it muscular they say. so i get push in a corner to ""heal up"".  ah! I had to work harder there that before.


3 year of the same job bs, the Dr finally send me to a mri. turn out I got 3 garbage disk. not much they can do, or willing to do.

last year they moved me in a different spot for work. but it our of town and it cost me more now to work.
I'm financially tight but ok. i had Dr and therapists but now im away and need to find some in the new town.

I had bought a house with a in-law suite, instead of sending them in a retirement home. (I know this sound selfish) but one of them died. the other one is rethinking his existence, and having major mental breakdown. (3/4 understandable).

since August they change my job again. I'm with a high volume, high risk, fast paced corner. but I can't do nothing (medical paper) I'm supervising a guy older than me ( he was running the shop alone for the pass 2 year. I think they made a superior spot just to say I have a job.

im away from my family, I'm gaining less money now that for a job im useless and not needed. i can't got my family the support they need (mentally because of the death, and physically because of my back)
I haven't done any of my hobbies in 4 year or seriously played with my kid.


I can't sleep because my mind got 1000mph as soon as a lay down... I'm stuck in the shit tornado.
with no one to talk, no real exit, and 6h away from my home. I'm going to have a break down soon.

sh!t didn't hit the fan. the fan is made of it."

1517,"I meed to lose weight for my health but I have such bad habits and a bleak outlook on life, I don’t even know why I should try.","5’1. 26 y/o female. Overweight at 180lbs. I’m told “I carry it well” by friends and family but fact of the matter is I’m fucking fat because I was pencil thin as a teenager and built my habits around being able to eat whatever I want. 

[I had a health episode recently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ijfl6d/covid_can_suck_a_god_damn_tailpipe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I was told that I could help to avoid it happening again by shedding a few pounds.

What the hell is the point though. We’re all gonna die anyways. I have other health issues going on (endometriosis, bipolar disorder and now this) and I have lost any semblance of being a healthy human being anyways. At the rate I’m going I’m probably never going to have children. So why the hell should I even bother acting like I have a future when my poor health has already taken almost everything else from me?

I worked hard and got a pilot license, but then one health issue reared its ugly head and I couldn’t get my medical renewed. Then I worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer but people didn’t like that I had to take so much time for doctor’s appointments. So I can’t even work in the field that I’m passionate about and I’m stuck working some shitty entry level job at a farm supply store that caters to industrial farming— an industry that I have actively spoken against in the past.

Ah, how the turn tables. Hello, boulevard of broken dreams. 

I feel fucking dead inside. My counsellor quit his job to focus on his own passions. Which is great for him lol but fuck is it hard to get mental health care (well, any fucking health care) in this province. 

The medical system couldn’t care less about me. I’ve been on so many waitlists the past 2ish years that have yet to come to fruition. Family doctor. Psychiatrist. Allergist. Now you can add neuro-ophthalmologist to that list too because even after being literally stabbed in a back to make fluid leak out of my skull, I could be waiting months for a follow-up appointment. Pretty much the only thing keeping me going is my husband and my dogs. 

But that’s not enough to convince me why I should bother trying to change my habits when I don’t even have any goals anymore. Like, why bother when it doesn’t even feel like I’m living. I’m just existing. And for what? A childless, friendless, lonely future in some nursing home to be abused by nursing staff and not allowed to see my husband or any family I may end up having?

Death is a subject I am incredibly uncomfortable with talking about, probably because I haven’t lived a life I’m happy with. This latest ordeal, more than anything, has forced me to really look at myself and think. That’s all I could think about while I was in the MRI. Like fuck. If they found cancer or something, what a waste of skin I have been.

And not for lack of trying, either. It’s just, my health always seems to hold me back from the things I am truly passionate about. 

So what is the point?

Or, more simply, what’s the point of living if we’re all just gonna die anyways?"

Got called a terrible father. Later on, got chewed out because I'm on disability for severe depression and we have to put our kid in daycare some days so the wife can work a few shifts. Then, I got grumpy about some minor annoyance and she remarked that I should ask for some pills that will make me more mature next time. 

I want to self harm again. I'm having really bad thoughts right now. I can't stand who I am anymore."
1523,I just cried for the first time in 4+ years,"So recently, as in yesterday, I cried for the first time in a long time. I’m currently a freshman on college and the last time I cried was sometime before high school so that’s at least 4 years.

During those 4 years I definitely had times I wanted to cry but I held it in because men crying is often look down upon by society

It was a weird experience, even after I got over the reason I started crying the tears just wouldn’t stop flowing and I continued to cry for like an additional 30 minutes for no real reason at all.

But I felt a lot better after I finished. This post is kinda a vent I guess, but I just want people to know that it’s ok to cry and honestly don’t hold it in. After you cry you will feel a lot better, I know I did."

Still, I don't think I have depression, I never spent a long period of time incapable of doing anything, I just...
Can't find motivation to do anything, I can concentrate on my hobbies, sometimes, but I can't do actual work and study. I feel like I can't breathe because I'm so afraid of what my future will be.
It's Adhd? I don't know! What is it!? 
And even if people try to give me affection, I can't trust them,  it always feels so fake.
I feel like nobody loves me, they're just acting nice until they find someone better to talk to.
Is it because my family was never that affectionate?
Is it because they have some narcissist traits I can't recognize?
Is it because I never got compliments growing up and nobody believes I can have success being an artist?
Is it all the bullism I experienced in school?

I'm just a failure of human being or there is something that needs to be fixed?

I'm so tired, I can't cry myself to sleep and feel shitty...

1525,"For those who were suicidal, how’d you get out of it?","So, this isn’t an easy topic for me, but depression runs in my family.  I, personally, am fine, though in the past, I wonder if I had some sort of mild depression / anxiety thing going on.  But, my grandfather killed himself before I was born, my mom suspects she has depression sometimes, and one of my close family members has mentioned suicide a lot lately.  She says she’s kill herself if not for the prospect of what comes after death (she doesn’t want to be floating around forever, unable to interact.). In the past, she’s said she’s too scared.  I don’t see it happening anytime soon.

Due to COVID, there aren’t any therapists available for several months, though the physician has proscribed antidepressants. My family member mentions suicide almost every day in some way or another and says she’s just tired of everyone pretending to be happy.  She can never find joy in the simple things in life and is bored by them, and I don’t believe her moral consideration extends too far beyond herself (and she herself is pointless in her own eyes.). It’s all really bleak and nihilistic.  I can talk about what makes life meaningful for me forever, but it just doesn’t translate for her.

For those who are depressed, what helped you find joy in life when everything seems bleak?  Maybe I can try talking from a perspective she’d relate to."

Like my body basically convulses because it hurts so bad but nothing is actually happening and each time it happens it lasts roughly 5-7 minutes.  The image of it wont leave my head either while it’s happening, I can hear the sounds it’s making and see it happening in my head while physically feeling it.  Tonight it happened and right after I began hyperventilating and crying uncontrollably.  Has anyone experienced something like this or know what it could be related to??

1532,Ruminating too much, I'm alone far more than I originally was this quarentine. I find myself ruminating on how I feel like a bad person because of my low self esteem. I obsessively loop  mentally about things I did wrong in the past and sometimes feel useless. Its not depression I don't think because I'm sleeping and eating and doing things fine. I find myself feeling agressive in the head because I feel like everyone hates me therefore I need to defend myself. My inner critic just won't shut up. It keeps replaying every nook and craney of the bad things in me. I feel useless if I cannot complete tasks that I expect myself to complete and I'm getting harsher with myself. I contemplate if I should do some things publicly because part of me says nobody cares anyways but the other part of me says they hate me and will judge me. I feel like I'm just there sometimes  as an average bystander with nothing people should concern themselves with.
1533,Does anyone else ever experience this?,"Whenever I have ruminations recently on how sometimes I feel like nobody truly enjoys having me around I start to have this seizing feeling in my chests that causes my body to physically coil up.

1534,I ask for your honest opinion about these fears I'm having.,"I love my girlfriend and I accept her exactly the way she is.

Thing is, I'm afraid. She has a variety of challenges, such as OCD, PTSD, and a past that would be enough to break most people twenty times over. 

She sees a therapist and takes medication. It works - even if we have some difficult nights going to sleep, it works and she is stable.

What I'm afraid of is the future. I just can't shake it off. What if something bad happens and she takes a drastic turn? What if we have kids, I die, and she breaks? What if the medicine she takes - like, eight pills a day (morning and night) eventually breaks something in her body?

Maybe I need to live Today, or perhaps I need to have faith. She is astonishingly amazing. But I'm loving her more with every page that turns, and I'm afraid it'll hurt too much if something like this happens.

Honest, unbiased opinion will be appreciated.

Thanks."

1536,"Helped some unlucky teens, now I feel guilty/unsure about what I did and am on the verge of relapsing on bad habits","So some backstory, my (23F) little sister and her friend (both 18F) were out eating after trying to visit a theme park (dumb idea, it was busy and hot as hell but we did out best to stay safe). A pair of young looking girls come up and ask if they could use one of our phones to Instagram message someone to pick them up. They had literally nothing on them, just the clothes on their back and they were a little scratched up too.   


I don't really have alarm systems in my head about potential scams or the dangers of strangers, but I'm pretty awkward around people and a little anxious about how I come off so I normally opt not to talk to strangers when possible. I didn't even have Instagram so I couldn't offer my phone up. They use my sister's friend's phone to try to get someone to give them a ride.   


Pretty much the moment one of them first mentioned that she was running from her foster family, we started encouraging them to join our table and talked to them a bit more. One had been separated from her siblings hours away and was in an abusive foster home, the other had been abused and molested by her foster family and was running away with this girl (who I believe she barely knew from I don't even know where), both confessed to being hooked on drugs before.   


They were pretty adamant about not wanting any food and just wanting to try to get a ride, but I got them food anyway. I don't even really know what came over me but I just wanted them to be comfortable and tried to joke and start a conversation, which was mostly a little awkward for me and I kept feeling like I was fucking up each time silence came back around but they relaxed at least a little.   


Then it came out that they wouldn't be able to get a ride until the next day. They were asking if we could look up where a store was that they could get some first aid stuff and we found one and ended up giving them a ride there and buying some stuff they'd need from water to candy to tampons to a flip phone for them to contact their ride (my little sister was suggesting the more practical stuff, I was too frazzled to think of anything besides comfort items).   


I really wish that we could have offered them a place to stay too, but with us living with my parents who definitely wouldn't have been okay with the surprise guests, and the fact that they were 17 &amp; 16, they wouldn't have been able to stay in a hotel room alone (plus the fact I'm the state I live in it's a felony to harbor a runaway for like 24 hrs).   


We ended up dropping them off at a McDonalds that's open 24hrs like they wanted, told them to make sure they stayed safe and looked out for each other, and to call us for whatever reason.  


I know we did a lot, logically, I should feel okay, but I feel horrible that we couldn't do more, and I keep on agonizing over whether or not I did the right thing. I had known I live a really privileged life and that I was sheltered, but it really shook me to my core to see these girls that were really struggling and had some horrible shit happen to them.   


I didn't know if I should have called the police, but as someone who has a deep distrust of the police, that didn't feel right either. I also don't know if maybe it was some kinda weird scam and I was too trusting and naive. My sister and her friend were apparently on high alert the whole time, so I also feel horrible for putting them in that uncomfortable situation just because I wanted to help these strangers. I have a thing about being insecure about not being adult enough, and I feel like maybe I fucked up somehow.   


Now I can't stop thinking about if they're okay or not and I feel horrible about leaving them on their own. I also keep thinking about how I was probably too overly generous and maybe made them feel uncomfortable (I was pushing them to get whatever they wanted/needed and then some). Basically that stems from when I went really over the top for my sister's friend's birthday (she's like a sister to me too), and my dad finally went past the 'you shouldn't be spending that much on gifts' to, 'the over the top generosity is weird and you make people feel uncomfortable'.   


I'm kinda spiraling, keep on crying, and I'm getting those self-loathing urges that I used to have. I almost dug up an exacto knife I know I have in the back of my drawer so I could cut, and considered swallowing a few pills so I could just pass out. My sister and I decided not to tell our parents about what we did cause we know they wouldn't be happy about it, and I don't want to talk about it to my sister cause I already confide in her so much about everything. I know she'd say it's okay, but I still feel like a burden anyway cause I'm supposed to be the older sister and be there for her, she shouldn't have to deal with my shit too.   


Anyway... TLDR: helped a couple of abused kids but not as much as I wish I could have. Now I feel bad/guilty, almost relapsed in some bad habits, and feel bad about talking to my sister about it cause she already does so much for me."
1537,"I don't know if this is depression, but..","I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I often feel anxious and worried I might have ruined my life and I'll never be able to sort things out (e.g find a job, become financially stable, etc). I have a very low self esteem, most of the time thinking I'm the worst ever at everything I try to do. I think I might really hate myself (wishing I was someone else), although I don't know if that's a thing.

Yes, I've been to therapy multiple times. No, it didn't help.

I was just wondering if what I described are common symptoms or not. The only thing I haven't tried yet are drugs as I'm a little concerned. So if anyone had similar issues, managed to get them under control and wants to share their experience I would be thankful."
1538,Was this insensitive?,"Hi. So I've had another depressive episode a few weeks before December last year and I've wanted to off myself for reasons that it drained most of my energy. A little back story though, I have been clinically diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (2017) and I've been battling it. It's been getting a bit okay since I've taken medication. But there are episodes that are inevitable.

So back to that, I was so sad I asked a very close friend and talked to them that I wanted to disappear. They stopped me and said I shouldn't. They reasoned out that ""the expenses that will cost you and your family will be more than the actual cost  of them giving birth to you"". Do know that I live in a third world country (but we have decent internet, somehow) though for the most parts, be the commodities are not cheap. And honestly speaking my family is in the lower middle class and we can only do so much since my folks are old and my sister has a Learning disability.

Now being the ""closest"" to ""normal"" person, I took their words by heart yet I got stuck. I was torn. Was it ok? Was it not? It was a grey area. Though definitely I stopped. Though that wasn't the reason why I didn't continue with my plan (my mom cried and it was painful).

Now earlier in the news, they had this featured story about the many industries in different places. They had these customized hearses in an African country: colorful, animal-inspired, and made out of wood.

This thought just crossed my mind then, recalling that incident.

Was it insensitive for a sane person to present  a ""summary of expenses"" to  a depressed person who plans to kill themselves?"
1539,Boss yelled at me for being bipolar,"I work at a bank cafe and part of the job is remembering names, faces, etc. I was taking lamictal and still getting used to it, which means my memory is like a leaky sieve. I would ask my co-workers for their names roughly every day, because my short term memory was shot. Let me repeat again, because of my bipolar medicine, I could not remember a damn thing. Plus I was trying something new to help with my attention span, and it was really hard to function at work.

The owner comes by for a cup of coffee. I politely ask her what name to put on the cup. She says:

""Are you serious? Do you know who I am?"" 
Insert dramatic pause
""I'm the owner. God, we've met like 5 times.""
In some weird way to normalize what happened, I asked ""so, what are you having today"" and she just walked away in mid sentence.

I'm already dealing with bipolar and trying to find a medicine that doesn't make me feel like shit all the time. After 4 months, I'm in a place where I feel like myself. 
I just feel like I'm the world's punching bag. Dealing with bipolar is bad enough, I'm trying to act normal at work even though I feel paranoid and spacey the entire time. And then, to just trample my self esteem even more. I get yelled at by the owner. For something I cannot control. For a disability that fucks up my short term memory. I never told anyone, because I don't like talking and I shouldn't have to explain my mental illness 

It happened a while ago so it's nothing to say about it now. I just feel like the world's punching bag. My self esteem was low already, but now it's just shot to the fucking ground. I just really don't understand why this keeps happening to me. It's really hard to work because the lamictal makes me feel sleepy and unable to function, and when I do I can't concentrate to do any tasks. It just feels as if I can never catch a fucking break. I still think about it time to time. honestly just makes me think there's no fucking reason to keep doing it if Everytime I try, something or someone just knocks me down."

So as with many, covid is taking a toll on my mental health and I'm noticing signs of a depressive episode again and I feel so much pressure from work, friends, family, and my relationship. It feels as though everything is too much to handle right now and I've lost interest in doing a lot of things I used to enjoy. I have been smoking weed to get by and I definitely have been abusing it to an extent and I'm at the point now where I barely enjoy that, just doing it because it's routine and feels comforting and helps take the edge off of everything. I'm planning on taking a break now that I've finished up what I've had. I've also been seeing a therapist for the past several weeks and that's helping a bit. I'm not worried too much about my friends or job, as I know those will be there, however I feel like my relationship is slipping because of this. I still love my boyfriend very much, I just feel hopeless and stagnant and need some tips on how to reinforce my relationship so I don't lose that. I know he understands my mental health and is very supportive, but I want to feel like I'm contributing and make it seem like I'm actually putting in effort even though sometimes I feel like I can't even get out of bed in the morning. 

Anything helps! Thanks in advance."
1546,I just need some feedback and assurance.,"     I’ve always been so shy. Specially in social situations. Throughout my entire life. I don’t know the right way to take a joke, joke with people and just generally flirt or have a regular conversation.
     Fast forward to 2 months ago and my life took a spontaneous turn where I thought I was finally gaining my confidence to just be who the fuck I want to be and not care what others think and let my desires just fall in place, but here about an hour and 50 minutes into my 28th birthday and I’m feeling the low I’ve felt my entire life, again. 
     Anyways, I’m also a bit under the influence of alcohol, and since covid went out for the first and got into no bars. I watched as others were let in, who weren’t waiting in lines. Now being driven home and I can’t help but spiral into sad thoughts about who I am, what I’ve wanted to be and who I will become as a person. 
     I’m sorry for being all over the place with this post. Recently I responded to 2 post on this sub through comments, thinking that I can help others, but the truth is that I still need so much work to be done for my own self.

1548,Is it worth it?,"hey, Dark Lord of the Sith here (m28) and I'd like some advice from you all.   


Is it worth it? I've  been wanting to speak to my parents, Mom, in particular, about how they handle situations. Long story short, but my parents, especially my mother, cannot take disagreements and the arguments normally conclude in an emotional, shouting match between us.   


The most recent experience was due to my current living situation. Again, long story short, I suggested either 1) my sibling and I (f25) move out of our apartment in the city due to a) the pandemic and my city is a hot-spot b) Living costs are expensive and I'm not comfortably managing to cover the costs, while still trying to save and get my shit sorted. 2) She goes back home due to a) she isn't working and not bringing in a livable income. My parents and I are covering her rent and living costs 80% of the time. 3) Til now, she hasn't made an effort to get any sort of work. 

I'm in no way financially sound (I'm considered a ""junior"" in my field + my salary isn't sufficient) to be ""supporting"" two people. If we move to a cheaper place, outside of the city, we could be saving money + maybe, even get a ""nicer"" place. I'm essentially living paycheck to paycheck.  


I approached the situation as best as I could and with as little emotion as I can. At the onset, I requested that they PLEASE listen, first, before jumping in. I managed to get through most of what I wanted to say, not at any point blaming, raising my voice or being rude. 

However, for some or other reason, my parents took offense to something I said and made the entire situation out as being, my way of wanting to ""kick my sister out our apartment"" so I can live alone. I called them out on this and without trying to sound annoyed (at this point) said that this is definitely not what it's about. Nope, the rest of the call was spent shouting at each other, until I just said I've had enough and put the phone down. Mind you, during this call, my parents really let me have it and I got a good idea of what they actually think of me at this point and it hurts a lot.   


The next day, both of them didn't want to speak about it. When I brought it up and asked why it had to end up in such a heated argument, to the point where some pretty hurtful things were exchanged?  Their response, in most cases, is 1) Silent treatment - they won't call and/or message for days 2) Play dumb when I confront them about it 3) Plainly just deny it happened and/ or X things were said -&gt; however, whatever said to + about me still stands.  


I'm just confused about it all, because on one side, I'm being told I need to be more upfront with my feelings towards them and when I'm struggling (I struggle a lot with my own mental health, something I haven't really spoken to them about - another story). But, on the other hand, my experience has been, when I do want to speak about something (ANYTHING) it usually ends up in an argument and I leave the ""conversation"" worse off + I'm usually the villain.

I do genuinely love my parents, but, it's like they want me to act as an adult, yet still be treated as a child.   


Sorry for the rant, but thanks for ""listening"". Honestly, at the end of it, I've been struggling and would appreciate your perspectives on this, even if it's telling me to shut it.

1549,why do i find social interaction so exhausting?,sometimes i go weeks without answering texts and calls because i just don’t feel like responding. talking just feels like a chore rather than something i enjoy doing. is there something wrong with me? why do i struggle to feel content around anyone? i’m either anxious to get away or i feel bored(?? not exactly bored but idk what other word to use. i guess i just don’t feel 100% into the conversation?). why am i like this

1551,What would you do?,"So, I’ve had no motivation to find a relationship for about a year maybe year and a half, then I randomly start talking to this girl and she quite quickly starts asking to hangout and showing she’s interested. Now, because I’m a royal fuck up, I decided her liking me must mean I like her, so, as a result... (quick disclaimer here, sorta. I’m generally good at knowing what people want to hear, and over time I’ve just kinda said whatever people want to hear... probably part of my issue.) but anyways as a result I decided to reciprocate, and what would ya know, now she calls me every night and we text lots in the day. 

Whenever she calls me I get stressed out, but reluctantly I answer. We talk and I usually agree to stay on the line till she falls asleep, lately I’ve just made excuses to stop calling early though. She talks a lot and generally I ask a lot of questions to avoid talking about myself because I always feel like whatever I talk about will bore the living shit out of people (like this post). She I can tell she feels left out of the loop of what’s going on with me, ironically me being interested in her is only one of the things, but it makes me constantly feel like shit.

We hangout fairly often, and I usually enjoy parts of it, but half the time I feel no emotions towards her. Now she wants to take things a little further physically. A year ago I would’ve loved that, but now I constantly feel like shit and am stressed out, so as one might imagine that’s not really what I need right now, because all it really does is cause me to overthink about what I’m doing. 

I’ve bruised my legs a lot because it’s helping me deal with stress and shit, but on top of everything else, she definitely can’t see that, so idk what in the floppity floppity fuck to do because despite having no real issues in life. I feel like a fucking waste of space and me not understanding what’s wrong with me doesn’t help.


If you’ve read this far, I’m concerned but appreciative, so if you have any opinions or just want to know what the point of this shitty post is, please comment. If your gonna say I need help, I’m aware, but I can assure you the only people I talk to about my problems is anonymously (sorta) on here."

1553,How to get an assessment done,"So pretty sure I need an assessment done. 

Had a really bad dream about a parasite that transmitted through sight. Quick version is someone gave it to me to force me to host it and it left me for the person how have it to me. When I woke up I felt like I had to keep it a secret or they'd reinfect me. 

It's stuck with me all day. I felt like I couldn't google or look up information about this parasite (that I know doesn't exist) I felt like I had to brains fighting each other. The one that knows this is irrational and the one that keep going into the irrational thoughts. 

For a couple of years I've had to sleep with something playing in the background or I'd wake up from a nightmare with super high pulse and out of breath.

This is the first time I've felt the nightmare for more than a few minutes.

I live in NH, USA"

1555,Help with anxiety or whatever it is and chest pain,"So this month has been honestly kind of hellish for me. About 5 Saturdays ago I woke up in the middle of the night feeling as if I couldn't breath and my heart was pounding. I had some unpleasant thoughts go through my head and since that fateful day I have been so jacked up. Almost lost my job. These constant attacks and chest pain, arm pain, jaw pain, waking up constantly, etc etc. 

I have been to the er about 7 times in this past month, urgent care about 6, and many doctor visits. Have had about 12 ekgs, blood tests, chest xrays, an echocardiogram, a stress test, and a coronary CT. Nothing was found wrong with my heart or anything.

I've had numerous doctors, PAs, arnp, family members, nurses, etc tell me its anxiety, panic attacks, anxiety disorder etc. Ive started therapy and see a psychiatrist Tuesday for medication.

It's been a constant battle in my head trying to accept its just severe anxiety and panic attacks. Its just i feel kind of calm a lot of the time i guess. Not much racing heart. I have constant fear though. And insane amounts of stress and a constant worry in the back of my mind no matter how relaxed I may be.

But I have physical pain all day. Its never severe the ache in my upper jaw is annoying which im trying to figure out if it might be from me clenching all night while I'm sleeping and not something health threatening. Only the chest pains I get hurts and but they are short. But they seem to happen not just during these attacks or severe anxiety they just randomly happen. And i dont know if thats normal for anxiety or severe anxiety i guess. Along with random shortness of breath that will last for hours. Especially in the morning and in the late evening or night. Do you all experience this with anxiety?

I seriously need people with severe GAD to ask questions. This anxiety or whatever is destroying me. I got a handle of my schizoaffective years ago but its coming back because of all this. Im having issues thinking im actually in hell and im being tormented by all these so called doctors. That im actually dying continuously and its all some sick game or some shit.

Sorry i dont know my mind is broken right now.

If anyone could help explain how anxiety or anxiety disorser is for them that would be awesome. Does it cause pain for you all day even when you feel fine? Maybe im just too hypersensitive right now. Im really trying not to be."
1556,Can severe anxiety cause psychosis? At what point does anxiety become paranoia?,"I have GAD 100%, and when it becomes really bad, I start to feel extremely out of touch with everything. Sort of numb, like I can do anything and none of it would matter. I cant really say ""out of touch with reality"" because, I don't really understand what 'reality' is, and so can't really distinguish what is or isn't reality. (i honestly dont know if this is a psychological thing for a philosophical thing)

Anyways, I was recently said to have Schizotypal Disorder by my psychologist (but refused to diagnose me with it because of my age (im 20)), and I was wondering if it is only due to my extreme anxiety, that I sometimes slip into psychosis and have developed schizotypal. 

I'm sorry if this is really disorganized, I don't know how else to word it."

I am a good programmer but I heavily need the experience to be good at it, I wrote some code, some creative code, but recruiters think it's a useless skill because I go back and implement outdated solutions, well even if they are outdated it doesn't mean it's easy, not even easy to figure it out.

I am really tired, I try to find the path that suits me, and either life or this shitty stat I am living in keeps pushing me to wrong direction.

for f sake I proved I am a good programmer in many different ways, I proved I can do a sysadmin job and I proved I can do a security analyst job, but they keep pushing me back.

I don't know what this life want from me and for sure I don't know what this stat want me to do, they tell me to get social while there is no chance to get social for someone who has no friend at all, I checked [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) there is no event in here where I live non zero nada, and the people I could make them a friend in here keeps avoiding me as they figured out I want to approach them, and the stat keep telling me to get a job while there is no offer for that and the jobs I can do are hidden and they don't show it up.

I wonder.. would I be qualified to be admitted into a mental hospital if I ever told what was wrong with me? I mean, I'm going to give examples of some of the things I do below and maybe y'all can decide for yourselves. 

1. C*t,
2.Think about s***ide every.f*cking.day,
3. Imagine terrible things happening to me and enjoying it, either because it would be better then being nothing and having nothing to do or because I feel like I deserve it,
4. Imagine k*lling/beating up my parents, (I used to do this very often I would imagine k*lling/beating my aunt and my father for hurting me when I was angry, have since I was nine I think but can't put a real date on it)
5. Once was laying in bed and started kinda dreaming of crushing someone's skull with my foot. It was a very very bl**dy dream. I-I took the person apart limb by limb. o-o (I laugh when I think about it and I don't know why)
6. Enjoy st*bbing myself with my pencil and actually have written ""HI"" on my arm with indents from my pencil,
7. Imagine taking a kn*fe and c*tting all my body fat off like a f*cking banana peel,
8. Can never ever ever sleep when wants to.

That's all I can think of lol so let me know what you think, while I lay in bed regretting eating ice cream-"

1570,How can there be people out there without any type of mental illness?,"I mean, it's just so fucking insane to me. Even when I was a kid I already some traces of mental illness. How are there fully grown people out there, without anxiety or depression? How can you not be depressed or anxious in a world like this? It's fucking insane."
1571,The Mental Health Nurse (a funny but distressingly true story about Healthcare in certain parts of England),"To begin, my wife and I both suffer from different forms of mental health. I have moderate anxiety and depression, while she suffers from more serious bouts of bi-polar, depression, anxiety, and others. 

We know this now, but we didn't have a diagnosis for her until about 2 years ago. 

Without going into too much detail, she had a very hard upbringing and has had mental health issues for much of her life. Her ex was not very supportive, and familial support was sporadic, though elements of this have gotten better recently. But, I digress...

We finally found a GP who was receptive to our concerns about my wife's mental state (the last one before that m, while my wife was in apoplectic tears in her office and I had tried to explain the situation as my wife physically could not, had said that my wife needed to speak for herself or she could not help her...), and he directed us to two local services - IAPT and Mind - and said that he would put us in touch with a registered mental health nurse. 

I had previously used IAPT and they really helped me,  but they often used 'talking' therapy, and my wife doesn't like to talk about her problems in that way, so we set up an appointment with Mind. 

Before that cane through, however, there was a phone call from NHS England. 

My wife answered, and started talking to someone on the end of the phone. Within 10 minutes I could tell it wasnt going well - I was sat in the next room so I could support her if she needed me, but she could vent freely about anything without having me over her shoulder. She started to get very agitated, and even angry with whomever she was talking to. She came into the room I was in and handed me the phone, shouting ""I can't talk to him anymore, you talk to him!""

A little on edge, I took the phone and explained who I was. A voice at the end of the phone said ""I was asking your wife what she wanted to be diagnosed with...""

""What?"" I demanded. ""What do you mean 'want' to be diagnosed with? We want her to be diagnosed with nothing! That would mean she was absolutely fine! But she isnt, so we *need* to know what she is suffering from!""

We had a short  lively discussion about the semantics of ""want"" vs ""need"", then I began to get irritated and demanded:

""Look, just put me through to the mental health nurse and let me speak to them about my wife's situation. You have been, I'm afraid, absolutely no help and you have made the situation worse!""

""Sir, I *am* the mental health nurse.""

I laughed, then hung up. 


**Epilogue**
I just want to say that not all NHS Mental Health Nurses are like that, we got a particularly bad one. And my wife's appointment with Mind (a charity here in the UK) went tremendously well. She has been on medication since these events - which was her preferred choice of treatment - and she has been recovering and getting stable ever since. 

This story is in no way designed to put anyone off seeking professional help - I would ALWAYS recommend it as the very first port of call - but rather to alert people that, certainly in the UK, mental health treatment varies from place to place. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's awful.

We need to have a discussion - an honest and frank one - about why mental health services vary so wildly, and why health professionals do not always take it seriously. Because only when they do will we be able to make true, meaningful steps forwards in the medical help that so many people need.

I also shared it because, looking back on it all now, it is a pretty funny story. If terrifying.

Peace and love, folks."

1578,Stop acting like that or no one would want to be friends.,"I used to really struggle during school academically and socially. My social life was non existent I didn't have friends, I was getting builled by students and teachers. So whenever I complained to my mom she always used to tell me theres something wrong with me and I should change so people would want to be my friends. Whenever I pissed her off she told me to fix that attitude or I will never get friends. I couldn't confide in her anymore after that. I was slowly crumbling away. I hated myself (still do) have no self confidence. I'm still in school but i switched schools and what the people see in school isn't me. It's all just an act. I learned how to manipulate people into liking. The person that everyone sees today isn't me because I'm scared because everytime I brought out me people would step on me and make fun of me. I show people the parts they want to see not me. No one really knows me.

1581,I don't know what is happening to me.,"Hello! 14M typing here.

Until July 2020, I was feeling ok about myself. Well, I had some problems, but they weren't noticeable for me.

In early August, I met a girl. She was amazing. She was really nice to me, she shared a lot of personality traits with me. 

I felt like we clicked. I felt amazing around her.

In late August, I started playing a videogame with her. Eventually, my other male friend started playing with us. I noticed she was being pretty kind to him. Ever kinder than she was with me.

My friend wasn't flirting with her and doesn't like her at all. 

I felt awful from this realisation. I am slowly starting to feel something is incredibly wrong with me. I feel like a horrible person.

There is more.

Since August, my stress levels have skyrocketed. I can lay down and my pulse can be 126 bpm. 

I also noticed that I have very rapid mood swings. At one point the girl can be my favourite person, two minutes later, she can be worthless in my eyes. And those swings can go on, like a pendulum in a grandfather clock.

I am also getting severe headaches really often. They can be cured by an aspirin, but I don't want to screw up my liver with medicine.

What should I do? It is horrible. I don't want to ruin the chance for an amazing friendship. 

I am Bulgarian, from Sofia. Are there any hotlines/boards I can check out locally?"
1582,How do I act okay,Basically since lockdown I’ve just been locked up in my room with my phone and my mental health hasn’t been the best so I would just isolate myself and I know it isn’t healthy but now after these months I’m starting college tomarrow and we’ll I don’t want to go but at the same time I do to get away from my family asking if I’m okay over and over. I know it’s selfish but my mum the other day said that she was concerned about me ect and was saying I could talk to her but I find it hard to open up to close people like even if I want to I physically can’t. And now I’m stresssing her out like she’s got her own mental health problems and I’m making it worse for her like does she want me to tell her that I hate myself I hate my appearance that I don’t like eating becaue she would call me fat that I feel suicidal like she doesn’t need that concern and it will make it worse for her and then she’ll blame herself I mean I don’t know why I feel sad sometimes I don’t know how to act like I’m okay like I’ve just given up ok it like at dinner my mind just goes off like I just don’t have the effort to engage in a conversation or I just am not bothered but how do I act like I’m okay I mean she thinks when I go to college I’ll be fine so please someone tell me how to act okay
1583,i don’t do anything and yet im so stressed,"i spend my days just dissociating and looking at social media etc. anything to distract me from the reality (i used to have an eating disorder to cope too). i can’t see the meaning in doing schoolwork so I’m behind on homework, even if i do it i’m so forgetful and dissociated that i submit it late at best or not at all. I’m irritable and stressed, i focus on my thoughts since I’m not doing anything - i try to do something sometimes but that’s only a temporary escape, most times im just lazy. I know productivity shouldn’t determine my worth or whatever but i feel bad, probably because not doing things is not good for mental health. I exercise and play the piano sometimes when I’m feeling good enough to do so. Why does that overwhelm me? Why does doing the bare minimum to survive and keep up a facade so exhausting for me? I told my mother that i wondered what it would be like going to a therapist before, but said that i didn’t need one - I can’t admit to anyone that i need help. I can’t be that vulnerable and who knows? Maybe therapy or the steps leading up to that will make me even worse. There are bad therapists out there and I don’t want to burden my family even more than i have to right now - guess i’ll just keep obsessing over my issues and sleep"
1584,My marriage may be over if I don't find a way to deal with my problems.,After roughly a year of tension and fights my wife informed me that for her own safety she will not be interacting with me until I get a psyhciatric evaluation and seek therapy. She said that after speaking with her own therapist about our problems that they are concerned I may have borderline personality disorder. Obviously I want to do whatever it takes to save my marriage but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared about this. What does a psychiatric evaluation entail? If I do have borderline personality disorder how can that be treated and how does a psychologist even determine that?
1585,Regret,"Whenever I'm walking home from school, eating, trying to sleep- literally anything that doesn't require my mind to actively think. My brain starts dwelling on the many regrets I've had in the past. There's so many things I've done that had resulted in bad outcomes, there's so many things I could've done to change it. Even when I was 9, or 7, I'm not really sure anymore. Just that one decision I made then had caused myself to suffer the impact, and I wonder what life would have been if I chose the latter.

I keep on thinking about how much better life would've been if I just made the right choices, did the right thing. It's to this point I regret I was born, I regret the fact that my mother gave birth to me so irresponsibly when she was in a toxic relationship, in a state of depression, which caused me to suffer neglect, suffer abuse, suffer in an unstable household with unstable income and be put on the spotlight to be the only hope for this family to be successful. I feel regret towards so many things, I keep thinking about how life would be better."
1586,I relapsed into self harm,"The first time I hurt myself again I thought I would just have to keep pushing harder. I thought it was just a moment of weakness. Then it happened again. I wasn't hyperventilating, I wasn't panicked, I was just numb. And I did it again. I gave in again and now I don't even know if I want to keep going. It feels so good to hurt. I hurt myself and I want to do it again. Does anyone know wtf to do now?"
1587,Sometimes it feels like what I love makes me feel worse.,"The essence of this is that recently when i've been doing what I love and want to do - make music, it makes me feel a weird sense of guilt and unsatisfaction - like whatever I'm doing isn't what I *should* be doing, or that whatever I make isn't going to go anywhere or do anything.

This kinda guilt detracts from my passion and creativity and means that I go to a medium to escape, such as playing video games. (*which if I'm being honest is probably becoming an escape rather than a hobby*)

I have taken breaks from music related things before and come back to the same kinda guilt and I'm finding it difficult to restart my passion and find the resolve needed to just do what's needed and not have to worry about anything.

I feel like there's something, like a pattern or something, that's causing me to fall in the same traps every time and I'm not realising it.

If it helps I'm 18."
1588,Really hard time with depression,"So recently my depression has gotten extremely bad, Every second thought is of suicide and I don’t know how much longer I can keep on going

Every morning I wake up and feel horrendous at the thought of going to work and want to quit yet I feel I need to go anyways, I’m drinking myself into stupid states every weekend and ended up taking cocaine again lastnight (the construction site I’m working on currently does random tests) which not only am I now coming down but I have to deal with the thought I might be caught out at work and lose my apprenticeship

Iv been going to a counsellor for a while now which I honestly don’t think it’s going anywhere

Does anyone maybe have any advice for me? Would be greatly appreciated during this time"

1590,Struggling With Dermatillomania (Obsessive Skin Picking) A Lot Lately,"I haven't been doing well lately, and it shows very clearly in my skin, which deterred me from wanting to put out content on my YouTube channel as I usually do; but then I realized this was a good opportunity to show the results and raise awareness about one of my many anxiety conditions, dermatillomania (obsessive skin picking).

Normally it happens when i'm home but i recently had it in school. Nobody noticed but i felt still really uncomfortable.

Does someone know what this could be? I know that this is no diagnose but maybe someone has similar experiences?

And what can i do to make it stop?

1593,"I (32f) feel that I need a break from this job that I'm working. I haven't been sleeping well, and the job has been effecting my mental health. I love it when I'm rested, but I haven't had a vacation in a while. I need help on what I should do...","I want to start saying that by tired, I mean I haven't had a vacation since January of 2019. I have gone through spurts were i don't talk to the guys the way I need to( i work with mentally disabled individuals) I know they don't work on full capacity, and yet when we both get frustrated with each other I have noticed here and there that I don't make the best word choice when I'm tired/exhausted.  And they can tell when your going through something/struggling. Sometimes they act on it by trying to make it worse, depending on their mood. Sometimes it upsets them. I have one individual that has IED, and constantly says the same thing over and over, which, when your tired, can irritate you easily. I had had just about no sleep the night before, and because we are short staffed, I can't call in. There are only two other gals that would be working, one that is new and isn't to work with this client because he tends to bite/grab/scratch others as well as himself and while the other has, that would leave her with no breaks(although she only works about 8 hours overtime and is our am lead worker. I work an average of 16 to 24 hours overtime) we just lost two workers. I don't know if the higher ups are working on hiring anyone. They have been taking vacations and getting time off, but no one that immediately works at my house does. 
I don't want to quit, but I need a break. They have an on call position i can move to, but that would leave my immediate coworkers hanging. Not to mention cut my paycheck.

Tldr: I work my butt off, I'm ehausted working 16 to 24 hours overtime, and havent had a vacation in almost 2 years and am at a breaking point. Higher ups are taking vacations whenever they feel like it, whether it be nursing or office intel people. We are short staffed. I love my job, just not at the moment, and its effecting my day to day choices with the clients."

Where I live has gone through its second cycle of quarantine and with the lack of physical and even digital communication between me and others I have begun to fall back into depression. I don’t want to go back to therapy. I’ve begun to get thoughts of self harm and suicide again and I’m back to square one. I’m only afraid I’ll follow through this time."

1597,I am disconnected from people,"I am detatched from people both in person and online. I have spent literally the past 10 years online hurting people. I have an addiction to creating fake personas and join communities hoping I can just be normal but it never works out. I end up hurting somebody, starting drama, and that's when I leave. I feel no attachment to people, both in real life and online when i have problems with people, I leave. I grew up socially isolated and detatched from people. I don't fully regret hurting the long list of people I've hurt. As far as real life goes, I've been out wiyh coworkers many times. It's annoying and bothersome each time. I don't feel the way they feel about me. I lie and use people to my advantage, manipulate situations and people, nobody is even aware of it.

Two days ago I was almost there, I was almost focused on my notes and then boom! Two days of reading thing passively with thoughts of everything stealing my attention from anything.
It's not just daydreaming, it's more of chaos and no thought lasts more than the time needed to distract me.

1599,What can I say to someone who has given up and just waits for their parents to pass so they can kill themselves too ?,"My friend (in their 30's) is hopeless. They are clearly convinced that their life is useless, does not believe in making any effort to change their way of thinking about themselves and just constantly talk about how ""they wish they could die of their cardiac problem"".

It's clearly not for the attention because they always quietly try to remove themselves from social gatherings (on the internet) of groups, leaving the discord everytime they see themselves as toxic (in their mind, because nobody see them as toxic) and choose a few years ago to avoid sex and romantic relationships at all costs.

Their state look like it trauma related since they lost an ex in a mass shooting, but the suicidal ideation comes from even before that.

I really don't know what to do, they are a good friend, always here when I need to talk. They have just given up on themselves and I really don't want them to die. They don't want to seek professional help, seeing themselves as an ""hopeless case"".

1600,Does anyone have the same as this?,"Hey guys 

As a bit of background, I (22M) was diagnosed as a high level self oriented perfectionist - and I do get anxiety symptoms. I have my own company with high levels of stress, and my partner was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Lately I have been really bad, I feel a constant head pressure that will not go away, which is becoming overwhelming, to the point where I just do not want to be here anymore.

I'm also finding it difficult to breathe, and can feel my heartbeat in my chest (which I normally can't)"
1601,Fuck this,"     Recently, I’ve lost every single one of my friends due to my mental health and also lost my best friend (read past posts if you wanna know what happened) and i’ve never felt more lonely in my life. It makes me sad because my boyfriend lives with me and we hang out and I love hanging with him, but he has friends of his own and he goes out with them and stuff. Recently I’ve expressed how alone I feel almost every day and how bad it hurts that I can’t even make new friends. 

      A few days ago, he went out with some friends he plays in a band with and I wanted to go, since it was okay I went all the other times. But for some reason I could just tell he didn’t want me to. Which I don’t mind I just didn’t understand why not. So I just slept all day like usual and waited for him to get home. 

     Yesterday, one of his friends came back in town and he was talking about how they are going to hangout. I asked when he was coming in town and he told me and I asked if I could maybe come too. And he fucking hesitated so hard it broke my heart. It straight up was like,
“Can I come?”
“...uhhhh”
I fully understand him wanting to hang alone with friends but it just saddens me that you could express your pain in depth to people and they wouldn’t want you to come along? And it’s not a weird thing for them to bring girls along so my brain just keeps telling me it has to do with how I act. And I honestly don’t blame him."

1603,How do you survive living in an emotionally abusive household?,"My parents divorced when I was a toddler, my mom moved on to a couple of other people but my dad stayed obsessed with her. They got back together when I was 16 to prevent my dad from becoming homeless. My dad has anger issues (but doesn’t get physically violent) and is very controlling, my mom suffers with depression really badly when she’s not medicated, but never stays on her meds. My older sibling moved out years ago. I (25) live at home with my parents and younger sibling (23).

At the request of professionals a few years ago I tried to move out to better my mental health but my mom is very emotionally dependant on me. The guilt took over and I moved back home. I’ve tried to move out 3 times but every single time it feels like I’m dragged back home. I never tell people that I feel forced to return home. I just tell them that I cope better at home. They seem to believe it. 

The thing is, my mom and dad are unable to communicate. Dad will take unnecessary digs at mom, mom will shut off, threaten to leave the country, talk about killing herself yada yada yada. Dad then starts having his temper tantrum and will slam doors and throw stuff he feels is in his way at the time, he’ll gaslight and say horrid things about people. The atmosphere of the house is awful. My younger brother has Aspergers and stays in his room a lot of the time playing video games and talking to his friends. It feels like I’m expected to check in and look after everyone. Mom and dad tried couples therapy a few time’s but apparently dad took over and did his manipulating, mom felt ganged up on and started refusing to go (understandable) 

I’ve been out of hospital since December 2019. The longest I’ve been out in 7 years! But with the dynamics of the family I don’t think I’ll be able to stay mentally stable enough to stay in the community for much longer. Things are already getting bad again. I want to just leave, but for many many MANY reasons I don’t have the heart to do that. I know my mom will end up killing herself and I know that my family will put that on my shoulders. The professionals that have been in my life have told me I need to get out and let my parents worry about themselves but the human emotions in me just won’t let me do that. I just don’t know what to do."
1604,What is home sickness?,"For real though, I want to know. I want to know what it's like to want to talk to your Mom, to be able to tell her all the good and the bad. I want to be able to talk to my Dad without him telling me that he learned everything on his own, so I need to learn.


How do I clean properly? How can I make sure my Cat stays healthy. Am I shaving properly? Am I doing a good job even though I'm almost 30 and disabled?

How do I fix things? Like. Anything. How do I know my fire alarm works? How do I call for help when no one is even on my health card as an emergency contact.

I dont want friends, I don't want a lover. I just want people. I want real. Im tired of the '""you didn't work hard enough"".

Im trying not to die every second of the day. Every second. I am doing so good too, but I just need help. I admit it, ok? I want family. I want someone to talk to about anything.

How do I properly hang these curtains. I dont have internet, only data. So youtube cannot teach me.

My landlord won't fix a cracked window is this freezing apartment. He won't give me a key or bother to clean the used needles.

Im so fucking scared where I live. Its not where I am comfortable living. Im fine with people being people ...but I really don't feel safe anymore. I am so lonely, I don't know how to talk to people anymore,

To ask for help properly, I have no furniture, no internet, family.

1605,There are certain times in my life where I get the sensation of death during the last phases of sleep or just after waking up. Especially in the afternoon,"I feel death around me.

1606,Books/texts on Schizoaffective disorder,I'm looking for any text or books on Schizoaffective disorder and its different types (depressive and bipolar). I was diagnosed in Fall 2018 with depressive type but I still feel like I dont know much about the illness from what I have read online. TIA!
1607,Loud or quiet 'mind'?,"Most of my life I've lived with racing thoughts and pretty constant thoughts in general, with my whole day being turning these over in my mind. I'm sure a lot of it was anxiety, or depression and what have you. These days I just don't, my minds pretty quiet, it's more like I have to motivated or discipline my mind now to 'assign' it to a task. I can just chill without thinking, like my mind is idling and I'm just aware of what's around me, or that I'm breathing or whatever it happens to be, but no thoughts.

I'm really curious why? Or if anyone else shares this experience? Part of me misses it, and a bigger part of me likes the peace and quiet."

1609,"I think I may have turned myself into a sociopath, I don’t know how to reverse it","I used to be a very caring and empathetic person, especially towards animals. I felt like I could emotionally connect with characters in books and movies and I was really connected to the characters I was writing. I loved heartwarming stories and could not stand it when an animal was hurt or killed in a movie. I was also really passionate and held strong beliefs regarding ethics. I also loved playing videogames and watching movies and reading comics. 

But as of about a month and a half ago, I feel like I started to lose that. 

I got really depressed in quarantine and noticed I was getting into more porn than usual. Also my paraphilia, which I had since childhood, began to really make me a bit uncomfortable.

So I decided to quit porn for a bit. This led to me really getting introspective on myself. I spoke to my therapist, who said it was fine to be into that sort of thing, but for some reason that only made me panic. I started questioning myself, every time I watched or saw something violent and didn’t get upset, like when watching an action movie or playing a videogame, or when I watched a nature documentary where animals hunted eachother. I started to feel not like myself. I was stuck inside my own head. I also started to feel a bit apathetic. I felt my personality and interests fade. 

I started having intrusive thoughts that I was somehow a serial killer because of the paraphilia. I also started to google. I googled and I got results like BPD, OCD, psychosis, and psychopathy/sociopathy. 

I started to have intrusive thoughts more often and panic googled even more. I also started to feel like I couldn’t connect with others anymore. I felt less mentally sharp, violence and death started to give me this discomfort sort of feeling, like I was supposed to know how to feel, but wasn’t feeling, and videos and pictures of cute animals did nothing for me. I felt nothing when I saw a video of a cat being rescued, I felt nothing when I saw a post about someone’s dog who died, I felt nothing when I saw an ASPCA ad. I felt nothing when my friend needed help. Nothing in the world felt real. I felt completely disconnected from reality, like nothing mattered. I think it was some sort of depersonalization. I’ve never lost my passion for wildlife before and now I’m scared it’s gone for good.

Anyway, last night [I googled again](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/inc7gs/i_googled_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and I was looking at reasons for why someone could lose their empathy and emotions. First looking at depersonalization again, then at various forms of emotional blunting, then eventually my mind went back to sociopathy. And I googled sociopathy. I questioned every time in my past when I was mean or cruel or selfish, every time I watched something violent, every time I laughed at a morbid joke, every time I got aroused by my paraphilia. I also questioned if I tricked myself into being empathetic as a kid. Now I really don’t know anymore. I’m scared that I brainwashed myself into having no emotions or empathy. I feel like all I am now is a collection of intrusive thoughts that don’t even really give me as much anxiety anymore. I have no more passion or motivation. I feel like I lost myself to all of this. I want to feel bad for my friends, I want to feel upset when an animal is hurt, I want to care and relate, but I feel like I can’t anymore. I feel like I don’t know how to anymore. I don’t want to be a sociopath. I want to just forget I ever looked up anything. I want to feel upset again. I want to feel justified anger at people who are cruel. I want to feel love again. 

At the same time I also want to be able to accept the darker side of myself. The side that was okay with morbid humor and playing videogames and DND and watching YouTube videos with stupid humor. The side that knew when to feel and when not to feel. 

Now I think I messed myself up pretty bad. I don’t know how to think or feel anymore. I lost myself to panicked googling."
1610,The aftermath of surviving a suicide attempt,"First of all my name is DC. Im 34 years old and love in Montana.

On July 10th 2020 I attempted suicide by shooting myself. Good news I'm still here today and I couldnt be happier.

I woke up that morning just like zny other morning except this morning the ""voices"" in my head which I've heard since i was 20 years old started to take on evil tones and commands. 
Telling me I should kill myself was just one of the phrases being directed at me constantly.

I couldnt form a thought long enough to realize what was going on was wrong and I needed help.

The day drug on and I was at my mothers house and she just returned from out of town. Anything I said wasn't making sense.... it was all ""word salad""

I couldn't hd on anymore. I pulled up a chair in her living room, grabbed my pistol grib shotgun and loaded it. As i was raising the barrel to my face I yelled to my mother ""goodbye""

Just as I had said that my dog jumped into my lap and my finger jerked the trigger spraying 12 guage bird shot pellets through my cheek, the TV and the wall behind me. 

My dog thought when I said goodbye it was md yelling for him to go ""for a ride"" in the truck. 

All I know is he saved my life that day.

1612,I need help,"So I’ve been sick to my stomach for days now. No vomiting. No vowel movements either. During the day I have horrible stomach pain but soon after I fall asleep I wake up super sick. I’ve tried Benadryl, zofran, and a bunch of other prescriptions and over the counter meds, and nothing works. I’m at the point where I haven’t slept in days due to the fact I’m scared to sleep due to knowing I’ll wake up sick and not get any relief. The only time I’ve felt alright was at the emergency room a few days ago when they put me on morphine. I’m worried to go back and get more because I might get addicted and my parents won’t let me anyway because they think I might theoretically try heroin. I need to see a gastroenterologist ASAP but I have to wait till mid October. I’m starting to lose hope and go crazy."
1613,"why do i want to be sick, depressed, and not okay?","TW: this post may be triggering to someone who's recovering from an eating disorder.

i've gone through a tough time the last year and a half. i've dealt with depression, s/h, ocd, anxiety, and have spent every day either not eating or eating too much, trapped in a vicious binge/starve cycle. i would starve until i inevitably gave in and for next few days, i'd eat everything in sight until i hated myself to try starving myself again. a year and a half of this torture and i've only gained 22 pounds, developed stretch marks, and learned to hate myself even more than i did back then.

today, i came across a quote: the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. i wrote 3 paragraphs on why i should give up on the calorie limits under 500, the pro-anorexia websites, the starving and the bingeing and the hatred for myself that came with it.

but the funniest thing is that 10 minutes later, i saw a gif of a character from the show 'Pretty Little Liars', a character who was anorexic, depressed, and sick. i found myself wanting to be that character, wanting to be sick, and wanting to starve until i couldn't move. i like the feeling of hunger, the happiness when you step on a scale and you're 5 pounds lighter than the weight loss app says you should be, i like being extreme when everyone around me is eating 1200 calories to lose weight. i want to get better so fucking bad, so i can be a regular blissfully happy kid, but i also want to be sick and sad. i always want to be sad, i want to be not okay, i want there to be something wrong with me, at least until i don't. it's hard to describe but there's just a feeling of sadness that washes over me sometimes, the feeling that no matter what, i'll never be a kid again and no matter how many funny tv shows or movies i watch, no matter what i do, no matter what friends i go out with, i won't ever be happy. then at those moments, all i want is to be happy and be a kid and be one of those painfully annoying kids who are just oblivious to everything screwed up around them.

this post is a mess and i'm sorry. i just don't know what's wrong with me and need help."

1616,Why is therapy/going to a psychologist so fucking expensive?,"I need help, but I can’t afford it. Sucks to be me I guess."
1617,"How is it even possible for doctors to make an accurate diagnosis on things that are heavily internalized like Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Bipolar Disorder and BPD?","I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I don’t know how it’s possible for a doctor to give me a diagnosis because things happen when I’m not at a hospital, and 99% of time I forget what even happened. For instance if I was doing something today like buying a new tv, or a new car, changing my surroundings and you asked me a month later when I did this I wouldn’t have an answer for you because I couldn’t remember. I’d just assume it’s always been like that. I only know that it’s September because I’ve been making such a big deal to myself and reminding myself that it actually is September because I don’t remember what happened in August at all and didn’t know the month even changed. I was under the impression that it was still July and to my surprise I look at the date and it’s the 27th of August.

And even with hallucinations, I don’t remember them I just assume they were dreams or question if they even happened at all. For mood, I just assume that I’ve always been depressed or manic and don’t recall a time period where I felt any different and usually recollect with “I remember when I used to be so happy” or “I remember I used to be very sad and glad I’m not” but it was only been a month or 2 before I switch. These moods feel entirely localized in their own space and time as my perception is altered greatly from cognitive abilities, to my environment and my world outlook. I see things with narrow tunnel vision, “oh the world is just so terrible, there’s not point to anything, everyone is mean and all they do is argue and fight” or the opposite, “life is so beautiful, everything feels warm, people really aren’t capable of great evil these days everyone tends to be on the same page that bad things are bad and it’s feels good to be good”
These are borderline delusions and I believe them and you couldn’t convince me that I was wrong. If I’m happy, we’ll the whole world is happy and if I’m depressed then the whole earth would just have to suck. 3 hurricanes within 2 weeks in Korea. This is insane. 

How is it that a doctor can come the the conclusion that this person has the mind altering illnesses if it isn’t as visible as other illnesses. You can visibly see when someone is depressed, you can visibly see when someone has anxiety Because they have panic attacks, you can visibly see when someone has a learning disability, you can visibly see when someone has an eating disorder or substance abuse disorder.
But how can you visibly see a psychotic disorder if everything is in my head? You just have to trust what I’m saying and even then I don’t really know what’s going on, or even know it’s actually happening that it’s real. Is that me in my head? They’re watching aren’t they, I can feel it. Right in the corner of my room. I don’t want to look.

Or was that just my imagination? Like it’s a normal thing and everyone experiences feelings like being monitored or thinks they see something or it’s directed to them?"

I don't know what trust feels like. I don't know how to be close with people, even my parents. I don't remember ever having told them I love them, nor do I remember ever hearing them tell me they love me. 

I just want one day where I wake up feeling everything will be okay. Where I don't have to struggle to get through the day. But I don't know where to find that feeling.

Most days I convince myself I'm not lonely, I just push it away. To my family it seems like everything is fine, because I don't want them to worry, they've already had to worry about me for so long.

Cheers."
1619,Can psychiatric medications actually help someone?,"I have heard many people say that different types of Psychiatric medications screwed them up or didn't help them at all. 
I was wondering if this is true for most, and people shouldn't take medication for psychiatric illnesses? 
I am asking because a friend of mine was advised to take them by a social worker and I want to know if it is safe."

1621,Wierd sh*t happening recently,"For some context I'm a 17 y/o and abt to graduate high school, but I had a pretty brutal mental breakdown in the end of junior year (I'm fine now) and some really weird things have been happening mentally recently and google wasn't of much help to me so I'm just kinda trying to figure out what's happening rn. I also can't go to a hospital for advice rn because all of the hospitals in my area are overloaded with COVID-19 patients and I'd rather not take away resources from the hospital when I'm not in a life-threatening scenario. Below I'll put everything that's been weird recently:

* I was depressed in freshman/sophomore year like every other high schooler but in junior year it just kinda morphed into anxiety (to the point where I was genuinely afraid of my parents) and now I'm completely fine thankfully. I have NEVER seen this happen to anyone else online or in real life. It's not like I slowly stopped being depressed, it's more like I was depressed over the course of a few days I had anxiety out of nowhere instead of depression, and then I was just fine after my anxiety led me into having a mental breakdown where I sent my teachers an email saying how scared everything made me (i.e. open doors and windows without blinds covering them scared the SHIT out of me but now I really couldn't care less). That mental breakdown happened in May of this year in case that's important, but it no longer affects me at all.
* I straight up hear voices sometimes. Not like a schizophrenic, but once every few months I'll hear a random voice or sound out of nowhere. I can tell because normal background noise blends in with my tinnitus unless I focus on it. Sounds I hear out of nowhere sound perfectly clear. They sound like they are coming from the external world and not from inside my head. For example, when I was going for a walk (after I wasn't overly anxious anymore) I heard loud footsteps sprinting at me. When I turned around nobody was even in my vicinity. The most intense sound I heard was back in April of this year when I was practicing piano and I heard my parents mocking my voice, saying things like ""oh he wants atteeeention"" and I could clearly hear my parents from downstairs. My parents would NEVER do this and when I confronted them, visibly shaken from what I heard, they had no idea what I was talking about and I came to the conclusion that they never said that and they wouldn't say that even if they knew I wouldn't hear them. 
* I have very vivid daydreams and from what I read online they sound very similar to maladaptive daydreams. I either get sucked into a fantasy world where I'm a superhero or where I'm performing at a concert singing perfectly (I sound like a dying lizard in the shower). Other times I relive bad memories. When I relive bad memories they're mostly from when I was younger (7-12) and my mind ""reverts"" back to the mentality I had when I was that age in the daydream. For example, if I remember getting made fun of in grade school, grade school insults will seem genuinely hurtful again when the me in real life could easily laugh it off. Either way, whenever I daydream they're so vivid I physically interact with them through smiling, frowning, or following through with certain actions in the real world while I do them in my daydream. For example, if I daydream of fighting someone, my real world body's arms would come up a little and drop back down again when I'm swinging and punching in my daydream. Listening to music makes me more likely to spontaneously daydream and I daydream literally all the time. Even during exams and stuff. Lastly, whenever I daydream I sometimes say words after the daydream that sort of ""snaps"" me back into reality, like if I'm thinking of a bad memory my real world body would say something like ""oh my god"" or ""kill yourself"" in a mildly annoyed (not hurtful) tone and then I'd be ""shot"" back into my body. I'm probably not making too much sense but that's the best I can describe it. I also find it pretty miraculous that my body keeps moving, doesn't bump into anything, and even continues (very simple) tasks I was doing on autopilot. So if I was going for a walk and then wanted to eat at McDonalds, my body would walk at a normal pace and wait in line at a McDonalds while I was daydreaming and not even conscious. However, I can't do more advanced tasks like doing specific workouts or doing my homework while I'm fully immersed in a daydream.
* I frequently lose track of the time and personal belongings. It only happens every once in a while but it takes forever to find it. When I was younger I frequently had trouble remembering to turn my homework in and I'd even lose my homework around 50% of the time until 4th or 5th grade. Other times I have random videos pop up in my youtube watch history and not only do I have no idea when I watched it, but it's also a completely different genre from what I normally watch.
* I can't sleep at all, but only when my body feels like it doesn't want to sleep that night, which is pretty annoying. I'm a night owl anyway, and most of the time I can sleep without a hitch.
* I'm an avid procrastinator and I work better under pressure. I'll do better on my homework if I do it in the 5 minutes before class starts rather than the night before, where the same assignment would take me an hour and a half just because of sheer boredom. I get bored very easily and either daydream or talk nonstop when I'm bored. I also have risk seeking behaviours and I'm very impulsive. I'd rather watch youtube all day than do an assignment due today, for example. My most recent, intense, and stupid stunt was failing all my classes at the beginning of the quarter and then making up all the work to finish the quarter with As thru Cs at the end of Junior year.
* I had a few instances where my personality completely changed so I'll leave a quick draft of the ones I remember for the rest of this list:

1. I was getting ready to sleep when my mom entered my room over and over again which was weird but I'd normally just shrug it off and head off to bed. That night my head started throbbing and I got extremely, irrationally angry to the point where i moved a dresser to block my door so she couldn't get in and when she was like ""what he doin over ther"" I was about to punch the dresser as hard as I could out of sheer rage. I am normally a very passive and tolerant person who never gets mad and always makes an effort to be nice, so this is basically a character flip for me. I decided to dub this personality change my ""evil twin"" cause that's basically what he is. I normally shift to being irrationally angry when someone physically confronts me and threatens to hit me, or whenever I hear repeated loud sounds. The doors in my house are louder than airlocks so I think her barging in too many times ""triggered"" this part of me for some reason. Normally when I get very angry, I'm just passive aggressive and never fight but when I'm my evil twin I'm very physical and have gotten into more than a few fights because of this. I normally snap out of it whenever there isn't a threat or any loud sounds anymore.
2. Overly feminine, comes out while texting and doing adult activities sometimes. I am male and it is very weird when  this one happens because I am straighter than a pole and manlier than a lumberjack but then out of nowhere I send cutesy texts with all the uwus and owos. Pops out when I'm texting women that I'm not romantically attracted to sometimes. Thankfully, almost never comes out in real life.
3. Makes fun of the smallest things like small spelling mistakes or someone flubbing up their words. Pops out in discord or texts but never in real life. My friends chalked it up to ""late night Shenpai"" but I mean I don't act like that in face to face confrontations, even if they are late at night. Also, it only pops out when  the person I'm talking to is weaker/smaller than me. If I'm talking a friend who is stronger, taller, or very close to me I'll immediately revert back to my original personality after maybe 1 joke where I tease them over something really small.

Alright so that's it and I am very grateful if you read this far. If you know wtf is wrong with me pls let me know. I'm hoping and thinking that I'm normal (albeit a little weird) and paranoid about small things but a bunch of stuff started popping up recently and I realized it's been happening for a while now and probably isn't normal and that I can't go to a hospital because I live in CoronaWorld. I am very tired and my calc homework is due in 30 minutes sooo I should probably hop on that over some ice cream, cya."
1622,Why do i cover my head?,Idk why but i just realized that i always cover my head like both hands on my head and just hunch my back. And when this happens i always say why did i do it? I feel stupid im dumb anyways. Whats wrong with me? I dont want to go to a psychologist about this because maybe im just over reacting or maybe im just making this a big deal or something. Idk.

1625,We need help...,"Hi all. 

I’m writing this as a bit of a desperate plea as my family and I are completely at a loss with what to do...

My sister (34) lives in her own home with her SO here in the UK. She is a full time teacher so it’s a fairly stressful job. She has had mental health issues for as long as I can remember (previously diagnosed as chronic depression though we now aren’t so sure that’s the full picture) but has been more or less coping for the last few years. 

She frequently has “episodes” where she has intense paranoia, lashes out, refuses to answer calls, getting verbally aggressive when we offer support and spiralling into a very dark place. My mother often visits to check up on her only to return home crying as my sister has said something to hurt her. She also self harms and has used this as emotional blackmail to make my family or her SO do various things. 

Most recent example (which started at 10pm last night and is still ongoing now at 3pm the next day) - she called our parents and hyperventilated on the phone (no words) before hanging up and refusing to answer messages and calls. Knowing her history, my parents called her SO who was incredibly shaken up. He explained that she had been working while he watched TV. She didn’t like the fact that he “wasn’t supporting her while she worked” and had blown up, grabbing scissors and stabbing herself in the arm before chasing him out of the house. He was honestly shocked that the police weren’t called by the neighbours as she was fully screaming by this point. 

My parents immediately drove over fearing she had seriously hurt herself. They said she was incredibly aggressive and confrontational - body language was off and she was seemingly gurning with her mouth, her eyes bulging etc... When I spoke to my dad (a very stoic person as a whole) he was incredible shaken. In his own words “I didn’t recognise her. I don’t know who that was”. When they tried to call for help she smacked the phone out of their hands and ripped the socket off the wall, screaming for them to get out. She was incredibly volatile and punching herself in the head while shouting insults. They refused as they believed that she was not safe to be left alone and I have to say I think that was the right decision. They eventually came home at 3am, after her SO had returned and promised to keep an eye and call ambulance/police if she escalated again. 

It is now the next day she is still lashing out when we call to see if she is okay, and saying some incredibly hurtful things - otherwise refusing to answer calls at all. My family and I are all worried sick that she is going to seriously hurt herself. 

This is not the first time something like this has happened and it undoubtedly won’t be the last - but this has been a totally new level. 

She needs help but flat out refuses to see a doctor or even acknowledge that she has a problem “I’ll just put my mask back on for work.”. We are all so worried for not only her safety but also that of her SO and pets. I think that her mindset is completely skewed and I don’t believe she is capable of making rational decisions for her own wellbeing and safety at the moment. When calling 111 to ask advice earlier, we were told that as she is an adult there is no help they could offer us, she has to seek it herself. We were dismissed and basically told to stop wasting their time. 

She has in the past taken prescribed medication (anti-depression and beta blockers) but stopped taking them as she believed they weren’t helping and she “felt like a zombie”. She also attended counselling for a short time but again cancelled this believing it wasn’t helping. 

Any advice you have would be so appreciated. We are absolutely desperate to get her the help that she needs but she won’t seek it for herself. Is there someone we can talk to? TIA. 




TL;DR: My sister (in her 30’s, living with her SO in the UK) keeps having severe mental health crises but is refusing all help. All professional advice has been denied to us because she is an adult and “needs to seek it herself”.  What can we do?"
1626,Is it called Depression?," 

Hello There Everyone i have a problem and i dont know if it is depression well i dont even know what depression is that is why i am here asking this question.

The thing is when ever i listen to a certain music my hear feels heavy and i kinda feel sad and want to cry and just want to listen to that music all day not wanting to do anything.

i am implying that it is associated with depression because i kinda listened to that music when i was a little may be depressed because there was so much work to do on my first job and that song really hit me and also that song is a little love story-ish and was connected to a situation that was similar to mine at that time and made me think too much about it.

i left that song a little while ago and tried my best not to listen be productive but because of not going to college nowadays and that song surfing again because of a tv show restarted that period of my descend into i dont know maybe depression.

That is what i want to ask if is it normal or is it depression. Please Do Tell Me If You Have Any Idea What I Am Talking About.

Thanks."

1629,I WANT TO KILL MY STEPDAD,I don’t know what’s wrong with me I want to kill my stepdad he argues with me all the time and embarrass me my anxiety is getting worse and I don’t know how I can live with him in my life
1630,"I'm stuck, stagnating and I feel like getting inches closer to my demise","Hey there, everyone! I need your help, desperately, for I can't handle it anymore, I am way past the breaking point and there's seemingly no return since I haven't been granted any help whatsoever.
I am in the now, in present 20 years old, in a gap year, I graduated last year and currently I am in a gap year, as when I was 17, during the summer break, separing the 10th to the 11th grade, I met this girl whom I was attending the same highschool with and so the whole story begins.
It all started quite nice, but I was so anxious to the point that I was saying I can't lose her at all and I have to go an extra mile so she would not want to break up with me.By doing so, I piled up unwanted feelings, negativity and such for the fact that I was afraid, fearing the idea of being abandoned.I told her at some point all this and she appeared to be understanding, but little did I know that behind was lying an absolute manipulative being.
I started growing more and more depressed and by each day passing, I could observe myself falling into this pit of anguish and I'm guilty, it is my fault that I stayed, that I endured and let it happen as our relationship lasted 2 years and something, we started dating on 20th of September 2017 and we broke up on the 8th or so of November 2019.
We both have made terrible mistakes, we've had monstruous fights to the point where it would get physical and she would start spitting on me, on my face, pull my hair and no, it wasn't during sex or in a kinky manner, nor am I into bdsm.
The thing is, I felt like the worst person in the world, belittled, downgraded and she would play the victim in front of my parents, as they heard my version much later, though, they are your typical boomers who can't comprehend anything related to emotional and mental health, they think that it's all an excuse to be lazy, unproductive and sabotage yourself.
My health started deteriorating, I started balding, my teeth started to become damaged and this sudden, sharp pain in the side of my head also appeared and to this day, I haven't got the chance to get any medical exams and I am just in the worst state, it's a nightmare, something I feared the most.
My sleeping pattern is so fucked, I forget things I've said 3 seconds ago and it's all blurry, it's confusing, I have no direction, as opposed to the 17 version of me, a sparkling ray of light, lovely, all laid back, healthy and comfortable within my own skin.
I feel old, I feel like I look old, everything hurts, my face hurts, my teeth hurt, my head hurts, I still have those stabs, I have this gut feeling, like a ton of stress in my stomach, I suffer from hemmorhoids that won't go away without surgery, I feel pain in my limbs, my back aches and it's just unbearable.Fast forward after that relationship, during the winter holidays, more specifically the new year's eve, I had a friend asking me if I want to join him along with a bunch of people and celebrate it together, I said yeah sure, neat and there I met this girl blahblah, on the 12th of january we formed a couple, everything was going great and it was so fun, we were getting along so well and then the pandemic arrived in Romania, and y'know, communication isn't as effective on social media and we got to see each other a few times during the lockdown, but on the 4th of may, 4 days prior to my birthday, we were on a discord voice call and she seemed quite bland so I asked her if there's anythin' wrong and she told me she wanted to break up with me.
I was shattered and bursted out crying, I'm super emotional and sensitive and yeah, I acted desperate, trying to figure out what went wrong.
She told me a bunch of excuses as a why, as I had the patience to listen and I could simply see the intention behind.
And since november when I thought I'd be fine and free, the damage had already occured, leaving scars filled with as astronomical amounts of guilt, physical, emotional pain.
To make the matters worse, there's also my parents that just cannot fathom shit and lash out at me.
Ever since that point onwards I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts, as I am aware all my needs require so much money and I do not have the financial status to tend to them, to mend myself and get therapy.
Everything is grim and I see no realistic way out.
 I set up a gofundme and shared it on multiple facebook groups created for this sole purpose, yet no help, they're filled with scammers that prey on naive, older people. I feel beyond redemption, I need help.And what I just wrote is just a summary for I forget all those mental states at times, it's a back and forth motion, they reveal themselves when I'm vulnerable, what is certain, it happens on a daily basis.Maybe my brain needs to forget in order to cope and not have me go insane.But it is atrocious and painful to see my own descent into madness.
Thank you for the patience and the time you just took off reading this!"

1633,Diagnosed With PTSD Yesterday?!,"I (25F) think I've always been mentally unwell. My parents described me as a ""sad kid"" recently, but I also was almost always bullied or abused. As a child I could never get homework done, I thought about dark things like suicide, and at this point I believe I may have been a bit hypersexual. I was intelligent, reading at a 12th grade level as a 4th grader. I was also the weird kid.

 Sometimes I think everybody hated me. My mother was extremely physically abusive, she would often punch and kick me while I was on the ground. Sometimes she would call me crazy or a slut, as young as age 7. The children at school were scared of me, but also fascinated that I knew horror stories and sex things. 

By middle and high school I was compulsively masturbating every day for hours. I became friends with emo kids. (Whoohoo, 2008!) I still never did my school work. I was still bullied and abused. It was honestly the same thing my entire childhood. 

But okay. Junior year, 17 years old, I leave home. I move in with a friend, then my boyfriend/now husband. I grow up a lot. I join the Navy. I'm diagnosed MDD and GAD. I get out, the VA is evaluating me for insomnia. The doctor is rapid firing questions. I have nightmares, my anxiety is high. I know these things, told my previous doctors. At the end he's like, ""Okay, so you meet the criteria for PTSD"". And I'm like, ""?!?!"" But I just say, ""Okay, thank you for telling me.""

Meanwhile, I had a different therapy type appointment the say before where I tell the doctor, ""I seriously believe I have ADHD. I want to go back to school, can we do something?"" I had noticed that as a fully grown adult I'm the only one in the room spinning in my seat in classroom type settings. 

And I guess I'm just overwhelmed? These are a lot of different diagnosis with varying degrees of overlap. I also know this is all very ugly and chaotic to lay out on a post like this. Please don't judge me too harsh. I try very hard to be responsible and calm.

Any insight or advice would be very helpful."

Anyway, I wanted to know if you guys had any experience with breakdowns over small things. My most recent breakdown was when I lost the cap of my Sola bottle and I couldn’t find it anywhere and started crying and gasping for air. Now that I look back on it, it was pathetic, but at the time I didn’t know what else to do.


I try really hard not to cry, but I just cry even harder.


Is there a way for me to develop a better coping mechanism and get rid of my tantrums?

1635,How does one get out of a self sabotage slump?,"I feel like I have no motivation to do anything other than work, eat and sleep. I have nothing that interests me. I live in a small town and not much goes on here. I enjoy hanging out with people and socializing but a lot of my friends have moved away or I have lives of their own and our schedules don’t match up. I’m eating poorly, gaining weight, getting a lot of acne which is not helping my self esteem any and just makes me want to stay inside even more. 

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression but currently unmedicated. I go through phases where I need mood stabilizers and Ativan to help, then I feel good and stop taking them and get into this slump again. It totally sucks and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m just a downer to my boyfriend and I want to find a hobby that I enjoy but I’m not motivated to try anything.

I live in a tiny apartment with barley any natural light and no pets which really sucks for me. I’ve always had animals in my life and not having one around really bothers me. I also have a non existent relationship with my parents which is mentally taxing. I feel like I’m just going through the motions and can’t even enjoy life when I have the opportunity. I look around and everyone seems relaxed like their confident and having a good time and I can’t enjoy the moment."
1636,I feel like I shouldn't be here.,"I just feel like I should be here. I'm worthless, the only thing I'm good at is eating.

I have no friends, used to but now we don't talk much anymore, we've grown apart and even if they said that they love me they don't, the always hang out without me. I only have a best friend but I feel like I'm just a weight for them, so I always say no when they ask me out.
I've achieved nothing this year, instead I've lost everything, my willing to live, my friends, my hobbies... I'm not even motivated to do something I love.
I don't know. I may just end it here but then I remember that my family need to pay for my funeral and I don't want to annoy them more."

1640,Do I have an ED?,"Okay so I’ve been having this on my mind lately and always have but there’s times I think I’m just overreacting and feel like its going to get in my head so i just forget about it and don’t pay much attention to it. Since last year i used to struggle with depression and i hated myself a lot and i thought i was ugly and fat so i decided that maybe if I lost weight i would be more attractive. I started counting calories eating only healthy foods and would exercise as much as i could. After a few months i somehow just stopped and forgot about it and ate again,but again these past few months I started eating way less. I don’t eat much and if i do its only a small piece of fruit or when im forced to eat by my mom. I can’t eat nothing that has bread without feeling bad about myself. So as long as i don’t eat bread, anything with oil or just eating out I’m okay. I weight myself frequently every morning, after I exercise and if I eat I’ll weight myself. Whenever I’m forced to eat I will just space out and just be bumped out about it and be like “why did i eat that” however as long as it was either fruit or some type of vegetable and as long as it’s a little bit i won’t feel bad about myself. So basically as long as i don’t eat 3 meals a day, eat out, breaded food or anything with oil I’ll be okay. If i do eat something fattening I will make sure to do at Least 20 minutes of exercise. Also my doctor is trying to get me therapy and im supposed to go get diagnosed soon at the hospital since my heart rate is low and I’ve lost around 27 pounds in the past 3 months or so. I feel like I’m okay tho whenever I look at someone with an ed i think to myself and just tell myself “i just want to loose all this fat but im not trying to end up being like that...im just cutting out every fattening food there is so i can get thinner”. I’m so confused and don’t know if what I’m doing is normal or not but i feel like it is and that i don’t have an ed but at the same time deep down i feel like maybe I do."
1641,What could this be please - I'm recovering from OCD but it seems like part of me wants to hang on to it? - Please read my brief situation and the question is at the bottom - Thank you,"I'm doing OCD recovery 

Part of my OCD is that I have lists of things I've said I was going to do and I have compulsions to complete them such as educational videos, books and anything and this is also blended with a sort of compulsion to collect these ""sources or material"" 

If I am researching OCD medicine for instance I might accumulate 25 links to read plus maybe a few books and once they're written down I am compulsed to do them

Here is my question: I've been doing recovery and now don't make these lists and even if I had a list I am not a slave to it any more. I know this BUT

This was conditional on me finishing my one last list!

On my last list I've got some things to finish but they are not big, they are not difficult and they don't even consume up much time!! Why do you think something has caused me to procrastinate and not finish them...

I want to, I need to and I have to but I've not touched the materials in over a week!!! It would be so easy...this entire side of the OCD is gone forever once I've finished this one last compulsion

What do you think would cause this hesitancy to let it go? Almost as if my mind doesn't want to loose this part of OCD? Am i scared of failure or something without having OCD as an excuse??? 

Please let me know if you've got anything to say, advice or any thoughts at all they'd all be welcome"

1644,Anyone else have small gaps in their memory during panic attacks?,"I (25M) have been experiencing nocturnal panic attacks. Sometimes I wake up very panicked and confused and do things I don't remember doing in the midst of my panic. For example, I had 2 water bottles in my bad and during one attack I woke up and I had put them in the bathroom without remembering. During another episode I put my laptop in my bag and when I came back to it later I didn't realize I had done it, or rather had no real recollection of it.

It's making my panic concerns worse...does anyone else have these experiences?"
1645,My thoughts are getting slow and weird. Insight needed. Very serious.,"So I've had a lot of problems with anxiety and depression this past year. Most of it comes from an awful life and drug use. But within like last half a year I started to have a few problems that I find more severe. I started to have thought blocks, became less social, memory started to fail me, reading became a problem. All of these things kinda happened when i tried lsd for the fifth or sixth time or so. Due to these problems fucking up my life I decided to Google my symptoms to find out what is happening to me. Of course that lead me nowhere good. Many of my symptoms are associated with schizophrenia. I never had any real hallucinations or delusions but I still got very anxious about having it and started to look for proof that I am schizophrenic. This worsened my situation a lot. 

I started to read up about how these people have disorganised thoughts and speak incoherently. All of a sudden thats how I started to think. I would have a lot of impulsive thoughts about schizophrenia. I cannot recall any of them due to my fishlike memory but it was something like my friends girlfriend looked at me, wouldnt even say that it was a weird look, but then she whispered something to her boyfriend so first thought that came to my mind is that I am acting weird and she's talking about me. I managed to think rationally and said thats not true and even if it is who am i to care. Its a pretty light example but thats the only one I could think of at the moment. But in general it goes in this template. I see something, I have a stupid thought about it, I deny it with logical thinking. I should also mention that im a huge stoner that used to smoke like 5 grams a day for like two years and been smoking for five years in total. Anyways as I mentioned most of them would be about being schizophrenic, anxious thoughts, sometimes just stupid thoughts like I should grab that random backpack. 

This started to torment me since I legit was thinking I was going crazy. Then one night I watched a lot of creepy vids on youtube. That plus my daily obsession about schizophrenia, like per hour I would think 40 mins about my mental health, made me really creeped out. Out of a sudden I became spooked really hard. Even though I am a sporty 20 year old male I had to turn lights on so I would calm down. Then with a corner of my eye I noticed a face. It was not that vivid it was like someone flashed three lights on the wall that kinda looked like mouth and eyes. IT WAS FUCKING SCARY. I didnt have any hallucinations, wouldnt say that was a real hallucination too.

IF YOURE TLDR TYPE OF PERSON JUST READ THE PART BELLOW

&amp;#x200B;

Next day I'm already calling the psychologist for an appointment. I went to her. Told her my problems about depression, this schizo thing ect. I forgot to mention a few things, like problems reading and weird thoughts but she said to me that the disease is genetical so I dont have to worry and make goals for myself. Thats what I did. Now I am at a uni, dropped smoking weed at the start of september. So its my sixth day without weed. But I have one new problem that I tried to google but it leads nowhere. So I thought maybe any of you guys might know the answer to this. Past three weeks, maybe more I have this new thinking problem. When I think of something I tend to rethink that thing two, maybe three times in a row. Like ""I should get a boat, I should get a boat, get a boat""  these thoughts tend to be about my mental health or my bad wellbeing and it is fcking creeping me out. Could it be that this anxiety is causing it, since I don't feel that anxious no more?  I also have head aches that last like two or three seconds, could they be assosiated with it? I dont know what to add, but please even if you don't know a lot any info would be good. I cannot go to psychiatrist of psychologist due to lack of money this month so I decided I would look for insight here."
1646,How to get over certain obsessions/phobias? EMDR?,"I have a psychiatrist and a therapist but I feel like I’m not making any progress with my phobias I have. They’ve gotten way worse since my mom passed in March and it feels like they consume my thoughts 24/7 in one way or another.

My therapist is suggesting emdr but I’m skeptical. I’m going to try it and I know it will most likely help my PTSD and trauma but could it also help these fears/obsessional thoughts? I take Paxil and I’m currently weaning off bc it doesn’t help at all and my psych wants me to try an atypical antipsychotic. Any tips or support with dealing with this would be reallyyyy helpful thank you"
1647,Is it okay?,Actually im in an emotionnal abusive household as a young  adult i dont have funds now but i save money  i want to live this family forever
1648,Last night was the second time I cut.,
1649,Cuts aren't actually bad,"So 3 days ago, I tried slitting my wrist and ended up with just a normal cut that didn't harm me much 
The pain felt so relieving. It was like I forgot every other pain in my life and I could see all my problems draining away with my blood. I can't describe how beautiful the pain was. I have never felt anything so surreal before. 


It kinda ended every thought running through my mind and I was in that moment; feeling something (be it pain) after such a long time. I'm so happy I did it. I'll try again once it gets better (I somehow feel a lot better today)"
1650,I think I broke,"

I'm still not sure even as I'm feeling a little better.

It started with an ambush from my mum a few nights ago after a stressful shift. I'd just wanted to say hi before heading down to my separate living area but suddenly it's four hours later. I'm shaking and crying from the things she keeps bringing up. It feels like many times in the last few years both her and my father (seprated) have driven me to these emotional extremes. I've had a breakdown before, a few times actually, yet something about this was fundamentally different. My reaction was final. 

Usually I'll be depressed and despairing for awhile, but the fallout of this conversation lasted days. I was angry then scream-crying then bouncing back to angry very quickly. I tried to do calming exercises, tried to distract myself, but it went on for hours. I get pissy at times, but never such a hate-fueled anger before. It triggered really strong resurfacing of urges to hurt myself (which are gone thankfully). When I got up the next morning, I was still quite angry and a little distraught. It's been about 3-4 days now and I'm still trying to process my thoughts. 

I've been faced with conversations I'd personally place as far worse than this one, yet I've never experienced such a visceral reaction as this before. 

Anyone else have this happen?"
1651,Should i seek help?,"I stopped having panic attacks for about a year and suddenly two days ago, something happened. My mom was lecturing (She used to shout and hit me but she stopped when i got older) me about me being unable to memorize birthdays while i am able to understand genetics and scientific terms. 
She then went on about how i did not remember prayers. 
Im not very comfortable with religion since it caused a panic attack in the past.
I do not remember what happened next since everything was just a blur. I just remember looking down, actually unable to think. I felt really scared. My mom had to slap my knee to stop me from this kind of trance thing. 
I started crying about how much she scares me and I kinda feel bad. 

Is this okay? Should i get help? I felt so scared cause i was actually unable to think at all and i could not speak for a while."
1652,How to explain your suicidal thoughts without being committed?,I struggle with thoughts of harming myself  but they’re more intrusive and I wouldn’t act on them. They’re always in the back of my head but sometimes they get worse and I start panicking because I think I’m gonna fly off the rails and do it. I feel like if I explain this to someone I’ll get committed.
1653,I feel like I'm getting my life together.,"A little backstory. I grew up in a really abusive home, spent most of my life in total isolation, got out and had to figure out life. 

Depression has really kicked my butt at times, and when I got my first room to myself, I didn't keep it up. Mix that with starting college, trying to develop social skills, a really bad employer, and trying to figure out who I was I let parts of myself go that I shouldn't have. 

But today I'm happy, because I'm noticing improvements that I really struggled with. Yeah my room sometimes gets messy, but I can normally clean it up within a couple of hours AND I don't feel like I'm living in a biohazard (and I finally got rid of those damn ants.) 

I've gotten into a better personal hygiene schedule where I feel like I look halfway decent. (Now to work on my diet!) 

And I'm better balancing my health, school and work.  I need to make more time for friends, but it's a slow progress. 

I know this is stuff I should have figured out years ago, and a lot of it is small progress, but it feels so good that for once in my life I'm a functioning member of society. 

I think my biggest struggle was I was trying to force myself to change overnight, but really all I needed was time. 

I'm just so happy to be making progress. 🙂"
1654,Is it normal to think that someone is going to kill me when I am alone?,I only think that someone is going to kill me when I am alone.
1655,Feeling depressed,"So I really want to talk to my therapist about me feeling depressed for a little while now but I'm feeling resistant for some reason. I started therapy because I found my friend that committed suicide (January 2020) and that's been a bumpy ride but it's all made sense. And aside from the trauma, grieving and anxiety from that event I've always felt happy despite it all. Now I have no motivation to do anything productive. My house is a mess all the time. Waking up is becoming more difficult. I don't want to go down this road, I feel like I have all the tools to stop it but I'm just frozen. I'm afraid to tell my girlfriend too, and I also think she's a little depressed but is content if that makes sense. I'm not content, I'm afraid. What should I do."
1656,Nobody to depend on.,"If I talk about it to friends, I'd feel guilty. If I talk about it to my family, I'd feel ashamed. If I talk about it on the internet and gain attention, I'd feel embarrassed and shame myself for looking for attention. If I talk about it on the internet and doesn't gain attention, I'd feel like nobody really cares anyway and would only cared if I actually physically acted about it (eg : suicide). And if I kept it all to myself, I'd start to fault myself for driving everyone away from my problems despite me clearly not being able to survive it alone. I hope I'll die fast."
1657,"It's all in my head, so should I just man up or is it okay to not go?",[removed]
1658,My mental health messed up my life and feeling hopeless it will be better,"Today I realized that anxiety and depression took away all the years for me to grow as an individual. I feel like I could have done so much more during my teenage years but was unable to do so because of this mental health issue. I'm really a people pleaser that's why because of this I'm always anxious about what others are thinking of me. I feel like I've been chained by the thoughts of others to the point that I don't really speak much anymore nor volunteer myself on certain endeavors which I low-key wanted but can't due to anxiety.

It also affected my academics as I was a straight honor student back in HS but was unable to achieve that during my first year of college. I think academic or test anxiety was really on its peak during this time which maybe rooted from the fear of judgement cause I was admitted to one of the prestigious universities in my country but I feel always inferior. I was always on my dorm room doing unproductive things to cope. And I generally did not even study that much during my free time or procrastinated a lot  cause I feel like I would just flunk it. My passion for sciences was really deteriorating day by day and all I can think about is that if I fail, others would badly judge me. This led for me not to do well during labworks like my hands just begin to shake and I easily perspire which feels like I'm being mocked. In the end, I miraculously got no failing grades but mediocre ones but I don't feel like I never grew as a person. 

I was really timid so I'm easily teased or bullied by my classmates. But I just tolerate it and maybe smile or laugh with them which makes them do so frequently. I don't know if I'm kind or just scared of other people's judgements due to being a  people-pleaser. This let me feel like I was not really true to my emotions and therefore don't even know myself.  That's why, when I had a fresh start in college, I never even hang out once with anyone cause I feel like I don't enjoy other's company anymore. I also had not used social media for almost a year now but never had the courage to deactivate it. I just use another account with my name in it for academics. I really wanna chat and say hi to my friends back in HS but couldn't right now cause I feel like I abandoned them and do not deserve them anymore. I don't have any contacts with them than in social media which maybe the cause of it. So basically, I ran away from this fear until I don't have the courage anymore to use my social media. I really have a soft heart and feel always guilty even with smallest mistakes. And somehow I feel like my mental health is also affecting others as this may feel like there is something wrong with them but I know I am the problem. I can't really make  lasting and true relationships to anyone which is mainly my fault that's why I'm thankful that I at least have my family with me. 

In terms of my family, my parents esp my father is so tyrannical in the manner that I feel like I don't have a voice in our home. I'm always anxious of doing something wrong even when doing chores which I don't usually do because I'm always scolded as an idiot and only book-smart whenever I fail. At times whenever I'm lazy or do not feel like doing anything (maybe due to depression), they say my life is miserable and don't have any chance for success if I continue to do so. They do not even ask me if I'm okay cause maybe they don't believe in mental health problems. That's why, whenever I'm asked if I'm okay, I just anxiously say I am alright but deep inside I feel like a slave or at war. This is evident when I was in a psychiatric consultation for university admission which my parents was angry of because this may not let me be admitted in the university. It was the first time I cried in front of my family but I don't really know why. My tears just started flowing when they asked if I have some mental problems or any illnesses. Due to fear of dissapointing my parents, I did not fully say what I'm feeling and only say that I'm frightened about my academics. So after that, it's just a domino effect on my fucked up first year in my college life. 

But at least I have my brother who is really open and approachable unlike my parents. Although I don't really say what I feel to him, I still feel free whenever I'm with him even though in a childish manner. Though he's not an expert on giving mental health advise so I'm not really fully healed. I have another brother and sister staying out of country but due to fear of social media, I barely have any contact with them. But I think they are always there for me, I'm the one who is just scared to reach out. Overall, I have really great siblings but I'm the one who is the problem that's why I can't share this to them. 

Another reason of my anxiety is due to gender crisis . I want to be straight cause LGBT is taboo in our family. But I feel like I am somehow attractive to men. This is maybe due to my lack of masculinity myself which I find with other men. And sometimes they really turn me on esp those with big muscles and genitals which I don't have. I think this also affected my way of interacting with some boys who could have been my friend but was unable to do so due to my unnoticed attraction to them. I have never experienced any romantic relationships due to the feeling that's it's such a drag and another chain that I would be in because I feel like I would just mess it up; but maybe it's also because of this. Right now, I think I have never fallen in love or maybe suppressed it but at times lust just comes to me and I don't know  who is it for esp when watching porn. I think I'm bisexual or fully but I wanna be straight cause I know it's a sin and my family would may treat me differently. I'm sorry for sounding homophobic which I somewhat think I am because of my religion. 

Right now while typing this, I feel like I'm gonna break down cause all the suppressed emotions and feelings just comes to me. I don't even know how I survived these. It really negatively changed my personality as I became more timid, apathetic, and anti-social.I wish I could go back to my childhood where days seem to be bright and I feel hopeful for a  better version of myself. I'm losing hope right now that life would be better to me and I don't know if I can be better. 

But reddit was one of the best thing I've ever done and I guess one of my saviors as it makes me more be who I am anonymously and actually be free from the chains in the real world. I love that there are virtual communities here who anonymously support each other. I don't feel much anxious to share my thoughts here and somehow lifts off the weight I've been carrying for so long. In reality, I seem alright on the outside but on the inside I'm barely hanging on.  This is the place where I can somehow take off my mask and be vulnerable which sadly I unable to do in the real world. I just really fucked up my life and wish I could just rewind it again. 

TL;DR: I messed up my life by letting my mental health problems control me and don't know if it would get better because I'm not changing for the better. 

PS: I apologize for my bad grammar and poor choice of words cause I just poured out what I feel at the moment. And I don't know how to do TL;DR cause there are different factors to how I messed up my life. Thanks for the time reading my messy post which suggests my mental state and life."

1660,My struggle with stuttering.,"Hello people of reddit, 

For years i have struggled with stuttering and this year has been the worst so far. Stuttering has always been a self-confidence problem. When I meet new people or when I have to do a presentation at school, it always causes mental problems like depression or extreme anxiety. This week I'm going to a new school and I'm already scared about introducing myself to my class. All my life I have only had traumatic experiences with stuttering and i keep thinking about it all the time. I'm really devastated and have to find something that will just make it go away! I already have therapy but I just want there to be something that will make it less and not have constant anxiety issues. Do you guys know anything other than therapy that will help?   
 

Thank you."
1661,I’m sick of my dad.,"My dad and me had a good relationship when I was little but now I can’t stand him. He guilt trips me all the time by saying that if I don’t spend time with him I don’t love him anymore. He makes fun of the food I eat, he is so stubborn and tries to make decisions for me. If I want to stay home he tells me I have to go somewhere with him, he claims he’s a feminist but still uses phrases like “I’m the man of the house”. He tells me to act grown up but then treats me like a little kid. He calls me his baby and gets upset when I just want to be alone. If I ask him a question he doesn’t want to answer he says he will think about it but then he never answers even when I ask him again. I can’t feel independent around him and I can never be open with him because it always turns into a lecture about my opinion. I wish he just would accept that I’m growing up and that he can’t make every single choice for me anymore. I just don’t know how to deal with him and it makes me so damn angry."
1662,Just want to see myself suffer,"Does anyone else here feel the constant need to experience what they read online? Whenever I read a sad story (eg : someone lost their friend due to depression) I'd feel sad and would start to keep imagining what if I were in their shoes, until I feel stressed enough that it felt difficult to breathe and something felt like it's stabbing my chest and stuff. I'd feel guilty for having a life better than other's because I don't think I'm worthy to even keep breathing. I'd feel like everything I do is a sin, and no matter what I do surely hell is waiting for me. And I even would feel guilty for having these thoughts because it's as if I'm not grateful of my life. I'm too scared and guilty to do anything for my own sake, and can't stop hurting myself mentally like this everyday. Idk why."

1664,Mental health of children dealing with covid restrictions.,"This may be controversial but that's the point, to spark conversation about it.
My 7 year old daughter is a social butterfly. She is usually very friendly, happy and absolutely loves people. Our school went back to in person teaching now but with extreme restrictions. The kids must wear a mask all day, they must stay 6 feet apart at all times, they can not share anything etc. She came home friday VERY upset. She tore her mask off (they are required on the bus as well) stuffed in the garbage and when i asked her what's wrong? She went off in a way I've never heard her talk. She said and i quote ""I fucking hate covid I fucking hate this mask, I fucking hate not playing with my friends, I fucking hate school. I'm want to kill covid""
""I got yelled at for giving Elly a hug at school""

This upset me quite a bit. She has never shown anger to that level before. All of this stuff going on has me worried about not only my kids mental health during this but all other kids too. I've brought it up amongst people I know and their responses were juvenile at best."

I honestly have accepted that I'm probably experiencing some sort of dysthymia (high functioning depression), because I rarely get very happy these days. I'm in therapy, but slowly the therapy isn't helping that much either. I used to be such a happy person, but I'm so stressed right now, that I can't even function normally. I'm constantly overthinking and ruminating, and I just want peace from my thoughts sometimes. I think I have a combination of anxiety and depression. I told my PCP, and she lowered the dose of my birth control, in case that's the problem, but she basically just encouraged me to keep going to therapy. I also do daily yoga, exercise, and meditation, with the hopes that I can just feel better. I don't even know how to communicate that I'm depressed to anyone. Definitely not my parents or my boyfriend. My boyfriend is such a happy, mentally healthy person - I would feel horrible to bring him into this with me. I'm really good at putting on a face. In the past couple of months, I've started having way too many suicidal thoughts. I used to be afraid of death, but now I see it as a way to quiet everything happening in my mind and not deal with the impending future. I haven't actually planned anything, so I don't think I'm in immediate danger, but yes, I do fantasize about it sometimes. The only thing that keeps me from it is hurting the people who love me. 

I feel like if I tell my doctor/therapist I have this problem that they won't take me seriously. Idk what to do. On a very good day, I feel numb to emotion. On a bad day, I feel like everything is horrible and my life is doomed. I'm not this person and I don't know how this happened. I was in an abusive relationship from the time I was 19 to 21, so maybe that screwed me up. Anyone have experience with anti-depressants/prescribed medication for these problems? I'm really considering it, because I can't deal with feeling this way all the time. :("

1678,Have you ever experienced having an unsupportive therapist?," Thankfully, I have one who can understand what I am going through and can empathise with my perspective.

But this took a long time for me to accept this because based on my memory and upbringing, almost every therapist that I had (mostly during my teens so I was probably in a very different state of mind that time), never really took my side of the story or understood me thoroughly. 


I am very inclined to say that the therapists never took my side because most of the time, the perspectives of my parents often had their perspectives taken to heart and I felt like I was never understood or even had a voice. 

And because of that, I kept on constantly questioning my every thought and action, whether what I say should be said or whether what I am saying is even true.

After a very long time, I learned realised that I have been silently bullied and emotionally twisted in every argument or even conversation that I had with my family. It is almost as though they never allowed me to have a voice in the most insidious way possible and when almost every therapist who I met almost took my parents' side every time, I kept on wondering on that all stuff and BS that my parents kept on telling me or claiming were actually accurate at all. 

Even though I am realising that I have been a silent victim of years of emotional and psychological manipulation (amongst other things) and a whole list of other forms of gas lighting, I still wonder whether when the therapists who I've met were actually on the right or whether they did it because I was still under the care of my parents at that time, or whether they did it because they did not fully understand my perspective."

I know I'm going to fail. Take things one step at a time. I think of those steps and they send me into a spiral. Im told I have a defeatist attitude, thanks I'm aware of constantly getting my teeth kicked in thanks. I'm In constant mental and physical pain. Anyone have any advice I guess..."
1680,What is this feeling?,"I always get this feeling when im happy and it makes me uninterested in what in doing and it makes me sad, it also happens when i am looking forward to stuff.

This happens on the daily. Does anyone know what this is?"
1681,I have typed out and deleted this post so many times. I can't even think anymore.,"Idk what my problem is and neither do therapists. Ocd? Bipolar 1? Bipolar 2? Bpd? Agoraphobia? Autism? And for the last couple of years my inclination toward conversation, or basic input, has diminished to nearly non-existant. Scattered thoughts are my 24/7. What the hell does adulthood feel like? I couldn't tell you. Relationships? Pffff. Career? Hahaha, no. Passions? None. What the hell am I even doing here beside usurping resources that are better used in a chinese ""reeducation camp?"" Fuck me."
1682,How do I get a therapist???,"I am a teenager, I live in Poland and I feel like I can't keep it together for much longer. 

I've tried to go to my school counselor and ask for help but it didn't really work out. My parents are very sceptical about the whole thing, my mother agreed to get me professional help a few months back but said that it's impossible just like a week or so ago when I asked again. My father's views on psychology are that mentally unstable people are a threat and should be locked in an asylum. I don't have any friends that could help me. 

My mother was told and knows that I cut myself but she doesn't seem to care at all, I don't know what about my father, I don't trust him enough to share my feelings with him. 

I was thinking of going up to the school counselor and asking for help again but I don't think she's gonna understand, I can't explain anything to her because she keeps interrupting me, talking over me and assuming stuff. I often wait until she stops talking but by that time the meeting's over. I had an idea to call or text a mental health hotline or something similar but I'm too anxious to do it and I am better at expressing myself while having a face-to-face conversation. I also wouldn't want my parents to be able to hear any of that because I feel like I would get in trouble. 
I am aware of online therapy but it seems like a very awkward thing at least to me.

I really don't know what to do in this situation and I hope someone can give me some advice."
1683,Is suicide a selfish action?,"I'm trying to figure this out myself. I know in some country they have rules that you can take your life? 
I read something on how this young girl was been molested and rape. Because of her trauma, she was able to take her life 
Since I'm dealing with mental health since I was 11 until today. I don't know what else is good to live. I received unconditionally love from my friends. And my family started showing their love, but I don't feel believe in love anymore.
I was marrying a guy who have a lot of trauma and he didn't think that his trauma affecting how he treated me. I failed all relationship. It seems that I would get cheated on the relationship that I was. And I'm thinking there must be something wrong with me.
My mom told me that I was unwanted. She almost gave me away to the orphanage. And she also would say that she almost aborted me when she had me. She would say this. When she was dealing with her divorce, she would say that she wanted to end her life or just leave us because my dad was never around. And cheated on her 

I don't really believe if love is a real thing? I feel love is something that is conditionally. Why do I even still here in this world. Is the suicidal a selfish decisions? Because I can't really find the purpose of living. What life is about anyway if it's not just being selfish?"
1684,Post Psychosis Anhedonia/Agitation,"Hello, I had a psychosis 4.5 months ago and ever since I have had a feeling of anhedonia/agitation. The agitation is like a feeling of uneasiness like I’m never at peace with myself. Around 2 months ago I lowered my risperidone dose from 4mg to 3.5 and then a month ago from 3.5mg to 3mg. This past week was the first time I saw any improvement in regards to my symptoms. I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and how long did it take you to feel better? Is it from the risperidone or is it just from the psychosis? Thanks."

1693,What can I do about my daughter having a mental breakdown but refusing to help herself in any way?,"
My daughter is 21. She has no job, sits at home all the time and isn’t going to school. She was diagnosed with PCOS and PMDD at age 17. She took birth control to regulate her periods and hormones for about a year and just stopped taking it. 

She was also diagnosed with aspergers, anxiety, and depression. She refuses to take medication that was prescribed to her. She also refuses to go to therapy anymore. She has been admitted to a psych ward twice for mental breakdowns, In 2014 and in 2017.  Getting her to do chores is like pulling teeth - she will scream and throw a fit instead of doing it. It’s not with just chores, it’s pretty much with everything. Driving her car is a massive struggle. Not because she doesn’t know how to drive - because she doesn’t like driving. She can’t do anything for herself.

Today out of nowhere (I didn’t say or do anything to her, she was normal yesterday) she came down stairs and was crying and screaming, stomping and slamming doors, throwing herself on the floor. She wouldn’t tell anyone what’s wrong. This isn’t the first time she’s pulled this stunt. I’m getting real sick of this. She wants me to help her with her problems instead of going to see someone. I can’t help her. I’ve told her this. 

Her father and I haven’t been together since she was about a year old because he was physically abusive towards me and has been in and out of jail.  He also wanted nothing to do with her and tried to push me down a flight of stairs when I was pregnant. I am remarried and have been since she was 4 to my husband who is nice to her and treats her well. 

When I tell her I can’t help her - she gets mad and calls me a “narcissistic toxic bitch who should’ve just aborted me because I don’t care about her and I never did”. I told her if I’m such a bad person then she is free to leave. She said “I have nowhere to go and you know this see I knew you didn’t t care just like everybody else in your life you just let them walk out”. How am I narcissistic? You practically get whatever you want. I buy you food, you have a place to live. I try to help you, but I’m not a therapist and you don’t care to listen or take anyone’s advice. You refuse to go see a therapist and work on yourself. You expect it to be an instant fix. She just wants to play the blame game and scream at me for everything rather then help herself. The past is the past. I told her today, she’s having a mental breakdown and needs to go to the psych ward. She said “fuck that place they never help me”. I told her she can either go voluntarily to the psych ward or I’m calling the police and having her removed. She said “call the cops they won’t do anything I’m not a threat to myself or others”. 

At this point I’m over it. She doesn’t want to help herself or do anything with her life. She also screams at my husband and calls him names. It’s like She just wants to blame me for her problems and scream at me and give me a hard time. She also threw herself down a flight of stairs today. Right now she’s currently upstairs. I don’t know if this is PMS episode or what her problem is. She won’t tell me. I’m sick of it all. She’s an adult. She is a legal adult. Yes she clearly has debilitating mental problems (can’t keep a job, random explosive psychotic episodes, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite to name a few). But She also doesn’t want to help herself and wants to scream at me and play the blame game. She has resources to go to (therapy, psych ward, medication) refuses to take any of it. I don’t know what to do anymore. Sorry if I was repetitive I just really am at a loss of what to do or how to help

When she left the psych ward the last time she stopped taking the medication and didn’t go to any follow up therapy appointments. She straight up refused too."

1695,Disconnected from myself,"So recently I've been feeling really disconnected from myself. I can't focus on anything and I just sit in bed doing nothing. I feel like I need to do something but at the same time I can't. I have really bad brain fog and I'm forgetting things almost instantly. I don't feel like myself, it feels like I'm trapped inside my head.
Is there anyone else who gets like this, how do you get through it? Is there anything that helps?"
1696,I can't stop trying to peel my skin off,"I know the title sounds disgusting. There's a part of me that's disgusted with myself. I've always had a bad habit of biting my nails. I had managed to stop for a while but now that I'm stuck at home it has started again.
Worst part is I dont even know why. I have an amazing family and my studies are going great. When something doesn't go my way, I get worried but I still manage to be calm and solve it out. However, lately I've started to notice  even when a small issue  like that happens,  I start to sweat a lot more or I'd be subconsciously biting the edges of my nails. It has become so worse sometimes my fingers start bleeding. Whenever I try to stop by cellotaping my fingers, I start itching and rubbing my feet/toes or basically anything that I can peel. I really want this to stop. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself. I'm usually a level headed person but this is the one thing I cant get myself to stop doing.
I don't know if I'll delete this. A part of me will regret posting this. But I'd really appreciate any advice you might have to offer."
1697,College,"I don’t even know what to say. Ever since my first semester in college I have been so severely depressed. I think about killing myself at least once a week. The only thing really keeping me alive is my dog. Every time I do school work I end up laying in bed sobbing for hours on end. I hate my life, and I can’t drop out because I would end up probably hating my life even more. Everything feels so hopeless. I’m just caught in this never ending cycle of crying and going numb over and over again. I’m so stressed out I want to just pull all my hair out. I got put on antidepressants and they’re the worst things that have ever happened to me. I don’t even feel like myself and the worst part is I don’t even really remember what my real self is like because my depression has completely taken over. I don’t know what to do anymore."
1698,My friend keeps harming themselves if i tell them something's wrong,"So, I have a friend who is in dire need of therapy, but their parents are basically ignoring their need for it and forcing them to find a therapist on top of school and every other problem, so they aren't diagnosed with anything. They self-harm, and I thought it had stopped. I have anxiety myself, and I've been growing more comfortable to tell them when they do or say stuff that gives me any sort of trouble, to the point where I can finally tell them over text messages.

But they always self-harm after I tell them something they did wrong. I've asked them if I can avoid saying anything that sets them off, or stuff like that, and I've tried talking them out of it but they seem convinced that everything they do wrong is something they can't correct, and they'll just ignore my texts.

So now I'm too scared and anxious to tell them they did something that set me off, and they're self-harming again and it's all my fault. Is there any way to make it better?

Also, sorry if this is not appropriate on here, I was trying to find somewhere to ask this, and this seemed like the best option."

1700,I keep getting violent thoughts and i fantasize about killing people,I keep overloading my brain with anger and I feel like my mind is about to fucking collapse. This happens way too often and I keep developing aggressive behaviours
1701,Avoid Self Harm,"Hello everyone! It’s another day and another post. Today, I will talk to you about ways to prevent self-harming. 

When you’re feeling low, depressed or the anxiety is taking over your life, your mind will instantly turn to self-harming, in order to release tension. Finding ways to distract or prevent you from self-harming may help you get through the difficult moments in your life. And trust me, we all get them. Usually, people who self-harm will stop on their own accord. 

But, by saying this, there are plenty of professional help and treatments out there for you, if you suffer from self-harming. With some support, however big or small it is, it will put you on the road to recovery. 

Without any further ado, here are some tips and ways to help you to avoid self-harming. Firstly, the most reasonable one = ask help from someone you trust. This can be a family member, a close friend, a co-worker, teacher or anyone that’s close to your heart. This isn’t a sign of weakness, it shows that you’ve got enough strength inside of you to speak out to others. Also, you can seek help from professionals. For example, The Samaritans. You can call them 24/7, 7 days a week on... 116 123 or email them: jo@samaritan.org. By contacting them over email or on the phone, you’ll have someone to talk to. 

You can express your feelings in a different way. If you’re angry, how about trying a different method of getting your anger and rage out? Scream into your pillow, hit your pillow, scream at the top of your lungs... anything BUT self harming yourself. You are able to express your emotions in different ways. 

Before you consider self-harming, put a timer on. Give yourself another 10/15 minutes, wait it out. You don’t know, perhaps in the next 15 minutes you’ll feel much better. I don’t recommend staying in the same position for the next 10/15 minutes, instead, go out for a walk, go speak to a family member, exercise, listen to some music while cleaning the house... your need of self-harming could very well begin to pass over time. 

Try some calm breathing exercises. I have done a previous past post on meditation. If you’re interested, check it out. :) By using some breathing exercises, you’ll find yourself to be more relaxed and your feelings of anxiety will start to reduce.

Write your feelings down. One of the greatest tips I can give to you. Whatever that’s on your mind, rather than causing yourself physical harm, write your feelings down. 

Thank you all. And remember, BEFORE you consider self-harming yourself, check out some of these tips. Also, my PM’s are open for you at anytime. 

God bless and have a great day! :)"
1702,I don't know how to stop being sad,"What used to makes me happy doesn't have much impacts on me anymore, I'm constantly thinking negatively about myself, I'm cutting myself from social relationships because I can't bare them anymore, I'm losing the hope and motivation in doing anything, I always assume that everything I'm doing is a complete failure, I can only think of my future as something dark and hopeless... well, you got it, my mental health is not doing super well. 

If I try and talk to a friend, I'm either brushed off or not taken seriously and it makes me feels even more like shit. 

I tried the stuff I read online against depression, things such as identifying where does those thoughts comes from, understanding them, etc, but it doesn't helps.

And I don't have the money to afford a therapist.

I've always had depressed periods but I feel like I've been stuck in a never-ending one since the past 4 months or so, and I feel like I can't get out of it."

1704,Actually feel good enough to do some deep cleaning.,"So far I've completely cleaned behind my animal cages and mopped the floor under the cage, did the dishes, and wiped down the entire kitchen even behind the microwave.

1705,Am I hallucinating?,"First off sorry if this is hard to understand i don’t know what’s going on myself so that makes it hard. 

I’m unsure if I’m hearing voices or if I’m just being childish/stupid. Multiple times a week I’ll experience what I think might be a voice telling me all sorts of horrible things or telling me to do stupid things. I can’t control when it comes or goes it just happens usually when I’m alone.

The voice is in my head as if I were just thinking it but it’s definitely not me. I don’t know if it’s a hallucination or just negative thoughts that I can’t control. 

Anyone else have this?"
1706,When does something become a delusion?,"Like, at what point does it qualify?

As long as I can remember, I've honestly fully believed I can influence the future. I have a whole bunch of evidence of things I've said or wished that went on to actually happen in some way, usually for the worst and it fucking terrifies me. I get horrible intrusive thoughts too, and I'm absolutely terrified that I'll bring them into being and there's no way to get around it because the universe is sadistic and if I try to make the opposite happen, it'll just work against me to remind me of my place. All I can do is distract myself and hope whatever it is out there that makes these things happen didn't notice, or is feeling merciful or something. Does this qualify as something I should talk to someone about? I can look at it written out in words and see how someone would think ""that's just ridiculous"", but I genuinely deep down can't convince myself that it's anything but true no matter how hard I try, because if I don't believe it I'll be sorry. Something bad will happen. Something bad will happen as a punishment and I'm so scared all the time of stepping out of line and causing something awful to happen to the people I love"
1707,Adult child of sex addict looking for support group/trying to heal inner child,"I’m (32f) looking for a support group/or just someone(s) to talk to on this subject. My momAnd stepdad raised me And my stepdad was a sex addict. I personally fell victim to his addiction. If anyone can relate and wants to talk PM me :)

Back story: My biological father left when I was 8 months old and my mom remarried when I was 4. He took on the role of my father and even wanted to officially adopt me (I don't know the details but I guess my biological father wouldn't allow it). Stepdad was an IT guy. Knows computers better than anyone I've ever known. Fast forward 17 years, my mom and him had divorced but he and I remained close. As I said before, he took on the role of ""dad"" to me, even after their divorce. I was 22 at the time and I was actually about to move in with him, into my old childhood room, until I figured out what I wanted to do after college. My grandma had been living with him but due to her health she needed to move to assisted living. My step dad had a funeral to attend in Washington so over that same weekend my mom and I decided to move my grandma. I wanted to help relieve some stress from my mom so I told her that Saturday night I was going to stay at my stepdad's house (it was the house I grew up in) since nobody would be there and I'd finish packing the rest of my grandma's belongings. Long story short, I had to get more boxes from the master bedroom. I hadn't been in that room since my parents were still married 5 years prior. I had no reason to so I'm not sure how long it had been like this... The bathroom had stacks of paper with printed pictures of naked young girls. There was a laptop with a fold out chair in front of it. I knew something was wrong but I couldn't quite process it. I turned the laptop on and my life was changed forever. It was me. Naked. I had a serious boyfriend in college and we had taken some pictures for each other. I had them in a hidden folder on my laptop. The laptop that my dad said he ""needed to run updates on"" and then told me it crashed and bought me a much more expensive one. He took my pictures and then made it his background on his computer. I opened the drawer underneath the laptop and took the usbs I found inside. I grabbed the computer and ran out of the room. The first usb I put in had every single picture my ex and I had taken. Except, he cropped my ex out and in case he wasn't messed up enough, he then sharpened the images. I went through a dark few years after that. Now it's been almost 10 years and now I find myself struggling to find a place I feel I ""fit in"" with my trauma. I know other people have situations way worse than mine But I also think I'm validated to feel a certain kind of way."
1708,On the road of self destruction,"I'm very self destructive atm. My ex dumped me 2 weeks ago and I've had to move out into temp accommodation and have to find somewhere else to live. I'm starting my postgraduate next week and it's going to be intense. I really want to work in this vocation but I'm self sabotaging at the moment. I have GAD and Depressive disorder with EUPD traits and I'm just feeling these intense lows. 

Yesterday, I went to the gym and felt amazing afterwards. Had 4 hours sleep but woke up the most refreshed I've been in ages. Throughout the day, my mood has been dipping but I'm trying to get it back up through drinking alcohol and energy drinks. I'm planning on going back to the gym tomorrow morning but I need to feel the elevation in mood again

I've started drama with my family members and posting outing information about how bad my childhood was on social media to try to get a reaction out of people. I feel so alone in what's going on with nobody to be there to just care about me. 

I feel like a waste of space. I already tried to commit suicide (not wholeheartedly) the day my ex broke up with me and I'm scared I might do it again. But also at the same time, it would end my suffering. 

I dont know what this post is supposed to mean, just venting my feelings really. The last couple of days I've been getting high as a kite (on cannabis). Yesterday and today I havent touched it but leaning back to giving it a try. It's so good with focusing my mind on something else and not the reality of my horrid, dreadful, lonely life right now"
1709,I’ve got this friend,I’ve got a friend who seems to be a little suicidal. She has an abusive mom and I told her to talk to me or her boyfriend when she feels this way (she has a therapist.) I feel like I’ve given myself a lot of responsibility. I feel like I can’t sleep just in case something happens. I would do anything to ensure her safety but I don’t know if I actually have the capability.
1710,I always cry at night,"First off, I am 19 (m) and  have never experienced any sort of depression or anxiety attacks, that was  until last month...
I started to wake up at the middle of the nights and cry uncontrollably for hours and have panic attacks coz I started to have nightmares and thoughts about my parents passing away not by some gore accidents or anything just natural death. Now I can't even thinking about this subject without having a mental meltdown, even as I am typing this post I am having trouble controlling my emotions. I am not a very religious person but I always pray to God to trade my days on earth with my parents just so they live long enough to see me happy and successful...but I am always afraid of letting them down coz I am there only son and there eldest child
I haven't slept properly for 2 days now, coz I keep having this panic attacks.
What can I do now?"
1711,I just need to vent about my parents,"Tw: therapy/parents/childhood memories 

So after a complete and utter breakdown, meds, beingt sectioned and finally getting a diagnosis, I am seeing a therapist for weekly sessions.
I started these session with the mindset of ""well my parents were fine, so it's nothing to do with them"" but the more I've talked the more has surfaced about my past and now it's come out, I feel like I've just been left with this information I have no idea how to process. Ignorance was bliss.

I was in no way abused, at all, so I even feel bad posting this, as I know there are people in this thread who were so I feel bad complaining too.

In therapy I was talking about how we were poor, but it was OK.
Then we got talking about my baby brother who died at 22 hours old, and I was talking about how my parents told me he never existed, even though I remember him and my mothers pregnancy.
Then I was talking about how my parents sent me to weightwatchers at 11.
Then we were talking about how my parents would give me fines for things, like my mother would do my washing for me, as a child, and if I had discharge in my underwear, I would get a fine and have to pay her.
Then we talked about how I was always told they wished I was another child, they used to tell me which children they wished I was like.
Then we talked about how I could never really guess what mood they would be in when I got home from school, sometimes they would just be so mad at me, or other times they were my best friend. I never knew what I was coming home to, or how they would react to something. It was actually really confusing. 
They were also devoutly Catholic, and I was sent to Catholic school which I hated, and the strict Catholic views were taught at home too. 

It's not abuse, but suddenly I feel like the relationship I had with my parents had all changed, and I just don't know what to do. I feel all messed up inside now. All these things were deeply buried inside me and now they are out and I feel like it's tarnish everything.

I'm not even sure I'm looking for advice, I think I just needed to tell someone. It's like it's all bunched in my head now and I have just been handed this information and I don't know what to do with it."

1713,Can self harm cause phantom pains?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I was wondering if it is possible to feel pain even when the arm is totally cured.

Like imagine that someone might have self-harmed in a way that if questioned could lie and say it was just some cat scratches. So not many, not deep cuts that didnt leave any scars.

Can a person like that feel phantom pain or is something else wrong with the arm?

Also can those if it does happen can it extend to parts of the arm that didnt get self harmed?"
1714,Is this normal?,"Sometimes I think life would just be so much easier if I were dead. Like I know I’m not actually going to kill myself and I don’t even want to plan it but sometimes every now and then like 5ish times a week I just sit there and go, you know I’d quite like to just not be here in all seriousness. But then I think that that would destroy the people around me as I know I am really loved and I just try not to think about. Sometimes I just want to cry for a while to because I just can be bothered. But then because I know that nothings going to come from it I don’t know if this is just a bit of stress and everybody just gets a little overwhelmed every now and then."
1715,Feeling disconnected,"Hey, I'm 19 and have been dealing with trauma (budding ptsd?) and depression/anxiety since I was about twelve. Lately, over the past year or so, I've been feeling disconnected from reality. Not like I can't tell what's real and what's not, but everything feels fake. (If you've done acid, it's kinda like that but 24/7)

Looking for some ideas of what this could be and how to help/prevent it. Any suggestions help, thanks sm in advance 💗"
1716,My parents take a toll on my mental health,"I was never able to talk to my mom when I was younger because she would say stuff like “grow up,” or “”you’re not a baby anymore.” I didn’t have no one to talk to growing up and I just held it all in. My anxiety was so bad that I would pee on myself without meaning to. I was too scared to tell them because I was afraid of being whomped. One time I got nervous and peed on myself in Walmart and they were making fun of me on the car ride home. I couldn’t help it. I didn’t know it was my anxiety doing this to me. I didn’t even know what anxiety was when I was a kid. All I knew was, I had trouble holding my bladder when I was nervous.

When I was little and me and my sis would tell them no or wait a minute when they would tell us to do things they would threaten to whomp us. Now I’m the type of person to say yes to anyone. I can’t tell people no at all. For example, when I was clocked out of work today one of my coworkers told me to get some customers knowing good and well I was clocked out. I couldn’t say no and even though I hated it, I did it anyway and brought customers their drinks. I have to say yes to anything or I feel uncomfortable saying no. 

Growing up my mom would randomly snatch our phones out of our hands and proceed to go through them. She would accuse my sister of watching porn if she’d get email spams. To me, I think she would try to get my sister in trouble on purpose because mom loved drama. She would accuse my sister of crazy stuff like putting mouthwash in her eye contact lenses. She would look for anyway in the world to punish my sister for no reason. My little brother gets by with so much stuff and even watches porn. He tells them no constantly and gets always with it.

I just got off work. Two days ago I worked a 8 hour shift. When I got home I get bitched at for not doing anything around the house which I did clean it just wasn’t perfect. I didn’t do the dishes I was too tired too. Yesterday I worked a twelve hour shift and was afraid of coming home that night because I knew they’d make me clean. They don’t let me sit down. When I get home today I had to clean the porch and now I’m getting ready to clean up again. 

My mom doesn’t even work and doesn’t even clean the house. I have to do everything. I’m so tired of it because my brother doesn’t have no chores to do other than to clean his room. When I’m not at work I’m completing college. I’m trying to save my money and move out but it’s hard because I’ve had to spend a lot on my car. 

I’m in tears right now because I’m literally mentally and physically exhausted. I’m aggravated because my brother should be the one doing stuff around here because he doesn’t do anything. I’m 19 and mom would have me and my sis cleaning when we were eight and seven years old. My brother is 12 and doesn’t know how to wash dishes. He sprays them with cleaning ammonia"
1717,Nightmares,"my name is a.k. i suffer from a multitude of mental health problems, but nightmares are what i want to share right now. three years ago (2017), at the age of twelve, i was  s•xually assaulted by a girl who was one of my best friends at the time.

coping with it took time, and this year is actually when i've finally gotten over it. in a way. just last night, i had a horrid dream where the same thing happened again, but with worse things, a man being the perpetrator, and it being someone i didn't know.

i'm truly terrified, and have had multiple panic attacks today. i have to return to school on tuesday, and i'm dreading having to go, since i have my own fears about the man who drives my van, and the creepiness i get from him, and the fact that my school is located in a mall.

i don't want to relapse back into my old self destructive behavior, as my body is scarred enough and i would probably detriment my own appearance, and have to be hospitalized. i'm scared and don't know what to do.

while i am not in any immediate danger, i'm currently petrified of leaving the house and being outside alone.

if anyone could provide some advice, i'd appreciate it very much.

1718,How to talk to my boyfriend about my self harm and mental health in general,"Hi all, I just really need some support and maybe advice because I’ve been really struggling and I’m so confused on how to talk to my boyfriend about my mental health. I’ve been dealing with depression and other issues for a long time but it got a lot worse in the past year or so and I have had 7 inpatient/hospitalizations for attempts/ideation within about a year, and I still don’t know how to talk about this with him even though we’ve been together throughout my episodes. He knows about my depression/anxiety and consistent suicidality and bpd, and wants to be supportive, but more often than not he just gets frustrated with me and shuts down when I open up to him even though he wants me to be open with him.
I’ve recently begun self harming again and every time I talk to my boyfriend, he gets angry with me for not telling him sooner or not telling him before I do it. Nothing seems to be enough, he closes off when I tell him I want to hurt myself and he doesn’t understand, but in the same breath he tells me he is here for me, and I don’t know what to do. I need his support and love and gentleness instead of being angry with me for “lying “ because I didn’t tell him about it immediately. I understand it hurts him but it hurts that he just jumps to being mad at me without being empathetic or gentle and wanting to talk about what’s going on.
He also just gets upset because he feels I am keeping things from him in terms of my mental health when in reality I just don’t know how to explain what’s going on, and when I do it doesn’t come out right and he seems to shut down, he says he’s listening but it doesn’t seem like active listening and he’s still upset with me and treats me coldly for a little while after we talk, so it’s even harder to try to keep communicating to him when he has reacted like this in the past, I am already hurting and instead of comforting me, he just makes me feel worse.
I don’t want to be selfish because I know he has a lot going on too, but when I’m doing bad, I need his support and I don’t know if it’s wrong to be asking/wanting him to be gentle with me and putting his own feelings aside for a little bit when I need support. I try my best to do the same for him although I know I don’t always do a good job.
We love each other so much and we’re both trying so hard but it’s the same every time I get bad. He’s also in a high stress job environment so I know it’s even harder on him when I’m not doing well or in crisis. We both would definitely go to couples counseling about this if we could, but we are long distance so that’s not an option. 

If you need more clarification or more info please ask, and I’d really appreciate any help if you can. I’m 20f and have been in the Navy for over two years and that is unfortunately partially what triggered my depressive episodes and the reason my boyfriend and I are long distance most of the time."
1719,"How can I tell if I should see a psychologist about my focusing issues, or if I am just lazy or undisciplined?","For as long as I can remember, I've had issues with focusing. But I've never really thought them as potentially disordered, because I did okay. I graduated college (with C's), have degree-relevant stable employment, have a girlfriend. I go on ADHD forums, and see people losing jobs and having relationships ruined due to ADHD, and feel like I'm not even close to that.

I can't seem to just sit down and focus on anything, even if I really want to. I want to study and learn in a sector of my field of work. I legitimately want to, it's interesting to me, and I would love to learn to use it. But after a short period of time, I just kind of fuzz-out and none of the information crosses into my brain. Sometimes I find myself on reddit, youtube, a video game, but not enjoying it at all and wondering how I got there from study. 

But on the flip side, I've learned new technologies at work (maybe a bit slower?). But that was because I would probably get fired and go hungry if I didn't. That same ""or I'll basically die, financially"" has the crux of my ability to do anything I've done in life. College, high school. 

I also tend to fuzz out on conversations even if they are important. I find myself loving when folks email me important info, rather than a phone call, because I can reference it because I know I'll miss 40% of the info coming my way.

Can anyone tell me if this just sounds like burn out, or laziness, or something else?"

1722,How to get over fear of physical intimacy?,"Hi, I've been diagnosed with ptsd and am doing currently a (cbt) therapy for my bpd. But because of the lockdown my therapy is on a hold. (And I am also at the beginning, I just have resources on how to deal with high stress levels caused from triggers or something like that.)



I didn't plan this but I've met this sweet guy and I realize I am crushing on him. I think I am not ready for a relationship because of my ptsd. Even if I really want it, I am so afraid I will just get triggered.. The last time I met a guy I kinda got triggered by him just getting near me while watching a movie. Me knowing he was romantically interested made me anxious most of the time. 



I had a boyfriend before but we met in a time period where I did everything with everyone because of impulsivity/lack of self respect. Now I am the exact opposite.



I planned on going with the flow but now I got unsure if this is even a good idea. But it kinda sucks, I just get depressed at the thought of me not dating for the next few years because of my mental health...


If it goes into this direction I will ask him to move things slow but even if I want physical contact it feels like my body/mind is working against me?


This issue doesn't only affect my romantic relationship. I also tense up and get awkward if my friends get too close even if I trust them completely. I just want to feel free...


I want to use the spare time to learn how to get over my fear of physical contact. Or if any of you had the same issue I would be interested on how you got over it."

1724,I feel like trash for making my parents spend money even though I don't know if I'm actually depressed,"For the last two months I've been feeling tired everytime, losing interest for things I was used to like to do, having eating and sleeping issues, having anxiety crisis and awful thoughts.
I (13) already knew I had anxiety, but it had never shown up like it did now, besides the anxiety symptoms, I searched the other things I was feeling. I know googling symptoms is never a good option but this time it was exactly the same symptoms, neither less nor more. I was feeling depression symptoms, so I started searching more and more about depression and it just became more and more relatable.
After some time I got addicted to self-harming and it just got worse.
One time my father saw the bruises and he and my mom took me to a psychiatrist, she (the psychiatrist) prescripted some medicine and after some searching I found out that it was an antidepressive.
I now know that it is most likely that I'm actually depressed, but my psychiatrist didn't say it to me explicitly, so I'm having anxiety crisis and feeling like trash because I'm afraid that I'm not ill at all and just making my parents spend money and being a debt to them.
Sorry for any English mistakes, I'm from Brazil and English is not my primary language, so I'm not so good at it.
I would really appreciate some advice, thank you all guys in advance &lt;3"
1725,My medication was stolen by a friend of a friend,"I was prescribed vyvanse for add, and within two days of having it it was stolen from me. I had a friend over one night, and he asked if it was alright to have one of his friends over, and I thought why not? I know this guy and trust him, and I would think he wouldnt invite anyone he didnt trust over, so I thought it was fine. Then the next day I woke up and went to get my meds from the livingroom, and they were gone. I tore the house up looking for them, and finally concluded that they mustve been stolen. I let a person into my home, I trusted them, I gave them a beer and some coffee, I was nothing but nice to them, and that worthless fucking tweaker junkie fuck stole the meds I need to get my shit together. I spent all night having nightmares about having to tell my doctors that my controlled narcotic substance was stolen, and trying to convince them that I didnt sell them, because I know they wont believe me. They never believe anyone. I honestly dont know what to do at this point. I try and get my shit together, and this is what happens. This is what happens when you trust people. This is what happens when youre nice to people. They stab you in the back and Rob you. People are worthless.

If I see him again, which isnt likely cause he lives a bit far away, I'm going to stab him."

1728,I feel like i have an evil person inside of me trying to ruin my life.,"Eversince I was small I know I could be triggered by aggressive behavior, I would simply switch my mind went black and my eyes rolled back into my head, I certainly felt like I could have killed something or someone..

As years have went by I have learned to control this behavior KINDA, avoiding triggers and staying out of discussion etc.

I am ruining my life now tho, I have this voice kinda inside of me that tells me bad things about everyone and everything, I simply don’t wish good for anyone not even my boyfriend that I love to death.
I will drag his hobbies, throw the biggest scene if he goes out to meet with his friends, I will threaten to kill myself and I always break up with him.
I will always find every single failure he does and turn it in my favor.
I am extremely toxic and manipulative, I really believe I mentally abuse my boyfriend..

But on the other side, I feel ALL these things I do, I see myself being this monster from the inside, I see and feel everything evil I do to people around me.

When I was younger, I would steal and break my friends things that they cared about etc..

I do not feel like a human being on this earth, I really don’t think I deserve to be loved or cared by anyone, I hate myself so deeply and I wanna get away from the monster I am..

I know I sound really evil and I am! But when I’m stabil I’m this loving caring person, but also pretending that I love life and that I’m spiritual and it works bc sometimes I’m happy but it lasts a short while.

Does anyone here have a clue is this is some kind of anti social behavior, some tips for a good treatment.
I have never in my life spoken so deeply about myself and I am making myself so vulnerable I know my mistakes and that I’m a horrible person, so I don’t need to get comments about that.

I am simply looking for some kind of help, as I am afraid of myself and how I can ruin everything around me and inside myself always.

1729,Is there a mental condition that makes you severely mess up your words?,"Not trying to be diagnosed with anything, just curious if this is an actual thing or just me. I have an ADD diagnosis but I’ve never heard of this being a symptom.

“I got a waddle a bottle” (Bottle of water)

I am currently in recovery from an eating disorder. I have a long history of treatment stays and hospitalizations due to anorexia.

I’ve been doing better with eating because I traded symptoms and developed a drinking problem instead. I’ve recently gotten sober and now my restriction is becoming a problem again.

The anniversary of my rape is coming up soon and I’m not dealing well.

1734,A poem I wrote about my current feelings.,"Grab a book.
Throw it into a flame.
As the pages all slowly burn away.
Words turning to ash.
They were once valuable in the past.
But now the book is nothing but a pile of dust.
And everyday I feel like I'm losing trust.
Trust in who I am and what I can achieve.
Shadows of the deep.
Pulling me closer and closer.
To something I don't want to do.
Tears frozen in grins.
Fears soaked deep in worry.
People laughing and smirking and I don't feel like I have any humor.
Freedom was once granted but now it's rewarded.
I held onto you in hopes that you'd stay.
Even though I know you've already flown away.
Living my life as if it is nothing.
Escaping conversation because i feel something missing. 
Expectations wrapped in disaster.
Visions plastered on horrors.
I pray for the day where I can see you again.
Even though I know that it will never happen.
Took you for granted, wanted to see you grow old.
But now you're underground and I feel so alone."

1736,Does medicating for many years make depression progressively worse?,"I have tried just about everything aside from pharmaceutical intervention to try and cure my apathy/depression. I am thinking about seeing a psychiatrist to get on medication but I am 26 and I fear that decades of medicating might only make things worse. Plus, I was so horrible at staying consistent with all the non pharmaceutical strategies that I have tried that I’m scared I will be inconsistent with medicating. Which would certainly make things worse. 

Has anyone out there been on medication for decades? I’d prefer insight from reddit on this since psychiatrists will probably not directly tell me that things get worse if they do"
1737,My (M19) younger brother(M16) tried to kill himself,"Of course, I do not think he is actually suicidal.

However, I wonder what could be the cause of this. It happened out of nowhere. Well, not really nowhere. His girlfriend(F16) is actually suicidal and has tried to kill herself, though she did get help and is now a bit better. He has anger problems and is now a bit better, but I can’t help but worry about any future issues and if he may become actually suicidal. Are there any ways I can help him?

1739,Struggling to regain my sense of self,"Sorry for typos or formatting, I am doing this on my phone.

I will try to be as brief as I can. I know a lot of people talk about losing themselves when they have children. Honestly, the same has happened to me since the virus started. 

I am an essential worker, I work in healthcare and treat/work with patients. I used to enjoy wearing make up, fixing my hair, etc. It made me feel confident and good about myself. That has long since stopped. No point in doing any of that when you wear several layers of protective gear and sweat through makeup in 15 minutes and spend the next 8 to 10 hours with it running in to your eyes and burning. Same for my hair, it is a sweaty, frizzy mess with in an hour of starting so what's the point of fixing it?

My face has broken out in horrible cystic acne because of the constant mask wearing at work. I have never had this bad of skin in my entire life, not even when I was a teenager. It is ugly and embarrassing and it hurts.

I am so exhausted after work that I rarely have the energy to cook anymore so I have been mostly living off of take-out. This has resulted in me gaining weight, which makes me feel even worse.

My work treats me like garbage, tells me constantly that I am replaceable and should be all but worshipping them with my gratitude because they are ""allowing me to have a job during a pandemic."" They have given us no hazard pay, and are not letting us use any time off. I haven't had any vacation time at all this year. 

I am so burned out. I don't even recognize myself anymore. I am annoyed, frustrated or angry all the time. Even minor things feel frustrating and overwhelming. My visceral reactions to things are so... angry for no real reason. I have such hateful thoughts about people, which has never been something I do. I am so depressed. I feel like crying all the time. I have no free time to get therapy or talk to anyone about this.

I am not sure what writing this all out is supposed to accomplish. I guess maybe I needed to get it all out."
1740,I feel weak,"I've been struggling with my mental health since I was young, but recently it feels like nothing makes me happy anymore and it just keeps getting harder to fake, I faked being happy for years but it's all become too much at once. My mind never stops racing, and I have this constant weight on my chest.

I feel like a burden to everyone around me, even though I know it isn't true but I can tell a part of me believes I am and it's loud, I feel selfish even thinking this way and throws me even deeper into depressive thoughts and moods. I've clawed myself away from suicide multiple times already in my life to try and save those close to me all that pain but all I feel is pain nowadays and no one seems to notice, but It's been my reality for so long that sometimes I don't even notice it just feels normal for me to be down, so how can I blame them for not noticing.

Of course there's a few people I talk to but they have their own problems they definitely don't need to worry about me on top of it, yet when I do text them to talk if it takes a while for them to respond I get extremely anxious that they hate me in every way. This makes me feel even more like a completely selfish asshole. 
I've dug this hole I feel like I can't leave and suicide is feeling like the only option to actually get out of my head and feel at peace."

She’s dealt with depression, self harm and attempted suicide. She’s been great the past few months but now being alone has made these thoughts come back. She text me that she was having thoughts of self harm that day but what happened that night I didn’t expect. 

I checked her location before bed as I always do and found out she was in the hospital. Come to find out she was jumped outside of our apartment and attacked then stabbed in the stomach. She’s ok bruised up a lot and has staples in her but the knife didn’t hit any organs. The thing is she’s completely closed off now and won’t talk to me or anyone about what happened. Knowing her I stopped pressing to know what happened because it’d make it worse. The thing that concerns me is she doesn’t want to pursue the person or press charges. Is this normal? Also how can I help her with her mental illness and now coping with this. I can’t move till October and she has asked me not to until then. So, how do I help her?

1752,I am in love with someone who does not exist,"I  was 16 when he first appeared in my dream; we were at the beach and  having bbq, pretty standard. Since then, I been dreaming about him  regurarly (but not all the time) and I never met this person, in fact he  doesnt exist. I dont know anyone who's remotely similiar to him in my  awake life.

we interact in most of  my dreams but in some dreams his just in the background; observing and I  would clock he is there, watching me. Almost feels like lucid dreaming,  I am completly aware of his nature and that he only appears in my dream  but I continue with my dream life anyways. His personality is kind,  fun, agreesive, rude but charming. He feels so familiar and comfortabe  like I have know this person since birth (corny sorry). I would tell him  my problems and he would help me sort them but keep in mind these  problems are dream life problems not my awake life problems. His  physical appreance is consistant but I dont know his face, I could never  remember when awake. I litreraly have a relationship with this guy and I  dont know what his face looks like.

I'm  23 now and he has been appearing in my dream almost everyday, I never  dreamt about him this often before and its really effecting my awake  life becuase I want him and no one else. I have tried boyfriends but  emotionally I'm never satisfied, so it never works out longer that 6  months. I'm the kind of person who can't see anyone else when they're  smitten with someone. So, I don't develop crushs in awake life, I find  people attractive enough to sleep with them but not never want to be  theirs or vice versa. I am aware this is very odd and it is  psychologically unhealthy to continue. I dont get attached to people  easily, so its really hard to let go of him.

I  dont really want to go therapy right now so any professionals on here  please give me your opinions or advice. Also, if anyone who has  experienced something similiar please let me know so I dont feel alone. I  am open to any opinions really, spritual, medical, psychological."

I feel depressed so I try to do be productive and work on stuff and read, but I feel like is too much and I can't, but if I give up I'll feel guilty and I'll go down a really dark rabbit hole. I feel like I can't hide my feelings anymore, I'm exhausted and gosh it's hard.

My closest friend didn't message me today after our fight yesterday and I don't feel good about it, I can't message her, it's hard for me to message people and it's impossible for me to message someone after we fight, I just want to end it.

Today was hard, I went outside with a bunch a friends, a couple and another friend. Seeing them together was pretty hard, especially because she was giving him a lot of affection and he was really cold with her and I'm carving some affection pretty bad, I don't judge him though, he can do whatever he wants and it's her relationship. What hurt me a lot it was that he said that I'm really nice and he likes to hang out with me, but he never calls me to hang out and stuff. And I think that people don't like me because I'm too protective, every time we meet we usually drink and I always try to make sure that everyone is safe and gets home safe and such, I'm usually the sober one since I have pretty high alcohol resistance and don't get drunk easily (plus that I'm a pretty responsible drinker).

I feel like I'm really unlikeable and a shitty person, I must be, because people don't like me. I just want a close friend and maybe a significant other, do I ask too much? I feel like I don't deserve such stuff. Happiness is such a rare resource, I get so little of it.

Anyway awesome people, I don't feel OK and I can't type anymore or say anything anymore, I'm exhausted.

I love you!"
1755,"Seeking suggestions on dealing with anxiety, depression &amp; uncertainty during these times","Hello everyone,

Just few basics about me before going into the details of my concerns. I recently completed my PhD at top 10 university in the US. In this journey, I also realized that I am struggling with few mental health problems, anxiety, depression and most importantly, feeling lonely. While I was a student, a therapist helped me to cope up with these. I am grateful for her.

I also got a job in Canada while graduating and have been waiting for the visa to be approved for 11 weeks now. This uncertainty of being unemployed and living on my savings in the US till I get my visa is driving me crazy. This is cause I don't want to spend up all my savings and eventually go back to my home country. My Canadian employer asked me to start working from mid September as they might pay me through wire transfer but they still aren't sure about this.

Also recent breakup with my girlfriend, and no insurance and hence no therapy are making me more depressed and feel lonely. Somedays I just feel that there's no one to connect emotionally with. I do have my parents and relative back in my home country but I never really share my concerns with them as it never really helped in the past.

Even though I am ashamed to admit, I also thought how it would be if I end my life to end this suffering. But that's only a one time thought. I stopped thinking about it after that.

As I don't have anyone to talk about these things and also since I can't afford a therapist, here I am anonymously seeking suggestions from strangers."

1758,Struggling to continue after the passing of my Mum,"I (24M) have been stuck in a loop for nearly two years now. 

I have suffered with mental health issues since I was 19 (depression and anxiety) but was actually on the mend until my Mum was diagnosed with Cancer during the Christmas season of 2017. She really did suffer but it was short and she passed October 23rd 2018. Since then I have really struggled to continue.

I have been put on new medication and taken up counselling but it seems that my morale has finally dropped enough to the point that I feel how I did years ago. My passion for life has gone after loosing my mum and I just really feel like it's time to go.

Every night I have the same dream where I relive the final day where she was taken out of her coma and it haunts me. It feels like I haven't slept on two years and my body feels heavy. I hurt every day and now with the addition of medication I can't even really express how I feel with words, I certainly can't cry. I just want to rest"
1759,What do I do,"I have come out to my mom about wanting to goto therapy because of my stress, paranoia and hearing things and wanting to vent about my dad being detrimental to my mental health, my mom said we can but I still haven’t gone,I’ve been asking her for about a month, she says she’ll set up an appointment by the end of the week but never does, she says that the reason I have mental health issues is because I stay up late, I know a pandemic is going on, I want to get a therapist but is now a good time should I wait until later? I don’t know what to do she keeps saying she’ll set a appointment but doesn’t."

Even in my darkest times in the past there was something to look forward to, but now it feels like my future has been erased."
1761,Depression is causing me to not want to do anything I enjoy how do I start enjoying these things again?,"I’ve been really struggling lately with watching tv, watching movies, doing arts and crafts, reading, listening to new music, just anything I do in my free time really. I will get a spark of excitement and decide to do these things but the minute I begin actually doing it I lose any desire to do it. I’ve been trying not to force it but I want this to end and I want to enjoy things again. How do you overcome this?"
1762,Never good enough/never satisfied?,"Why do i feel what I do is never good enough? My parents have always been caring and loving. For instance in my studies I get good grades, they say they are proud of me and to always push myself to be even better. Sometimes I feel a little discouraged by this, from their point of view they say they don't mean that what I do is not good enough, they just think I can accomplish even greater things. I kinda get it but I still feel a bit empty inside of me. My father particularly, is a very good person, but he had a bit of a troubled infancy so It's hard for him to sometimes express his feelings openly, this sometimes increases the feelings to keep pushing myself, but still, specially now that he is older he tries to do his best to encourage me.

Even when they say they are proud I feel they say it because it's the ""good parents"" encouragement you are expected give to your son. I feel kinda grateful but cursed that they always educated me to always do my best, but sometimes I wish I didn't. When i was in school, some of my friends just didn't study much or did much homework and they seemed to have more fun. I went to parties for time to time but even then their lives seemed much more relaxed. Even if I tried to live like that I couldn't, I could not just say f*ck it and don't do anything. There was always this internal guilt, even if my parents were not expecting anything in particular from me.

Idk if this translates to other parts of my life but I am not often very proud of the things I do, even do others give me praise for them. Idk why I tend to have a very cynical view of others as well, when someone compliments me is either because it is expected of them or they want something from me (I kinda feel like a child who is getting complimented by their shitty macaroni art). I know I should give myself more credit and I do try to by watching some guides and videos about self worth but it just doesn't feel natural and it's very fustrating, kinda like if someone was expecting you to find ultimate happiness in life by reading a book ""how to find ultimate happiness in life"" and then be done with it. Even now I am bit skeptical about posting in this subreddit xD. Idk it just feels it is always the same ""motivational talk"" but doesn't solve anything, I don't really even know what I am looking for or expecting. Anyways any advice would be entertaining at least to read :)"

I just want to have a someone help clean up the attic (my mental health) and just listen? Maybe help me feel less overwhelmed sometimes and help me cope with things better and just work through past experiences to help understand myself better.

1766,I think I’m experiencing the beginning of a psychotic episode and I’m alone and afraid,"Hi, I’m sorry if the title seems over dramatic or this post seems wild. 
 
I’ve been feeling really strange all day, like tired and unmotivated and just not myself. I tried to take a nap earlier but I was having racing thoughts so I couldn’t and then I heard voices (?) it was just like incoherent whispering in my ear, just once. I’ve never experienced this before but I have had periods of really bad depression where I see like flickering lights or shadows. 

I continued feeling strange all day and about an hour ago I was putting up some Halloween decorations and I started feeling very panicked, like I was being timed as if it was a race. Then things started feeling not “real” (I’m sorry i can’t articulate this better, it’s kind of like watching a movie of yourself instead of being present in your own consciousness). 

This feeling has been worsening but also now I’m like...terrified. Like I’m just in full freak out, crying terror and every noise I hear (which I think are real noises, like animals outside or my hamster in his cage) is majorly scaring me. Also, I want to hold my hamster but I’m afraid that I will crush him if I hold him, like that I’ll hurt him, even though I don’t want to. Also, when I look down, like at my phone right now, I’m too scared to look back up because I feel like there will be something there. 

For medical history, I have CPTSD (depression and anxiety included under that umbrella) and I started taking Wellbutrin XR 300mg 2 days ago as well as Norethindrone birth control. I also took one Ativan on Thursday because i had a medical procedure done, i don’t know if that’s relevant. I’ve been on Wellbutrin before but had been in a depressive episode and hadn’t taken it for 2 or 3 months. 

I’m sorry this is very disorganized and I hope it makes sense, I’m really afraid that it’s not articulated understandably or that I’m not typing real words or something. 

Does anyone have advice on like calming myself down? Is this just a panic attack? Will it pass? Like it kind of sounds like psychosis but i also think i have reasonable mental clarity. At least enough to be like “this is not normal”. I don’t think I’m at risk of hurting myself, or even my hamster. 

I’m by myself and I don’t have anyone to call. I’m afraid to go to the hospital because I’m scared they will hurt me."
1767,I can give support but I hate receiving it.,"Hi everyone,

I was just having a moment of self-reflection and realized that I’ve always had a hard time going to therapy because I knew my therapist didn’t care and I felt bad for making them sit and listen to me. Every time I have built good rapport with a therapist I get irritated by it and ghost them or fizzle our without a proper good bye. Whenever a therapist has gone over during a session, I’ve felt anxious and mad that I couldn’t figure out their actual motive. I would cancel sessions and miss appointments because I just don’t receive. 

I am currently a mental health care worker and mentally pretty sound and not currently in therapy (not that I can afford it anyway). I care about my clients and genuinely want to do whatever I can to see them excel. 

I am the person my friends know they can count on when they want to talk about something without being judged. I work with the homeless population because I genuinely care so deeply about their lives and want to make them feel even a tiny bit better. I know I care about other people, but in my head, I also know other people don’t care about me.

Anytime I receive a compliment my chest tightens up and I deflect and don’t believe them. Sometimes when I think about no one caring about me I get sad, but mostly I just get pissed that people think they can fool me into me thinking they care about me. 

I don’t know if I have an undiagnosed personality disorder or something, but I hate being on the receiving end so much that I don’t even have any motivation to try to change it. But it also makes me really sad and distressed so I don’t know what I want. Has anyone on here experienced this? I’ve been this way my whole life and I’m in my early 20s."

1769,Should I go to Therapy?,"Long story short, I’m a male in my late 20s. I’ve had a tough life growing up. My father was deported to Lebanon when I was a kid and I ended up growing up there. I survived two explosions, terrorist attacks, and I grew up in a poor household.  
In my teens, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and it was difficult for me to make friends. When I went to college, I had a nervous breakdown one day and was kicked out.  
I moved to LA in 2014 and crashed at a relative’s place. We had problems and they kicked me out and I ended up homeless.  
Fast forward 5 years later, things turned around when I got on medication, learned programming, became an engineer, got in shape, etc.  
However, I’ve come to a point in my life where I have no friends or family due to my neurotic and dysfunctional behavior. Every time I meet someone, I’ll eventually fight with them at some point and either end up blocking them or ending up being blocked.  

My resentment and anger towards society and how I’ve been treated growing up and in my early twenties is something I haven’t been able to let go.  
I’ve contemplated going to therapy, but I feel there is nothing a therapist can do to help out. I’ve gone to a therapist before and all they did was listen to me for months with nothing else. I would have been better off buying Alexa and talking to her.  

Also, I’ve taken an oath to take some secrets to the grave. There are things that happened to me in my life that I’d rather die than tell anyone. It’s something off the table and non-negotiable.  I’ve been told unless you open up to therapist, it’s pointless.  

What are my options here? Should I find a therapist anyway? Should I reach out to family? I feel like I’m grasping on straws and that no one will be able to related to what I’ve been through in my life."

1774,I don't know what happened to me,"Hey, I am a 20 year old female and I have anxiety, depression, and have the rare dissociative moments. I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed. Posting on a phone.

So last night I felt myself start to slowly panic. But this panic isn't like a racing heart and crying and freaking out that's in a physical sense. Its scary. I basically get panicked and my body starts to shut down, my arms get heavy (I feel like I can't move them) and my heartbeat is all I can feel and hear. Mentally I can't concentrate and I have tunnel vision, time is just not a concept anymore. My arms feel shaky but won't shake but if I stand my legs give out. I try to frantically find music to help me in this situation (or I try to trigger a panic attack but it rarely works) and when I do find music I just sort of spiral and I'm just sitting there unable to do anything or move or help myself as I just am panicking internally hearing my heartbeat. I try to focus on other things but it's impossible to ignore your own heartbeat in your chest. 

It's like being trapped in a body you can't control. You're freaking out and you're just sitting there like your brain and body disconnected. From an outsiders view I'd just be sitting watching YouTube while internally I'm just freaking out. I was stuck like this for 4 hours until I remembered some sleeping pills I had designed to relax you which I took. When I'm in this state sugar helps me bounce back again so I can move and think but it only helps for a couple minutes until I'm back in the same position even if I use the time to get up and try to feel better.

In the past it's gotten so bad I would describe it like my body died but I was still inside. It's just this horrible feeling and you just can't stop focusing on your heart or that feeling in your limbs or anything. And I have no idea what it is, no way to really say ""I'm having *insert name for thing happening* so I can get help. It's horrible to be like this and I haven't had this happen for what feels like a year now so I'm scared this will become more common again like it was a year and a half ago. 

I've tried looking it up but I can't find anything that fits how I feel. So my question is, what is happening to me? How can I prevent this? It doesn't seem like a typical panic attack or anything and it just comes out of nowhere. I'm scared to have it happen again or that it will happen while I'm at work.

Also if I did anything wrong like violate rules or templateing or something then I'm sorry in advance. I just want help"
1775,My sister’s boyfriend is bipolar,"Hi, I’m in a bit of distress right now. My sister has been dating someone for 6 months who is bipolar. He hasn’t been on medication for some time (we don’t know how long) and has experienced some episodes while with her and when talking to us. His job situation while dating has been very rocky and financially he is not doing well. He’s pretty much almost homeless. My sister has gotten herself into credit card debt trying to support him and he recently had an episode when my family said they will not house him unless he is on medication, seeking counsel, etc. 

I’m not sure how to handle all of this. Should I be contacting an institution? I know those kinds of things have all kinds of negative connotations. Apparently an ex-girlfriend of his called him into an institution before and he did not like the experience. He says that his family isn’t willing to take him in. Unfortunately, he’s also put himself at an impasse with my family who was willing to help support him initially, but with everything going on now it’s too much for them to handle.

It makes me really sad because of everything going on. But he’s almost at the point of bringing his things into our house and refusing to leave, which I know is not right at all.

If anyone can offer advice, that would be very much appreciated..."

I have a quick question about something that's been bugging me for awhile now. Most nights when I am in bed trying to sleep, I'll hear random noises or word / sentence fragments in my mind, about 80% of the time they will be spoken by someone I know. I never know what they're saying, usually its just a noise or a part of a word, but it's definitely not me that is thinking it. I've also had a couple experiences where there will be a scenario in my mind about something violent, and then immediately after I'll feel an extremey abrupt and scary sensation in my brain and see some kind of circle in my vision. But the circle isn't actually there, in the room, only in my mind's eye.

These have been happening for a months and their frequency increases and decreases with time. It's more frusturating and unnerving than anything else, but lots of the time I will also see things (small, like movement) in my field of vision whenever I have these thoughts.

Before anyone assumes anything, I'm not in some ""state between dreaming and wakeness"". I'm always 100% awake when these things happen, just in bed and laying down.

Anyone have similar experiences? And if anyone knows what these are / mean, could you let me know?"

I wish I loved myself more and respected myself more to the point where I could forget and ignore the people that have hurt me in the past and focus on the people who love me in the present.

I could really use some help right now on positive thinking and why loving yourself is important. Because right now I’m finding myself picking out every single fly have been thinking of everyone who doesn’t like me. And I hate falling down that rabbit hole of questioning why things happen to me and blaming myself when in reality some things are just inevitable."
1792,I feel so anxious about this place,"My parents moved about 1-2 years ago, and i was fine then. But now i hate it here, the neighborhood is so awfully quiet and empty it’s like I could get attacked any time, same as when I go to the kitchen, it feels like someone is there. Why am I feeling this way? I would get startled by the silence and sudden noises, and it would feel like someone is there. It’s making me so anxious thinking the house is haunted and that’s why I stay in my room so much, even though I’ve been isolating myself in there before I got the feeling 

Just earlier I heard my mom calling my name 3 times but she was at work. And i went to the kitchen to eat and there was the feeling again, my dad even scared me saying I got paranoid over nothing after telling him this."
1793,I‘m lost,"I don‘t know what to do anymore. Everyday i‘m just sad, nothing is fun anymore everything is exhausting and hurts. I have a feeling that my bf doesn‘t love me anymore, at least it feels like it lately. He suffers from depression and bpd which he is trying to deal with but while doing that he completely forgot about me.
I just feel lost and alone and unwanted. I don‘t want to lose him bc i love him a lot but on the ither hand this relationship doesn‘t make me happy anymore. I‘m just scared that i‘m never gonna see or text with him again. The thought alone is making my chest hurt.
But i also feel so drained. I try to take care of myself and most of the time i feel alright, i‘ve never felt good about myself so yeah but with him i felt good and everything felt right for the first time in my life and now everything is just in pieces and i don‘t know what to do. Noone understands me or can help me. I feel like i‘m just an empty shell..."
1794,Came to the conclusion.,"I came to the conclusion that i need therapy again. I did therapy as a teen but never really had one i felt i could talk to so i left things out but now as im older i need to address these things in order to be a better adult. Looking at my childhood i went through alot death of grandparents, grandparent with illness, parents separation , moving to a new state, Witnessing my mother get attacked by her sibling, being sexually harassed for 5 1/2 years straight at school starting in 5th grade. All while dealing with my own chronic illness. Im honestly amazed that i haven’t full gone mad."
1795,How do I stop feeling empty?,"As the title says, how do I stop feeling empty? The best way I can describe it is like there is a void in my chest. It feels like some core component of myself is missing and I would like to know how to solve it.

For some background, I just got out of a short term relationship. However, we do have some history and I am extremely infatuated with this person. I do believe that my infatuation may be one of the causes of my feelings of emptiness, but I don't know how to stop this feeling. 

I've been told by many people that I need to focus on myself and get a hobby. The thing is, I have a shit ton of them. I love video games, anime, art, movies, books, etc... I also go on walks in the forest every other day for about 2 hours. The point is, I do all these things that I enjoy for myself and yet I still feel like a shell of a human. How do I stop feeling this way?"
1796,How do you move on from someone passing in a healthy way?,"My older brother passed Saturday morning really unexpectedly and my whole family has kinda shutdown and stayed by themselves the only one openly crying about it is my mom I don’t know how to comfort her, and I’m really worried about my other siblings I know they must be hurting to but I don’t want to force them to talk about it if they don’t want to. I keep thinking he’s gonna come walking through the door and be fine and that it was all just a stupid joke or a dream or something but that’s not happening. I feel so lost right now it just doesn’t make sense I miss him so much"
1797,What am I supposed to do?,"15 M

For the last four years, my days continously have gotten worse and worse. Not them being bad days, just my good days are when I have a reason to get out of bed.
Of course there are exceptions every couple of months.

Those last four years, I've been very tired, and just bored of pretty much everything. I'm almost 100% sure that I have depression. Me and my aunt had a very short conversation that she dismissed right afterward. 

I dont know what feeling happy is like, you may hear this from people far worse off than I am. But I have times where I just get excited, like my heart rate increases but I don't ever feel good.

Self harm. No, but I've tried it, but I was too scared to push the knife hard enough into my skin, not worried about my health but about me getting yelled at by my parents.

Suicidal thoughts? Pretty regular, every 1-2 days. But I care too much about the select few people that I do care about, to actually go through with it

Home Life? I have probably the ideal home life, and hearing about others difficulties, makes me both angry and sad at the same time.

for as long as I can remember I have a hatred towards people just in general. Especially the ""nice"" people,  I don't believe true sympathy exists. If somebody is nice they have a reason for it. I can not convince myself otherwise. That's probably the main reason I havent told my parents yet, 
I dont want their sympathy. I dont believe it."
1798,Mad at myself for hobbies/wanting to be alone,"I’m mad at myself for wanting to be alone/my hobbies

TLDR: I am rough on myself for my own hobbies of playing video games and working at my desk, and I don’t much like hanging out w people.

 work from home bcuz of covid, I work 8 hours a day starting at 10:30am, so I normally sleep until then. I wake up and work until 7, then almost every night i’ll either go to my gfs house or just stay home and play video games all night. I don’t know if this is necessarily bad, I know I shouldn’t play video games so much just to keep myself active. But I do go to the gym every other night for an hour, i’ve been working on gaining weight, and i feel more awake and up. 

But with this I’ve also started to dislike myself for how much and I sit at a desk every day. I mean if my gf has plans, I’ll usually work for 8 hours at my desk, workout for an hour and eat (so maybe 2 hours time), and then play video games with friends until 1 or 2 then repeat the cycle. Most of my really close friends are out of state for new jobs, and my other group of friends are all gamers so we rlly just hangout online (other than weekends we go out).

I also have the mindset of not wanting to hangout with people generally speaking. I prefer to be alone as I don’t trust a whole lot of people and It’s just generally hard to find “good people”. I’m also kinda quiet when I am with people bcuz I don’t do a lot so I don’t have much to have conversation about. 

Not sure if I just need to pick up more hobbies and stay more active so that I maybe would want to hangout w people more? idk I moist sick of hating myself no natter what i do. If I stay home I have fun playing games w my friends but I also kinda hate myself for just sitting at my desk all day."
1799,Self-sabotage I think?,"So, this is the first time I openly (behind a nickname) speak about this. When I was studying my undergraduate degree I wasn't the best or the worst student, just average and while going there I fell in love with someone. We made a lot of plans for the future but I had to retake a few courses and at a point we declared ourselves madly in love with each other, we had a lot of chemistry together, but he always resented me for losing time and having to retake those courses. Anyway,  to make a long story short, our plan was always to go live/study/work abroad. He got a scholarship and left, I went to visit and we made plans of me finishing everything back home, graduating and leaving the country and reuniting for us to be together and live our best life. A week after visiting and making some more concrete plans, he broke up with me, just because he couldn't handle a LDR. That was devastating for me because not only I had lost my love but I had lost my plans and I had no ""Plan B"". I let 2 or 3 years go by, and I focused on building a career home and I did at some extent create a succesful career, pioneering in certain new areas, but now I have the drive again to start looking for opportunities abroad, I tried to get a scholarship into a prestigious university abroad, for which I obviously didn't succeed with my average grades. So now, I'm scared about applying for any degree anywhere because I feel like I'm not good enough for anything related to studies and that's in a good part due to having some scars from that relationship that still burn from time to time. Guess what was the first time he did when breaking up? Marry a PhD, or Post-Doc or whatever. 

I'm just so tired of self sabotaging and feeling anxious about being not good enough for anything and not being able to go abroad to study or work which was my dream too.  I have lost so much life thinking about that and I don't know what to do to stop feeling like that."
1800,Quarantine has made me lowkey agoraphobic,"I'm a new college freshman and a few weeks ago I developed some very mild covid like symptoms and got quarantined by my university. I was just moved back into my dorm on Friday and its now the 2nd full day of my freedom.

 But I don't feel free. I've stayed in my dorm the last few days hesitant to leave. Today I went to the dining hall to get brunch and dinner and those excursions alone had me anxious. I can't pinpoint why I'm anxious exactly. It could be because its a long weekend and there's not many people here but when I leave my room I feel like I'm being stared at and judged and so I get really spacey, like my body keeps doing things and I'm pulled back just thinking and watching it go. Its a little scary and I dont think its a safe thing to have happening on a college campus whenever I leave my room. 

This only started when I came back and I assume once classes start on Tuesday I'll be ok but I definitely understand people with agoraphobia more now. I dont think I have it but even experiencing a baby version of it is awful. To anyone suffering out there Im sorry and I believe in you.

1801,I am little scared of myself.,"Sorry if the title is too aingsty. But I keep bothering my friend ever night when I feel shitty. She asked me to reach out to her when it's really hard, but I haven't for a few days and do want to ruin it. I feel bad. I don't want to be suicidal. I mean no one does. But I just can't help these intrusive thoughts anymore. Any tips?"

1803,Does anyone else feel numb about what’s happening in the world? Is that normal?,"I’ve noticed that I’ve been a bit numb to what’s going on in the world. I know what’s happening, but I don’t really care. I’m not saying these things don’t matter to me. Whenever I think about them for more than 10 minutes or so, especially when I’m alone, I start tearing up. So I just stop caring, but not really. I don’t if what I’m saying makes sense, but is it normal?"
1804,Less enthusiastic than I would like,"1. I’m not suicidal. 
2. I’m very upset though. 
3. The one person I could rely on to always answer the phone has gotten toxic.
4. I need people who want to be my friend, get to know me, and let me get to know them. 
5. I’m tired of non-memorable conversations that take place through text. 
6. Unless you have a legitimate reason you can’t voice chat plz don’t respond unless you want to voice chat eventually. 

I’m looking for friends (30f me) who are not likely to get me into any kind of trouble. I want people that will contact me first sometimes and that want a real connection, I’m asexual, I’m not looking specifically for a relationship but if it is mutually unavoidable I guess it’s fine. 

I want to play video games while we are on the phone or voice chat (you don’t have to give me your number). 

I’m bossy and can sometimes cross peoples boundaries. Please do not get upset with me when this happens I have aspergers. 

I’m not looking for people to force opinions on me like: weed is better than medication, or intrusive questions like: why are you always at the mental hospital. 

Please only contact me if you are under the age of 45 and over the age of 17.  I have to talk about adult issues, and I’m not a boomer or gen x so I probably will have a hard time explaining myself to you if you are too old. 

Please don’t commit suicide on me. I need friends that don’t want to die. 

If you are bipolar (so am i) please try to keep in mind stability issues in your own life so that we don’t get carried away into any outlandish crazy ideas. 

If you are depressed, please try not to be too negative. I’m working on that too. 

If you have schizoaffective or schizophrenia please believe me if I tell you something is not real. (I have schizoaffective)

I have had all of these conditions diagnosed by multiple doctors and most of them agree about my conditions. 

I will do my best to respect you if you have other needs not on this list. 

Hopefully we can be friends."
1805,I binged watched a bunch of gore videos from Hoodsite.com am I mentally stable?,"I am a 20yr old female, and I just finished watching  at least 20+ videos on Hoodsite.com in the middle of the night  of people being murder,dismembered,committing 
Suicide, Fatal car accidents, people setting themselves on fire, etc. and I had little to no reaction at all. Is that okay? Idk if this is normal or am I just curious? I didn’t search it up i seen a video on TikTok of someone blowing their brains out and it linked me to hoodsite and i just started watching other videos from there."

I’m hopeless! How am I supposed to be a functioning adult when I can’t even finish school work properly?

What am I doing wrong?"
1807,Voices in my head,Every once in a while I start hearing my parents screaming at me in my head. It’s things they’ve actually said to me before and it just plays over and over in my head like a recording and I start crying from it. It usually happens whenever my mom gets mad at me. I don’t know what to do about it the voices stop after a couple hours or so. I want to stop hearing the voices can anyone help?
1808,I've recently learned that mental illness isn't the norm.,"TLDR: I've recently discovered 55% of people have never and will never experience a mental health disorder and quite frankly, I'm pissed.  


I have mental heath issues. I grew up in a family with mental health issues. My best childhood friend had mental health issues. Most of my friends throughout high school had struggled with some form of mental health issue. My boyfriend also has mental health issues.   


I was unknowingly under the impression that while not everyone struggles with persistent mental health problems like I, or some of my friends/family do, the large majority of people have experienced some form of depression, anxiety or even a cheeky nervous breakdown from time to time.   


Until, I came across a mental health awareness campaign that said something along the lines of ""Mental health is a huge issue! Around 45% of people will experience some form of mental health problem at least *once*  in their lives!"". So I'm like, ""What do you mean only 45%???"".

  
This stat really stuck in my head, so I tried to find evidence of this magical 55% of people who didn't wake up every morning just trying to cope.  Last night I was chatting with some people from work (all uni students as well) and I asked them how many of them had had a breakdown due to their degrees at some point. *Fully* expecting them to all say ""Ahahaha YUP"" in agreement. Instead, they looked at me like I was crazy and just said ""Well, I mean, I've gotten stressed before but I've never like cried or anything."".  


That's when it hit me that the %55 was all around me. They had been the whole time. I realized that I've been comparing myself to people who don't spend most days dealing with some really dark shit. I realized that I, and many of the amazing people I know, have an utterly debilitating, silent, invisible, misunderstood disability that no one can possibly empathize with unless they've been through it. I've always been so hard on myself. Trying to push myself to be able to function the same, and better as those around me. I've been fighting life with both hands tied behind my back and blindfolded while thinking everyone else had the same handicaps.   


This news isn't comforting to me. Because I also have to live with the knowledge that most people will never see what I'm fighting and will continue to blame me if I'm not always strong enough."
1809,"My (decently drunk I think) brother stood in the kitchen for 5-minutes, arms crossed, then was condescending but I laughed off his remarks.","I’m just really fucking confused. And he was like:

&gt; Oh you caused a problem!

&gt; No I didn’t?

And laughed off his remark.

Then he asked me to clean the fridge, I told him I have 3 items in there, he pouted at me or whatever and seemed upset.

Don’t talk to drunk people."

I just need any suggestions that would help."
1812,"Hey, anyone want to share your good news for me?",It makes me feel happy that some people are doing good even when I have shitty nights like this. So just share something good. Doesn't have to be great. Just a little hope. It can be about yourself or the world.
1813,That wrenching feeling in your gut when your depression is so bad that your breath feels physically heavy,"It’s a really hard feeling to explain in words, but when my depression gets really bad, I have this pit in my stomach and it feels like I could just burst into tears at any given moment, all the time. My lungs feel heavy. I’m just feeling so sad and lonely, dealing with the worst breakup of my life (it was a year ago) and it still haunts me from time to time. I hate the panicky feeling that I’m going to be alone forever because my heart was broken so severely that I don’t feel anything for anyone anymore, even when I try. And lack of support from family and friends.  I’m just so damn lonely, and it seems like nothing is going right. 

I guess I’m just kind of venting but I’m hoping to find people to talk to that might be feeling the same way"

1815,Is therapy once a month okay? Therapy is expensive.,"So it turns out therapy is pretty damn expensive (and since I opted for a HDPD, it’s not covered by my insurance). I’ve called around a handful of places and the highest I heard of was $395/session and the lowest $150. Jesus!

Even with the sliding scale, I make too much for a discount with this place I’m having a consultation with (I picked the $150 place). At least that’s what the person on the phone said when I was asking about cost. 

Realistically there’s no way I can afford $150 every week. Even though I make enough on paper, I still have other things to pay for, to save for, and to pay off (debt). I’m comfortable with $150/month at MOST. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that I either 1) need to keep searching for a therapist that may have more generous sliding scale policy; 2) costs less; 3) once a month appointments.

What is your experience if you did once a month sessions? What would you recommend to do?"
1816,On failure and self-worth when you have nothing to really be proud of,"This is long, TLDR; I have no distinct skills, talents, or passions, don't know where to acquire some, and failure highlights how I don't have skills, talents or passions.

Look, I know that there are \*things\* I have to be proud of. I've made achievements and I've surpassed myself before in my young life. I know that I'm not \*supposed\* to compare myself to others, and that I should remain focused on \*myself\*. But with each time I focus on myself, I'm reminded that I've wasted all of my youth as I head into my thirties. I don't have any talents or skills, I'm not particularly useful or adept at things, and it bothers me to think that I'm heading into my full adulthood as someone who's not particularly useful and will require a lot of help in ways that I cannot return to anyone.

For my entire life I've been a sedentary and lonely guy, except for my late teens but that's not really here nor there. I've had some pretty serious social anxiety that I had to deal with, which prevented me from socializing and participating in sports well into my teens. I had a father who wasn't very patient. His tempter was made worse by his fucked up back that made working with him difficult. I never really connected with him because he would shout when he was angry, and his impatience made me shy away from doing work with him. I played a lot of video games as a kid, which I don't really do so much anymore, and as a result I don't really have these skills I would have learned doing normal kid stuff.

I am not musically talented; I enjoy lots of music and used to play a few instruments as a kid but that never followed through. I am not physically talented; I don't have any cool tricks I can do or sports I can play, as an individual or on a team. I don't know a whole lot about how to fix stuff, build stuff, create stuff, work with stuff, or otherwise provide any sort of goods or services for myself or others. I can cook myself some food, but that feels like a fairly default thing to do to be an independent adult. When I notice all the things that others seem to do, have knowledge of and take enjoyment from, I really can't help but be a little disappointed in myself.

A friend group of mine has begun planning and discussing the creation of a co-operative living space. I took a peek at the survey, and one question stuck out to me: What skills do you possess? What can you do that makes you a good housemate? And I thought, fuck man, not a whole lot. I can try to be a good roomie and be courteous, but there's really nothing I can do to help the processes of a household in a way I could jive with on a daily basis. A dude I was talking to for a long time through some shared kink interests is way beyond my skill level, having already pursued my post-secondary path and went on to an MBA, plays a number of sports, plays several instruments, is into machining and vehicle mechanics, and all around dwarfs me in terms of being a well-rounded adult. This all seems antithetical to living a healthy life, but frankly, \*\*I don't understand how these comparisons aren't real or how I shouldn't be stacking my behind-the-scenes against someone's highlight reel, because my highlight reel also pales in comparison to so many others.\*\*

I want to feel good at things and adept as a grown adult who can handle stuff on his own, pursue hobbies and interests, and contribute. Outside of my career path, I don't really think I contribute a whole lot. And as a student, soon to be busy young professional, I don't honestly know where I'll find the time to develop skills and passions. Everything feels cost prohibitive, and where I live I cannot seem to find some sort of fellowship or workspace that will help me practice things. I also have a terrible fear of failure, because it feels like an underline of the fact that I'm not all that good at anything. I don't know how to handle it well, and I think it holds me back from things.

I might also be neurodivergent; it's tough for me to organize myself into pursuing something new that I haven't really done before and don't really know if I'm making progress on, and feel like I lack a certain degree of executive function (this working from home thing has been incredibly difficult for remaining on task). I need something to schedule a slot of time for me, like a class, and someone to help me figure out what I'm doing, like a teacher, if I want to make progress. However, it feels like this only really exists for private lessons in creative or musical endeavours, and there isn't someone who can help me gain helpful skills relevant to fixing or building things.  

To wrap things up, I feel like shit. I feel like I wasted my youth not understanding I had my whole life ahead of me, and now that I've begun to work on my mental health issues, I don't know where I can surpass my all to real feeling of uselessness. I know a number of things are as easy as taking lessons, but I can barely afford them, and many things aren't so easy. Each failure makes me feel worse about who I am as an adult, and I don't even know where to start that will make me feel OK with myself. I just want to feel like I have an identity that I can be proud of. I want to feel confident in myself and don't know where to start."
1817,Excessive rumination? This should help!,
1818,Understand what is PROCRASTINATION and how to develop a strategy against it ?,"&amp;#x200B;

**Sometimes the most significant obstacle keeping you from achieving your goals is yourself. This is not just your problem. It’s a global problem. In the United States alone, 84% of people are affected by procrastination; 1 in 5 procrastinate every day.** 

**Before we start talking about procrastination, we need to understand what procrastination is and where it comes from.**

WHAT IS BASICALLY PROCRASTINATION?

**It simply means waiting until the last minute to complete a task. Researchers estimate that procrastination can come for many reasons.**

1. **If we grew up in a very authoritative parenting style, like ‘they always try to control you, you have today now’ so we procrastinate as a form of rebellion**.
2. **Fear of failure plays a vital role in your procrastination. You don’t want to fail in your life, and deep down, you believe that you can’t achieve success in this field. For example, You know that you need to work hard to get a job in a company like Google. But you also know there are so many competitions and you are an average student, so it’s not possible for you to go there. So It’s a dream to work for Google. But it’s hard for you.**
3. **Lack of motivation. I saw so many people in my life; they don’t have any goals in their life. That’s why they just put things off, cause they don’t even know if the particular item is important from them or not.** 

In most cases, procrastination is not a sign of a serious problem. It’s a common tendency that most people give in to at some point or another.

TYPES OF PROCRASTINATORS.

1. **Arousal type procrastinators: That is someone who loves that euphoric high and adrenaline rush, they want to become the best in the class, but mostly they do everything at the minute.** 
2. **The people who don’t want to take responsibility: You may have heard that some people say, I don’t know how I should do this if it goes wrong, I don’t know anything, I will not take any responsibilities.** 
3. **The people who don’t want to fail:  They always think, if I dont put any effort in, so there is no chance of failure. But they firmly believe that, if they do the work, then I will give my 100% effort. But unfortunately, they don’t want to do anything.**

OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION. 1. BREAK YOUR GOALS:

One of the most important reasons we procrastinate is that, subconsciously, we find our task overwhelming. To make it less intimidating, break it down into smaller goals, and now focus on one goal at a time. Not only is the resulting amount of work more manageable, but it also doesn’t look as overwhelming. 

When you complete the smaller goal of the task, you will feel a sense of accomplishment. This helps reinforce your determination to tackle the rest.

1819,Has anyone dealt with the complex PTSD caused by emotional neglect as a child? How did you do it?,I am regularly in touch with my parents and I have to take financial support from them during this pandemic which makes this situation more complicated for me. They provide unsolicited advice all the time and I don’t feel emotionally connected with them. I have never felt connected with them.
1820,Chaning my life but how much should I change it? Keeping people out in a healthy way,"I'm a guy in my early 30s. For some reason people tend to really overshare their personal stuff, when they are with me. Needless to say it's not the cute, funny and bright side of their past but rather sickness, mental issues, family issues, relationship issues, death, job issues etc.

I had a bad experience (not of intimate nature) 20 years ago regarding a what I though back then my best friend. We were together since the beginning of kindergarden all the way to my 12th year. When I was 11 this person blackmailed me and that opened up my eyes, revealing to me his (later on as I discovered) narcissistic nature. I cut off my ties with him completely but I also closed myself to the world around me. That was 20 years ago...The first 4-5 years I hated him, then the next 4-5 years I hated myself for hating someone that much. Then I decided to change. Sadly it was not the best way to do it so I just started investing my time in helping others as much as I can.

Fast forward last year, when I got so stressed from work that I quit and left on an almost 8 month bicycle trip with a tent across Europe. All that time (most of it alone) I had a lot of time to self-reflect and decided to make MAJOR changes to my life. I postponed things for half a year this year to wrap up some stuff with some people and now I've started to work on my issues.

You may wonder why I'm telling you this? Well, from my experience with other people, who have been in some sort of a toxic relationship holding things inside you is very damaging in the long run (me being a fine example). In may case I have severe trust issues, which have also manifested into intimacy issues. I have never kissed a girl, never went on a first date and needless to say never had a real intimate relationship.

I'm not a bad looking guy (according to my friends) but I fall into the category of a nice guy. I try to help those around me however possible. Sadly sometimes it leaves me completely emotionally drained.

I met this woman (she is 5 years younger than me) about a month and a half ago. She has been through a lot in her life - alcoholic father (who died from cancer and exhibited child neglect to both her and her two brothers), a brother who was recently diagnosed with psychosis, a series of very bad relationships (including her first one age between 14-15), drinking issues etc. She attended therapy a year ago and discovered a lot about herself and started changing her life including what she works. Now she is trying to become yoga instructor and nutrition adviser for both adults and children, changed her diet starting 10 years ago and now lives a very healthy life.

On our first date she shared a lot about her past with me. Something that I somewhat felt uncomfortable with but decided to also open up on our second date. So now we will be going out on our 5th date and we are taking things slow even though I might be rushing sometimes due to my lack of experience that I haven't told her about. Planning to though...

My point is however the following: I don't want to become her emotion dumpster. The new me made that loud and clear when I told her I don't want to be her therapist and she said she is not expecting that from me. I am currently working on creating barriers to protect myself from what other people share with but I fear I might overdo it. I am very emotional but learned to hide it at a very young age. That thing about my childhood friend is something I kept even from my parents, who love me very much and are very carrying. That is actually the main reason why I didn't tell them the full story - I didn't want to hurt them. I did tell them he blackmailed me and that I no longer want to see him but I didn't tell them about the aftermath and how I just everyone out completely. I made a mistake clearly and only 2 months ago I shared that with them, leaving them devastated and very sad. My mother even told me she was scared of me doing something to myself. Needless to say I am not going to (life is the most precious gift one can ever receive) but I did quit my job (again; it was a really toxic environment for me there) and spent like a month going through my past and issues, crying several times a day.

Now I am better and realise that I am still (yes, in my 30s) very emotionally immature. I thought that emotional intelligence is you being able to control and hide your emotions but it's actually the complete opposite. I am able to completely shut down and play along, exhibiting completely opposite emotions to what I truly feel on the inside. Mostly this would mean me witnessing something that angers or upsets me but pretending to be okay with it and not really carrying that much, while inside it's crushing my heart. One thing I've decided is to no longer to that.

Examples:

A neighbour of mine is getting evicted. She has a drinking problem, is late with her rent all the time and has damaged to properly. The house owners (who also live in the same building) have been on her case for a long time and finally managed to kick her out. Since I've recently moved here I was unaware of all this. However when they both sides started telling me that stuff I just said: ""Sorry, this is not really something I want to involve myself into"". My previous self from 2-3 months ago would have just sat there and listened, and listened, soaking it all in without uttering a word.

That neighbour needs help moving her stuff out and I offered a hand (also in order to prevent too much chaos in the building because she is anything but organised). Her family is grateful for me helping out but also try to dump their emotional garbage on me. Her mother came to me yesterday to ask for my phone number and if I will be available next Sunday. I told her that she can have my email address and that next weekend I will probably be busy. She started whining about the situation and all that. I stood there and told her: ""Look, I've offered my help for moving stuff out but nothing more. Your issues are family issues and no my issues. When you need me to move the stuff out, contact me in advance a couple of days before that. Decide what you want to throw out and what to keep. I will not waste my time standing there, while you are discussing that.""

To be honest it hurt me a little bit for being that straight forward about my feelings and thoughts on the matter but now (a day later) I actually feel pretty good about what I did. I will help them out but the moment they start whining and shouting at each other I will pack my sh@t and leave them deal with all that.

My only fear is to not push people away this way. I'm very new to this behaviour where I actually put some boundaries and I might come too hard on some people. Then again being direct and expressing how you feel about a certain situation/action should not have that effect on others, if they are really worth building a relationship with, right? I even dropped like 15-16 people out of my life so that I can start fresh and not deal with all the drama they had around them. I do like communicating with people but I also don't want to return to my old ways of being an emotional punch bag for someone, who I might have even met for the first time. This includes an intimate relationship with that woman. Due to her past she has a lot of trust issue and she told me about that just like I told her about my trust issues. We decided to take things slow but at the same time I fear I might rush something too much. I wanted for us to go out hiking and what not on our 2nd or 3rd date. She told me she likes the fact that I am thinking about future activities together but that sometimes less is more. My immaturity and lack of experience in this matter are things I feel very insecure about but I will give it a shot. After all it's a learning experience. I am thinking about telling her I have never dated anyone before and will see how she reacts to that. She is younger but has far greater experience than me. I think that if she accepts that, she will be someone I can become really close to (on an intimate level). Needless to say I am scared what would happen if she calls things off. We have only been on 4 dates so far so I don't know what to expect. Then again if she feels uncomfortable about my lack of experience she is not the right one...

This post is quite chaotic but I just got up this morning and decided to share this with you. Since I am still figuring things out I want to tread lightly with how much and fast I reveal about myself to the people around me. Dumping 15-16 people in an instant was pretty tough but a decision I don't regret. Still the people that are left in my life are people, who I truly care about. So I want to share these things with them too but when the time is right. Before that I need to still figure a lot of things about myself. I was even thinking about going to a therapist but then decided to dissect myself and try to do it on my own since I have had a lot of experience analysing and helping others. Never turned these skills towards myself though...Pretty tough...At least I am through with crying all the time and now I feel much better and will even start looking for a job. I do have the money to support myself for 2-3 years without lifting a finger (I'm a software developer) but I would love to teach and do research. One of the reasons I quit my previous job was that I knew I had to spend time on my own dealing with my stuff and combining that with a job would make things impossible.

I just want to learn to be myself and not pretend I am someone else. I want for people to connect with me but create actual connections and not just use me to dump their personal issues."
1821,How do I dissociate on purpose,I used to dissociate all the time but then I stopped cause I wanted to be more healthy but turns out being healthy is meaningless for me and no coping mechanisms work so I want to dissociate more again
1822,I feel so numb. What should I do?,"For the past few months, I’ve just been constantly stressed out, then I resorted to pain to forget about emotion, and now I just feel so fucking numb. I feel like I could watch someone die and feel nothing, or die myself and just not care. I have no motivation for anything, not even to text people back. I just feel nothing right now and I don’t know what to do?"
1823,"Having a hard time pinning down a good medication, but the one I'm on right now is really bothering me...","As far as I know, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and some kind of depression/anxiety. My psych doesn't want to put me on Wellbutrin since that can spike my anxiety (I was also on it for a bit long before I started seeking help- prescribed by a family doctor, but I forgot exactly why). We tried Escitalopram and Lexapro. I feel like I was much less anxious with Lexapro, but it also made it hard for me to process anything- almost mentally catatonic. She stopped them and then started me on mood stabilizers, and the first one, Lamotrigine just didn't do anything for me, and my anxiety spiked through the roof. 

I'm on my third dose of Olanzapine and the past two days have been just trash. I usually sleep in on weekends, but I felt dead waking up at 5 *in the evening* after taking my first dose at 9 the night before, then going to bed maybe close to 11. A similar thing happened last night where again I took a dose at 9 in the evening, went to bed sometime after 11, and then woke up towards 4 in the afternoon. On top of the bad sleep schedule, I feel almost drunk. I wouldn't mind if it was just for the first few minutes after waking up, but it seems like it won't go away. I'm somewhat dizzy, and at times I can't even read correctly, much less focus on something. Some sensitive places, like my lips or fingertips, feel almost numb. I feel generally weak and my head just isn't right, and this is supposed to be a low dose.

I have a bit of a history with sleeping too much and being hard to wake up, so maybe that's just what it is, but I can't really tell what I should be doing at this point. I mean, I guess I should go ahead and call up my psych and let her know this med might just be bad for me, but maybe I have to ride out the initial effects. I'm kinda worried because I'm supposed to be going to school and I'm scared to even try when I'm feeling like this. I have a 30 minute drive to the school, and I have to leave an hour early to make it to class. If I can't wake up, I guess I just miss class. If I feel dizzy, I might not be good to drive. Even if I make it to class, what if I just can't process what's being taught?

So, should I just take the hit and try to get through at least this week with the medicine? I guess it's kinda common sense telling me to tell my psych, but she can be hard to get a hold of with how busy her days are, and if the side effects go away, maybe this could be the medicine."
1824,Can you trigger someone else’s OCD by showing your compulsions around them?,"I’ve developed OCD away at school for the last year and since I’ve been home my family has begun to notice.

My dad apparently had some symptoms way back like 40 years ago, but he says he overcame them and hasn’t really had any since.

But I’m afraid that he might watch me while I’m living at home and see my compulsions and rituals and stress and get triggered, and fall back into OCD.

Is this possible? Or does OCD only come from the inside personally?"
1825,Just do not see the point.,"It seems no matter what. Ever since my mother passed away in January, everything has always been busy. I still havent gotten over the loss of her. Even though I have made progress.. I am living with the people who took us in 7 years ago when she went to the hospital and lost her leg due to doctors fucking her over and giving her medicine she was allergic to that was in her records. She got 40-50 blood clots from it in her right leg. Then she slowly got addicted to opioids. I didnt notice.. I just knew she was ""in pain"" it was the doctors fault. She was taking over 200% of the regulated amount for Oxycontin and Oxycodone. Cause of death was OD. She was fucked over her whole life and it pisses me off. She deserved so much better. I saw her change.. From her happy normal self, to how she was on drugs.. She was still loving though. Always caring.. Anyway.. After her passing.  I began working. Got her car repaired that she accidentally wrecked when on the pain meds. It took $2015 to fix it. She wanted to see it fixed so bad.. She missed the car. That was her only freedom and I took care of her. Did what she needed. She said I was her rock, her help. That she wouldnt know what to do without me.  Well. I got it insured and licensed, $350. I just turned 20 and I just got a better job. From working for less than $10/hr for way too much responsibility. I will be working at this new place for 10.50 an hour and will get a raise when fully trained.  I still feel like its hopeless.. Im always stressed and super tired. Past two days I worked 9am-9pm and I will do it tomorrow and the day after. Got to be professional.. 2 weeks you know? I just dont know if I can handle it. I feel like life isnt worth it. I keep getting these thoughts I dont want of suicide or self harm. Only reason I havent done it know is probably because of my sister.. I dont want her to lose her brother she loves.. I try to spend time with her and make her happy. She is only 11. I don't want to break her heart.. The thought of someone having to tell her that her brother is dead.. It hurts. I just feel like Im in a pit. I cant seem to be happy and most my childhood friends dont even talk to me anymore."
1826,Anxiety Runs my life,"I’m really depressed I don’t have any friends in my new town and it feels like I lack the social skills to build any kind of relationship. Anxiety controls me it feels like an invisible force stoping me from doing anything social. I smoke weed but I’m pretty sure that just makes my anxiety worse but at the same time it’s my only escape. I just want it to stop, walking around or getting food shouldn’t be stressful I’m so tired."
1827,TW: Self Harm... Is it normal that I want to start cutting again for really no apparent reason?,"I have cut before but not very much/often. I've started going to therapy due to a breakdown I had a little while ago where police got involved, and I've only gone like 3ish times so far. I haven't cut for a while but mostly it's because I don't want to have to talk about it with my therapist. I keep getting the urge to start again but when I get those feelings, I'm not usually super sad or angry or anything really I just want to do it. There has been a lot of things going on such as my grandpa recently passing, my parents currently going through a nasty divorce, and we just had to move to a different state right before I started my sophomore year of high school. Maybe all that's going on is making me want to cut, but idk. Is it normal to just want to?"
1828,Need to know whats wrong with me?,"I am 19.From six months I have not been myself.I used to have confidence.I used to have a goal in life.I used to exercise.I have been anxious my whole life.But now it has gone up to a different level.It has become crippling.I have zero self esteem.I always feel guilty over everything I say ,everything I do.People I have known my whole life feel like strangers to me.I cant open up to them about my emotions.Talking to someone is very hard.I cant remeber things.I used to read a lot now i cant even read a page without my mind wandering around.Constantly beat myself up because I havent been productive nowadays.Not being able to do something without nervousness.Answering calls are a pain in the ass even from known ones.I feel like i am a waste of space.I keep getting caught up in a negative spiral of thoughts and feel like shit for hours even days.Somedays its hard for me to eat and sleep.Some days I sleep 16 hours a day still wake up feeling like an alien and cant get out of bed.On bad days I feel like ending it all and imagine ways to commit suicide and think of it again and again.Now i cant remeber the days when I was normal.This has become the new normal for me and It has been very hard.I have very hard time processing emotions.I get angry easily yell at someone and then feel bad for many days.If someone says wrong to me I feel like cutting them off forever and dont talk to them.But the anger is not always expressed.Most of the time i keep it in.But in between all those chaos there is day or half a day where i feel its all ended.But the other day it comes back.
 I dont know what this is.Is it an illness or am i just exaggerating and doing this myself.I am very confused and fed up of life.I wanted to go to the doctor but i dont know how to express what i feel.Yeah i know you guys are not doctors but if i had any idea it would be easy to open up about."
1829,Im not really sure what happened to me last night.,"Last night I was texting my boyfriend and we had a misunderstanding and then I suddenly am not familiar with the letters I see on my keyboard until I can't construct any sentences anymore. I felt a bit dizzy too and a bit just a bit blurry eyesight. It only happened to me twice, the first one is way back 2 yrs ago when I was texting too and I suddenly dont know the letters, It's like I just suddenly forgot about it. I tried to read something and sing some of my favorite song to test myself because I thought Im just making this up, but I was reading like a 1st grader. I read so slow like sooo slow and I cant even pronounce some words I usually know and then when I tried to sing it's either I'll say some gibberish words at some part or seriously can't remember the lyrics which is unusual esp since I know my favorite song so much or sometimes I forgot what Im singing even tho I was singing it just a seconds ago. I felt lost and I was just crying last night. It was so scary. I know I shoulve been consulting this to a professional  but due to covid I cant really go out plus its scary to go to hospitals nowadays. I think I was just maybe tired? But I doubt since I haven't really done heavy works yesterday. Does anyone also experienced this? Please help"
1830,Difficulty embracing doing nothing,"A little shout me - Im 29M, full time employed remote working a design job that I enjoy, and also have freelance on the side, my income is great. I’m pretty on top of my workouts MWF, and i’m also lucky in that I have a few (although distance) solid bro’s for me in my friend circle.

That said, I just moved into my own place - which i’m very much so enjoying, however it’s because a nearly 3 year relationship just ended. It was the most healthy and peaceful split I had, and it was a mutual thing - we both grew with each other and helped each other grow but we could both feel a pull to still want to grow independently and go back to our individual journeys. 

We split a few weeks ago and I moved into the new place last week. I’m typically someone who gets consumed in work, as I enjoy it and the older i’ve gotten the better I am at making money and figuring out how to sell my design services.

I’ve intentionally aimed to kick off this transition with less work focus and more just hanging out with myself and me time, I even renewed my classic world of warcraft subscription just to have an outlet to do nothing while also doing something.

The thing is though i’m still having a difficulty just being with myself and being mentally okay with the idea of doing nothing. It’s like I want to focus on something and simultaneously I can’t because all of this me time is so new I sort of don’t know how to deal with it. I suppose time helps all things but I sort of feel lost in my own head a little bit as of late.

I just wanted to write this out for myself in an effort that someone might have a suggestion or insight. 

Thanks"
1831,How do I set goals for myself that I can actually achieve?,"I want to set goals for myself (weekly, monthly, yearly, long term) but I don’t know how to make ones that are actually going to be achievable for myself. Any tips on how I can start?"
1832,I think i have a syndrome(?),"Soo, i think i get emotionally attached to famous person. I have that feeling since i was in junior high school. I always imagine a life with the famous person that i like at that time like every night before bed or just when i don't have anything to do, or simply when i'm washing dishes and don't know what to think about. It still happens now, i'm 21 years old btw. I thought it was just a crush. But everytime they have a lover, i kinda feel sad and i became to hate the famous person that i like also their lover. It's not like i commented on their social media or throw hate on them. It's just me don't like them anymore.
It's not only to one person, because sometimes i feel bored too when they don't have interest thing to share to the fans or i became bored on imagining them with a lot of scenarios of our future life. Sometimes it's because they do something that i don't like. But again, i don't throw hate on them. Just simply going away from them.
I don't stalk them, or giving them any presents. Maybe it's because i live far away from them, i don't know if they live near me, i will be a stalker or not. But maybe not. I know that it's a bad thing to do and it will make them uncomfortable.
One of the things that weird is i don't want to meet them in real life. I feel like i will be sad because i know that i am just a fan and i became to realize that we would not have a life like what i imagined. I don't wanna go to their concert, because i'm jealous that a lot of people love them too and they are better than me. (Okay that's crazy, lol) but i really feel that.
Soo, the reason why i decided to say this things is because a week ago, i have a crush on a thai actor. He is a rising actor, currently playing a series. He is famous in my country too. But i thought that no one in my circle would know him. So i was loving (yes, love) him for 2 or 3 days (a week ago). You know when the love just rising and you just crazily in love with them. But then, i saw my friend's ig story that showed the thai actor face and she said that this guy is handsome and she likes him. I suddenly cried then. I feel soooooo sad, and the bad thing is i started to feel like i don't wanna talk to her anymore. And of course i don't wanna see the thai man anymore. Even now, i feel soooo sad. I always think that i need to look for someone new to replace him and forget about those feelings so i will talk to my friend again. I mean i would if i need to, but i will avoid her talking about the thai man.
That's my story, i'm sorry my english is not that good. But yeah i need you to tell me if it's actually a syndrome or not. Thank you for reading ❤"

1834,Feel like I am getting cabin fever. (20 F) at point of going mia and going on a trip to the forest.,"Today just feels like my tipping point. I have been inside all day. 

I have been quarantine since march. No parties, no traveling, etc. just seeing my parents every 1-2 weeks and going to target. I tried exercising every day for three to lose some weight. But during that time I was obsessed with losing weight and became depressed about it. I was abusing laxative’s every other day. Not eating. Binge eating. Starved myself of carbs 

I tried to purchase stuff to create a hobby, like a bike or something. But due to pandemic unemployment cant really afford much but my rent. 

I have tried to ask my boyfriend if we can go to sedona, az just to go on a hike to a waterfall where we would have little to none human contact just us. 
But he is too paranoid for that. 

I just feel stuck. Im depressed. Avoid looking at mirrors. Im moody. I get mad at every minor thing my boyfriend does or says. My mother as well. 

Im at the point to get a way from this. I want to go on a hike to sedona and hang at a creek. Maybe sleep in the car overnight and go back to the creek and chill. Then go home. 

I just need to get out, be by myself away from my apartment, my boyfriend, family, my phone!!!

I talk myself out of going out in public. I literally have trouble going to the gas station or dollar general to get something if I'm alone. I have battle getting close to addiction and I think I'm getting closer to losing. I recently had multiple panic attacks at work. I want to scream for help but just my self that there isnt anything wrong. What really notice was when my friend asked why I was not texting or gaming with anyone. I told him I was fine and he told me that he cared and to not hurt myself. I broke and I couldn't control it I just cried. My life has been just escape after escape and I think my thoughts are catching up. If listen to my rant thank you that's all I need. It was hard to even write this."

If I can't find a therapist, is it helpful to get a prescription for a medication? 

I haven't asked, but it sounds like it'd be easier for me to meet with a doctor who could prescribe me something then it will be to actually find a therapist to help me at the moment.

I'm afraid if I get on medication there won't be appropriate support to monitor how it affects me."
1840,I'm quitting another job.,"  I just recently got a job in fast food, at one of the best if not the best company you can work for. It doesn't matter. I don't have the ¿common sense?/focus/instinct to keep up and I can physically feel my coworker's annoyance. I'm not giving a 2 weeks because I've worked myself up so much that I could not walk back in there if I tried. I've been called lazy my entire life and told I have no work ethic even by my family and I honestly agree now. I think think it's mental health related but if you aren't a good worker in the US you have no value and people look down on you. 

  I'm on the max dose of Wellbutrin XL which has helped my depression tremendously but my short-term memory, executive function, and dissociation have been absolutely terrible. I only ""think"" for like an hour a day. It comes across as me being dumb but I know I'm intelligent. I'm just losing it because my brain doesn't allow me any form of stimulation other than consuming media.

I'm a 16 M, and for a while I've known that I've had an inflation fetish. It started off ""normal"" enough, but the past few months I have noticed that it had begun to turn more and more violent. This slow buildup has culminated into me making this post. Right here. Right now. I have realized that for the past week I've climaxed solely to art and fictional stories which all depict bursting, and subsequently death. I think I need help. I'm terrified. I don't want it to turn into something even more violent, or worse, try to inflict my fetish into myself or someone else. 

Should I be worried? Is this normal? God, I hope it isn't."
1843,is something wrong with me?,"i (13f) get really uncomfortable and angry VERY easily. i have a lot of trauma, so that’s what my mom blames it on. i don’t know what it is. 

my little brother (6) thinks it’s so fucking funny to make me so incredibly angry that i burst into fits of pure rage, then cry and pull my hair out, and scream, and then sleep. he’s made me just like my father. and i’m disgusted with myself. 

i get very uncomfortable when people get on my bed without my permission. which my brother loves to do. so basically i got mad and yelled at him, and now i feel so horrible. 

my parents think i’m cold and i don’t love him or want to spend time with him. i love him with all my heart, but he’s such an asshole. i also get weird when people use my computer, go in my room or even just sit at my desk without my permission. and even when they do have my permission, i’m watching like a hawk. it’s my stuff. 

so now i feel like i’m living in a flawed perception of reality because so many people treat me badly and i’ve confronted them about it, but what if it’s not them, it’s me? every single man mistreats me. what if it’s my fault? what if they’re not even mistreating me, but i’m just insane? i feel so distanced from reality, and i almost feel like i want to die. which is so terrifying to type, because i’ve been horrified of death all my life and i still am. but i’m scared these feelings will take over and i’ll lose the battle with my mind and i won’t get to follow my dreams. 

basically my question is is this normal? i don’t feel normal. at all. i don’t wanna be like those stupid people that are like “oh i bounce my leg i must have anxiety :D” or whatever, but i just don’t feel right. this can’t possibly be normal, otherwise life would be a living hell. i hope it’s not."
1844,I don't want to have to be strong anymore,"I'm so tired. I'm not sure if my mental health has ever been this bad. I can't motivate myself to get out of bed most days, but since I live in an apartment and have to pay rent, I have to keep working.

The past week has just felt like a giant depression void. I can't do anything, I can't focus on anything, I can barely even sleep. I keep a box of Cheerios next to my bed so that I can eat a handful before I take my meds.

I can see it in my face, too. I look horrible. I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation, depression, or a combination of both. I'm only 21 but I feel like I look much older.

I guess the good news is that I finally started getting help a few months ago after struggling with depression for over 10 years. In doing so, I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ocd, and anxiety, which explains a lot of the struggles I've had to go through. 

I'm in therapy and I just started medication. The meds haven't kicked in yet and I can't tell if therapy is helping or not. I just hope something changes soon because I feel like I'm at the end of my rope."
1845,New fiction book written during a psychotic episode with themes of mental health,"  

Hello! 

I’m a young health professional who has just been through his first psychotic/manic episode, during which I wrote my first fiction book! It has what I like to think is a super unique plot loosely based on my mental health saga. 

It’s an action-packed adventure/psychological thriller/sci-fi.

The best part is that it’s available for just one dollar! 

Here’s the synopsis: 

On a tiny planet in a distant galaxy, warfare has evolved to the point that the mind has become a literal battlefield. As power-hungry warriors leap through eyes and seize thrones at the back of brains they create slaves and build armies. Sixteen year old Kahu is thrust from his peaceful external life into a chaotic internal world when his tribe is destroyed by Centre-Point, leaving him as the lone survivor.

  
 Although his family are dead; they live on within his head. Armed with four defenders internally, Kahu meets a powerful beast who gives him an ultimatum, forcing him to unite the remaining tribes and lead a siege upon Centre-Point or risk extinction of his new tribe. As he meets other leaders Kahu discovers the truth, while growing more powerful with every fight.

1847,"I don't know if my friends are even my friends, manipulating me, or what? I'm not even sure if it's all in my head.","Earlier today I was spending some with my friends (normal) in my school breaks. So during my first break I went to my friends and for a bit we were just talking about stuff, and then all of a sudden they started making fun of me for always being so *close* to them, being *right up against them*, having my shoes *touch* theirs, not leaning up against the wall like them and instead standing in the open by doing things like standing in a circle against each other (during covid). Then the bell rang.

After the bell rang once more for lunch I went back and my friends decided to play a game (we play it because for some reason people still like playing it), so one of my friends said I should be in, then someone mentioned someone else not being in ""for ever"", that person then complains about it and says it should be me, I and another say we both could be since we are both pretty bad, then they decide on counting to 21. It of course lands on me being in, then one of them tells me to count for 90 seconds which I complain about because nobody else counts for 90 seconds, however it's just dismissed. Afterwards I count for a minute because that is the usual, so I start to chase after them then when I catch up, one of them complains about me not counting for a minute, the other says I was supposed to count for 90 seconds, consequently I decide to do something better with my time.

After all of that I notice they keep coming to the area around my classroom but I'm not sure if it's they want to apologize, poke more fun at more, or anything else? As a result I ran from the area until the bell rang for the penultimate time that day.

Now, before that, about a year ago, I was in a different friend group, they'd always criticize me for being bad at sports (e.g. ""You're so fucking lazy and bad, you don't listen at all and can't even fucking get a goal without help."" because tbh I'm trash at sports) and say I'm a freak at times. Saying things like I attempted suicide for attention (when I was in a year group with like 50 people, gonna be famous cool kid now am I right?) and making suicide jokes themselves and putting their hands around my neck (not full on strangling but if tighter and with more pressure could be considered it) in front of everyone (in the friend group).

The thing is I also somewhat liked those people and like the current friend group as well because we somewhat got on well, chatted a lot, talked about stuff with them, and when I'd play games with them like football (the game I mention earlier with the new friend group) they would help me even though it's cheating and giving me an unfair advantage. Yet whenever I talk about me and my stuff nobody shows interest, ignoring it in the process and does not care unless it's making them feel better about themselves.

I get worked up over things such as people criticizing (not constructive) my stuff, making a joke about me, being ignored, saying I should do other things with my times, etc. The worst part is that I don't even know if I'm telling you (the reader) the right information or my mind warped it (I have not been diagnosed with anything and NZ mental health care is really bad).

1854,Tactile hallucination experience of getting shot,"Hello. I suffer from psychotic depression which causes ideas of reference for me (I hear or read very provocative and timely things over the radio or on facebook when i'm irritated with the people that were seemingly psychic towards me), delusions or illusions, thoughts that are hell sent and psychologically torment me in ways beyond my intelligence, sometimes mild tactile hallucinations, and obviously a deep dark and heavy depression. it's a tactile hallucination though i'd like to talk about. a pretty scary one. 
One night when I was laying in bed, on the verge of sleep I believe, and I could feel some stiff, long, metal thing struggling to enter my mouth as I was fighting this feeling. Once it really got in there, I felt this intense ""blast"" throughout my whole head followed by this wind. the occurence jolted me awake and I wondered what the hell had just happened and I had this sudden realization that it was a shotgun barrel that I had ""felt."" 
I thought this was pretty unique, as all of my experiences. was wondering what people's perspectives would be on this, or what people have to say, so I appreciate anything said."

I have been super anxious because of the unclarity of everything that is going on in the world right now and then I started talking to a girl so that was extra anxiety because of bad past experiences and major trust issues and I have started to act differently. For example, I ghosted this girl because I couldn’t deal with the extra anxiety and the pressure and I decided I didn’t like her or my best friend was called hot by some girls and I started feeling jealousy and dislike for him which is super abnormal because I am not the person to be jealous and am usually happy for others. Then, earlier today I started having this immense hate for this streamer/YouTuber because they are only a year older than me when I only have 26 subscribers and I have worked longer than him. I don’t know what is happening but I am feeling extreme jealousy and hate for others at the moment and I think it is connected to my anxiety but I don’t know if it is just because I am a bad person but I don’t know.

1863,Mindful Monday!,"Good morning friends!  


What are 2 things you plan to do this week to practice mindfulness?   


Mindfulness means to become the empowered viewer, rather than the helpless participant, in your life. To observe, without judgment, your thoughts and feelings. To be able to take a step back and enjoy an experience, without feeling the need to move to the next experience."
1864,Am I just being a child?,"Hi, I'm a 28 year old woman and I feel like I have the coping ability of a child.
I've spoken to so many people in my life who say that they dont remember the last time they cried. In general, it seems like the vast majority of people go through most of their lives feeling really terrible once in a while, and maybe just getting sad from time to time but they just get over it.

This genuinely blows my mind. On a weekly basis at least (and usually almost daily) something sends me spiraling. Crying (and I don't mean a tear or two, but actual balling), shortness of breath, etc etc. I struggle with anxiety but that doesn't feel like a panic attack, just this deep sadness that hurts in my chest and stomach and doesn't let me breathe. 
This can be caused by anything, really. Working with a person who is being a bit of a jerk, getting into an argument with my boyfriend, getting a rude comment etc.

I feel like everyone around me grew up and just ""stopped giving a fuck"" as they described it, developed thicker skin and are much more stable, but I just can't relate. I don't feel like I've had anything different about my life (I've had my fare share of pain, but nothing insane), so my first reaction is to blame myself and feel like I'm just being a child. I know it's not constructive though, so whether it is my fault or not -- I want to make it better. But how? I've gotten better about not burdening other people with it (it's still WIP, but I am actively improving so I don't feel as stuck), but how can I get better at not feeling this deep, painful sadness at anything mildly upsetting?"

1867,Depression is the tragedy of 1,"Depression is like any other illness: it hurts and it’s debilitating. But at least with those other illnesses Get Well Soon cards and hospital visits and just nice gestures in general, at least those help. You can’t tell a depressive shit. Alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases. And there are group meetings and sponsor programs that can help. Other people who can help. Imagine a group meeting of the clinically depressed trying to comfort each other. No way. Depression sucks the life out of not only you but everyone you come into the slightest contact with. Nobody actually wants to hang out with you when you’re depressed. And even if they do, the depressive ignores every bit of encouragement or positivity from his well of depression. They bounce against the walls and are spit right back into the face of the well-wisher. That’s why your friends can’t help, why your therapist is limited,... why I feel the urge to make friends after reading strangers’ stories on this sub but know that friendship can’t work out between us, cause we’re fucking depressed.

Depression is a particularly cruel disease because it takes away one of the most effective coping mechanisms known to man — other people. It freezes out warmth, it numbs the tender touches, hell, it even twists people’s words and action that were for you to ones that are against or despite you. So it’s a tragedy like losing your loved one is a tragedy. But for you, the depressive, there is no consolation. A tragedy of one."
1868,I feel depressed,I feel depressed but I feel like if I tell anyone they won't believe me I've felt depressed for 2 years now maybe more but I've just always pushed down my feeling and faked being happy that's how I was raised but as I keep living I keep hearing people say how getting diagnosed and seeing a therapist helped them feel happy I want to feel happy but I don't want to be told that yes I'm depressed and yes i am messed up but then there's the fear of what if I'm not what if this is just life and I can't live my life properly
1869,I can’t anymore...,"(First time poster and on mobile)
I can’t do this anymore...I feel as if the world would be better off without me. Like I’m just a strain on everyone’s life that they just want to go away. I don’t think I can talk to anyone about any of this. I don’t want to hurt anyone with how I feel but I just feel so damn empty...I put on a fake smile and try not to think about it, but it’s all I think about. At any moment they are just gonna toss me to the side for someone better, someone who’s not broken. Why do I feel like this, like everyone secretly hates me and as if I don’t belong. I try to fight these intrusive thoughts but they always win. My friends make jokes and I know they are just jokes but they don’t know how I feel. And it’s not their fault I haven’t told them. My close friends think I’m doing so much better and I am finically, but mentally I’m slipping. I spend most nights crying. I fear that if I tell them they will just blow it off like it’s no big deal or worse just throw me away because they don’t want to deal with me anymore.

Everything I have ever wanted I have achieved so far. I've joined the Army (part-time, which I'm starting to suspect may have contributed to my bad mental health), I married the woman of my dreams, I have my dream job in my dream city where I make nearly six figures, and I have a beautiful house and dog... but I feel hopeless and unfulfilled. 

My favorite thing to do is travel, and my wife and I love to travel to the west coast of WA and hang out at Ruby Beach and that area. Today we drove there and stayed on the beach for a few hours, but I was so miserable and tired for no reason; all I wanted to do was lie down on the beach and sleep. I'm just tired of going on lately. I don't know if I made a mistake somewhere along the way and thought I knew what I wanted in life. I drink more than usual, and not even for the taste anymore, just to fall asleep quicker or to remember parts of my childhood that I've repressed. I'm not motivated to even work out or walk around the block. I either don't eat for days or stuff myself.

1874,Furlough has absolutely ruined me. Support in talking to my manager?,"I've returned to work after a 5 month absence and started making mistakes, I expected some errors to occur but with each passing issue the problem becomes larger, feeding into the constant anxiety of ""is my job at threat"", being the sword that looms above all of us.

I find myself trapped between needing to take a break to get rid of the stress, ended up taking a week off last week but upon my return I've immediately returned to another mistake that's leaving me with a crushing amount of stress. I've had some issues understanding things that I haven't done for a good while, and while that seems understandable to me, my manager doesn't really seem to get it and only gets frustrated. I've taken leave for mental health issues in the past and made sure the reasoning is known.

I completely understand that my manager needs to see results, but it's incredibly hard to generate those results when stress from previous issues is mounting and obliterating my focus with the constant overthinking. I can honestly look at a task and consider it done only to have it sent back with several errors. I'm not a machine, I get it, I can't do everything right, but this furlough time away has seemingly blown my margin for error right open. 

Does anyone have any idea how I can discuss this issue with my manager now?"
1875,Idk what the hell is goin on..,"I don’t know where to start this tbh. About a month or 2 ago I noticed when I would wake up every morning, everything would feel so surreal and just not real. I feel like I’ve just been living in a fantasy world.

To elaborate a little more, I mean everything feels off and not just mentally. I really can’t explain the mental feeing fully but I feel like I’m in a game or something weird sounding like that. Physically though I’ve been very distraught and confused as items around my room and house that I touch daily just feel completely different as to how I would remember. Even the texture of my walls feels different from how I remember.

I’m super tired so I’m wrapping this up but like ??? I feel like a baby in a world I’ve known for a hot minute. There’s isn’t even a way to respond to this. Just read and be interested at my confusion."
1876,What do you call someone if he or she need to feel pain?,"I came to the conclusion, but I am not sure if it a solid conclusion or if I am just thinking with my sleep deprive mind. But how do I change from someone who feel they need to be in emotional pain all the time whether inflict on themselves or influence someone around them to make other inflict pain on them.

Its a conclusion I hate to come to but...

Lately I have been wanting to make myself miserable by any mean or form. Plus I am someone who has never been to a doctor to help with depression and am working towards that. But in the mean time I need all the advice and help I can get."

1879,How to deal with being easily overwhelmed by people that are deliberately trying to incite a reaction?,"Throwaway.


I just got a new job, and I really love the job aspect of it, and I really enjoy 3 of my coworkers. That being said, a lot of my other coworkers are going out of their way to piss me off. I have autism, and for me that means not understanding social situations and avoiding eye contact. Anyway, I was talking to a coworker who randomly came up to me and was like “look at this”. I was like, ummmmm? Okay? She just randomly was destroying the lid. I nervously laughed and said “Okay, why are you destroying that lid?”. What I wanted to say was, “Okay, great. I’m at this job because I literally need it to live past 18. I don’t want to see you doing random shit to cups.” 
She just looked at me, and said “ewww”, and then just continued on with the day like nothing happened. 
Okay, first of all, I am going out of my way to not directly be rude to people like her at my job when people make it difficult. Second, what the fuck is up with that? Alright, then. Whatever. I just legit ignored her for the rest of the day.
Also, my manager came up to me, like, right after, and rhetorically asked “are you okay?”, so I guess I’m probably gonna get fired.
Also, it really pisses me off that my trainer goes out of her way to talk to me like I’m autistic. Granted, I am, but if she didn’t talk to me like “you-need-to-do this-now-or you-forgot-what you-need-to-do?-do-it-again.”
It just feels terrible. 

Whatever these people believe, I am trying my absolute best to succeed in a world that has never been on my side. Glad they already hate me."

I feel crippling guilt everyday for sleeping with someone else.,"So my ex partner of three years and I split up in January, it was very rough on me but I felt I handled myself well and was making genuine progress. June comes around and I met a women and we hit it off, started seeing each other for a month or so and things were rather chill.

 Up until this point my ex and I had very little contact but she had reached out to me in a positive way which wasnt recieved badly because there is a lot of mutual love and respect but it left me very conflicted and withdrawn all together. 

The girl I was seeing and I had split up and honestly that didn't really bother me due to the loss I hadn't really grieved yet I believe but that was what it was. Around August my ex and I start sort of reconnecting, having casual conversation, hung out once or twice but all with innocent intentions on my behalf but the more this goes on the more guilty I find myself for having been with this other women after her to the point where I don't want to leave bed or after hanging out with my ex I feel like a mess.

I don't really know how to wrap this up and I'm happy that anybody took their time to read and listen, any kind words or advice is appreciated.

Tl;Dr- I feel guilty for having a connection with my ex knowing I've sort of dated and slept with somebody after her and I don't know how to cope"

I'm dealing with jealous emotions as of late, and it's quite hard for me to deal with because it's the one emotion I find hard to accept. I currently got into a relationship with somebody who is amazing and has a secure attachment, sadly I do struggle with having a insecure attachment and as soon as I get into a relationship I become jealous as a defense mechanism to the point it's enough to make me leave a relationship.

I haven't told my partner I'm jealous as I don't want to put my emotions on him or change the dynamic of his home... but I really need some advice or help from someone who has experienced jealousy before and how they overcame it because I know it's my own issue I need to overcome."

Why the fuck do i feel like this? Why is it so hard. I dont know what to do. I dont know how i could help this feeling. I try everything that the doctor says me to do. I exercise, i hang out with friends. Nothing works. I just feel worse and worse everytime i do anything.

So over the years, I've noticed the taboo nature surrounding mental health related conversation.

I did a sit down interview with him and found his story very motivating and im here to pass it on in hope that it does find its way to someone that needs to hear that they arent the only one out there suffering.

1890,Mental Health And School,"School started only two weeks ago and today I was already so stressed that I had to leave during a test and had to be picked up from school by my mother.

It's not the first time this has happened. I just get super nervous and anxious all of a sudden, start shaking, get dizzy and nauseous. It always ends up with me going somewhere quiet and start crying. I also start scratching myself until I bleed and sometimes cut myself because I feel so bad. This also happens during a family gettogether or events where I have to be with many people. Honestly it's just extremely tiring and embarrassing. I hate when my friends see me crying and they have to get me to the nurse's office. They always have to send me the stuff I missed and going to school the next day makes me just feel pathetic. I'm scared that this is also how my other classmates see me. Just as a pathetic person. My parents picking me up makes me feel even worse because they have to stop whatever they are doing just to get me.

I don't know if it's a sort of breakdown but I tried to tell a doctor. He just said that it is all in my head and I just need to stay calm but I really don't know how. My parents are usually super supportive and they know I have this problem but they are also just saying the same things as my doctor and that if this continues they will take me out of school so that I can't write my A-levels (which I really really want to be able to write).

I'm really scared that this all will take a toll on my studies and grades because I miss lessons and tests. Also I think my parents are dissappointed because I'm the only one of my siblings that has these problems.

1894,I just feel tired.,"I'm tired of disappointing people,I just don't have the energy to do anything and I'm just not happy,I feel bad for alot of things and even though I think I'm a good person I either have bad friends or they don't understand me,I just want peace,I don't want any more people making fun of me or screaming at me while I'm trying my best doing things that I shouldn't even do in the first place ,helping them. I want to go to therapy but this is probably just one of those moments I feel terrible,I don't want to pay just for someone to tell me that I'm sad and get my s*it together,but in these past months I just feel like I'm not enough,I want to tell my friends this but I know they'll never understand me,one of my friends said he felt depressed and I talked to him and stuff and he just made fun of me while I was just trying to help,and my other good friend thinks that depressed people are just sad...
I never really tried hurting myself but I feel miserable,and it hurts me so much,especially that I don't have the energy to deal with all this stuff."
1895,What am I supposed to do?,"Hi, so I got this problem of my depression that affecting my cognitive abilities to think and answers simple questions. And lately I've been trying to meditate but I think it needs more time to see the effects? And besides that, I also can't seem to interact with new people. I'm afraid of people judging me of not being smart, not being funny and all. And the condition in my own house is really really bad. I got verbally abuse a lot. And whenever there is a zoom class and I started the zoom class in my house with my parents around, I don't really wanted to talk. At all. Is there anything that I could do? At least I can talk comfortably around new people even through some zoom class but still inside my house? Thank you."
1896,Was I a victim of pedophilia?,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I just really wanted to get this off my chest. When I was 16 (I'm a male), I met a 20 year old girl who seemed perfect for me, we started hanging out all the time very fast and within a couple months we were having sex and talking almost every night, she also really quickly she told me she loved me. Keep in mind I've never had a legit relationship before this. So obviously I jump on it and tell her I love her too and then she starts talking about how this is ""an adult relationship and not like a high school relationship"" which I figured was fine but that's when then the subtle emotional abuse and manipulation started. without getting too much into the details she'd treat me like absolute garbage. She also used sex as a weapon for whenever she knew I was mad at her. We ended up breaking up after about only a year but I can't stop thinking about whether or not I was a victim of pedophilia or not, if the genders were reversed it'd be a 100% yes but anyone I've tried talking to irl about it just says ""she's hot bro you were lucky"" Again sorry if this is the wrong sub but this whole situation has really effected my mental health the past couple years and I'd appreciate any other opinion."
1897,I’m pretty sure I’m depressed,"Throwaway because I have my fiancée on my main. 

I’m military, stuck in a dusty northern town, but it’s not just the location. Nothing interests me other than some boxing classes. I’m planning a wedding I don’t give a shit about, not because I don’t love her but because I can’t literally bring myself to care. I’m lethargic at work because I know it’s a job that doesn’t matter. I have trouble going out in public because, I try not to be, but I hate being around other people. I’ve gotten in trouble for saying ‘mean’ things to people, as in I speak what’s on my mind, and usually it’s something terrible. I don’t want to kill myself, but if my life changed tomorrow and I was a totally different person, I would be fine with that. Someone who appreciates this life should be living it, I’m angry with it. I don’t know what I want, I’m tired of waiting on other people, and I just want out of my circumstances."
1898,I don't understand if I'm pretending to not be okay or if I'm actually sad.,[removed]
1899,Why does it begin in the evening?,"I have extreme sadness and anxiety closer to evening, around 9 PM and during the night, basically, anytime it gets dark outside. I am not afraid of darkness but it seems as if night time has certain negative effect on me. I am so terrified to fall asleep cause so many depressive thoughts keep bothering me if I am not distracting myself with comedy movies/tv series until I fall asleep. I have insomnia because of that and sleep deprivation. 

Has anyone experienced the same and what did you do? I don’t want to rely on external stimulus (tv series/medication/alcohol) to fall asleep or cope with it, I want to deal with it on my own but I can’t yet figure out how."
1900,How do I find myself?,"I was studying engineering in university and dropped out in the beginning of my second year. I worked here and there of about 6 months. Then, my mom suggested moving to Germany to get back on my feet financially. I've been working there for about two and a half years now, living with my mom and my stepdad. I come back to Lithuania once or twice a year for vacation, so I still spend time with friends I left there. In Germany all I do is work or stay at home. I don't have any friends there. I am planning to come back to Lithuania in March next year, because my contract ends then I don't want to be there anymore. I've completely closed myself off and feel really depressed. I don't have any goals or dreams in life. All I do, when I'm not working is, I listen to music or watch stuff on the internet. I always loved driving but even that doesn't give me any joy now. I was thinking, that I should try studying again, but I don't know what I want to do in life. I feel really down all the time and don't see any joy of life. I see this as a big problem and don't know how to pick myself up. Can someone help me with this?"

1904,Visual Hallucinations,"
I am medicated for bipolar disorder with Latuda and Welbutrin. However I still experience Visual Hallucinations with a change in mood. A kitten I was trying to save died while in my mom's care while I was at work. Which frustrated and depressed me. When the fact finally sunk in, I found myself hallucinating a shadowy crow flying in the building while I was trying to work. It would disappear when I tried to follow it with my eyes, but if I just stared at one spot in the distance I could see it darting back and forth in my peripherals.

To be honest, I'm not sure this counts as hallucinations. But I had one doctor told me they do. Before I was medicated I would hallucinate shadow people and animals all the time. Since I was fired from my job, it was more common, but after starting a new job I thought i wouldnt have to worry about it anymore."
1905,Advice about seeking help/speaking out,"Hey all, I was wondering if anyone has any advice about trying to talk about mental health with friends or partners? I’ve been feeling like I’ve been battling with things for a few months, but I’m worried about either trying to get professional help/speaking out about it, because I’m worried what friends/family will think. I can’t really see a way out of things at the moment and I’m wondering if anyone else has struggled with this."
1906,I dont want to ask for help.,"15 M

For the last four years, my days continously have gotten worse and worse. Not them being bad days, just my good days are when I have a reason to get out of bed.
Of course there are exceptions every couple of months.

Those last four years, I've been very tired, and just bored of pretty much everything. I'm almost 100% sure that I have depression. Me and my aunt had a very short conversation that she dismissed right afterward. 

I dont know what feeling happy is like, you may hear this from people far worse off than I am. But I have times where I just get excited, like my heart rate increases but I don't ever feel good.

Self harm. No, but I've tried it, but I was too scared to push the knife hard enough into my skin, not worried about my health but about me getting yelled at by my parents.

Suicidal thoughts? Pretty regular, every 1-2 days. But I care too much about the select few people that I do care about, to actually go through with it

Home Life? I have probably the ideal home life, and hearing about others difficulties, makes me both angry and sad at the same time.

for as long as I can remember I have a hatred towards people just in general. Especially the ""nice"" people,  I don't believe true sympathy exists. If somebody is nice they have a reason for it. I can not convince myself otherwise. That's probably the main reason I havent told my parents yet, 


I dont want their sympathy. I dont believe it."
1907,The secondary feeling to every primary feeling has become guilt,Is this common when someone is breaking down your subconscious? Also talking to you abusively in your sleep? Beating you while you sleep? Constantly monitoring you online?
1908,Tired of always helping others,"My (18, F) mental health has recently taken a strain due to being overly exhausted doing so much for others I feel as though I haven’t had a one day off break to myself once. I drive my sister (22) around everywhere, take her on drives to places over an hour away at least 3 times a week (she doesn’t have a license) if I say no it’ll just cause a major fight. My boyfriend is constantly sad about things I can’t control and feel like he takes out his sadness on me, I always have to organise plans for us to go places/events because he never does and if I don’t we won’t do anything, I make dinner every time we spend a night together, clean the house. I’m also a full time uni student which makes it difficult I feel as though I never have time to myself. I’m not sure if I’m just being selfish but I just don’t know what to do, I wish people would do things for me for once. Any advice would be appreciated."
1909,Wow. I am really upset today.,"I woke up just a little while ago (about 9:30 am) from the most disturbing dream I've had in a LONG time.

I was watching someone bound and determined to kill herself. I was on the outside this time ... I stopped her over and over. She was trying to die, and even though it wasn't me as the main ""character"", it was me in a very strong way.

I feel like crying now. Why did I dream this? 

It was me...but it wasn't me. I could feel the emotions and the absolute news to die...

I am really depressed now and upset. I don't know what to do because the feelings linger...but I have no reason to feel as such. My life isn't bad at all right now...

Help."
1910,I had a breakdown and feel guilty &amp; embarrassed. Not sure what to do next.,"This past weekend I had what I’ll call a breakdown.  A bunch of stress and emotional pain broke through my normally controlled demeanor and I lashed out at someone I love. (another adult, not a child).  The things I said were true (at least to me) but the way I said it was horrible.

I feel like such an ass.  I deserve to feel bad about it, to feel guilty &amp; embarrassed.  I just don’t know how to proceed and to prevent this from happening again.  

I wish I could go back to Friday and redo my whole weekend.  I feel like a failure.  I feel like a deadbeat piece of crap for losing my cool.  I can’t see my way to hope or happiness.  How do I ever recover from making a scene and hurting someone else just because I was hurting?  What do I do?"
1911,I Think I Have a Mental Illness,"The long and short of what I have to say is that over the past few months in quarantine I've developed a truly strange attachment to a celebrity. When I'm alone, I sometimes imagine I'm with a fictional version of her. Not in a sexual way, but she basically acts as a stand in for what I would want out of marriage or a committed relationship and maybe this is a psychological mechanism that prevents me from feeling isolated in quarantine. But at this point I spend so much time thinking about about a person I've never met that it's just really bad. Getting an actual girlfriend a couple months ago helped take my mind off this celebrity, but when we weren't together I kept thinking about the celebrity. My girlfriend and I broke up last week and I'm spending even more time thinking about this person. This celebrity is someone whose accomplishments I admire and respect regardless of the fact that I find her attractive, but I want to move on and leave it at that level of platonic respect. Nonetheless I look at myself and think it's so bizarre that I have this secret fixation on this woman and I wonder if there is something wrong with me. 

It's hard to find a place to begin, I might as well start in my childhood where all this started. Basically, for many years from boyhood to being a teenager I was deeply in love with my best friend. She and I were inseparable as kids, but by the time we were teenagers we were both sent to a very strict private school that banned dating - so we couldn't be together, even though we took the same classes and hung out in the same social circles. That was really painful for me, and around this time I became very invested in the films of a certain actress. Not because of her, but because I related to the themes of these movies which were very well made - she just so happened to be in them. Interestingly though, this actress looked a lot like my childhood best friend and I developed a huge crush on her. Not just because of her looks, but her on and off screen personality was very similar to my best friend. Eventually, my friend and I grew apart and I fell out of love with her - probably because of the policy imposed by the school. I transferred from that school anyway, and I haven't seen her since. 

I forgot about the celebrity for a while. But when she came out with a new release a few years ago, I developed another huge crush on her which I think was healthy at first. She wasn't just attractive, she was also someone whose accomplishments as an actress, producer, and activist I genuinely respected and looked up to. In particular, the way this actress spoke honestly about bullying and how she channeled her experiences into her professional accomplishments inspired me to do the same. I related very strongly to her characters as well as her real-life personality, and watching her films as a teen helped me get through a tough time as I transitioned into adulthood. 

From then on my crush faded and I really saw her as a skilled actress more than anything, and I continued to follow her work with curious interest. That changed earlier this year, after quarantine began. For some reason my crush came back in full force. I spent most of my time completely alone as I studied for the LSAT in my rented apartment, and sometimes at night I would imagine that a fictional version of her (not her exactly) and I were together and this prevented me from feeling alone. I went through a marathon of her films while I was studying for the LSAT, which helped get me through an otherwise stressful time. Reading and watching interviews with her talking about her craft as well as some of her difficult life experiences gave me inspiration to keep on going with the LSAT even when I felt like giving up. 

For about a month, in June when I took the test, I forgot about my crush. But after I took the test the crush came back again but this time I spent a lot of time being heartbroken that she and I couldn't be together. I knew I needed to overcome this so I booked a hotel and drove to Cape Cod and isolated myself from everyone I knew. While there, I got a girlfriend for real and we started dating. It was great at first, but when we weren't together I kept thinking about the celebrity. My girlfriend and I were together for two months, but we broke up recently and now my crush is back again. I almost feel like I have a mental illness because I am clearly obsessed with someone I've never met and I'm tired of it. Especially when I imagine myself with a fictional person based on her who doesn't exist. It's just not healthy but I don't know what do to about it."
1912,I need help please,[removed]
1913,"I don't want to be a Schizoid, anymore. Can I stop being one?","Hello r/mentalhealth,  


I'm a schizoid, and for the longest time, I didn't care that I was one. As someone who prefers being alone, and has been able to find work, I didn't see the need to seek additional therapy for it.  


However, recently, I've been evaluating the quality of my life over the years, and I've noticed the quality of my life has always been the highest when I'm living with others (and lowest when I was completely alone).   
It seems I greatly benefit from just having the presence of others, and being able to chat with them from time to time.  


For this reason, I now believe it's important that I avoid being alone as intensely as schizoids tend to be.  


I believe it's important now for my mental health to at least talk for an extended amount of time with someone everyday.  


So ... can a schizoid stop being a schizoid, or will I be one for the rest of my life? And even if I am one for the rest of my life, to what extend does socializing with others help my condition/prove useful?  


P.S. rest assured, I'll seek therapy for what therapy is better for. I don't want this post to be 100+ comments just telling me to seek therapy."
1914,extreme anti social traits,"The thought of becoming someone I always knew was the true me is a scary one, I genuinely tried to change what I knew for a fact was deep down, I hate stupidity the most, I never truly cared about anyone’s feelings unless it’s for a benefit that’s coming afterwards, and even that is just for show
 
I come from a relatively “high social statued” family, but I never really cared about a specific person’s status, all I “cared” about is a person’s ability to think, even if its “limited” due to whatever circumstances you’ve been living through, but the ability to be able to freely think has got nothing to do with whatever “education” or school you’ve gone to
 
I never shredded a genuine tear towards anyone, I only cared about myself, I had close people dying, but never really felt sad
 
I had an extremely weird childhood, I’m used to be attracted into physically hurting anything, I didn’t have the concept of getting hurt back, and when that “concept” was carved into my at that time small mind, I started using my brain a little, and made sure I wouldn’t get hurt back when I hurt whatever living being there is
 
I always was able to differentiate what was right and what was wrong, but never at that time was able to tell why, I just knew that I’d get “punished” if I did anything wrong, so I had to always act up good in order to get what I wanted, and always had to avoid whatever was considered wrong in order to steer away from unnecessary trouble
 
Grew up a little and started to get curious about the human psychology, body language, eyes, voice tone, and basically everything along the lines, loved and really enjoyed acting up depending on how you’re feeling and could easily make you subconsciously uncomfortable, scared, or loved, depending on what benefit I’m getting out of you
 
Started abusing drugs since a really young age, I basically tried everything, and even most of the really uncommon drugs, and started mixing a shit ton of medicine even, went to a dozen rehab centers, was always diagnosed as merely being an addict and antisocial, my family and especially parents, are not even able to comprehend what personality disorders are, so they basically self-diagnosed me as autistic, using the simplest terms ever due to their “limited” knowledge of mental illnesses and personality disorders, and I’m far as an autistic person is, I always enjoyed being social but it always depends on what benefit that comes with it, the thrill of being wholesome is basically a feeling I literally can’t get enough of, I feel that way by exploiting whatever your body language indicates
 
currently, I don’t particularly enjoy physically hurting someone, but I have no problems with it either, and I wouldn’t really do it because then, law enforcement would be involved, basically I just to try stray away from that, I wouldn’t really call you out by swearing, I basically only enjoy dismantling someone’s mental state by showing how obviously “superior” I am by wording out what your thoughts are, I can easily get the “higher ground” no matter who you are, never really met anyone who’s actually able to escape from such manipulative schemes, I started doing it for fun even, not just for the benefit coming afterwards, I build up lies and actually, its become relatively easy to be able to keep up with the lies built, and remember whom I told this specific lie to even, I just love to see how different people would react to different “colors” and personalities I have on stock, I can easily change colors depending on who you are, but I always am one step above
 
I tried to keep myself of thinking that I’m psychopathic, because I find people assuming they are, are actually infuriating and downright cringe worthy, also straight up calling myself that, “cringes” me down to my spine, so I literally tried myself stay away from such thought
 
And one of them reasons that kept me holding myself up of such thought is that, there was this just one time that I actually fell in love, and we were together for 3 years approx, and when we broke up, I hated it, cause injustice was involved, family related issues due to the fact we both are Egyptians and live in the middle east, during that point, I always thought I hated it because we broke up and basically we both were in love, but when I deeply think about it, all I despised was the fact that it was completely unfair, breaking up cause of family related issues, yes I cheated, and sometimes got intoxicated and shit talked her, but the fact such “injustice” was involved makes me absolutely detest such ways of thinking, I already realize cheating and unnecessary shit talking is wrong, but I basically can’t feel it (even currently as I am sober), and when I even deeply think about it even more, I only loved the affection given to me by her, not her personally, I really loved the attention given to me by someone who I know for a fact absolutely adores me, I wanted to give her the world, basically so merely I can continue on feeling such “wholesomeness”
 
Nothing I hate more than stupidity, and if there was a way to handle whatever shit, I’ll do that, I’ll automatically label you as dumb if you’ve done little to no thinking towards basically anything you’ll be doing, and that literally gives me a push to act up and get whatever benefit I can from you and completely exploit you (my thoughts and acts come to me smoothly natural), ill most definitely really enjoy dismantling your very mental state, by showing how much “better” I am, as long as I’m not breaking laws and not doing stupid shit that would label me as irrational then anything ethical could go out the window
 
I always hated the fact I’d personally call myself smart, or even subconsciously thinking so, cause that just “gives off” the psychopathic traits I have if that makes sense anyways (despised the fact I’d call myself smart cuz it cringes me), also really despised whatever and whoever is “cringeworthy”, especially those acting like they’ve got mental problems and act upon that fact, I’d gladly make it real and really would enjoy seeing you get mentally hurt cause of your own actions and your own act (don’t even think about acting mentally “sick” and show me yourself cuz I’ll easily label you as looking for attention, and I’ll act up upon that fact), but at the same time, those suffering from whatever mental illnesses, i can literally always be there, and fix whatever issues your specific illness resulted in, and already there are ton of people’s feeling so much better and thanking me too much for what I’ve done (you’re too good to be true, is often said to me)
 
Took me approx 6 months to learn a third language merely because I wanted to join a community’s specific main language to understand and comprehend how culture and language “affects people psychologically”
Found myself really into that, so took me  another two years to learn other multiple languages, merely because of such fact, I don’t do shit that would bore me, I started having international calls and not just texting and writing posts online, so I can also comprehend how tones differ from languages to another, started listening to issues at first and then started “fixing” them later on, I wouldn’t go around talking about whatever if I don’t have enough knowledge towards such subject, and if I really had to, I’ll try to understand as much as possible and ask a lot of questions without sounding like a complete dick, be it a business or anything academical or whatever
 
People calling me really smart is a daily occurrence, and I love it in contrast of how I personally think about calling myself so
 
I’m not feeling particularly sad nor happy, I’m basically feeling really empty unless I’m around people
 
I’ve got pets, dogs and cats, I don’t really have any particular affection towards them, but I just love doting to whatever is smaller than me, I genuinely smile when they do cute shit and always wanting to give them the world, I sometimes have some “grade A” meat, which is basically really expensive in my country, but I’d still give them lots of it, but at the same time, I honestly don’t really think I’d be against physically hurting them, but I just don’t do it cause they’re cute (if that even makes sense), but whenever I see posts of people hurting animals or witness it with my own eyes, I’d get really annoyed, not cause of them poor animals, cause the people doing it look pretty stupid, might sound pretty hypocrite to other people, because I personally seem to have no problems with it, basically just hating the people doing it
 
I love to talk about politics and religion and basically whatever that requires a lot of thinking, and if I’m at some point became a man of “power”, I’d have no problems and whatsoever applying “drastic” measures towards anyone who’s stupid for the sake of whatever country or district I’d be in charge of
 
I don’t particularly “enjoy” watching people dying or whatever blood-gore related videos or witnessing something in real, or any of those stereotypical anti-social disorder I might have is affiliated with, but I still have no problems seeing it either, exactly the same as watching cute cat videos for example, and even applying it towards whoever is a reason for such error, be it a country or a company or anything man-workers related companies/districts
 
Went to a dozen psychiatrists, therapists and psychologists, but in my country, none would even consider the fact I’d be having one or multiple of those anti-social traits and could easily lie to their faces, if I wanted a specific prescribed medicine, they wouldn’t even realized they’ve been lied to, the most they could come up with is affiliating my drug abuse with their “final” decision and diagnose, cause in Egypt, most of those going through them, are addicts fixing their issues and ex addicts fixing previous problems resulted by them abusing drugs at some point
 
And by tying the fact I went to dozen rehab centers and my “personality”, “it’s just issues resulted by your previous drug problems” is all I get
 
And my family aren’t any better, even more simple than those psychologists here in Egypt, diagnosing me as being “inhuman” or an “asshole”, if those are medical terms and diagnoses even
 
I’m relatively physically “appealing” by most standards, and it makes it even easier talking and manipulating whoever is a next “victim”, getting basically anything I want with just talking to people


*I tried to word it out as simple as possible so it could easily be understood, some words that were used such as “cringe” for example is simply because I don’t really know what words to use in their place in order to cross thoughts*"
1915,My father ≠ my father figure,"
My dad experienced abuse as a kid. As a result of that he blames his emotions onto us (my mom and I). He also always invalidates my emotions. He says I shouldn’t be stressed and he is the one I should worry about. Sometimes he goes all “nice” to make you love him again or at least attempt to and then he gets all grumpy as in blaming everything on us.

This is my latest vent but it really kinda brings to light what the “cycle” is: 

I He turns everything back around on me or my mom. He blames my mom and I for his emotions. We go out to eat so much because he is a pain in the butt to be around. He stays home and sleeps. Sometimes he tries to bamboozle me by being “nice” but then he ends up being rude again. On top of that he never lets me have personal space. I don’t like people to come really really close to me and he just comes close and I tell him personal space and he says “you don’t need personal space”. He also never gives me privacy in my room. He just barges through the door and turns on my light. I say get out but nicely and he gets mad at me because I never talk to him. Here’s the thing I don’t want to talk to him.  10 years ago he was nice and I loved my dad (I was 4). Something changed when I was 5-6 and after kindergarten, he went mean. He wants my mom to help him of things around the house but then once she tries to help he says go relax. He is the cause of my shitty mental health. He makes me love anytime from 2am to 1pm because that’s when he’s at work. But when he’s home and weekend are *hell*. Today is the last day of a three day weekend and I personally was looking forward to some rest but that didn’t happen.He’s racist to his own race and others. He’s homophobic (I’m apart of the lgbtq community but really in the closet) and he makes an excuse of “oh I have gay friends it’s okay that I can say this. ” He has caused me in the past to self harm and just stay in my room all day. He also has told me that he wishes that he had a better daughter. 
I’m an only child and I feel like I’m the cause of his behaviors. He calls me names such as “string bean” and “skinny Minnie”. It bothers me and I’ve told him to stop but he doesn’t. He has made me more self conscious about my body. This quarantine I knew what I was getting into and now I’ve been feeling numb for almost 6 months. He also jokes around and says he will hit us (he doesn’t) which is really not funny. I don’t remember the last time he hugged me or told me he loved me. He somehow says that he’s proud of me but I really don’t believe it. He is also the reason why I have trouble accepting compliments. He also says that I am too negative and he wishes I was more grateful. Here’s the thing he doesn’t really do anything for me in terms of taking care of me. My mom literally does everything. The only thing he’s doing is going to work to save up for my college (I graduate High school in a few years). 


Here’s the TL;DR of his cycle: 

1. He gets mad at himself for dropping something or just for existing
2. He blames things on us which makes us in a crappy mood which we know we don’t dare talk about it in front of him
3. He forgets what he did but still is grumpy 
4. He ends up “nice” and trying to make you love him as in just being somewhat fine to be around. 
5. Cycle repeats. 

The cycle happens once a day or the nice part happens after about a week."
1916,Did I..trick myself out of my depression?,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place. I just need to vent about this and its a huge problem that I’m not dealing with. 

I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m so confused about the fact that I’ve done this to myself and I have no idea what to do.

For years straight, I’ve had severe, debilitating depression. It destroyed my life, it destroyed my mind, it destroyed my memory. I cried every night. I self harmed constantly. But I think somehow I did something and now I’m just..I don’t know. I’ll explain what I mean.

I can’t cry anymore. I haven’t cried for months, at the beginning whenever I felt a single tear coming I’d laugh at myself in my head and taunt myself about how pathetic it is, and now I don’t cry anymore. I got told that my grandma died last month, I loved her so much. She was the most wonderful woman. But I felt nothing. No sadness, no guilt, no care. I watched the funeral (online because of covid) in silence. 

I can’t feel anything anymore. The only thing I’ve ever felt ever since I changed was anger. But it’s not even an emotional anger, it’s a ‘stop bothering me and getting in my way’ anger. I keep hurting everybody around me. I don’t know why. It’s like it’s just second nature to me now. I hate it so much. It badly affects my life. The anger, it just comes out. I can’t control it. I’ve become cold and cruel and I’m not even able to feel any sort of..remorse for it? I don’t know if that’s the right word. Basically I don’t feel guilty. I don’t understand why. I have no answers. 

I don’t know who I am or what’s wrong with me. I could do the worst things and I wouldn’t feel anything about it. I can’t feel love. I can’t feel anything towards anybody. I’m a selfish person, I put myself above everyone because I’ve been screwed over my entire life by other people. 

It’s so confusing."
1917,OCD: When Obsessions and Compulsions Rule Your Life,"""According to psychiatrist Andreas Wahl-Kordon, [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27199/20200907/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-when-obsessions-compulsions-rule-life.htm) is a common mental illness, although not always obvious because society has made it a taboo and concealed concept..."""
1918,Emotional inaccesibility 22F,"Maybe i'm just ignoring my emotions, but whenever i get upset, its like it cant be stopped, like a brush fire or wild fire. I cant control what i say or do. I walk out of my jobs in a month or two, ive never been able to hold a job, i cry several times a day and i break things (fridge drawer recently). I threw files full of paperwork against the wall. I avoid myself. I have a huge history of self harm that put me in inpatient for 10 days in 2016. I've tried effexor, lamictal, rexulti, lexapro, abilify, not in that order. I'm thinking about getting back on lamictal. None of these medicines ever stopped the crying episodes or even curbed them, but my doctors are hesitant to try new things with me, because the problems dont seem severe enough, because i cant communicate well. Its kind of something i need to therapize on my own.

But i dont understand how. My worldview is horrible, i skipped school every day, i was abused to hell and back up until this morning from birth. Like a dog in a cage, i was starved for eight years, with no winter coat, or access to people, or laundry, or toilet. I still live with my family, and im expected to work. Every day they tell me."
1919,Worried about my councillor calling my mother after something that happened to my friend,"Hi,

So I (f22) am currently on the waiting list for rape counselling, funded by the NHS in the U.K. I am also currently receiving CBT, also funded by the NHS. When I signed up for both services it asked me to put down a next of kin on the form. I put my mum down but thought nothing of this. 

My friend (f23) also receives counselling. A few days ago, she overslept and missed her telephone appointment. The counsellor called her mother, who was down as her next of kin, out of concern that she didn’t answer. This was disastrous for my friend as she didn’t want her mum to know about the sessions, and she had to explain it all to her, stuff she didn’t want her mum to know.

It never even occurred to me that this is something they might do. I’m now really anxious that if they can’t contact me for whatever reason, they will call my mum. My life would be over if my mum found out that I had been raped, or was having mental health troubles. 

Is what happened to my friend a mistake on her counsellors part, or is it normal practise to contact a next of kin if they can’t reach you? Are the any professionals that can answer this for me?"
1920,If people bring opportunities... Does it mean that for being and introvert my life is already fucked?,"English is not my mother language so I Apologize in advance for any weird thing I say. 

Well, ever since I was a 13 year old, my life has been kind of a constant awkward situation. I’ve never been able to get along with other people because I’m very (actually extremely) shy. It is very difficult to be comfortable among others and I never seem to connect with anyone. I’ve been through 3 different universities now and I haven’t met anyone I can actually consider a friend, or at least an acquaintance. 

I study Film because I want to become a screenwriter and a director, and I have realized that being a social and nice person gives a lot of opportunities. My shyness is truly destroying my life. I feel alone all the time. Everytime I try to meet somebody and make some friends, my low self-steem and insecurity fucks me up. It’s been almost  10 years of this bullshit now and I don’t seems to be able of going over it.

At first I thought that maybe I just should ignore it and try. I did. But the low self worth and insecurity always seem to catch up. 
I don’t know guys. Perhaps I’m just built different. But I hate it, because I actually find people really interesting but I can’t get along. It is frustrating. I only wish I was an extrovert or a different person. I’ve gone to many therapists, psychologists, gotten into sports groups... 

Being alone is my everyday and I’m actually getting tired.

If I’m this shy does it mean that I will never get any opportunity? Is my life doomed to loneliness? Will I always be an underachiever? I honestly want to be somebody but my own psyche keeps pushing me down. It ia frustrating"
1921,I wrote a song following the aftermath of losing my younger brother to suicide and asked fellow redditors to submit short videos of someone they’ve lost or their own personal struggles with depression to raise awareness for mental health ❤️,[A Lesson In Shapeshifting ](https://youtu.be/j-hQMvNL2R8)
1922,Struggling dealing with death,"This was probably the worst week I've (27f) ever experienced. My boyfriend's beloved grandma passed away, then my parents put our elderly dog down, and yesterday my boyfriend's friend's brother committed suicide. I know these are all kind of on the outside of grief, the friend's brother I never even knew, but it hit me very hard. Mostly not understanding how his family is supposed to carry on, when obviously their pain is so much more intense than mine is. 
With the grandma and the dog, I'm just having trouble coming to terms with the fact that they're just.. not here anymore. That they don't exist. It's too surreal for me to comprehend. 
I've also been experiencing bad anxiety thinking how minor these experiences must be for me in the grand scheme of life, how the hell will I handle anyone in my immediate family passing away, which will inevitably happen sooner or late. 
I've been venting a bit to friends, and obviously my boyfriend and I are going through it together, but I still feel so alone in my pain and sometimes slightly embarrassed that I'm having such a strong emotional reaction. I'm also trying to be accepting towards my negative emotions and trying to just be with it, but it's a physical pain that I just cant bear. How the fuck do I deal??"
1923,Do you sometimes doubt if you're depressed at all?,"I'm struggling recently with what I think is depression. I'm seeing a psychiatrist since spring and after every appointment I have a feeling that I did it wrong. I said the wrong things I didn't get across what I wanted to tell him, I feel like I'm stealing his time.

I feel like I shouldn't be complaining I have a job, albeit very stressful, am married, have a beautiful child, trying to do sports as best as I could and have a relatively good social life.

But the times I am alone with my thoughts are horrible. When I wake up I beg the world to just forget me. I feel like it really wouldn't be that bad if a train hit me, that it wouldn't be that bad if I just stopped existing.

Then I go on and do my chores and it's really not that bad during the day... But deep inside I'm just so empty...

I don't know why I tell you this... I just needed to get this off my chest."
1924,Can someone explain why music plays in my head when I'm mad,"I used to get angry to the point where I was a danger to others over mild problems, but recently music plays in my head when I get mad and calms me down, can someone explain why?"
1925,"I'm stuck in a job I hate, and it's really starting to get to me.","I used to adore my job, but for the past year and a half it's just gone so downhill. Benefits been taken away, lots of stress with no support. I've begged my work for help and they just tell me ""it's not that bad"". 

I've got a lot going on, my mum's poorly, I myself am poorly. I am under the hospital for abnormal cells, and I may have to get a partial removal of my cervix. I'm actually terrified. This added to the fact if I DO need an operation to get this done. My company have taken away sick may, and i'll be so screwed for money, and I genuinely don't know what I'll do. 

I have no savings as I'm paid so little, I can just about afford my bills and food and petrol each month. 

I don't know how I've ended up at such a point in my life. I'm so hardworking, I don't do/buy anything for myself. I started applying for jobs at the start of this year, and then lockdown happened and everything went on hold. 

Even now we're out of lockdown, so many people are applying for jobs, i'm getting rejection after rejection, or not hearing back at all and honestly, I can't cope anymore.

I'm not sure i'll ever be rid of this job. 

I'd give anything to just up and quit, but I can't afford to; I can't even afford to be off for my mental health, because the company took away sick pay as COVID hit.

I'm so sad right now."
1926,I dont want to go to the Psych ward. Will I if I open up about whats happening?,If I tell my psychologist about whats going on can they send me there? I dont want to go. So if they can I wont be telling them. I cant go. Can they send me there?
1927,I don’t feel the need to sleep or eat anymore,I barely get enough sleep and just feel the need to not sleep and just go throughout the days like that. I’ve been eating less and am starting to lose interest in food in general. The only appetite I have is for like gum and water if I don’t make myself eat something.
1928,"I find it difficult to maintain proximity, touch with other people and I am scared of sharing my emotions and feelings.",[removed]
1929,Title,"I know I am faking it. I know I force my symptoms and            ""mental illness"" on my self. I just don't know why. Maybe to feel special I don't know. This makes me feel frustrated and ashamed and guilty. On the other hand I know there is something wrong with me and I don't know what. I wish there was an objective test that could tell you with a 100% certainty what is happening because I don't. And going to therapy is just not working because I don't know what to say or how to say it. I want to be objective and truthful. I don't want to mislead anyone. Thing is I can feel myself forcing the symptoms sometimes but I can't stop me from doing it. It's like there is something in my head forcing me to do those things. I was never genuine. I think everything I ever liked or thought or how I behaved was forced. Now I am forcing this on myself. I don't know. Today was a fairly good day and now I just feel so frustrated about these things. These past few days have been a rollercoaster. I feel momentarily euphoric and then I don't. I feel happy and then I think I'm faking and force myself to be sad because after a while I start feeling miserable again. I am losing my mind and I am certain I did this to myself. I am still doing this to myself. It's like I don't let myself  be happy. I think when I force myself to be happy I succeed but only for a few seconds. Then the other part of me starts making me sad again. Even writing this post feels like I am faking it. I don't want to do it but I do. Posting here proves i am faking it and I just seek reassurance and validation.

If this gets posted (cause my posts never appear here) : I know the post doesnt make any sense. I don't make any sense. I can't even understand what I am thinking. Just wanted to vent."
1930,Insomnia,"Been coming to terms with the fact that I was sexually abused but suppressed it until recently. Have been seeing a psychologist but in doing so has only increased the memories. Insomnia began. Then friends and I were robbed at 2am and threatened with a gun. Insomnia increased significantly.

It is so fucking annoying because it makes it super hard to actually get anything done. I was let go from my last job because I wasn't on time (15 minutes early) and was struggling with pressure even though it was only probation.

Really makes me so mad. Not to mention I have god damn epilepsy with seizures only happening when I fall asleep."
1931,How do I convince myself I’m not that fat?,"Recently I have been losing weight ,but if I look at the mirror I want to chop off my stomach this,used to be mild because I had friends who helped me but I dont really know anymore I’m trying but sometimes ,I want to just chop it off I know I would never but it’s still hard."
1932,My grandfather just passed away and I feel sad but not as much as I thought I would.,My grandfather lives in Mexico and I just received news after my mother went to visit him that he passed away. I am 16 living in the U.S. and i cried a bit but i didn’t break down or anything. I’m just sitting here watching the sad but I am confused. When my dog died I burst down crying shrieking and I broke down but when my grandpa died I cried a little and got sad but didn’t make it a big deal. Did I not love him like I thought I did. What’s wrong with me?
1933,Do you ever convince yourself your insane?,"I've never been diagnosed with anything but every couple months I'll have a episode kinda where I'll stay in bed for a couple weeks and convince myself I'm insane and everyone knows it but me, I look back on stuff I've done and every awkward social interaction I've had and everything I've done wrong and convince myself a normal person would never do that and that I am clinically insane and I'm the only one who doesn't know. Then I'll snap out of it but every time it feels so real."

1935,Getting over sexual traumas,"Apologies if this is the wrong place for this, but if anyone has guidance on coping skills they’ve used to get over sexual traumas of any sort it’d be much appreciated.

I don’t want to get into any details of events, but I’m spiraling a bit. I’ve gone to therapy and perhaps never focused too much on these things because I’d rather avoid it, or apparently blame myself, but I need help. 

I’ve been getting heavily back into smoking and drinking and I’m so scared, and tired.

Can’t really talk to anyone in my support system about these things. It’s not their weight or burden to bear."
1936,I’m starting to feel alone a lot now idk what to do,I last had a girlfriend ( or a very close friend ) 2-3 years ago. I feel like i don’t like anyone anymore... it’s like i know they wouldn’t want to talk to me casually and share my feelings. I really miss having someone close... i have  friends but like they would get bored easily talking. At night or at times during the day suddenly i suddenly get the feeling that i’m alone and would like someone to just come and have a simple conversation. And i know my family wouldn’t understand what is going on. I’m still not able to tell what i’m feeling
1937,What/who do you turn to?,"I was a little unsure if this was the right forum to ask this question, but I was wondering what/who you turned to when things are just cumulatively getting worse for you and you’re tired of looking inwards for comfort and strength? I mean, especially if you’re an atheist or just generally non-religious/spiritual, who do you turn to? Where do you put your faith? Where/how do you find hope? What gives you a sense of “shh, it’s going to get better soon, you got this, keep going”?"
1938,I feel lost and lonely,"I was studying engineering in university and dropped out in the beginning of my second year. I worked here and there of about 6 months. Then, my mom suggested moving to Germany to get back on my feet financially. I've been working there for about two and a half years now, living with my mom and my stepdad. I come back to Lithuania once or twice a year for vacation, so I still spend time with friends I left there. In Germany all I do is work or stay at home. I don't have any friends there. I am planning to come back to Lithuania in March next year, because my contract ends then I don't want to be there anymore. I've completely closed myself off and feel really depressed. I don't have any goals or dreams in life. All I do, when I'm not working is, I listen to music or watch stuff on the internet. I always loved driving but even that doesn't give me any joy now. I was thinking, that I should try studying again, but I don't know what I want to do in life. I feel really down all the time and don't see any joy of life. I see this as a big problem and don't know how to pick myself up. Can someone help me with this?"
1939,Worrying about my son...,"Apologies for the randomness of this post.

My 18 year old son broke down on me the other night.  He said he was very stressed about his course load - he's a freshman in college.  Well, he was a freshman... he was struggling with his courses being online and remote - his mom and I let him drop two courses, and later that day he broke down again and asked if he could drop the other two.  So he's unenrolled.

He's actually stressed about life.  He doesn't know what he wants to do, school or career wise.  I don't know what to say to him - we want him to be happy, and to not worry about choosing the path for the rest of his life, at age 18.  Our public school system insisted that our children choose ""career electives"" as high school freshmen - I don't know of many 14 year olds that know what they want to do with life - our sons didn't -  maybe that's a failure on our part as parents.

He's indicated that he just doesn't care any more... about anything.  Two of his friends group have moved away to college, and two more that he worked with are in college locally and no longer at his workplace (a fast food restaurant) so he has no friends at work any more.  He has social anxiety and attempted suicide 4 years ago. He mostly wants to sleep; he does play an online game with his friends when he can.  His exercise is limited to a half hour to an hour daily, playing with our dogs outside. 

He spent the long weekend with his friend that came home from college.   I'm concerned that he's being very hard on himself - he says he hasn't been kicked out of his friends group, but he expects it.  We're going to Zoom-meet his psychiatrist tomorrow. 

I feel helpless - I want him to know that he's supported while we work through this pandemic and that he doesn't have to have a defined plan for the rest of his life - that he will find some purpose in his life sooner or later and that he can be content.  But I'm worried about him giving up again... that he doesn't understand we care about him and support him.

I'll stop and will ask for your ""I was lost and now am found"" examples, or any other wisdom."
1940,Need urgent help : girlfriend with BPD,"So I'm in an LDR and my gf shows a LOT of symptoms of BPD. One of them getting jealous TOO quickly. She gets jealous if I talk to someone, even if I'm talking to them for as little as few minutes. She gets so mad that she starts screaming that she hates me and how I'm a horrible person. She does this everytime and keeps spamming me. Once I got hurt from her mean comments and said that I'll get out of her life if she really wants that, she gave me self harm and suicide threats. I really really have no plans to let her go. She doesn't want me to talk to others but doesn't want me to ""not-talk"" to them either cuz it will make her look toxic even tho she can talk to whoever she wants. A similar episode happened just now and I srsly need help. She can't go to a therapist or something, please help me treat her right. I have already apologised multiple times to her but she thinks that I just don't understand."
1941,Why? Will it ever end?,"Why can't I just be normal? 

Why can't I go out and not nearly breakdown in the middle of the town?

Why can't I feel worthy of love? 

Why do my days have to consist of panic attacks and depression?

 Why have I forgotten how to love and feel attracted to no one?

Why every time someone says I'm a good person the noise in my head tell me I'm not?

 Why can't I go out and be fake most of the time put on a smile and pretend to be fine?

 Why does it feel like no body would ever understand me?

Why does it no matter how hard I try I end up back in the dark hole of despair?

Why do I feel like i'm not allowed to be liked by no one?

Why is my favourite part of the day the morning because for a few seconds I don't know who I am before it all comes flooding back.

Why can't I just say oh well everyone makes mistakes let's move on?

Why does spending time with the people I love feel like a chore? 

Why did everything I once enjoyed just seem so boring?

Why me why am I taught I need to be strong when all I want is to cry?

Why do I feel like I need to be fake for everyone?

but the pain is still there always there in the background waiting for me to slip up so it can grab hold of me.
Why the nightmares waking up at 3 with sweat around me just never ending darkness?  
Have I been faking it my whole life or not who the fuck am I? 

Why can't I do even the things which are really important I just sit there and act as if I'm ok when I'm clearly not?

Why did my pride have to get in the way when things were getting bad? 

Am I ever going to get better who knows I could live a life of pain but oh well at least there might be some days which are ok
Even the good days are filled with doubt and pain. 

Why can't I tell the difference between any feelings anymore they all feel the same. 
I feel like a husk of my former self just drifting day to day? 
The pain it won't go away the voices in my head will only ever stop when I'm asleep even then sometimes my dreams don't offer me a route of escape
I know I need help but I'm just so busy with shit in my life but when that stops I will phone my doctor and get the help I need hope that you guys can relate to this just needed an outlet of my stress and anger."

1944,Deteriorating Mental Health,"So with the state of current events in the world, I've had to spend a lot more time with myself than I prefer. And I have been unable to see my therapist. I only see therapists in person due to trust issues, but with the world situation therapists are no longer meeting people in person.

I'm starting to become tangled inside my own head. It seems like my depression and apathy are getting worse than they've ever been before, and parts of my personality that I've spent years burying are starting to creep back up.

last night I killed my sisters fish by pouring some bleach into the tank. The whole household, (apart from me) is currently away from home, visiting relatives.

Yes, I know, these actions are granting me a one way ticket to hell.

I don't regret killing the fish. My sister didn't take care of them the way she should have, often not feeding them, their tank becoming beyond disgusting, and just generally neglected them.

They did not deserve to die, but I felt like i wanted to do it anyways. and as i said, i don't regret killing the fish, the only thing that is making me feel bad about it is the risk that my family will find out they live with a monster.

---

In the past I've talked to my therapist about my desire to hurt people and animals. My therapist said that i can't be a sociopath or psychopath simply because i have an understanding of morals and what's right and wrong.   
but i don't think he understood what i was saying.   
while i do understand morality and ethics, i don't feel an innate natural desire to follow the common rules. ie. hurting people both physically and emotionally and physically hurting animals.   

---

I don't really know what to do with myself now. Even though they were only fish, i know that my sister had true feelings about them... She didn't want them to die, she just wanted them to live happy. and even though she neglected them, i know here feelings for them were there, but i killed them anyway. Only because i wanted to, it felt like something i needed to do.   

most people here will probly call me a piece of --shit-- and suggest that i rot in hell or put a bullet in my head, which to be fair, those people make a good point. I really do try to be a good person, following the common rules of morality   
&gt; Don't put others in harms way   
&gt; Don't hurt other people, physically or mentally/emotionally   
&gt; Always value an innocent life over my own   

the thing is though, i have broken these rules may times,   
driving while tipsy/high   
using dangerous tools while tipsy/high   
allowing my friends to drink and drive
hurting people emotionally, and toying with their mentality for fun   
manipulated people in ways that negatively affected them

1945,I have almost beaten my OCD,"I have almost beaten my OCD

I have struggled immensely with Pure-O for a long time. It's truly hell. It's like you have a monster living in your head that feeds and thrives off of your biggest fears and paranoia. I can't count how many times my OCD has put me in the darkest times of my life.

However, I have somehow been getting better and better. I didn't even reach out for professional help. Something clicked in my brain and I'm so happy it did. Each day is getting easier and more peaceful &lt;3 I can imagine that IF I had seeked treatment I would have felt the way I do now much sooner. 

It's not like I have recovered fully. I'm not even sure if that's possible with Pure Ocd. I think that we will always live with the unease that comes with it to a certain extent. But my mental state now versus when it was at its worst is worlds apart. Sure I might still live with this monster in my head, but I have kicked the shit out of it, and it's almost dead. It can still be there for all I care, as long as it doesn't ruin my well-being again. 

There is hope guys &lt;3 It's not easy to overcome this disorder, but it's sure as hell possible. If you haven't seeked out professional help, please please do. I promise it will be so worth it."
1946,Does anyone else really have trouble being able to react normally to some social situations?,"I'm not an introvert. Quite the contrary, actually. My issue isn't interacting with people I just don't experience emotions as intensely as they do or have the same thoughts a lot of the time. 

Let me give some examples. People will make jokes to me a lot that I simply won't catch onto. Fart jokes for instance. I'll be the only one in the car that will force a chuckle and just hold my breath because it's nothing but gross to me. Even when I'm the perpetrator I cannot laugh, I just get super embarrassed. 

I'm a male so you can see how that may cause some awkward scenarios. Also running with that theme, I don't think I react to things romantically like most men would. I'm not super defensive of my girlfriend. Random men will talk to her and if I wasn't at the time it won't bother me really. Honestly I think if she accidentally kissed some guy drunk I'd probably let it go and act as though nothing happened the next day. I just wouldn't feel the anger I know I'm  supposed to.

When I receive something I really like I appreciate it but I feel like I offend the person who gave it to me because my reaction is never ecstatic. When I got my first car I just gave my mom a hug. I loved the car, and I love my mom to death, I just don't have that energy I guess. 

I'm not depressed, I'm actually quite content in life. I have OCD I'm on lexapro for and it works pretty well but that's my only known mental issue. Might anyone else here have this socially inert sort of mentality I have? I'd love to hear your thoughts."
1947,Support animals,"Lately I've been feeling very bad and it keeps getting worse, my anxiety is taking over my life and I can't handle it.. I also have horrible mental health care in the place I live at the moment so I was wondering if getting a pet could help. I was taking care of a kitten for a while and I've noticed I felt so much better while he was around, but now I'm all alone so I don't feel too good anymore.. The problem is I'm too afraid to confront my family and roommate about this, I know getting a pet would make things difficult for me with them and I'm so anxious I feel stuck in place about it. Does anyone have any advice? Or experience with animals and mental health? I feel like people might think I'm just making an excuse to have a pet, but honestly I cry so much and feel so sad all day so I really think it could help me. While I took care of the kitten I didn't even have panic attacks anymore."
1948,My brain is turned off?,"So this is getting out of the hand tbh. I was struggling with depression 1 year ago and with a lot of help, I fought it off. But during that time, my brain just stopped working as it should. I couldn't focus and I still can't. There is nothing that can keep my focus. It seems like my brain is on autopilot ( don't know if this term is only used in league of legends ) and all things I do are automatic. There is no thought process of why am I doing it. I'm just simply doing it. There is also a weird feeling in the head. It feels like something is trying to push something. I struggle to solve even simple things fast, like 56+38. Before the depression, I was super smart and good at things I was doing. I get angry at very minor things and I always feel nervous"
1949,What would you do if your family believed you were not sick?,My family believes I am malingering.and has told me that I don't like myself or them and that is why I am sick. They don't believe that I am actually sick. They told me to stop playing acting like it was a game. My doctor's office has stated that I was doing it for attention and refused to adjust my medication when I told them I needed it. It was not until I wound up in a hospital  involuntarily that they changed my medication. My mother has also petitioned for me to go to the hospital when she was angry with me. The judge approved her petition because I had previously been hospitalized. When I was released she told me that she felt like I didn't need to be taking medication. She wants me to work in nursing but I tried explaining to her that I can't because of the previous involuntary commitments I wouldn't be able to obtain my license.
1950,Ranting,"tw, death threats, childhood trauma, potential suicide 






I hate this world and ignorant people so much.

Not long ago a vent artist left what looks to be a suicide note on his story, all because people took his vent art that looked like chi/d p/rn to them and attempted to ""cancel"" and harass him for doing so. Like straight up fucking death threats without even trying to understand his situation, sure, maybe his art may need warnings but that doesn't condone the shit  other people had done. 

He has DID and the alter they're horribly harassing is a fucking child. He told multiple times for them to leave him alone and to block him if his content bothers them. He never intended for them to be sexual, everyone just overlooked how serious his trauma is and blatantly threatened to even doxx him. 

Now that he may be actually be fucking dead, people finally decided to give a fuck. Both his partner and himself said not to dm him asking if he was fine after so much drama, well they still ignored it anyways."
1951,I feel so depressed,"I feel so depressed I have no desire to eat and I spend most my time sleeping. I’ll get high and go to sleep and do it all over again. I don’t wanna die but sometimes the pain just gets too much that I think to die would be easier to ease the suffering. It’s this emptiness and hollowness on the inside, the heaviness in my chest, it hurts and I am so overwhelmed at how I’m going to manage getting through each day. 

So. Fucking. Tired.. but I’m scraping in there and hanging in there."
1952,Why do my grades have to matter more than me?,Why. Why does the letter C have to matter more than me wanting to die. What’s the fucking point of doing good in school to have a “good life and be successful” when I can’t even take care myself already??
1953,I think I am becoming depressed,"Last month I got to hear that my graduation project fell through thanks to the changes brought to the internship with Corona as main factor. During the week before the final draft, I also went sick, my body feels stress heavily while my mind doesn't. I got a call from one of my professors that they cancelled my project anyhow, one day after I uploaded my final paper. 

I am 24 (M) at the moment and wanted to graduate so bad. My dad has lost all faith in me and treats me like shit now, I get it somehow, all my friends are buying their own houses and apartments and I am just sitting at home, searching for student work. I did have some proper job interview for real work, but all fell through when I mention that I still haven't got my degree. 

To feel a bit better, I started to lose weight, was slightly overweight and trying to lose some kilos. This was what kept me going through the last weeks, but now with my weightloss, my mom and sister starts to hate on me because it isn't the right way to lose weight. 

Recently I can't fall asleep, stay awake till an hour of 4-5, sometimes even skip a night or two and my sex drive is gone. At the moment I don't know what to do of what to feel, but I feel a bit empty inside. Have been avoiding my friends and family, because I can't be bothered and am having really bad mood swings. I am sometimes near to crying, but I just hold it down. 

A couple of years ago, I had the same feeling as now and  I started to self medicate with alcohol, like 2 bottles of port a day (cheapest for amount of alcohol), I don't want to go back to that state. 

I am thinking about seeing a gp or a psychologist, but I am afraid that being diagnosed with depression or some mental illness will make my family and friends even more judgemental or I feel like disappointing them."
1954,My ptsd was triggered last night,"When I was in college about 6 years ago I was raped. This was before I went on birth control. Long story short I was on my period the night I was raped and it was the first few days of it so it was really heavy. The next morning I walked through campus with blood seeped shorts and blood down the side of my inside of my legs... 

Fast forward to last night, I was having sex with one of my friends who tbh I was actually starting to like which is rare.... well I got my period during sex which usually isn’t a big deal but it was bad. I got an IUD after the incident in college so I never get my period or it’s just spotting/light. I was bleeding everywhere it was all over my legs etc and it just triggered me. I have been triggered during sex before and I’ve dealt with it for so long I can usually come back to the present but I couldn’t and I’m still struggling to. 

I don’t know how to proceed. He was really nice and so good about it but I feel like I ruined everything. I didn’t want to tell him I was raped but I need him to know it’s not his fault."

1957,advice,"i'm a 15 year old girl who is struggling a lot right now, and need some help. i have severe anxiety that affects my thinking daily. my parents are incredibly strict. as in ignore all signs that their teenager is having problems strict. as in devout christian, strict. as in i'm not allowed to do anything, strict. i'm not christian. my parents are both verbally and mentally abusive. i have struggled with suicide and cutting for the past few years. after telling my parents, they said that they would only let me go to christian counselling. food for thought: i am atheist, closeted-lesbian, and not interested in being ""converted"" or told that God will save me and deal with all of my problems. I've already tried that. for my entire life. Didn't work. only messed me up more. i don't have access to therapy anywhere else. i don't know what to do and how to get help. my parents aren't interested in helping me unless its sending me to church. what should i do? i don't have a lot of access to technology, and i have one trusted adult in my life who is willing to help me with whatever i need. what should i do?"
1958,Hold mean things back in a relationship,"I'm seeking already a therapist for professional and regular advice and sessions, but it is taking a long time and I need to improve myself NOW. I would like to know what therapy I'd need in your opinion (today I had a meeting with a therapist and she's suggesting me CBT..someone else told me I might have BPD..) but let's get to the story..

I (30) am in a relationship with a girl (24) and I do love her.

Though, we have been fighting a lot, since a long time, I know I want to make our relationship work, as I know part of the problem is surely mine.

I don't want to discuss what her part is, as I'm seeking strictly actionable advice on how to stop my toxic behavior of breaking up (this is the most important) and becoming avoidant or verbally hurtful during our fights.

It makes her insecure, and she's a very insecure person already, so this trait and behavior of mine will surely not help her to grow strong, to feel safe in our relationship, and eventually to bring me also the peace I need to have a healthy relationship with her, but also with myself as it is making me sad.

This fighting pattern is something I have since forever, and it's most probably related to the way I'd fight with my mother, as we'd get into fights and never talked it through, and stay apart for days, even when living in the same house.

This relationship is making me very sad, and I'm part of the problem, and this sadness is not allowing me to enjoy my life anymore, which is also a reason why I get so stressed that then I react so brutally. Still, I don't want to justify my behavior, but I know that I've lots of issues around my life caused by me, by her, and by other circumstances.

It's a hard habit I've to break, but what can I do? Any actionable steps I can start taking? What might be the cause of such behavior?

I want to fix this relationship, and soon, because if it ends, it will leave me with a deep sense of regret and sorrow, that will make me pitiful in the long-term. Things heal, sure, but deep down I'd always be feeling like a piece of shit, if this love ends for this behavior.

Thanks!"
1959,I don't know how to deal with the remembered memories,"Tw: therapy/parents/childhood memories 

So after a complete and utter breakdown, meds, being sectioned and finally getting a diagnosis, I am seeing a therapist for weekly sessions.
I started these session with the mindset of ""well my parents were fine, so it's nothing to do with them"" but the more I've talked the more has surfaced about my past and now it's come out, I feel like I've just been left with this information I have no idea how to process. Ignorance was bliss.

I was in no way abused, at all, so I even feel bad posting this, as I know there are people in this thread who were so I feel bad complaining too.

In therapy I was talking about how we were poor, but it was OK.
Then we got talking about my baby brother who died at 22 hours old, and I was talking about how my parents told me he never existed, even though I remember him and my mothers pregnancy.
Then I was talking about how my parents sent me to weightwatchers at 11.
Then we were talking about how my parents would give me fines for things, like my mother would do my washing for me, as a child, and if I had discharge in my underwear, I would get a fine and have to pay her.
Then we talked about how I was always told they wished I was another child, they used to tell me which children they wished I was like.
Then we talked about how I could never really guess what mood they would be in when I got home from school, sometimes they would just be so mad at me, or other times they were my best friend. I never knew what I was coming home to, or how they would react to something. It was actually really confusing. 
They were also devoutly Catholic, and I was sent to Catholic school which I hated, and the strict Catholic views were taught at home too. 

It's not abuse, but suddenly I feel like the relationship I had with my parents had all changed, and I just don't know what to do. I feel all messed up inside now. All these things were deeply buried inside me and now they are out and I feel like it's tarnish everything.

I'm not even sure I'm looking for advice, I think I just needed to tell someone. It's like it's all bunched in my head now and I have just been handed this information and I don't know what to do with it."
1960,For the first time I’ve been able to,"For the first time in years I’ve been able to pick myself up from a negative point of view. Backstory: A month ago I returned to work after 5 months of furlough. Furlough helped. to process, self assess and take action. I am depressed and didn’t even realise it after years of feeling seriously dark stuff. 

I’ve had a really shit day today yet for the first ever time I’ve been able to pick myself up and move on without getting anxious and depressive. 

In my case a mixture of reflecting has enabled me to be a happier person to my girlfriend. My work, and to myself. 

Sometimes. Having time to think can make take you from complete despair to a sensible, happy person. 

I beg of you all to do that for yourself. We don’t all have the pleasure of getting 5 months but get out of your routine, take time for yourself, go and do something you enjoy and go and think about shit. Come back and be a happier person every time. 

I love you all."
1961,Diagnosed with PTSD but I think it could be schitophrenia.,"My Dr has diagnosed me with PTSD.  Ive been reading a lot about psychotic episodes lately because I have them extremely frequently only with down times of a day or two.  My Dr knows about the episodes.  But I don't think the takes me seriously when I try  to express how bad all my symptoms are.  I cannot for the life of me do any work because the voices are so distracting.  And I can't help believing everything they say even though I know I shouldn't.  It's always degrading to me, and it's always in the voice of someone I know, and I always feel certain it's actually how those people feel about me.

I was casually reading about the different conditions that cause them, just out of curiosity, not intending to self-diagnose.  I'm no expert and don't know how to separate the descriptions of symptoms from the psychotic episodes from schitzo symptoms but I do know that the majority of my problems started around the age of 20 (or maybe 19) - I had some symptoms prior to then but I started with all the really bad stuff at that age.  My grandfather also suffered from very similar symptoms to my own (voices that he couldn't not believe, self isolating, and much of the rest).  I also have a lot of sensitivity to loud sounds an bright light and can only work on a computer where all backgrounds is very dark blue or black.  And any bright white windows I have to close or minimize, and just open to refer to then minimize them again.  My partner often speaks loudly or is very loud for the first few words speaking loudly and I cannot stand it it makes me do a severe cringe where I try very hard to lower the volume with my mind every time.  I much prefer soft voices, and my hearing is just fine so why do you need to raise your voice like that when I'm right beside you or only a few feet away?"
1962,"Where has my ambition gone? I used to be very motivated and ready to fight for the best grades years ago, but since 7 years it's been downhill all the time","So far that right now I am completely happy if I just have my daily dose of Fast Food and TV

I always wanted to be the best of the class ""to prove others wrong"", but since I actually became ""the best of the class"" and thus have proven ""others wrong"" my motivation and ambitions have been falling and falling down

Now although I am in the lower third of my group (studying right now) I don't care about it, i don't know but I am literally like ""as long as I have my daily dose of Cola and Fast-Food I don't fcking care about it""

It's like I don't have an internal motivation to do anything at all, not even studying something other, not even achieving a career, or becoming perfect in a hobby or something. I literally just want to chill and nothing more

No, I don't take any drugs, I don't even drink alcohol and I also don't feel depressed, I'm actually enjoying life very much, it's actually the problem that I can enjoy life too easily lol

The funny thing is that sometimes very seldomly I get these spikes of ""spite"" or how it is called and get super motivated like in the past, you know this feeling of HAVING to prove others wrong. But unlike in the past when I've felt like that for 24/7 I maybe feel like that for an hour and then I just think to myself ""Fck it I don't have to prove anything to others etc""

What can I do to ""come back"" to the state and mentality I had seven years ago?"
1963,The drive through that gave me a will to live.,As a sixteen year old kid I know I have no right to feel the way I have been. In all honesty my life is pretty perfect. Yet here I am. One a day filled with these episodes where my heart rate reaches about 160 it last a minute or two until I black out. Anyways onto the story. So after laying in bed wanting to disappear I decided fuck it I’ll go to Andy’s (our local icecream shop) and get some icecream like the depressed fuck I am. So I go to get my icecream and I have this kid all the cash j had on me as a tip I mean after all it’s just money. I pull up to the window and everyone knows me turns out they were kids from my high and as stupid as it sounds in that monument seeing those faces  my heart filled with joy I felt almost happy for once. In life it’s the little things that get me by. I don’t expect anyone to read this but if you did I hope your mental health is far better than mine❤️
1964,What am I dealing with?,For years I’ve pushed away my emotions and finding happiness in making others laugh. And I’ve often been able to not deal with emotions as they’ve never played a big part in my life. Now I find myself getting irritated and then it will lead to a depression if I can call it that. I know depression is a long lasting thing however these are short episodes where I’ll get very twitch and hyper aware yet spacey all at once and then this not sadness but an empty feeling. I’m not suicidal but I often find myself praying to be taken from this earth(I’m not super religious ether). For the first time I’ve told my parents and reached out for help they only know about my panic attacks because after a car accident that should’ve killed me they often worry as it only happened a week ago. That in its own has caused me more issues but that is a different story any hell would be more appreciated than you know. Thank you for your time
1965,I weaned off my lexapro I’ve been on for 5 years because it was triggering manic episodes and now I’m depressed and nothing feels like it’ll ever be balanced,That’s it that’s the vent. On lexapro I’m manic without lexapro I’m in a depression cave. I feel like I always get the worst side effects when trying to up meds or attempting new combos and I’m so tired of feeling like nothing will ever work.
1966,My Mental Health Struggles in 2020 (so far),"Hi there, I wrote [a little blog post](https://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/depression-in-2020/) summarizing my own struggles as a result of isolation and this whole year, with the hope that just sharing and being open about it might help others in a similar place keep working through it.

1967,How do you deal with overthinking or what do you do to take your mind off of things?,"I’ve been really overthinking and having a bad time latley and I can’t seem to do anything to change the subject. I would usually play some video games or something, but it’s jsut making me kind of stressed and i just don’t want to play them. I really don’t know what to do and I thought if someone could share their own coping mechanisms, I could try them out."
1968,Is it wrong of me to argue or fight back my Schizophrenic mother?,"I have been patient with my mother ever since she relapsed in July but not only has it been getting worse, she has also been getting in between what I do, play, who I talk with and where I go. I tried to get her admitted but the hospital denied it due to Covid. I am just not sure on how to handle her anymore and her interference with my life is just becoming a hassle to the point that I end up fighting back both verbally and physically when she does the same....."
1969,I’m never going to be perfect.,"I’ve got back into school, and I feel like shit. I feel so stupid and talentless. Everyone seems to be better than me and I just want to be perfect. I’ve had this feeling for ages, but it’s just getting worse. I used to enjoy singing, having hobbies. I enjoyed going to school (to an extent), but now I just can’t. It’s like watching everyone else succeed, while you get worse and worse and leave you behind. I feel everyone staring at me. I feel the teachers disappointment in me. I feel the pathing from my family. Why couldn’t I have just been born perfect. Smarter, happier, talkative, caring, talented. But I’m not any of those, and now I’m just sitting around wallowing, while my mocks creep up on me. It’s so shut knowing this, then being even more imperfect. I gained tics 6 months ago, and they haven’t stopped. My family think I’m liars. And the kids at school probably do too. My life is so fucked. Why does it always have to be me who ends up with the short straw. Why couldn’t I just be perfect. I want to be perfect, I’d let someone else suffer, just to get the chance to be perfect. I don’t know why I’m so selfish, why I don’t care when my friends cry. Why I only care about myself. I’m not perfect, but I just want to be. If I had an explanation to why I felt this way. I can’t be depressed, as my mother seems to have diagnosed me herself, so I’m not getting help, but maybe if I did, I would have been closer to perfect than I am now."

1971,Breaking down. I'm stuck and I feel paralyzed.,
1972,I feel like an impostor.,"I was bullied a lot as a child and it ravaged my mental health. I was passively suicidal for 5 years, I was experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety (chronic stomachaches), I was severely dissociating and living in a daydream most of the time, my self-esteem was non-existent and I hated myself, and the list goes on.

I didn't get to see a therapist until much later. By that time I had recovered a lot, but I never got a formal ""label"" for the symptoms I was experiencing when I was younger. (Sadly enough, when I did try to get a ""label,"" the therapist I saw at the time said it was just a label and doesn't define me. I'm sure she was right in a way, but that did not make me feel too great.) 

I care a lot about fighting mental illness stigma because it made me suffer in silence for a lot of my life, but I don't know where I belong. I know I'm not untouched by mental health problems, but I don't want to speak over other people with more mental health symptoms than me. I feel like an impostor no matter where I go.  

I want to feel like I'm being genuine, but I don't even know how to be genuine with myself completely. Any advice for my extremely specific conflict?"
1973,Living in a Toxic Household and Attending Zoom School of Law,"This is my first time posting here and I guess I just need some support/advice.

I have anxiety and ADHD, which already makes law school hard as it is. And recently, I had to move back to my childhood home because of COVID, which is making it even harder to focus on school.

My mental health has seriously declined since coming back. I grew up in an abusive household and I feel like I’m reliving a lot of my childhood trauma. I also get into arguments on a daily basis with my parents, they constantly gaslight me, and they refuse to believe I have disabilities (the denial is a cultural thing). 

I’m trying to save my money by staying here instead of moving back to NY and paying astronomical prices towards rent. But at what cost? I’m having a really hard time living here and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Should I just take the financial risk and move out? 

What would you do?"
1974,What's wrong with me?,"First of all I should say that my English is not that great. So if I make any mistakes I'm sorry. I am 24 years old and a male. I never channeled myself  

I want to know what is wrong with me. I am a very silent guy. I don't speak not even with my family. I speak with my mom only like 3 or 4 times a day. Sometimes none. I don't know why but when I'm alone I m abnormal like talking weirdly to myself and flamming other people I hate. I have a very explosive anger. Even for small things I get angry explosively. When I get angry I always smash things. I also do self harm not that much but when I'm greatly angry and sad I do that. There was one or two times I got very much angry towards my friends. I never cut myself but I punch very hardly to hard surfaces. I once bitten my own hand and for 5 months I couldn't feel anything on the area I have bitten. I feel worthless almost everyday...I'm not a guy who has everything. I'm short af and no one likes me that much. I have 2 or 3 friends who knows me very well like friends since school but not even a single one starting a single conversation with me. I know that I have to make initiation but they never make initiation for me. Not even a hi. I don't feel that much in a situation where I should be sad or happy. I should note that I smoke weed and cigarettes every day because of this. I use it as an escape. I did hard drugs 4 or 5 times and I like using them in future because it gives me euphoria and good escape from my problems. I have a depression but I don't know to what extent. I feel deeply sad about everything of my life..there was one or two times I felt like I need to die..i have mood swings almost everyday  but im always sad and hate myself and others..I'm only happy when I'm high or watch something I like. when I m with my friends (which I call them and ask to hangout with them. They never call me to come) for that moment I temporarily forget my problems. The only reason I hangout with them is to smoke. Nothing else. And I don't care about them. I cant maintain a relationship. I always rushing things and never plan ahead. I waste money without any thought. I always like to get something from someone rather than earning it by myself. I started to hate my friends.sometimes I think of doing things to them like hitting them or hurting  them. But I can never bring myself to do it in real life. I lack common social ethics like talking with someone, thanking someone etc. I don't have words to maintain a good conversation.i always have to search Google for common human things. I don't know what should I do !!! I'm very lost at the moment and I don't care about my future even though I have plans to make money and living comfortably. Please help."

1976,I let my mental health ruin my family (wife and daughter),"Growing up i was treated as a disappointment and failure by my dad because I could never meet his standards. The phrase of ""i thought you were smarter than that"" still plagues me to this day. I didnt have a childhood with my father and my mother was the only one to comfort me growing up. As time went out any time i felt like i was doing well I somehow managed to fuck it up. Whether it be grades, my high school relationship, almost getting kicked out of college, becoming dependent on alcohol even though i said id never be like my father, or even now ruining my marriage with my wife and thus ruining her life. Looking back i cannot find any logical reason for all of a sudden doing things completely out of character that would make me unhappy and ruin my life. I had so many things going right for me but randomly do things that topple everything ive built. With my marriage its because I said terrible things about her to other women, making her seem terrible and then telling these other women I had feelings for them when that wasn't the truth. I was happy with my wife and although she dealt with mental health that I helped her get through i never spent time getting the help I needed. I take responsibility for what ive done regardless of what mindset I was in but I just don't know what to do. I live at in military base housing and she left eith our daughter back home 1000 miles away. Due to covid restrictions I can't even leave the state and she wants to get a divorce. I did not even sleep with anyone else but the damage had been done. Now she pours her pain onto social media and i am a joke to everyone. All i feel is pure regret. I hated myself since day one of talking to other people but couldn't find a way to stop. I wish i could give her a real reason like I was unhappy or I didn't love her to make this easier for her but that just isn't the truth. I had been doing this for some time now but had begun to stop recently about a month or two before she looked through my phone and found it all. I want to get better and I am seeking counseling but I find myself hopelessly lost with my wife. Some days we can talk to each other like nothing has happened and suddenly the conversation just becomes her reminding me how terrible i am. All she has to rely on back home is her friends and remaining family and i physically cannot go over there to help. I want to fix all of this regardless if it takes my entire lifetime but she keeps reminding me nothing will ever make her want to get back with me because now she can't believe a word I say. I dont know if this is a vent session or plea for help anymore but all I know is I have to keep working every day to be there for my daughter. She is just a baby but even now I will have even less time to spend with her because of military. Im sorry for rambling."
1977,Working Medicine and Improvemengs,I have finally been on working meds now for about 3 months now and it took a while to get here. Everything just seems so much more positive and like it's easier to be positive. I have major depression. Unfortunately due to covid I cant work on things that I'd like to improve (mainly social life). I just dont really have anyone to share this with. It feels weird being like this like being able to think faster and control my thoughts better. Medicine is really doing a lot of the heavy lifting here.
1978,"Should I try going to college, in my condition? TLDR At bottom","I've been an NEET for an year now, and it's the third, or fourth time I've ended up at home in my life (all physical symptoms due to mental breakdowns I believe, my memory is bad), I haven't been to an actual school in years, just tuitions, and exams. I have zero social life, and ignore anyone approaching me.

I have up, and down moods alot(my mental problems are beyond me to explain), I don't like being around people alot most of the time, when forced to go out, I end up so so exhausted beyond my limits. I won't kill myself, but if I were to rather wait until I'm distant enough from everyone in far future so no family members work gets disrupted.

Usually only music, and maybe anime, or so calms me, but even with that most times I just go eh I don't wanna do anything, especially not work, or study.  And even have to force myself to do ""pleasurable things""

A couple days ago, both my mom, and dad approached me, and asked me if I'd like to go to either tuition, or college to study? I was wondering, if a yes was warranted in my situation.

They don't know too much about my mental state except for my physical symptoms driven from mental problems (which I take medication for), and maybe that I'm sad or down from my facial expressions (which I fake now because of that lol), or that have alot of anxiety issues.

TLDR: I'm a NEET, hate interactions, and everything, have extensive mental issues (resulting in physical symptoms too), I can't do anything at the moment, even enjoyable things"

1980,Can a doctor diagnose my behavior?,"First real quick, its great that people are getting help somesomething free like reddit. This is more of me being curious.

Basically I think I'm a minor narcissist and wanted to know if im on base on that.

I'm extremely confident in very specific areas. I happen to be very confident in my ability to use my brain for things like debates or puzzles, and generally do well, reinforcing that idea. But the things I'm not confident in, not only do I concede those with no problem at all, but I also take pride in the fact that I was able to recognize that. (I know this is basically just pride hidden in fake humility) I do not believe I am disillusioned with the world, I think I see reality as it is, and not through a filter of me being the best. Exp.) Im open about the fact that I think im smarter than most of my friends but when someone demonstrates they know way more about something than me, I am very comfortable saying they are smarter than me on that. I have lost 2 friends as a result of this but when we talked about it, they could not give specific scenarios where I wasn't actually correct. 

This leads me to believe its my attitude about my confidence that they were upset about. This, itself, is something I'm personally patting myself on the back for figuring out myself, which contributes to the overall point of this post. I have the social wherewithal to recognize and stop doing that in all facets of life besides debates. 

Ig my main question is do you think I have something wrong with me because I need that consistent gratification, and if I don't get it from other people I need to suck my own dick about how much smarter I am than the average person. Or is this just something most people have and aren't as open about it?"

Homeschooled, i listen to heavy metal music, grew up in a fairy stable environment (not too spoiled, not neglected, pretty normal home), and i, for some reason, have really bad explosive anger outbursts. Example, if something is a slight inconvenience to me it can seriously piss me off and throw me into utter rage. I often find myself being conscious of the fact that i’m in a full on rage, but if i tell myself to “calm down” that just makes it worse. The idea of calming down when i’m angry just makes me lose it even more. Anything that’s happy at all annoys me when i’m having one of these episodes. If someone hurts me, i will often find myself fantasizing about hurting them. (I would never take action). Normally, when i’m having these episodes I’m extremely silent and i isolate myself and i just ignore people if they talk to me. It feels like a constant inner battle and i’m sick of not having control over my emotions. I do not feel very much empathy at all towards humans, however i do for some reason have it towards animals. My pet cat is my best friend :). Also it would be good to point out that it’s not just common anger or frustration that i feel during these episodes. It’s full on psychotic rage. Is there something wrong with me? Is it just an inflated ego or may it be something more serious like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia? I have been diagnosed with Aspergers in the past so that’s what i connected it to at first but it just feels like something more. Appreciate it if you take the time to try and help me. Thanks"
1982,Should I seek professional help after a breakup,[removed]
1983,Need advice for supporting my friends,"I have two best friends that have a lot of trauma, which manifests itself in a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms. They’ve both really been struggling in their personal lives as well as with the state of the world currently. I love them dearly and want to be there for them, but it can be very draining and often pulls me back into a harmful mental state. Is there a way to set boundaries with them for my own mental health, but then also support them? I just feel so guilty when I need space from them because I feel like I’m not being a good friend. Does anyone else also struggle with this? Any advice would be much appreciated."
1984,All the mentally ill people you have encountered through life,"Do you ever think back through childhood to present and question why there’s so many people on this planet that are not well mentally.. 

I remember teachers, relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues... 
are we all just not well?, is that what life is about?.. just not being well in our own unique way but living to deal with it the best that we can?"
1985,Does the national helpline do anything besides make things worse?,"Honestly fuck these people.  Went to a clinic, they wouldn’t even see me.  They gave me a number for some random ass place and said it was another facility.  I’ve tried everything.  What else can I do besides die.  Is there a drug that makes me fall asleep have a nice dream and just not wake up?"
1986,Boyfriend is severely depressed and I don't know how to help,"My boyfriend's \[24M\] depression has worsened over the year to where he now freely describes a desire to kill himself, frequently locks himself in the spare room, does not eat or bathe without pressure/assistance, and has mental breakdowns 2 to 3 times a week. He has finally agreed to seek therapy, but his attitude is pretty pessimistic about the whole thing.

I'm stressed 24/7 about him. I worry about his health and if he will harm himself. Neither logic nor emotional comfort helps him. I just don't know what to do. How do I help? I know I can't ""fix"" him, but there has to be something where I don't live constantly wondering ""did he lock himself in the room to kill himself?"" or ""what will trigger a breakdown today?""

I honestly, if I could convince him, think it would be best if he went back home to live with his parents. Then they could feed and care for him while he gets therapy. He could also get a therapist that is covered by insurance and more readily available (Rather than the free service he signed up for that only allows one to two appointments a month). I also think he should take the semester off of school or work. He does not like these ideas, though.  

Just, what do I do? How do I reason with him?"
1987,Voices and Images Falling Asleep.,"I was under some stress and started having problems with anxiety attacks. I felt physically exhausted at the time too. I went and had several medical tests done and everything came back normal. I was given a prescription for anxiety attacks as needed. 

Currently I struggle with anxiety still. Some days aren't as bad as others. What concerns me is when I fall asleep or wake up I'll hear voices and sounds. Sometimes I'll see images with my eyes closed. This has me worried that something more serious is going on. I've never had any mental health issues in the past and I'm almost 40. I had a mental health assessment and was referred to counseling. Others have mentioned about hypnagogic hallucinations and they're normal. Has anyone else experienced this?"
1988,"Has anyone got a diagram of the effects anxiety/panic does to your body, getting ready for fight or flight etc, all the symptoms. I could print off please, struggling with panic here today, sorry to ask",Any good links or files to print off are greatly appreciated
1989,I'm not okay and I need help.,"I've been pretending to be fine for a long time, but I really need to face the fact that I'm just fucking not anymore. I've tried to fix myself on my own, and it doesn't work. I can't get the help I need to get where I live and I just really don't know what to do.


I currently live in Vermont, isolated from absolutely everything. I've been an inpatient at Dartmouth Hitchcock before, but just a temporary stay isn't what I need. I know that just getting a push in the right direction is never going to be enough for me, at least not anytime soon.


I don't really want to vent or go into too much detail about what's wrong with me, because that's not what will help me right now. Instead, I want to ask if anyone knows of a place anywhere in the US, preferably close to Vermont, but at this point whatever needs to happen needs to happen, where it's an extended stay inpatient facility with access to therapy session and socialization and job placement, a place to stay until life is actually stable and I'm not just relying on a tiny piece of positive momentum. I don't even know if it's a thing, but I don't think anything else can help me anymore, I know I sure can't help myself."
1990,"Just a quick question here, what are the signs that someone needs a therapist?",As the title says pretty much. Just been wondering about this for a while.
1991,I am lost in my head and torn between two different personalities,"I really don't want to sound like a victim, and I ain't one. But I feel myself going further and further down two roads that seperate. I've just started at a new highschool and I am very happy that I get a new chance to create a brand new picture of myself. Sadly those goals are slowly fading, because I am stuck between two personalities. 

One side of me is open, polite, kind and happy, whilst the other is more dark. I sometimes get this phase where I get very cynical, sarcastic, indifferent and dare I say nihilistic. I am bitter and sad, aswell as a jerk (not always, only in worse cases). I am stuck between what I want to be, that is: Charismatic, open and kind. Though it's not an easy thing to change, especially  when I've been the sad personality most my life. I feel uncomfortable when I try to be this happy and open person, but I want to be like that. I feel as if I can't, because people don't change. A person can not *truly* change, only pretend. I don't feel like pretending anymore, I just don't feel happy. Believe it or not, I am more happy when I am in my indifferent personality.

I haven't been to a doctor, and I don't believe I have som sort of personality disorder, I just act under false pretenses. There is also a chance that I have cancer, a miniscule chance but a chance none the less. This made me think about how meaningless it all actually is. Life is always a temporary thing, but knowing that my time might be shorter than I think made me realise that no matter what I'll do, I'm fucked. I just feel mentally tired all the time, I got so much shit going on in my head that I can't concentrate. I day dream all the time, of the ideal life that won't ever exist. That is all meaningless knowing I'll never experience those things in my dreams. But it's the only salvation I've got. 

I don't want to sound like some pityful emo that thinks he's a victim. But I've started with self-harm as some sort of relief, I don't know why but the stinging sensation of a whip against my back or a light slice with a knife is something that somehow fills me with joy and excitement. It might be the thrill that does that. 

Sometimes I believe that death is a far better fate than a painful life. In some situations I like the pain, It fascinates me, I've always been afraid of pain when I was a kid. And rightfully so, it's what makes life difficult. But without pain life isn't worth it. Without difficulty life isn't fun. Pain is fun, and life is pain.(sorry for this rant)

I just want to know if anybody has any advice regarding my personality situation?"
1992,I thought i got better,"I had a dream that i was in a room full of mirrors. Just all me staring right back no matter where i looked. And i smashed every single one of them to pieces. I recognised myself more in a shattered mirror than i recognis the person staring right back at me. 

All you cause is pain. Pain and suffering to those around you. You push people away because you’re afraid. Afraid that one day they will leave you. And no matter what you do. No matter how hard you try they always will. Either through broken relationships. Distance. Or death. Everyone always leaves.  It’s been the only constant in your life. 

I resent you and everything you are. Your just like that shattered mirror. Bits and pieces of people you’ve picked up along the way. Maybe that’s your way of not leaving them behind. 

You aren’t yourself. You never have been. 

I’m mean shit you’ve pushed so many people away i don’t think you know how it feels to be liked. People say they love you but they don’t really like you. And neither do you. You’ve become a tolerable person.

You don’t even know what to do anymore when people show you affection. Earlier in the car you almost broke. Nobody has done that in such a long time or even anything close to that. Same with the hug. If you keep people at an arms distance you’re fine. But once people get closer you completely drop your guard. And it never goes well

You’d rather be known as an asshole rather than someone with friends. To some people being lonely is scary because they have no one. But to you it’s great. Because then you can’t let anyone down and you don’t have to live up to their expectations of what you would or wouldn’t do. 

I regret hurting people. But it’s really for the best for them and yourself. It helps you keep a distance and it also helps them because you just leave a path of destruction wherever you go. You can’t hurt people as much if they are not emotionally connected"
1993,Do I have depression?,"I think I'm suffering from depression or something similar, but I don't wanna label it until I got more information and opinions. Keep in mind please I'm only asking on here because no one would be willing to take me to get it diagnosed by a professional.

It's on and off, but I go through long periods of time where I got no energy to do anything regardless of the amount of sleep I got. Anything that I found funny, entertaining, or interesting don't really excite me. Typically, I'm the type of person who finds everything funny and constantly make the most stupidest jokes but lately I've rarely make any jokes, and when I do it's to keep people from (mainly my mom) asking me if I'm okay. I don't really have an appetite and I started giving up on my personal hygiene, and I'm pretty insecure and paranoid of what people think of me. Lately I barely remember anything also. I used to be pretty decent at remembering stuff, but now I'm lucky if I remember where I put my glasses. I don't really want to sleep either and force myself to stay awake until my body just shuts down and my head jolts backwards.

Any information, ideas, or ways to help with whatever I'm going through would be really helpful and appreciative."
1994,Hallucinations? Or?,"So! I am curious about if what I'm experiencing is a hallucination or not. 

Essentially,  I'll see things out of the corner of my eye, like people walking, (usually shadow-like) or something moving around.  

If I look directly at these things I'm thinking I've seen, they aren't there. 

An example was yesterday,  I was waiting in the car and watching a movie.  In my peripheral vision, I thought a man in a white and red plaid dress top was stood beside the car window. I looked up, and nobody was around whatsoever. (This is a time where it's not a shadow, but there is detail,  like the shirt/hand)

Are my eyes playing tricks? Or should I be concerned"
1995,I just accidentally watched something that I didn’t mean to tw: harmful behaviors,"So this month is Suicide month (obviously). Last Tuesday I attempted. If got too much. Now today, almost a week later I was on tiktok and that video of that person who committed played. Now I’m triggered and I feel like I can’t breathe. I feel nothing (I have felt nothing for 6 months now). Now I’m hearing voices telling me to die. During the video I was smiling and then it happened. I immediately felt even more of nothing and now I want to cry but nothing is coming out. Did I just attempt today after that video? Yes. Will I go get help? No. I can’t. I’m fine now. Just 2020 is so hard. So hard. I should probably end this vent now since I think I’m disassociating again. I want to feel normal again."
1996,Something is wrong but I don't know what.,"So this might be long but this has been going on for a while now for no apparent reason I can put my finger on.

I am a master's student abroad away from my parents and family for a year now. I talk to them everyday and live with my gf in Berlin. 
No major tragedy has happened in my life that I can point at and say made me start feeling like this. However for the past 3 months now I always have sad and weird thoughts like nothing is going to work out in my life. Happiness is all but gone from my emotions and all the things which used to excite and inspire me just don't. It's like a lost feeling. I have started sleeping long hours and putting of things I should be doing.

I tried focusing on some of my hobbies but i just can't put my concentration on anything as of now. I tried talking to my gf about it and she says that I am just overthinking in my mind. She might be right but this feeling different than overthinking and it is actually starting to mess with my functionality.

I have been trying to get some part time or student job to keep myself busy but can't seem to find anything. My parents are not talkative type and don't want to burden them with my troubles as they might worry and can't even travel because of the virus. It would be really helpful to hear someone else's opinion on this and what I can do to make some positive changes.

Thanks for listening."
1997,title,[removed]
1998,My mental health caused me to lose a loved one and I don’t know what to do.,"Hello, I am a 26 year old man. Who just recently allowed his unchecked mental illness to cost him the best friendship he’s ever had in his entire life. Allow me to explain. If you want to skip right to the actual story I will leave it very spaced out and easy to find in this wall of text.

So I’ve recently come to the conclusion that it is highly likely I have some level of bipolar disorder. Just to be clear, I’m not self diagnosing and I have an appointment on Tuesday to seek professional diagnosis. However after what happened this past couple weeks and upon looking into bipolar disorder; it’s symptoms and what it’s patients go through. Waaaaaaaay too much of my life made sense almost immediately. 

Ever since I was a teenager I’d have bouts of crazy depression lasting weeks-months that it would seem I would suddenly snap out of for no reason. Then it would seem some time down the road I would have bouts where I either 

A) am extremely productive, start several projects, pick up new hobbies, deep clean everything, do more work in less time at work, etc. 
B) become extremely irritable, I’ve constantly been asked why I’m pacing or if I need to do something. Will communicate or express opinions in a way where it’s almost a wall of sound that can’t be stopped even though that’s not my intention, I’ve had people get upset that “you were yelling at me” even though to me I sincerely and genuinely wasn’t yelling, I wasn’t even mad at them, I was just passionately talking about something. The worst of this state usually results in some kind of major family blow out or tensions in my relationships and friendships. I am very guilty of breaking things or hitting walls in select few circumstances in my life,       I am incredibly ashamed of this fact.           However, I have never and would never hurt somebody I love. My destructive behaviour comes from a place of self loathing and a desire to harm myself, not those around me. It usually stems from a “I fucking did it again, everyone hates me and I’m losing the most important things again”. This level of stress seems to be a common trigger that would push me from what I’ve learned to be called prodromal and then to manic. 

I’ve known for years that I need professional help, but never could bring myself to accept I likely require diagnosis and medication due to the own stigma I have in my own head of me specifically requiring that kindve help. But this has led me to lose the best friend I’ve ever had and I really don’t know what to do, I would do whatever it takes to mend things between her and I. 





So I had a friend, we’ve known each other since high school and have pretty much always been really close. However the past 2-3 years her and I developed an incredibly strong bond. She became my best friend and I became hers and it was pretty unquestionable. I was there for her through her heartbreak and she was there for me for all struggles. She was a huge influence in my starting to seek help back in March, she supported me and gave me the strength to swallow that pride I had and get over my own stigmatization of myself. However, my doctor gave me mirtazapine (even though I only wanted something to help me sleep not an antidepressant. As I mainly needed help sleeping after my grandfathers recent passing and didn’t want to seek other medication until speaking with a therapist and psychiatrist) and after about 2 weeks of that stuff I felt incredibly not right. First off I felt like I was tranquilized every day, but I was pacing all the time and just became really irritable. So I stopped taking it. Which really was fine, except that irritability didn’t really go away. This was around April or May. Now during all this time my friend and I were looking for places to rent so I could get out of the shithole town I was in and she could get out of her grandparents. Fortunately enough we ended up in a situation where we could rent to own the home. But there were many stress factors involved in this on my end that didn’t exist on hers. Anyways what I thought was normal amounts of bickering occurred in the first couple of weeks of moving in with each other at the end of July. During the talks to resolve these fights I made sure to explain to her very openly and honestly my thought process, stress factors, insecurities and just everything in general that I felt led me to contribute to making things worse. Things kindve settled and I was beginning to think maybe we really were starting to find our stride. But I was still irritable and not feeling right, sleeping 3-4 hours a night, up late cleaning for no reason, but still up and at it for 6am to work. She never noticed this cuz she works night shifts. But then something else happened that really fucked everything up....

She had a mutual friend over and they, really badly took advantage of her. When I got home from work that day she was really upset and I of course, was there for her. I felt so bad seeing her this way again, and due to the actions of one of my friends no less, someone I respected. And as I sat there helping pick up the pieces the thought crossed my mind that “man I can’t believe he’d do this to her, I would never do this to somebody” but the thought continued on and became “I’d like to help her pick up the pieces... and be the one to hold it together too“. I knew this was a problem. So I decided I would try to take some space and get over it. She asked what was wrong and I gave her a really half assed answer. Saying that I just needed some time to sort things out and that I’m not mad at you so don’t think that way. But things weren’t getting better. I don’t know why, but I decided to open up to her about it and tell her. I made sure to start the conversation with “I need to be honest with you about what’s been bothering me, I don’t expect you to say much and that’s ok, because the most important thing to me is that things don’t change between us as friends”. After telling her she said it was a big deal and asked if us living together would be a problem. I said no it’s not and I don’t want it to be. She went out for the weekend for a birthday, which I thought was perfect it gave me some time to myself. But when she got back things were markedly different. She locked herself in her room all day, wouldn’t go out for a smoke if I was on the deck, would hardly even look at  me, starting acting super shady about the people she’d bring over and go out with. After a few days of this I decided that I should take a couple weeks to stay at my sisters and give us some space. I told her about this and said “ever since I said what I had to say you seem very uncomfortable by my presence, so I think I’m going to go stay at my sisters for a couple of weeks, I just don’t think I’ll be able to do what I have to do and be here right now. And it’s not fair you’re uncomfortable” she said “I agree I think you should move to the basement”. I think this response really triggered something because I felt I was being completely pushed away. Anyways we discussed some of the problems with bills and what then she kindve stormed off and left for work around two hours later. I stewed in my own racing thoughts and forwarded her the email to swap the security system over and then snarky text messages were sent. I accused her of not caring she told me I’m psycho....I punched the wall. And that’s pretty much it, she came home in the morning I asked her if we could talk and at least finish things off. She slammed the door in my face, I screamed “thanks for being a fucking adult about all of this” (I know, real rich coming from the guy hitting walls). I got an eviction notice, began packing and left that evening. That was Thursday. And now she’s telling people she’s terrified of me and felt scared for her safety. Which is honestly what hurts the most because she knows I have a really deep insecurity about causing fear in people I love. I’m a pretty big guy who’s just naturally loud. I don’t want anyone to feel scared of me. Especially as a big brother, I want to be a protector. I know punching the wall was wrong but it’s not like she was there for it or had to witness me in that state...

I have had many turbulent losses in my life because of this. I’m tired of it. But this one really does hurt the most, I’ve learned that there is nothing better than a best friendship between a man and a woman. As strange as it sounds, I’m going to miss the days where we could platonically cuddle up together, talk about our hopes, dreams and insecurities and watch Disney movies. I just wish I didn’t allow my pride to keep me from getting help and so irreversibly fuck up this friendship. I really don’t know what to do or how to move forward from here. Because all I want is to make things right. I’m an idiot and I wish I never caught feelings for my best friend, I wish I wasn’t the way I am and I wish I could stop this from happening to me."
1999,Not trying to be nit picky but a friend of mine reacted with a heart on everyone else’s comment but mine?,Uhh.. hmm...
2000,Trigger warning ⚠️ suicide video (not showing),"So I did something stupid, someone told me on TikTok to not watch this video because it was disturbing, but it made me want to look more so I googled it and it was a man who committed suicide live. Now I’m traumatised. Yes I know it is my own fault but how can I get this image out my head?"
2001,Why do I(30F) have the urge to sleep on the floor instead of my bed when I feel stressed/overwhelmed?,Is it just a comfort thing or perhaps a form of punishment?
2002,I hoped for the past 6 years for a better life.,"Hey there, as the title says I am hoping for something to change, but nothing does. Every evening I go to bed being completely lonely. Every single day is a disappointment in terms of me getting better. I just hope for one of two things: to be able to talk to some people ""freely"", and not with a mask. But I can't really... Whenever I am around others its like an instinct, and I hate myself for it. I never know how to talk to people, and even if I am in a conversation where I would be able to add anything personal I overthing it and I ""miss my chance"". And to find someone I can spend some time with. I mean I can't really remember having a person for more than a few weeks, and they just always ghost me... My day persists mostly of doing nothing and wasting time with stupid stuff I mostly don't enjoy. And I actually never told this anyone, but something that bothers me lately a lot: I remember when I was little, going to my dad and asking him to do something with me because I had no friends whatsoever who would do something with me, but even he turned me down and never did something with me. I just want someone to hold me... it would make my day, but even that will not happen I think."
2003,Why do I (26F) start uncontrollably talking to myself when I'm stressed?,"I never used to do this, it started when I was about 22 when I got a job in a call centre that I found very stressful, cringe and embarrassing, and I was stuck there for about three years."
2004,Bullying can really mess you mentally..,"So, i was watching an anime and one the characters was being builloed.. and it put back all the awful memories from my childhood.. it's really annoying to watch.. because i wanted to push it as far as my brain could,  they word what they said about me.. Still  hauntes me, i did bad things in my bad.. if only i can fix it.. i still hate myself i dislike my voice and body.. i know alot of people say it.. idk what and how they feeling but it does bother me.. if only younger me could say the friends i made.. how i still hurts.. it's fine.. I'm still hurt but i can move but i still need some help to stand up.. i really try to push the thought of ""everything without me is better"" but i keep thinking that is true.. I'm sorry.."
2005,Does this count as being suicidal?,"Often when I'm feeling overwhelmed with negative emotions, I lay down and think how much lighter and better my chest would feel if I suddenly vaporized into nothingness. I'm not even close to thoughts about committing suicide, but does this count as being suicidal? It happens often."
2006,How do I know if someone hates me or if I'm just overreacting?,"Let me preface by saying it is not a constant feeling. Sometimes I feel as if my friends are just putting up with me so that they can laugh at me when I'm gone. And the people that are not my friends outright hate me and wish me no good. They're just good at lying and being ""polite"". When I feel like this I usually try to stay away from everyone as much as I can. Even when going outside I might believe that the strangers that were talking and laughing are talking about me. It's even worse in large crowds, where I can discern my name in between all of the voices of the crowd, followed with rude remarks and laughter. No matter how much I say to myself ""these people are not talking about me. They've most likely never even seen me!"", it doesn't stop it from hurting. This sometimes happens at school too. I can hear my name being mentioned followed with some rude stuff that I am insecure about while a bunch of people are gathered a couple of meters away from me. I instantly feel targeted and scared, but the peculiar thing is that when someone is back-biting, they're usually whispering. They seemed to be chatting quite normally and the snippets I caught (if they were real at all?!) did not match their tone and body language at all. Perhaps they think it's funny and casual to talk about me, who knows. It's high school though, teens aren't known to be the nicest people on earth.

Once or twice I started asking a close friend of mine if our mutual friends hate me, and if my childhood-classmates hate me too (long backstory with insecurity, mild s\*icidal ideation and slight bullying, can't type it out cause it won't do it justice). She said they didn't at all. I was (and still am) not convinced. After that, I tried to subtly introduce my fear of acquaintances and strangers alike hating me by sight. She said ""no, that's not possible"", and told me to seek help. My sister wants me to seek help too but I am sceptical. I don't know if I can trust a therapist. What about if they are lying to me about me not being hated? What about if they just give me a sense of fulfilment while not accomplishing anything to distract me? Anyways, I doubt that this is severe enough for a therapist."
2007,I feel like no one is on my side.,"My mom tries to listen but I don't like talking to her about a lot of stuff, and she gets annoyed with me so often that it just feels pointless to try and talk to her. My dad has been so invalidating recently. My friends all have their own problems to deal with. I feel like a shitty friend to my best friend in particular, because I always go to her for advice and when she comes to me for advice I just don't know what to say. 

I don't feel like I have a person to go to anymore. I'm so fucking worried about my health and I HAVE to do research because no one else will advocate for me. I'm just so tired of staying strong when my body feels so shitty."
2008,Am I being fake if I don't put out my sorrows and how depressed I am on social media?,"I just saw a post that said that everyone on social media is happy but in reality no one is. 

And I realised, I haven't really talked about my own mental health issues ever on social media. 

Does that make me fake?

( Somewhere, I am just scared that I'll be told to get it together and that mental health doesn't matter and that I am okay and that I should pull it all together.)"
2009,Why do I (26F) start uncontrollably talking to myself when I'm stressed?,"I never used to do this, it started when I was about 20 and got a job at a call centre which I found really stressful, cringe and embarrassing and I was stuck there for about three years on and off. The job definitely affected my mental health because a lot of it was asking strangers in my city for their details re: property sales and getting yelled at a lot, and the pay was absolutely shocking.
 Ever since, when I'm by myself and stressed or embarrassed, like I've just called in sick to work (aged care these days, very stressful) or walking home from walk and processing a hard day, I'll start uncontrollably talking to myself.
It's almost like a tic, they aren't really proper sentences, it's repetitive and I often swear. They usually go something like: ""Fine, it's fine, just fucking fuck off."" ""For fucks sake just fucking kill me. No don't kill me but fuuuuuck."" It kind of looks funny written down haha. It's usually rapid fire out of my mouth before I can even think about it, usually at the height or peak of my ruminating or stressful thought train. I don't tend to do it around other people but I have caught myself sighing suddenly and loudly in place of when I'd start jabbering or saying ""Oh, dear' which has gotten people's attention before.

Sometimes I just have one outburst and I'm done but sometimes I'm talking like a deranged parrot for a minute. 

Is this normal, do other people do this? Like, am I a bit mad? I'm certainly not remotely a mentally healthy person but in general I'm pretty functional."

2011,"Hey, uh idk what to call this","Before I say this, idk if its mental health realted. If its not i'm sorry. I'm kinda dumb and just want to rant to people.

Idk if this is normal, But like when I see a group of people I start panicking and want to cry. When i first started year 7 i got jumped alot by groups bc i'm cool and like I just don't like big groups of people In case they start. I'm in year 11 now (10th grade for u Americans, I'm from uk) and  when i walk my dog and I'm walking home and I see people, even if there younger then me and even if I know there not a threat, I'll just turn back round to avoid them even if it takes me 20-30 min more to get home. Like i feel like i'm being judge and just want to cry. And then in school, when we have seating plans I feel like people are mad that they have to sit next to me and I just feel disappointing. Like I apologies to them for having to sit next to me. I don't talk alot in lessons incase I get judge, but i talk alot at home so my parents don't really notice. And like, I want to talk to someone about it but idk how to say I'm scared of people.  

When I see groups of people I just want to go home and it kinda makes my friends less interested in me as soon as they meet in groups I just want to leave and idk how to explain it and I don't want to talk to my parents about it as I talk alot at home so they will probably feel like i'm exaggerating. But i walk a longer route home from school everyday (probably about 30min longer) As less students walk that way so i feel more alright.

I just don't feel alright seeing groups of people and I always feel like there judging me. So thats cool.

Also, my school doesnt care about people feelings unless you miss behave alot but I'm too scared to do that so like i just go unnoticed and it will just feel to cringey to me to talk to someone, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, idk why i wrote this but like enjoy i guess."
2012,I know it's all in my head but I don't know how to make it stop,"I find myself not being able to eat. Like every time I am about to get food or something to snack on I get a thought of ""what if my stomach starts hurting"" and it does. I don't know how to make it stop, even if I try and do something to get my mind away from it I can feel the pain. But I know it isn't real pain and it's all in my head.

I don't know how to explain it. I had the same problem 5-6 years ago and I don't remember how it went away. I was at the doctors last week and she just gave me some pills. The exact one I used to take when I was younger and would always feel sick after them. However instead of having to take them every day, she told me to take them when needed.

Today I had one an hour before eating (it says so in the instructions) but it didn't help much. I talked to my dad about my eating and how I just can't and he thinks I'm becoming anorexic. I don't know if I am or even think that. I don't avoid food on purpose to lose weight, quite the opposite. I know I need to gain weight but I'm so scared to eat food so it doesn't hurt.

I just feel so stressed and anxious and want to make it stop. And yes I asked my dad to get me special help but he doesn't want that so I don't take those kinds of medicine at such a young age. 

If you know any way that I can get myself calm then please tell me. I would really appreciate it."

2014,I Feel Left Out All the time,"I've always been the odd one in every aspect of my life.
I've was mentally bullied in highschool (they laughed at everything I did even in the way how I walked).I Always had it rough making friends. At some point i gave up being social and kept to myself but that didn't work. I tried learning things thinking that it may get me some attention it didn't. I only exist to people if they need something and once they are done they just throw me away. Even recently i met someone nice and it was going all well but now she says she needs me but isn't able to love me back for some reason and here I am thinking about all I've been through haven't slept in two days .help"
2015,Trying to help my sister. I don't know what to do.,"My sister (I'm not sure if I may put her age, but she is middle aged) has been struggling with a mental disorder ever since her teens. She has done many street drugs, and has been on nearly every type of prescription drug to treat mental disorders. Doctors have diagnosed her with a drug-resistant neurological disorder. She goes through what could be bi-polar disorder where one day she's kind, understanding, thoughtful, reasonable, and can take criticism - and the next day she becomes very defensive, interprets nearly anything said to her as a personal attack, is unreasonable, and argumentative. She has said that she experiences several emotions (negative emotions) all the time, and at the same time. She claims she is unable to cry because of the medicine she is on, and that she never experiences happy emotions.

I'd like to say what medication she is currently taking, but I'm not sure if that is allowed here, but I think it's okay to say it is a strong mood stabilizer. Doctors apparently feel she should not be on an anti-psychotic medication. She has also had ECT treatment. She insisted on having it done and my parents and I believe that has done severe harm to her mind.

She has been in a ""psychiatric hospital"" multiple times, and now has told us that if she is ever put in a hospital again she will kill herself. So we feel we no longer have that as on option. She is willing to see therapists, and has been for some time now.

She is functional to a degree. She is mostly able to care for herself, but is not able to be self-sufficient. She relies heavily on our parents for emotional support as well as financial support, and has put extreme stress on us. We want to help, but don't know what to do at this point.

She has used many drugs over the years mostly hallucinogens (LSD, DMT (Ayahuasca), shrooms). She's taken marijuana for her whole life - now often as CBD. The only concern I have with the marijuana is what a dealer may add to it - she's mentioned one time she believes she smoked some that was treated somehow with formaldehyde. I don't think she's ever done any kind of opiates, or uppers thankfully.  I mention this because I honestly feel that these drugs have done harm to her mind.

She just recently lost the place she was renting, and this is what has set-off what she says is the worst crisis in her life. She found a place to rent (2 bedroom, 2 full bath, with a large yard) for an amount that she could afford (around $850) located 9 hours away. Our parents and our other sister paid $4000 to move her things and cover other various costs. When she arrived, she said the place was a dump and the area was awful with trash everywhere. She refused to move in and went to a motel. We ended up having to drive over there to bring her back. We looked at the place and I felt it was more than reasonable for $850/mo - in fact, I think it is larger and nicer than my current place.

So now she's back and currently living at my parents house. I doubt that will last much longer as she can't stand to be there. She says that she must find a place to rent for around $1400/mo (she has $2000/mo of income) that is 2bedroom/2bathroom with a yard and accepts pets. She said she will find a roommate to split the costs, but she wants to live in a rural location which I feel will make it very difficult to find a roommate. She refuses to live in a suburb like area as she says it frightens her. 

There's much more I'd like to say about her and her situation, but this is already very long.

I appreciate very much everyone who reads even part of this, and also any feedback.

I honestly feel she wants us to reject her and tell her that she's on her own so that she can have an excuse to end her life.

2016,i’m just a piece of shit and there’s no one for me.,"this is just a wall of text, sorry in advance.
i don’t even know where to start. i’m just venting. i’m a messed up person. i’m depressed and probably have dissociative identity disorder and i’m just so unable to provide for anyone let alone myself. my boyfriend has been basically caring for me through long distance, but his parents don’t like it. when we were first together i was pretty fine. i was somewhat happy and definitely not as messed up as i am now. i presented as female, too. we kept it a secret until we were found out by my parents and they weren’t really happy. but things were fine with them after a bit but then slowly my mental health got worse. i self harmed and felt horrible. i transferred schools and was better, but still felt like a complete piece of shit. i started to explore my gender identity and only up until january of this year have i figured out i am a boy. flash forward through all the covid stuff and then to this summer. my boyfriend and i finally got to visit. my mother went with me and she watched me on the tracking app every time my boyfriend and i went out alone. my boyfriend’s parents said they needed to talk to him about the trip, but it never happened until today. they told him they feel like he is putting in more than he is getting out. they're a bit put off by the lack of please and thank you, and when they gave my mother money for the trip she didn’t acknowledge it (mind you she didn’t really want it anyways and it wasn’t my place to say anything). his mom also thinks i am manipulating him when i had a dissociative episode a few weeks ago. i have self esteem issues no doubt and everything that’s been going on lately with my mental health just hurts so bad. i’m just a terrible person and i can’t provide for him. i don’t have enough money to get him things like he gets me. i’m not stable enough. i can’t drive and even though i’m working on it, it’s still really hard. i’m in counseling but it doesn’t really help and we’re on our way out with it since i’m “better” with the things i originally came to her for. i just feel so shitty i can’t even describe it. i want someone to comfort me but i don’t deserve anything. i just want to crawl in a hole and die. i don’t deserve life or attention or love or anything. i just.. need to get this off my chest.."
2017,"!!!! A HUGE FAT TW, IT GETS KINDA GORY!!!! I tried to kill myself and now i struggle with ptsd","
it was summer. I don't remember the date or what day it was. The song Asleep by The Smiths was playing. I was wearing a pair of gray sweatpants and a zip up hoodie. I laid down on my bed and took a old shoe box, filled with souvenirs and other memories. At the bottom of the box was a steak knife or whatever its called. The saw like one. I wrote a note to my friends and family, took the knife to my wrist and made a cut. It wasn't deep enough so i just kept cutting with the rigid knife. It hurt so bad but i didn't mind because all of the pain would be over soon. I just kept going until i hit something. I laid down again. The song was still playing, but all i could hear was my blood, dripping down my arm onto the wood floor. I started to get sleepy and feeling light, yet heavy at the same time. Then i was hit with this panic. I saw the floor, i saw my hand, and then i froze. There was blood everywhere. I still remember the smell like it was yesterday. It smelled like coins, but a very specific type of coin. The blood felt cold on my wrist. With my other hand that i had tried to cut too, but i was too weak to do so, i grabbed my wrist and put pressure on it. I didn't know what to do. I went to bathroom and put my hand under the water. That hurt too. After a long time, the bleeding stopped. I ran to my room and put the knife in the box, took my sheets and cleaned the floor. I threw the sheets in the wash and bandaged up my wrist. My hands still feel cold. I can still smell the blood. I can still feel the knife against my skin. I can still feel the panic. I can still feel the bleeding. I haven't listened to The Smiths since. I still have the knife with my blood on it. I still have the pain.

I want to tell people but I'm scared."
2018,What’s wrong with me,"Everything is making me sad. I’ve never felt much so much sadness for other people. but now whenever I see people going through shit or the sadness in the world i want to cry. I’m 17 years old and I’m struggling with so much boredom that it constantly sends me into a spiral. My anxiety is off the charts constantly. I just feel like I’m waiting for every day to end so I can fast forward to a good day but nothing really changes. I have almost no friends, and whenever I think of the past I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Everything is bothering me at this point and I’m so confused. I’m just a teenager and I think about death all the time. This just feels so wrong... I can’t get out of this funk. I’ve been feeling like this every single day for almost a month now, and I cry almost every day too. Has anyone gone through anything similar?? Will it get better?"
2019,"Pressure from parents, exhaustion, depression, no-one to talk to, grades are worse because of quarantine and family is a nightmare. Help please","As said in the title, I don't know what to do. My dad already doesn't talk to my brother and I feel like if I don't do well then my dad will feel like he failed or something. But then if he wants me to do well then it shows he cares or something idk. I also got a puppy yet I'm the only one doing anything for her and I've got online school which is just making everything more stressful and I can't focus. Getting 6 hours sleep each night. Have close friends but this ain't something I would talk to them about it. Idk why I posted this anyway sorry"
2020,Extreme anxiety around my own mortality and the mortality of others.,"So, to start this off I wanna preface that, since lockdown, I have suffered with what can only be described as debilitating anxiety. It’s been very much like that of a wave - really good times where all my worries seem benign and my anxiety symptoms are low or not there at all and other times where I’ve just been crippled with anxiety. I don’t want to go into great detail about everything that’s happened since lockdown regarding my anxiety, as this would be too long and I don’t really like to dig up and put what I felt into words as I sometimes feel that it’s counter-productive for myself personally. 

It started with panic attacks that were a 50/50 mix of being triggered or just occurring randomly. I have (self-diagnosed) health anxiety. I say self-diagnosed because I feel health anxiety is very specific and hard to misinterpret for something else, it’s almost like saying I have a self-diagnosed cold or headache, the symptoms are typically self-explanatory and rarely chalk up to a bigger thing. This caused me to have extremely irrational thought and just have this constant dread sensation in my stomach. The idea of a serious illness was absolutely crushing to me, to the point where even entertaining the thought of it or seeing something on an ad or someone saying something in a video would cause me to feel light-headed and intensely anxious. It still does. I did everything to help myself and I think I did improve, it took a while, but I’ve definitely done things that have resulted in me being more rational and generally calmer. Aside from the odd panic attack (that seem to be centred around my migraines), I’ve been okay - definitely better - I feel that’s all that needs to be said regarding my anxiety history. One more thing to preface: I had only experienced something like this period when I was young, like 12-13 but I had no clue what it was and it ended up passing. 

Now, into what I wanted to talk about. After a long-while and after everything I stated above, we are in the present. Recently, this feeling of very unpleasant, existential dread has taken up a lot of my days. I question everything around me, the meaning in life. I feel like “is anything worth it?” “Is anything truly special?”. Everything looks different since my anxiety started. I’m okay, I’m not depressed. But I wish I had this sort of naivety that I had prior to my anxiety, where I was good and I didn’t have to question the validity and meaning in everything. I just don’t know what to do. 

Death terrifies me. Every time I hear that someone dies in the news I feel almost sick with dread. It’s not necessarily the thought of not existing that terrifies me, it’s just the prospect of death - I can’t put my finger on why. It just elicits this horrendous response in me where I almost feel sick. Prior to all of this starting, I had no trouble in accepting my fate and my own mortality but now it seems to me like this stomach churning thing. 

I don’t know, has anyone got any advice or experiences anything similar 

Ellie :-)"
2021,I feel like I cant go on despite doing better. I just want the pain to stop.,"I lost my thing recently. And no matter what I try to do to get it back or make it try...it floats farther away. 
I see something serious in this thing. It was my reason to live and for a while I thought I was its reason too. 
My anxiety started getting really bad...
But then this thing started getting into things behind my back...keeping them a secret...lying about it. 
And when it started doing that, we started slipping. 
It talks about how it just can’t do certain things, but the whole reason it became my thing was because we had that level of connection/communication. 
I need to tell them whats going on and what I think but they don’t want to listen me. They dont want to talk to me. 
So I try my best to cater to what they want in the time being
And they get mad at me. 
And it hurts so bad. 
So so so so bad.....
And now they don’t even want to work on our friendship for now. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong
I don’t know where I went wrong
I know my anxiety made things hard
But I was really trying the best I could...
 
Now I’m on medication
And while it helps some, it hasn’t been long enough for the full effects to kick in. 

I just want to give up...
I want to stop trying...
I want to die...

I want to because I want the pain to stop...I’m trying my best and then they just shit on me...
It’s really making me feel worthless. 

But above all else, it’s making me worried. 
Because this isn’t normal. 
This isn’t how they are...
It’s not right but they don’t care."

2023,How do you find a therapist?,"Hi,

If anyone here is in therapy, how did you find one you 'clicked' with, or know what was the right approach for you?

I'm not functioning at the moment and need to get help pretty fast... I have friends who have been in it and they've mostly just said they got lucky finding a good one and having a successful one first time, but surely there's more to it than pot luck when some charge upwards of £90/hour and each time you don't 'click' would be multiple of those sessions to give it a fair shot...

They're starting to get pretty annoyed with me struggling to understand and being frustrated with the situation so any input would be appreciated"
2024,People who self diagnose and fake stuff for attention,"Listen, so I'm not saying that Jessica from middle school wasn't depressed, I'm just saying that maybe she wasn't diagnosed.

I know so many people who straight up lie about their mental health. And like not in the way i do where i say I'm not suicidal or that the flashbacks are gone and i totally sleep. I'm talking faking OCD, DID, anxiety, depression, ptsd etc. I had a friend, let's call her helen, who told everyone she had attempted suicide when we were at school. She said that the cops showed up and all that other bs. I'm someone who has actually tried to kill myself twice, so i know the protocol in these situations. I didn't say anything because she was my friend, but it really made me angry. Everyone was talking about her FOR DAYS.

I just don't think that it's ok to take advantage of stuff like mental health and suicide, when there's real people who actually battle with this all the time.

I am seriously not ok in that front. Like many diagnoses not ok. You know how much attention i expect and receive from those? Zero. Nada. It's really fucking insensitive HELEN.


The other thing is people who self diagnose. I think i don't need to say more, my fellow unstable people get why it's not ok or good.

2026,I Am A Hypochondriac &amp; Struggling,"I am worried as hell and don’t know what to do

Hi there!
This will be a bit long so please bare with me. About 6 months ago, March 2020, I (20F) performed oral sex on a boy who was a virgin, not a drug user either. After this intercourse, I had no symptoms but for some reason I started to worry. Maybe it will sound dumb but I started to worry because I thought what I did was wrong and that I deserved to get some type of disease for it. This was my mentality and I looked for symptoms all over my body. I developed tonsil stones, mouth ulcers which made me insanely worried as hell too. On July 2020, I had check-ups and routine blood tests done (complete blood count, wbc etc.) and everything was perfectly fine. For some reason I couldn’t get illnesses out of my mind. 2 days ago, I noticed some weird stuff in my throat, red spots that weren’t there before.

Here’s the link to the throat pictures: https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/inu623/help_why_is_my_throat_so_red_no_trouble/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

: https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/iog4b7/is_this_hpv_or_herpes_tested_neg_for_strepcovid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I immediately went to an ENT, tested negative for both strep and covid. I had a blood test as well, wbc was perfectly fine. Monocytes were a bit high so my doc said that it was some sort of minor viral infection like the flu or common cold. However, I always get the flu and never develop these type of stuff in my throat.
I got worried about HSV and HPV. Sidenote, I am vaccinated against HPV. I don’t have a fever nor a sore throat.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I would like some peace of mind or advices about what may be going on with me from you. I would also love suggestions on how to improve my extreme hypochondriac mentality right now.

Thank you.."

1. My ptsd
I have SA related PTSD ( suicide attempt related post traumatic stress syndrome) and It's getting unbearable. My flashbacks are more frequent and way more intense, and the funny thing is that i didn't know that some of the things i was experiencing were related to that before asking reddit.

2. Eating disorder
This is getting so romanticized in media it's crazy. It's not beautiful at all. I've eaten 14 times in the last 2 weeks and i feel awful, but i just can't stop. I won't go into too much detail because it's kinda gross.

3. Triggers and trigger warnings
Some people don't understand how important tw's are. It can literally save a life. Me and my friends have a twt gc where we talk about alot of stuff, and once when i was at work i checked the gc and they were talking about the Wes Johnson ( smosh) allegations and didnt put a tw so i had a panic attack at the bathroom. That's was fun. People need to use the fucking trigger warnings."
2031,Really Bad Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend broke up with me about a month ago and even before we broke up I’ve been feeling lost and not sure what I’m doing with my life and since then I’ve been feeling super anxious. I haven’t felt this anxious in a long time, but this time it’s different. This time my anxiety is so bad I haven’t been hungry so I haven’t been eating lately and I’ve lost a good amount of weight. Sometimes I feel hungry so I look in the fridge to make something and immediately don’t feel hungry anymore and start to feel nauseous. Has anyone else felt like this? Do you have any suggestions on how I can lower my anxiety and start eating again? Thanks in advance!"

2033,please can someone help,i feel like everyone around me is fake. it’s affecting me so much that I can’t concentrate in school. ive grew to be unappreciative of everything as i am extremely irritable. i have to have a new personality to even stay in a friendship because no one even knows what im actually like. i just get ignored when trying to talk about actual interests; not that i have that many anyway. ive tried talking to my friends about this but its not sinking in and I think she doesn’t realise this is hurting me. this has driven me to tears many times because i really hate not knowing who i am anymore and i hate myself a lot for it. it’s caused bad emotions to grow on me and bad habits to surface. thanks for reading. help is appreciated. :)

During periods of anger I lock myself in my room and get chills all over my body, or start sweating, and end up just crying. This doesn't happen daily, closer to monthly, but I feel like I have a problem and I don't know what it is or what to do. Does anyone know what's wrong with me? I haven't told anyone about this"

I feel like the biggest idiot for leaving my card in the notebook if I hadn’t I would be free right now. I guess I’ll have to try again I found a place to jump off of it’s just a long walk there.

2040,I’m not sure what to do,For awhile now I’ve(20f) felt like a disappointment because I lost my job around October of last year and haven’t had one since and I haven’t done school stuff too. I recently started taking my health into my own hands by working out but I don’t have insurance to get medicine for depression/anxiety/adhd (I’ve had doctors confirm these) and tbh I’ve felt really good about working out. But two days ago my mom asked me if I wanna work with my step dad and I don’t know if I should just “man” up and go with it but I cry when I think about it. I don’t really think I could get up at 3-4am every day to work till 3pm I don’t really have a problem working long shifts but 3am is a hard time for me to get up. Then my step dad brought chocolate home for my mom and I made a comment (like oh you got chocolate) he said if you had a job you could get your own. I really just need some people who’ve been through the same stuff or similar what to do. Thank you for reading ❤️

He’s not usually abusive, he’s just really scary. I watched him choke my brother a few years ago. It was traumatic. I’m scared. I know I put myself in this situation, but I’m really scared. And my Mom’s not helping. Repeatedly telling me my grades. Going “Dad doesn’t mess around.” “You’re gonna care soon.” “Dad’s gonna be furious.” I’m scared."
2043,Can’t stop myself from screaming,"I 23M have a problem of showing my facial expression while I think,it make me seems like crazy dude and lately due to events from where I live and relationship problems I start to scream when I think about it.and I can’t stop thinking about it.they are the problems I can’t solve but it’s bother me so much that everyday when I not doing something complex enough like video game , chess I can’t stop thinking about them.

It’s just every mistake I made , everything I did that embarrassing me in the past and the people I have to let go haunt me in daily basics, I miss them so much but they are a toxic relationship I have to end before it hurt even more.but I still have to see them at school sometimes and it make me scare and anxiety.thinking about this make me want to die and it so painful I scream or did that silence scream when U can’t , sometime I scream randomly on the streets and it make me look like crazy and scary people. How can I stop it.?"

2045,Thoughts on when people respond to “I’ve got depression” with “we’re all depressed”?,"I’m sick of trying to deal with this bs mental illness and being told it’s an excuse and that depression is part of life etc. But what are your genuine thoughts and opinions on this? Am I really just making an excuse and intentionally like this? Are all humans depressed? 

Please note I do exercises and try staying very very active. I try to eat well too. I try to do a lot of things. So far it hasn’t fixed my lifelong issues which is fine and all. I’m just tired of hearing how apparently everyone is dealing with depression and I’m just making excuses. It’s frustrating and I’m scared that maybe I am being a little bitch. Idk. Even when I’m thinking positive thoughts I feel empty and exhausted. It’s not an emotion so."

2054,Help with my family.,"Hi there. Cut along story short. I've suffered with anxiety my whole life, started when I was 5 and I am now 28. I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, AD and psychosis a few years ago. Been taking medication for 6 years, been to see countless therapists. Anyway I'm now in recovery and got my life in order. My only issue that's left now is my family. My brother took the route of drugs years and years ago because his friends did, and he got hooked. There was years of abuse (physical and mental) from him. 2 months ago, after his 4th trip to rehab and him leaving early because he was bored (no I'm not kidding) I finally got him out of my life. My dad was a twat, chose women and drugs, got rid of him also. My mum I tolerate because I love her, but she's an extremely selfish lady as well, always choosing alcohol over everything else. Then there's my sister. My sister I've always had sympathy for, but tonight I believe I have lost any sympathy I had left. She's in an extremely toxic relationship with a man that she's always fighting with, but chooses to stay because he gives her what she wants material wise. Clothes, shoes, holidays etc etc. About 6 months ago after coming off a 12 hour shift, I got a phone call from her. She'd been out drinking and had yet ANOTHER fight with her boyfriend. She thinks it's a real party to ring her recovering brother that she wants to kill herself, so I spent 4 hours calming the situation down, crying down the phone to her begging her not to do it. I offered to call the ambulance for her, she said no, so I just spoke with her. I went to bed and had to be up in 3 hours for another 12 hour shift. On my break I looked up all this information, helplines etc to send her when I got home. I sent her them and said you will find a lot of help and guidance from these people. Well she ignored me, she ignored me because her and her boyfriend made up. I didn't hear anything for over a week and all I got was ""awww thanks yeah I'll look into it"". Anyway fast forward to tonight, after months of not even getting a message to ask how I'm doing, how my partner's doing....nothing. I get a message saying ""I'm gonna do it. What would work best?"" I immediately rang my mum and told her and said you and her have been out drinking haven't you? She said yes and that my sister has YET again had a fight with her boyfriend and wants to kill herself. However this time I can't get involved. When I saw the words ""how should I do it?"" I had a really bad panic attack, all the bad memories of the couple times I attempted suicide, it's triggered so many bad thoughts. I can't get involved with this, and part of me says I'm right to do so, but another part says I should. I've rung my mum and said you need to deal with this, you know how she gets when she drinks and you chose to go out with her. She said she was going to ring her and talk to her. I don't know...I don't know what the point of this post is, I think I've just reached my limit with my family and I needed to get alot off my chest. After tonight I really want to get rid of her as well, like I did my brother and dad. All of them are a huge reason for why my mental health is so bad. And even now, when I've moved 200 miles away, they drag me into their self inflicted drama. This is the worst my anxiety has been in weeks, and it's because of...once again, my family. 

Sorry for ranting."
2055,How can I help my insecurities to stop making me possessive,I feel like I've been being way over possessive over a friend I have after she hooked up with a guy. I dont even really have a crush on her or like her in that way that much but isk why but that shit sparklesh u r tsparkles like i was absolutely devasted and idk why. I think it might be because of my insecurities because I've never even gotten close to having a  romantic relationship with someone. But to get to the main point I can't stop worrying about it and idk why. Like know its none of my business and I know its so so so so SO fucking yoxic and stupid of me to be worrying about this but I just cant shake this feeling of dread thinking about it. I've tried researching how to deal with jealousy and insecurities but I've already tried those steps and I still have this dread thinking about it. I suspect I may have BPD (borderline personally disorder) but I haven't been tested so there's no way to be sure. How can I make myself stop caring whay she does? I am pretty sure thid could be a problem with my insecurities but how can I stop those from making me posesive?

2057,Social media is such a trigger,"Is anyone else really struggling at the moment being on social media? 

All over any social media i’m on its just so full of homophobia/ racism and other mental health stuff that i find difficult to deal with and its just all so triggering but i still want to support BLM but then it just makes me see even more videos of people being racist and Im struggling to want to stay in a world with so much hatred and evil. I feel i shouldn’t feel this way because I’m not black and haven’t been oppressed but i feel so awful for them especially when cops who are suppose to protect people clearly don’t. 

I’ve tried staying off social media but i feel i have nothing else to do as it use to be a place for me to escape my own problems but now it causes a lot
of them. i hate the online world and the real one. i feel so lost. corona isn’t helping either. 

i hope this makes sense and someone understands me. i didn’t really know where else to post this as everywhere else online feels unsafe to me. 

thanks for reading if you got this far."
2058,I don’t feel human,period
2059,"My family , doctors, friends is trying to kill me and make everything worse. It’s obvious","It’s obvious they are putting things and my food. They keep telling me I’m a hypochondriac but I know they’re lying, they’re all lying to me.. the doctors, family, friends, everyone is just lying to me about my symptoms. They made me get Migranes and stomach issues because they put things in my food, they want me dead. I now have the urge to constantly pee all the time and had a migraine for weeks after having a big argument with my family about my mental health. They did this to me, they’re just trying to kill me because they hate me and I know it now. I don’t know how to stop them but they’re trying to kill me."
2060,Is it self diagnosing if it is related to something I have an official diagnosis for?,"I (24f) was diagnosed with adhd and aspergers when I was a kid. I have always struggled with keeping my spaces organized, starting, switching, and completing tasks, tackling larger projects, procrastinating, self motivating, remembering to do things, and recognizing that things need to be done. I had never really looked further into these things, having been told all my life that I would 'outgrow' the symptoms. Until I tried moving out recently, I had a set schedule of small things alongside individual tasks that would be sprung on me whenever my parents took the notion.
When I moved in with some friends, this had become an issue where my chores were getting done late or even not at all until someone asked me about it. I have since moved back with my parents. While I was there, I started looking up how to maybe fix the issues I was having and stumbled upon Executive Function Disorder, something I had never heard of before but as I read about it, it seemed like I was relating to everything I was seeing. It turns out that this can also be a symptom of adhd. So the way I saw it, if it walked like a duck and sounded like one and you knew there were ducks in the pond, it's probably safe to call it a duck! There was some closure in knowing that I wasn't just lazy and that there were things that could be done to help the issue other than having someone breathe down my neck and tell me to try harder. 

My (possibly now ex)bf (25) got irritated with me about a week ago when I posted a few links to adhd resources in our household's group chat about how to work around executive dysfunction problems and said I was just self diagnosing and giving excuses for not doing house work because I ""don't want to do it"". 
He has had problems with family members of his who would say they had this that or the other due to looking things up online. The way he was talking, he feels I am just being lazy because he's seen me do things in video games and help moderate a discord server without issues.

I was actively trying to get the other people in the house to understand what I was going through and trying to get help in making things like lists or something to make sure I get things done in a consistent and timely manner. The other housemates were willing to help at first until it blew up into an argument between me and him, with the others seeming to side with him.
I would appreciate any feedback on this I can get."
2061,!!TW!! Struggling with urges and friendships,"My SH urges are skyrocketing. As of right now, I have been clean for 3 days and 17 hours and that's going to be messed up soon. I hate urges because when I relapse I can't help but feel and believe that I am disappointing everyone more than I usually do. My closest group of friends act like they care about me in the slightest bit. If they truly care, I don't believe it. I simply acknowledge what they have to say while dismissing it. I hurt myself on call with them and they don't know what's up with me other than the things I tell them daily which barely scratches the surface. I just hurt and so does everything. They don't know that I hurt myself on call and it will stay that way. I firmly believe and think that not a single person will miss me. No one cares, I don't matter, I'm not worth it, blah blah blah. I've been slowly isolating myself from everyone so hopefully soon when I attempt again, they won't ""care"" as much because I've drifted off into the background/sidelines of their lives. I bring enough negative energy around them by solely existing and none of them needs that. I'm doing them a favor. I'm going to make their lives easier and this world a better place by killing myself."
2062,My parents are super inconsiderate and unsupportive.,"I honestly have gotten to the point where I hate getting out of bed, and have lost all of my appetite. When I tell my parents I feel horrible, they give me advice such as taking walks. I was diagnosed with arthritis a few years ago, and can barely walk. They tell me that I am lucky and that some people don’t have such loving parents, and I know that is true but it doesn’t make me any happier. My depression started a couple years ago, when my little sister was a still birth. They are always arguing with my sister or each other, and never have time for me. I cut myself when I am really depressed, and I try to tell them, “hey I feel like cutting and I haven’t yet” and they just tell me good job and forget about it. I honestly can not get mentally better unless I get away from them but it is pretty hard to do as I am only thirteen."
2063,Action-packed unique new fiction book written during a psychotic episode - Hunger Games meets LOTR meets GOT meets Dune! One dollar!,"  

Hello! 

I’m a young health professional who has just been through his first psychotic/manic episode, during which I wrote my first fiction book! It has what I like to think is a super unique plot loosely based on my mental health saga. 

It’s an action-packed adventure/psychological thriller/sci-fi.

The best part is that it’s available for just one dollar! 

Here’s the synopsis: 

On a tiny planet in a distant galaxy, warfare has evolved to the point that the mind has become a literal battlefield. As power-hungry warriors leap through eyes and seize thrones at the back of brains they create slaves and build armies. Sixteen year old Kahu is thrust from his peaceful external life into a chaotic internal world when his tribe is destroyed by Centre-Point, leaving him as the lone survivor.  
 Although his family are dead; they live on within his head. Armed with four defenders internally, Kahu meets a powerful beast who gives him an ultimatum, forcing him to unite the remaining tribes and lead a siege upon Centre-Point or risk extinction of his new tribe. As he meets other leaders Kahu discovers the truth, while growing more powerful with every fight.
