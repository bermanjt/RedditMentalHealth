0,"A Mentally Disabled, Bullying another Mentally Disabled","Hey Friends!

So I work with a community that is dedicated to helping individuals with suffer from Mental Disabilities. The community is spread out into five houses, with each containing 4-7 Mentally Disabled individuals.

So with my house, me and 4 of my other co-workers, are basically in charge of the same 4 Mentally Disabled adults. We basically share life with them in their house, clean their houses, play games, drive them to places they wanna go, and keep them happy and engaged. It's a great and lovely job (especially with me being a Senior Psychology Major)!

So here's the problem. There's this certain member named ""Jenna"" (not her real name; for confidentiality), and she always nitpicks on ""Nina"", on EVERYTHING she does. Like Jenna basically hates every single thing Nina does, whether it's talking about her favorite movies, telling jokes, or telling me facts about Dolphins. Jenna basically treats Nina like she is superior to Nina, and this evident in her authoritarian tone-change when asking her a question and feeling like Nina's mistakes interfere with Jenna's life (when obviously... They don't).

They are both 29 years old and Nina has the utmost patience and holds strong with Jenna's hurtful comments. What I will like to ask, what can I do for Jenna, who has a mental disability where a part of her brain was removed, to tell her not to treat Nina like she is ""beneath her""?

Thank you for any empathy and support!"
1,"For those who recovered from recurrent major depression, did the cognitive abilities return?","If not, were you able to retrain your brain to regain these abilities? 

Research seems to indicate MDD diminishes abilities in 7 cognitive domains: attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, decision speed, and information processing.  


I read many recovery stories, and try to follow their advice, but still find myself greatly diminished in the cognitive functions, which impairs my ability to feel integrated into work, social, and overall qol."
2,I have a hard time making decisions.,"A lot in life I find myself always having a hard time making decisions. Especially when hanging out with friends and I'm asked what I want to do or watch. I can never make a decision and just tell them ""I don't know, I don't care"" in fear of rejection in my taste of what I want to do I suppose.. anyone have tips on this? I know some of my friends must get annoyed with my indecisiveness."
3,Corona and mental health,"Have you ever considered how the actual Corona crisis effects the mental health? 
In Italy for example people have to stay at home the whole day and there are many people that live by themselves so they have nearly no social connection. Of course these people can phone or text with their friends but that's not like meeting them in ""real"" life, so these people could start to feel lonely. Also humans worry a lot about their grandparents and their school education, that's not good at all for the mental health.
In the last centuries we got used to going out for dinner, going to cinemas, discos etc. and now more and more people have to stay at home. That's a quite big change, it's not easy to get used to this.
But whatabout people with anxiety disorders, that are very afraid of infectious diseases or depressives that have no chance to try to work on their depression by doing sports or cultivating social connections because they have to stay at home? I suffer from OCD, I'm really coping with obsessive thoughts about the Corona virus, it stresses me so much that I decided to stop reading or watching news about the virus because it triggers my OCD.
There are many more examples about how the actual Corona crisis effects the mental health. I just hope we will get through this well."
4,I’ve realized there’s just too much wrong with me.,"This is the first time in my life I’ve realized that some people really just should not be around. I’ve been trying to find a purpose and be happy since I was 10. Nothing has worked and I’m honestly just...tired. Of being let down, used and hurt. My family? Uses me only for money, I thought loaning them money and buying them things meant I would get love back but once I couldn’t anymore I was useless. My friends? I had so many friends from JH-HS who turned out to be just my greatest bullies. I would try to branch out and meet new people but by senior year I was eating lunch alone in the bathroom by myself, hiding from everyone. I’ve only ever been in 2 relationships, both of them had cheated on me/abused me. Both of them were long term. My career? I feel stuck and I can’t leave because of financial stress. I feel so trapped in my life and so alone, let down and scared that I’m honestly tired of it. I have no one to talk to, whenever I bring anything up it’s ,”Well your fault that’s on you.” But like...I KNOW it’s my fault I just want to vent but I keep getting shut up. People only talk to me when I drink because I’m a funny drunk. I have been self harm free for 2 years and binge/purge for 6 months. But I feel like I want to go back and this time I want to end it all."
5,I feel overwhelmed by everything going on right now,"At the moment, I am just so overwhelmed by everything going on in the world (and in my life). My university is moving to online classes which I really dislike for several reasons, many of my international friends are flying back to their countries to be with their families, concerts (usually one of the happiest places in the world for me) I bought tickets for ages in advance are suddenly canceled or postponed, the panic shopping completely messes up my grocery shopping schedule and discourages me from even stepping into stores, my spring break vacation will likely not happen and all my sports practices are canceled too so basically all the fun things are not happening right now and I really don't know what to do. 
My boyfriend just told me that I've been spending way too much time on my phone lately and I'm trying to change it but right now, I feel like my head is just too busy dealing with everything. In addition to all of this, I'll get my wisdom teeth removed next week and I already had two panic attacks from just thinking about it. I normally handle changes quite well but at the moment, I have a hard time adjusting to everything because too much happened all of a sudden.

If anyone has some tips on how to handle this, I would be super grateful. 

Also, I would definitely appreciate suggestions for some fun hobbies/activities to try in the mean time, preferably involving no phones. I'm a woman in my early 20s, unfortunately not very artistic or creative and I enjoy sports and programming."
6,I am told that I am too negative and my girlfriend can't handle it very well. I feel so alone.,"Today I made no money as a server. The restaurant opened while all this chaos about the corona virus is going on. It was a solid six hour shift of nothing but occasionally getting a customer, but I essentially left with twenty dollars in my pocket. It wasn't a good day. I went home feeling kind of down and was waiting for my girlfriend to head back to her place after work.

When she told me I could come over, I did and it felt like a mistake. I walked through the door and she asked if I wanted to join her in a few drinks since we both had a bad day. I agreed to it. She told me that she was going to have friends over the next day, which is fine. I like her friends. They like me. I thought ""Finally some company this spring break. New people to talk to."" Then she told me that she would like some time with them herself. I then realized, I don't have anybody else to spend time with. Everybody is out of town or busy. I started to feel really bad. I told her that was fine. I'll just stay at my place. I was very sad about it. She picked up on it. Told me that her negativity is not good for her. That we were both in a fragile state. I got the feeling she wanted me to just force happy. I can't force happy. She just kept repeating how negative I was and how it might bring her to the verge of a panic attack, because she's prone to those and I kept feeling worse and worse, then eventually I just left. Told her that I'm not someone she should be around if she is going to be set off by my state. She asked when I will be back. I told her I don't know. Right now I just feel so bad. I'm trying to drink it away, but it feels like its all my fault. I'm so sad guys. I just want it to go away."
7,Phobia and lowering mental health,"Hi! I'm quite new to reddit and mental health communities and curious to hear about like-minded persons.

I am over 25 and have been suffering of a paralysing agoraphobia for a few years. No job, back to my parents' place, friends all far away, the idea of leaving house for ""unsafe"" places makes me sick (so no outside activity)...
I enjoy being fed, having my family around and time for hobbies, but it is not enough to make me happy anymore. I am trying hypnosis with a pro.

I know something deeper than the phobia is ""blocking"" me from improving but I can't figure what. After a very painful commute in february, I even started considering death as a suitable solution if I don't improve, thoughts that used to scare me. I haven't had future plans in years and don't know what I even want except healing.  The self-loathing is so bad I don't want/feel like improving skills or exercising. I am however not depressed (I sleep, eat, do things and am generally not sad, etc.)

I have good parents I see every day, good friends and a good long-distance partner I message often, but none of them can help me. It feels lonely and helpless, enough to rant online like this, haha. I used to be functional and my life is currently hopeless.

Is it abuse to share such dark feelings with the persons who care about me? Would rejecting my partner/friends for their sake be reasonable to protect them? Do you have tips on therapies that could help with agoraphobia? Does anyone have experiences about phobia making someone consider dying? I am open to any experience or support you guys feel like sharing.

Thank you for reading this!"
8,Am I crazy?,So I talk to myself A LOT. Like I will catch myself talking to myself inside my head but unintentionally I will move my mouth. Almost like I am reading a book and mouthing the words. I will have full conversations with myself and then I snap out of it and am disappointed that no one is actually there. I am not sure if this is healthy. I have done this my whole life and I feel like it is just a coping mechanism because I often feel alone. I have friends but I am always their second or third choice. I live at college with 3 roommates and when they tell me they arent going to be there i look forward to it because I know I can talk to myself loudly with no judgement. also i daydream a lot and it feels so real. Just posting this just incase anyone else does this and also feels like its weird. Any advice/comments are appreciated :)
9,for those who live a life by feeling...,"I live my whole life. by feeling. I let it dictate pretty much how i live and who i am as a person. and this can be a wonderful, wonderful thing. it really can be. letting your heart dictate and choose where it wants to go is an incredibly freeing way to live, and I’ve always wanted to be open. just live wide and be open so that maybe people will be open with me in return. I’ve had more “stuff” to deal with and process and cope and break down and understand than i ever have in my entire life. I pretty much spent the last 9 months processing a dream like life altering reality that I happened to find myself in (I’m not going to get into it but I was in a hospital for about a month and pulled from school for about 3, and had my final consultation just today. A year later) I know it takes time, and i’ve healed so much and know and have felt. on such a wide range. it’s truly incredible. But sometimes it’s almost too much. i’m just wondering if anyone else out there understands what i’m talking about. and how to deal with living a life by feeling. and how i can protect myself without limiting the beauty and bliss that comes with feeling the world around you."
10,I don't want to accept it...,"I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to accept my reality. U don't want to accept my flaws, my depression...I think it's because my mental well being scares me. I'm scared of being labeled ""insane"" I'm scared of being labeled ""depressed"" I'm scared of my doctor telling me I might be slightly psychotic. I'm not ready for this, I'm not prepared to face this. I never have been. The meds don't help, they all make me feel off. I'm left to wallow in my own sadness and I feel like I'm withering away. I guess I'm just scared of being me. I'm starting to subconsciously distance me away from myself. I feel like everything that's happened to me for the past couple of months have been out of my control. I don't think anymore, I don't have my mental voice anymore, my head feels wiped every 2 seconds, I've started hitting myself in the head to try to hit myself back to normal. I'm fucked up right now. I don't even know why, and I'm fucked up. I don't feel like me anymore. I just want to scream. I just need to tell someone, just want someone to hear me out and not judge me. I just want to be who I know as me."
11,Zyprexa made me pass out,"I was walking into work feeling very dizzy, I assumed it was from the medication I took yesterday night (trazadone) but I never felt it that strong. I go to clock in and feel my hard body feeling chills and feeling extremely dizzy then I pass out on the ground and apparently had a mini seizure. Has that happened to anyone else?"
12,I just want to be ok,"I am sick of feeling this way. Depressed, negative and worthless. On paper my life is perfect. I have a very supportive husband who loves me unconditionally. We have 7 kids who are all awesome and healthy. I love my job. I am supposed to graduate college in May. 

But inside I am falling apart. Last year I had a 4.0 GPA and this semester I am barely scraping my C- average that I need to graduate. I have random spaz attacks where everything comes out, and then I end up pushing my husband away. He tries so hard to get me through my attacks, but I somehow always end up making things worse. I hate it. I hate hearing voices telling me that I should kill my self. I hate knowing that everyone would be better off without me and happier not having to deal with me and my emotions.

I don’t really want to die. I love my husband and our children more than anything. But I feel like a huge burden. They walk around on egg shells trying not to upset me and I hate that it has to be that way. I want them to all be happy and have someone better in their lives who wouldn’t put them through so much. 

I just want to be ok."
13,"I think I have something, but do not know where to go","Trigger warning: self-harm and bingeing. I just needed to talk about my past and need help on what to do. I am not sure if this is the correct place, but here we go.

This is a bit of a rant type thing, but I just needed to get things off my chest. I am from the United States. I am a Sophmore in college and am starting to realize that I might have more problems than I thought. For multiple years in high school, I self-harmed. Even though I haven't self-harmed in years, I still have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. I have idolized suicide multiple times, and have even considered following through, but I could never do it because I do not want to hurt my mom. My biological dad disowned me when I was 10, and me and my stepdad have had a lot of issues. We fought like cats and dogs, and he has single-handedly made me feel terrible about myself. My parents knew about my self-harm but never did anything. My guess is they didn't know what to do and/or didn't want to make the problem worse. I have had bingeing issues since I was 12. When I was 13, I got really into pro-ana websites, but at 14 I started seriously restricting and bingeing. I use to eat so much and felt like I was out of my body. I remember one time I binged on a loaf of stale bread, and have eaten so much multiple times where I have puked (I never purposefully purged, I was just so full it happened). I have been bingeing for years, and still do to this day. I will spend up to $50 dollars on cheap food just to eat as much as I can. In college, I have felt suicidal, but haven't relapsed on self-harm. Just a lot of bingeing. I have never been able to hold down a friendship because for one reason or another I cut people out. I cut them out of my life and isolate myself. I have had and lost so many friends, it is so frustrating. But every friendship breakup is because I chose to do it. I have never told a soul about my bingeing, no one outside of my parents knows about my self-harm, and I have NEVER told ANYONE about my suicidal thoughts. To be honest, I have always avoided deep relationships, and have never had a boyfriend.

My mom is an alcoholic, and tonight she almost chocked. She was saying things like, ""you don't understand my pain"", and it clicked in my head how mental illness runs in my family. And maybe how all the loneliness, sadness, pain, anger, and problems I have had in my life isn't because I am bad or wrong, but it is because I have something I have never sought help for. Maybe I don't need to feel this way and life can be beautiful. Now there's just one problem. I am in between colleges, broke, but want to seek help. I do not think that right now is a good time to bring things up to my parents, and would rather do it on my own. Any advice?"
14,Help me,"Hi, 21 M here. I feel like my whole life and mind is spiralling down into a crappy depression and I feel absolutely terrible. I hate myself, the way I look, the way I think, how my anxiety restricts me compared to so many others who are comfortable in public. I have no hobbies anymore, I feel like my best friends are replacing me as they’re starting to hang out with someone much more and put me on the back burner. There’s a lot of stress in my family at the moment. I’ve never been in a relationship and feel so alone right now. I hate my university degree and hate the future I’m going to get from it. Everything feels so bad, I feel like giving up, I never feel like I’m going to get a break."
15,I've been accused of hurting the mental health profession.,"I just did a few AMAs today about my (pretty miserable) involuntary stay in a mental hospital last month, and when I admitted I lied about no longer being suicidal (why I was in there, suicidal ideation) just to get out of there, someone went on a tirade toward me saying I harmed the mental health profession and now the hospital I was at will use the treatments they used on me thinking they will work because I lied just to get out.  I don't know much about mental health but I'm pretty sure I hurt no one and no one's going to die because of me, or am I wrong and did I just do something horribly wrong?"
16,Increases Lamictal,I take lamictal as my main mood stabilizer. I was taking 100mg in the morning and 200mg at bed. I've been on this dose for 2 years. It's been changed to 200mg both morning and night. I've never had a reaction at all on the medication. Today is the first day I took it in the morning. As far as I can tell no reaction but good old anxiety is like what if you take your night pills and react in your sleep and you don't wake up for help. How likely is it that just this increase will cause a reaction? Would it happen on the first day? It's been just over 12 hours since I took the first morning dose of 200mg. Can someone please help ease this anxiety?
17,What is my brain/body telling me?,"I'm always tired no matter what. The time I go to sleep, how long I sleep, and when I wake up, it all just feels the same to me :(

Think of it this way - you know those tall ""high striker"" machines at amusement parks, where you hit it with a hammer and try to get it to go all the way up to 100? I can only get it up to maybe 60-70, and it just plateaus from there. That's my ceiling where I stop, and I can't get passed it, no matter how hard I try. I can only get that much energy, and then it just stays the same or goes down until I sleep.

I sleep because it feels good, yet I'm also forcing myself to sleep simultaneously. My body wakes me up, telling me it's time to get up because the sun has risen, but as soon as I do, I feel like shit and is sleepy and unproductive all day. I can't win. Oversleeping, undersleeping, and getting that 7-9 hours all just feels the same, and it's getting worse slowly over time."
18,"There's more to it, right?","According to my psychiatrist, I have childhood trauma.

I was diagnosed with depressive disorder. I agree that I am depressed but that only covers half of the issue. 

1. I get overtly angry at people who do not deserve it. I'm irritable at times. 

2. I have very few friends. My social life was never good because of some abandonment and relocation thangs. I know how to talk and ""make friends"" but never stick through with the relationship because I'm use to being left and i don't like people who i truly let in leaving. 

3. I get really hyper from nowhere and it can range from a day to 2 days, I think. I'm absolutely high on life and feel unstoppable. When like this, i get quite scared, I sweat and peers look at me odd. This might happen 2-3 times a month.  I don't do anything crazy like spending all my savings. Then I have a sudden mood shift.  

4. I have these realizations that I'm hollow.  In the sense you think (empty) and then ""hollow"" as in I don't recognize my hands. I do not feel attached to myself almost like a dream. I'll eventually wake up from a coma. 

5. I go elsewhere. Dissociate. I zone out and go away quite often.  When walking,  driving,  talking,  etc. This happens quite often in a given day.  

6. I do self harm and have ideation but have never made any plans.  I also consume alcohol to numb these emotions.  Honestly,  i don't why i consume. I just know it makes me feel better. 

7. I have a significant other who is unaware of my ideations, except for the depression. I try to act normal and not express how i really feel because i don't want to scare them.  
Maybe I'm over thinking it and might be wanting more explanation. I don't want to pay again for another appointment.... tooo costly."

20,I don't wanna live anymore. No one cares anyway. My absence wouldn't have an impact on anyone's life,I'm not ever going to be happy probably. Why should i continue to live then? I can't stand this shit anymore. I WANNA LEAVE. I WANT TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. WHERE THINGS ARE BETTER. Probably everyone else deserves to be happier. Probably I don't deserve to be happy and loved. I cannot wait. I want to go away.
21,Going down hill or just a burn out?,"I feel like I’m slipping into bad habits, such as, eating/binging almost every day, smoking much more than I used to, not working out as consistently as I used to, I’ve been having very big mood swings. ( I have been told by my therapist that I hold high expectations for myself, and by my teacher that I have imposter syndrome(?) shes a librarian )    does this seem like a burn out?"
22,Do you care about me? Will I be missed if I died? Will anyone have tears their eyes when they remember soumya?,I wonder if there's gonna be ONE person who'd shed tears of grief because of losing me.

25,Somethings wrong with my dog and no one cares,"I’m underage and living with my parents. I have no car, and no means to take my dog to the vet. She’s recently developed multiple sores/ulcers on her throat and is bleeding out of them constantly. I have begged my parents to take her to the doctor, and was told that it’s not a big a deal. When I started crying because of it, my mother told me it wasn’t cool of me to say that I think we should take her to the doctor because she’s just a dog and not worth the effort.
This dog is literally the only thing in my family I look forward to seeing because my family is one of the largest negative factors for my mental health. She’s like my baby, almost eleven and just a little younger then me. I’m literally gagging/dry heaving and sobbing with the thought that she’s hurting, or may possibly die. I don’t have access to any sort of therapist and the mere thought of her not being here anymore has been one of the biggest strains on myself for the past ten years. I’m already severely depressed and if my baby died I would be literally broken. I know it’s going to happen eventually and I should accept it, but I’m literally always paranoid about it. When she’s laying on the floor while I’m drinking tea or reading, I will stare at her chest to make sure she’s still breathing. Every time I come downstairs and I don’t immediately hear her I think she’s dead. I can’t imagine what’ll happen to my already unstable mental health if she passes.

I can’t talk to anyone about this because my family doesn’t care and I don’t want to weight this on my friends. I can’t even enjoy myself around her anymore because she’s always bleeding. She doesn’t seem to feel pain from them, but I can’t help but question what is happening.  How can I convince them to let her see a doctor and take me seriously?"
26,I could really use some advice,"Around 6 years ago I was at a party drinking with friends, we were underage and unsupervised. I fell and hit my head pretty hard on the tiled floor and didn't know where I was when I got up, I was very scared and distraught but my friends calmed me down and the party continued,

My mental health began to go to shit around this time and I dropped out of school shortly after due to panic attacks and not being able to get out of bed, I still to this day struggle pretty bad with mental health issues and find it extremely hard to concentrate aswell as it feels like I'm constantly daydreaming.

It's been 6 years since this incident and I am only now beginning to realise that all these problems could be connected to that night.

I'd like your opinion on whether a bad bang to the head could be connected with these problems

And also I'd like to know if there is anything I can do to hopefully move forward."
27,Wanting to move on yet not ready to move on,"I have this inner conflict. After talking to people with major depression resistant to treatment who have recovered, I feel like I wanna move on. They had severe depression which had no relief, but they recovered. I start to think, I shouldn't have any insecure attachment or codependency issues. I can move on like them, even if my appointment is postponed 2.5 months. The other part of me is thinking, can I move on from having an insecure attachment style to my mum? I want to be mentally stable and go overseas to work, go to the countryside, explore the bustling city. I want to ride scary rollercoasters again without getting too anxious. There is life outside a hospital and constant outpatient appointments. Probably black and white thinking. Its not an either or thing. I was so ready to move on, I managed to stay on for months on my part-time jobs, things were going well. Like I knew I got to a point where I didn't have serious self harm urges or suicidal ideation. I felt like I was healed by God too. (Christianity). I hated some parts of my past, but I loved some parts of my past: the clubbing, the rollercoasters, the events which I went to. I hated being bullied or left out or failing academically. But I loved it when I could actually excel in the modules I loved, and I could write about cool stuff. I was so ready to break away from the identity and labels people have given to me. But there are some events and situations which will bring me to feeling useless again. And stupid. Like accountancy or being in a social setting where I don't feel welcome. Like I feel, how hard is it to wait 2.5 months for the next appointment? Just live my life and do shit even if I don't have much of an income right now and wait for ncov to tide over before finding new jobs? Then the other part, is a child-like baby part which needs protection."
28,Who do I contact about a friend in a foreign country that said he will be attempting suicide soon?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory. I have a friend that just went to Germany that is definitely going to try to kill himself, and I’m not sure what action to take next. I don’t know his phone number, and he’s planning on deleting his social media soon. I just want to make sure he’s safe."
29,Hard time loving myself,"I’m extremely frustrated with myself because I can’t seem to love myself. I’ll love myself or think I do for a few months but then something happens like I gain weight or my crush rejects me and then uses me. Then I lose my confidence all over again and spend a lot of time consciously and unconsciously picking out flaws and trashing myself. And then when I try to change and get apps that spread positive and promote self love, it’ll work for a second, but then I get so stuck in my ways that it seems almost impossible to actually love myself. 

I feel like I’m on a infinite journey of improving myself and getting to a certain point of achievement and if I don’t get there then I’m not good enough. For example my weight. If I’m not skinny, fit, or if I gain weight back that I’ve worked so hard to lose, then I’m not good enough or pretty.

If my grades are lacking and are a C or lower then I’m failing and I’m not good enough. 

I feel like I need to be a certain way in order to love myself. I feel like I’m in a constant state of trying to fix myself. Anything that’s negative about me has to be fixed or I’m not good enough. And I feel like if I’m not in this state of mind then I’ll become lazy and let myself go causing me to not achieve my goals making me worthless. 

I’ve also found myself in situations where I avoid relationship or go for guys who don’t like or care about me because I feel like I’m not in the headspace that I should be in order to be in a healthy relationship. I feel like I need to be super confident and love myself and I’m not that and I’ve never really been like that ever in my life. So It feels like the possibility of being in a healthy relationship is impossible for me because I can’t seem to love myself. It’s like when I try to love myself, I get angry that I’m giving myself love and mad that I’m being compassionate and just irritated. And I don’t know why. It just irritates me and I prefer to help others instead. 

It also feels condescending when people tell me I need to work on myself because that’s all I do. Is work on myself, try to fix myself. I’m literally trying to improve all the time. And I make improvements but not on things that I want specific improvements on. I want improvements on my self worth! I mean it’s cool that I’m more social and a little bit more open and it’s great that I’m doing things that are out of my comfort zone, but I’m still self loathing 😡 and it’s making me upset! Why can’t I just love myself? Why is it so hard to do? Why does it make me feel irritated whenever I do give myself love. Like I actually hate doing it. But for some reason helping others makes me happy. It just doesn’t make sense!!!!!"
30,Recovering,"Recovering (I don’t know what’s wrong with me)

It was only since a year and a half ago that I stopped hanging out with abusive friends. Yet I still feel pain

(This’ll be really long)

I used to be in a group of girls that loved gossip and the majority of our conversations were about boys we liked. We’d spend a lot of our time talking to each other about our crushes, but because of all this focus on romance stuff, they’d get into bad habits (lying, insulting each other, etc.) which turned into hair tugging, screaming at each other and emotional manipulation. They’d always target me because I was the “jokester” of the group and I was always playful (just kidding or playing around). Even my own best friend would make threats to me. We’d do each other favours where if we got gossip about each other’s crushes, we’d trade for a bit of money. She’d eventually go on to scam me and occasionally steal my money. She’d then threaten to tell my crush lies about me (that I hated him, that I was a horrible friend) and I was so scared. Idk how I didn’t see through her empty threats till later, cause she’d threaten me every other day. It was so emotionally draining and I’d cry almost every other day. 

I think I finally lost it when I spent my last Halloween with them. They weren’t doing anything they’d promised (they promised to me and another friend we’d go out a bit) and when I was getting tired of them just sitting and gossiping, i told them I was getting bored and “when would we go out?”. The group’s leader snapped at me after I was getting tired, and she kept repeating to me “why are you so selfish, you’re so whiny and childish” and she cussed at me to the point where I cried. If you ever met her back then she’d scare the sh-t outta you. It was awkward for the rest of the group so they just watched. (I was a weak person before don’t judge please, I cried easily lol). The leader of the group was the most aggressive one, and was ironically, one of my longtime friends.

I think one day in summer I kinda finally snapped. I guess my brain had enough of the bs I was going through, and I completely changed after going outside for once-  . It was literally just one faithful day in summer, I cut ties with my crush (he turned out to be manipulative too, since he’d play around with me and three other girls’ emotions), I removed myself from the old group, blocking them and never speaking to them again. I reconnected with another old friend who introduced me to a new group

I love my new group so much they’re literally the best. But even after the year and a half, I still kinda feel the whiplash the old group gave me. I feel so bad. I’m supposed to get over it because it was all so petty, but it felt so emotionally draining that I feel like I’ve got a huge void in me now 

It’s not easy when the friends you had to let go were people you knew for 8+ years

Currently I’m fine. But I feel emotionally drained (a bit), really low energy, and sometimes I’ll stop my hobbies for weeks at a time. I’m really into art, and I’ve been having a major creativity block for 3 months now, which I keep hating myself for. If I stop a hobby for too long, I’d lose my practice and get weaker and weaker. I can’t stop having low self esteem

My confidence has gone up, but just because I’m confident when talking to new people doesn’t mean I have a high self esteem. And sure people joke like “oh yea I’m a bummer” but I literally can’t tolerate myself even when I’m doing nothing and everyone says they’re fine with me. 

I feel randomly stressed, not in social situations, but just thinking about the future, or thinking about everything I do, and how it could possibly hurt me in the future, I can’t stop. I hate it when my stress leads into physical pain (stomach, chest, muscle? Pain). I’m always stressed about wether I make people upset or not just by tiny actions (like if I joke or if I accidentally mix up something). The worst feeling is when my stomach feels like it’s sinking into me. Like there’s some sort of invisible pressure. 

Remember the friend I mentioned earlier that I’d trade information we had on each other’s crushes with? She’s still my friend now. But I don’t even know how to feel. Ever since all the drama stopped, she looks disinterested in me, our conversations are always awkward, and she still hangs out with the old group occasionally. I’m so freaking frustrated at myself because I’M the one who started talking about my crush in the first place. We used to have so much fun and now it feels like I’m talking to a shell of someone I know. She doesn’t like joking around anymore. Was I only interesting because of my crush situation?? 

Lastly I hate being so defensive. Whenever I see a story of someone online getting away with so much manipulative sh-t, I can’t help but go on rants and get angry for hours because I know what it’s like to be hurt by someone like that. One of my My online friends struggles with depression severely and when she got into a fight with an extremely popular fanartist, it only made her depression worse. I keep texting her to comfort her because I now know what manipulative people are like and it just makes me so sick. I’m scared that my defensiveness will make people think I’m crazy. When I hear about things like the Zoe Quinn and Alec holowka situation, petty online artists drama, or anything involving a sensitive topic dropped in the middle of drama, I can’t help but get upset, and I don’t want people to see me as this grumpy person that hates others. 


I’m so sorry this was so long but I’m honestly so tired of feeling really empty and I need some way to pick up my attitude and get happy again. I need to have some sort of motivation other than “oh, well just try” because I keep trying and I’m still stuck. I’ve been stuck for a while. I also need advice on how to regain motivation for my hobbies. Yes I draw occasionally, but it’s not as much as I wish I could do. When I see artists online pumping out 10 sketches a day, vs me that’s now on 2-3 per week, I get upset at myself. If anyone can help, please do. I really want to try getting better

(This isn’t to say I’m not ever happy, I have my moments, but I feel like I’m lacking a lot more than I already have)"
31,Nefu id 13 years old is progressing more than me,"He is becoming a great conversation.  Learning the li gos and Qs real great. Milestones are being met..

Then theres me. 26 and cant conversate cant do nothing my brain is paralized so im fucked. No im still mobile. Its just when you do your everyday life your brain has to work and process your thoughts and actions.. well i dont think. I jardly leave the house. Cant think at the moment. So im paralized"
32,I feel like a crappy human being.,"I have times where I feel really bad. I shut myself down. I go quiet, and I won’t say anything unless it’s not a yes/no question. It’s hard for me to smile or laugh. I sink into a bad place where I wish I could just disappear. I don’t want to do anything. I lose motivation. I stop caring about myself, and my future as much. I don’t eat at much. I isolate myself. I feel like a burden. Like people just tolerate me out of pity. I convince myself that nobody cares. Even the people who have shown the care plenty of times. Sometimes I feel angry. Sometimes I’m sad. Sometimes I don’t feel anything, which is the worst of the three. 

I was in that state for months. Starting in July, and gradually getting worse until it was really bad in late December. In Early January I suddenly got better. Started caring a little, and managed to feel happy and laugh and joke around. Started to turn back into me. I was happy that I was getting better. Though maybe I wasn’t actually getting better. I have days where I feel bad like that for no reason. I sink right back into that place. When I have a bad day, it’s pretty bad. I mean that as in, I immediately go back to wanting to disappear. Just vanish. My good days are where I’m able to be more of myself. My bad days are when J want to vanish. There is no in-between. 

I have some days though where I start off good/bad, and then by the end of the day, it swaps. It makes me feel like a bad person. I’m afraid people see me as just a moody person. As someone who has an attitude. The truth is on those bad days, I’m falling apart inside. I’m being torn down by myself. I’m not trying to hurt anyone else when I go quiet. I’m not trying to seem rude. I just can’t get out of my own head. I can’t convince myself that I have a purpose and that people actually care. I feel so bad about it. I feel like everyone is judging me when I have a bad day. I feel guilty, ashamed, and pathetic, which just adds on to how I already feel. I just wish someone would see that I’m struggling. I know people aren’t mind readers. I just wish someone could see that something isn’t right without me having to blatantly say it. I can’t blatantly say it. I’m too afraid. Someone did see once. They reached out to me. Helped try to get me professional help by talking with my parents. But what did they do? They gave me false hope. They kept saying they were looking for a counselor. I asked them. Multiple times. I asked if they were still looking. They said yes. Months later and nothing has happened. Not a damn thing. I get angry just thinking about it."
33,Recovering from past,"It was only since a year and a half ago that I stopped hanging out with abusive friends. Yet I still feel pain

(This’ll be really long)

I used to be in a group of girls that loved gossip and the majority of our conversations were about boys we liked. We’d spend a lot of our time talking to each other about our crushes, but because of all this focus on romance stuff, they’d get into bad habits (lying, insulting each other, etc.) which turned into hair tugging, screaming at each other and emotional manipulation.

34,A couple things I’ve been thinking about recently. I started EMDR therapy a few weeks ago. I’m not sure about the time frame and what my reactions should be. I did talk to my therapist at length and have done research about it but it seems as though it can affect people differently.,
35,I’m Living Life on the Borderline,"A poem about my experience with Borderline Personality Disorder




There’s things In my mind 
that I sometimes struggle to find
things like who I really am
if I looked deep inside 

These Intrusive thoughts
keep invading my mind
and they lead me to believe
that everyone will leave me behind

There’s something explosive
inside of my chest 
emotions leak out
I can’t keep them suppressed 

Can’t tell what is real
I’m so dissociated
it’s like right after something happens
the memory is asphyxiated

I can go from pure joy
To exploding with anger
and its so hard to control
the impulsive behaviors

I have so many conversations
inside of my head
and theres someone inside of me
that says I’m better off dead

By the time I was fourteen
I’d made my first attempt
only a freshmen in high school
yet I was treated with such contempt

Now I’m an adult
and nothings really changed
except for being told
there’s a disorder in my brain

Now I don’t want any attention
but I need some affirmation
does anybody really care
or am I just a mental patient"
36,Am I weird ? Wtf is wrong with me,"Idk if I need help idk if I’m ok I hate everything I hate everyone . Every single thing pisses me off irritates me or makes me so unbelievably sad idk what to do. I’m almost 18 have nothing left of my family life’s always been shit. Sometimes I can pull off looking happy when I go outside where other people are but I’m severely antisocial and have a very short social battery. Whenever I’m outside I can basically only think about going home where I feel comfortable. I hate school I hate anything where I gotta be out with people for a long time. I always feel unlucky, I feel like everything goes bad no matter what happens even if I have no control over things they still make me so fucking annoyed I can’t stand it. I feel like I can never get some peace. I don’t know of any mental illnesses in my family
Because I barely know them but I was told schizophrenia ran through and I’ve never really heard voices or seen things but sometimes I feel mentally ill with myself I feel like my thoughts jsut don’t match a normal person. Everything I do is so fucking sad and I can’t cry so it feels even worse. I never get anything I want no matter what nothing works out I have trouble learning -I can’t get help anywhere(for my mental whatever) or my mom would disown me cause she’s one of those people who think it’s all in your head and not real. I’m stuck pretending everything is fine

I seriously feel like there’s no point to life but I don’t have the balls to end it. I feel trapped life is shit what the fuck is wrong with me??"
37,I want/am going to hurt someone,"My sister and her boyfriend broke up. It’s been a nasty break up, and she’s destroyed. I’ve never been fond of that boy but she liked him so I never said anything. I knew this kid was a piece of shit. He broke up with my sister because of her pre-existing mental health issues, along with her gaining weight. I want to kill him. Or seriously hurt him. I know I could do it, I know where he lives, what school he goes to, what car he drives. I could totally kill/hurt him. My sister is my best friend. This man has destroyed her, and he is going to feel the same pain he’s caused her, but in different ways. He’s shorter than me, but he’s going into the military and also a black belt. I’ve got size on him but besides that he’s way stronger than me. I dint know if I could actually do anything to him, but I’ve got so much anger, so much anger brewing in me."
38,Life is too hard - how does one survive this life?,"I'm not made for this life, but I've also realized that it seems a lot of us aren't. Everything feels like too much almost all the time. It feels like life is moving so slow and so fast at the same time. How does one survive when they're constantly being tormented and tormenting themselves in their own brain? I feel trapped."
39,I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,"I have mood swings. Not just normal mood swings, but awful mood swings - one day i will want to kill myself and not talk to anyone and want to shut everyone out and then the next day i’m too hyper, too overactive first people to handle and too social and just wanna speak and laugh with everyone. One day everything is grey and black, the next it’s a blinding dazzling white where everything is ok and it’s all going to be ok. Sometimes they last ages, I’ll be in my ‘grey phase’ (i like to call it that) for days on end, maybe even weeks, and then something will tick and i’m happy as ever and never want life to end - and vice versa. i’m super clingy too. i’m 16, my family are together and i never really had any trauma as a child, and I have a girlfriend who i love and i’m quite popular in school and do quite well. but there’s days where i want nothing more than to kill myself, or to just stop existing. i have no reason to feel this way, but i do. there’s also this bubbling anger in me that lingers - not just anger, but a hatred toward everything, sometimes i imagine snapping and hurting everyone and everything.

i don’t know why one minute i’m fine and the next i want to die. it doesn’t feel normal. i need answers before i enter the grey phase again, i’m worried for my safety. please help me."
40,Possible Bipolar II Disorder?,Hi for years now I have struggled with depression and finding my place in this world. I don't have many friends and I have immense trouble finding new ones. I have been doing some research and I share some of the symptoms of bipolar II like having unbearable depressive episodes that last as long as two weeks and followed by self destructive ones that cause people that might have been my friend to distance themselves from me and I really am trying to look for an answer. I think its bipolar because several people in my family have suffered from bipolar and my grandfather struggled with it his whole life. If someone could help me figure this out that would be greatly appreciated as I desperately want to get the help I need to be happy again.
41,I’m in a Hole That I Can’t get out of,"Before I start, I’d just like to preface this with a few things: sorry for the formatting (I’m on mobile), I am not suicidal, and I’m gonna try my hardest to describe what I’m feeling; I’m having a hard time putting it into words so bear with me. Thank you. 

For the past few years, I haven’t felt like myself. It’s been so long that I don’t even know what being me is even like anymore. I used to be able to speak and have conversations with people, it was great. Now I can’t talk to someone outside of a professional atmosphere even if I tried. I feel like I’m very very alone, even if I’m in the company of others. It feels like I’m in a pit with people lining the edge with their backs turned; they’re all talking and having a good time. I’m at the bottom of the pit too scared to make a sound, almost as if someone’s covering my mouth. 

I don’t know what I’m so scared of. I really don’t, but social interaction just paralyzes me these days. Even when I do have interactions with people, I talk like I’m at a job interview. I can’t help it, that’s just where I default. I want to meet people, I want to speak, I want to do so many things, I just can’t. 

It feels like I can’t connect with anyone. Nothing about me matches up with the rest of me, if that makes sense. This makes meshing with any group very difficult, because no one in said group can relate to me. I want to reach out, but every time I do I feel an emotional pain so intense it starts to feel physical. I just don’t know what to do about it.

Thanks for reading, I’d write a tl;dr but I don’t know how to make it coherent. It feels like it’s barely coherent as is."
42,Fuck the coronavirus,My life was finally taking a turn for the better. I talked to my parents for the first time and agreed to try therapy. Then the virus happened. School is cancelled and I can’t leave the house. No more therapy and no more distractions. I don’t think I can survive. There is nothing I can do except think.
43,I don’t feel real,Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and remember what I was like as a kid. When my mental health wasn’t so bad and I could focus and feel things normally and just exist in the present without worrying about every little thing. I miss it. I am going to work to go back to that. I don’t know how it progressed so poorly over time but I need to stop my mental illness form getting worse.
44,"With this whole Coronavirus and social isolation days on end, how do you prevent getting gradually too much “in your own head”?","I’m 25, female. I have always enjoyed spending time alone, in fact I pride myself in being my own best friend not for any social problem but because I genuinely enjoy my solitude and being alone with my thoughts. 
I noticed a few months ago that if I isolate myself for too long I tend to get sucked into my own thoughts where my mind becomes a toxic unbearable place, that I just want to run away from myself. It starts off positive while I recharge my introvert batteries reading a book, painting or watching a show, really enjoying my solitude. But then it tapers off to a compulsive recollection of memories and racing thoughts and gradually I slide into plain depression: no energy, sadness, obsessive thoughts about past hurts and trauma, the sort of things that leak into my consciousness and I usually avoid thinking about because I obsess and can’t snap out of it so easily. 

Now, four days into working from home and this social isolation from the whole virus chaos, even though I’m with my roommates and digitally in touch with my close friends, this cycle is starting to happen again. 

What advice can you give, if any? I don’t know if anyone else is going through something similar but I’d really appreciate some insight."
45,Help please,"What do you think about all of this?
I am not okay, and have just come to terms with this fact. Everything is getting worse mentally, and has been but didn’t notice until a few days ago. I opened up to an online group of people in a game called VR Chat (Virtual chat game). By opened up I mean I got scared when they came to close and started to breathe really heavy and beg them to stop. I thought this was normal until they asked why I reacted as such. I just stated that it is normal for me, no worries. They then told me how it wasn’t normal to have panic attacks. I didn’t  know that not being able to breathe and freaking out + hiding was a panic attack and told them that if that was a panic attack then I have them every day, which I said jokingly. They then proceeded to converse (two guys) about how I may have been abused sexually or physically. I respoded by freaking out for an unknown reason and they helped calm me. When I got off the game I started to realize that no one around me reacts to things like I do (sometimes have panic attacks for no reason to).
My online friends (I don’t trust anyone irl) told me to get in therapy. This is almost impossible by the lack of a phone, car, family member assistance, or place in my town to go to. 
At the beginning when I stated that my mental state is getting worse I kinda meant I can’t control myself anymore. I do not believe in online tests and are nothing like the real thing. Yet a month ago (before opening up) my symptoms for all and anything mental related was high, today every single test I took came out 1/3 times stronger than a month agos.
This tells me that I am spiraling down really fast from purely opening up to someone. This means that there is something wrong and I am not self diagnosing that came out positive. I am solely stating that maybe it isn’t normal to score so high on the tests.
Even a little answer is nice so please I need some sort of help/answer/guidance/anything
I will accept whatever anyone syas"
46,Angry at other people's happiness,"Every time I see people being happy and having a good time I  get so resentful and envious. A while back, when I was still on campus, I saw a group of people. They were all laughing, joking, and having a good time. My chest swelled with resentment and envy. Why couldnt I have that?! Why could I just have one friend who cared? I just want to matter to someone. I wish I could be happy. Why dont people like me? Why cant I connect with others?"

49,My friend needs help and I only have so long before I get pushed away,"this is going to be crossposted to multiple mental health subs fyi

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine who's always been very open with me facetimed me recently and I'm very worried about her. She 's obsessed with a guy who's told her in the past that he likes her, but lately he's only been talking to her so he can keep fucking her. She told me she's only happy when he acknowledges him, and that's becoming less and less frequent.  She's never been a very serious person, and so as soon as I try to step in and help I can almost guarantee I'm gonna get pushed away in &lt; a week. She's also high from the second she wakes up until she goes to bed, so nothing I say will be taken to heart. I have two concerns: 1) she's going to hurt herself (suicide is unlikely). as she told me that she hurt herself for the first time a couple weeks ago. 2) she's going to move onto more dangerous drugs. I have no chance of getting her off weed, but if I can keep her from switching to a more dangerous drug, and make her happier, that's a win. She doesn't have a good relationship with her parents, and I don't know them well either, so going through them isn't really viable. She has a sister, but her sister doesn't like her much (and that's not from her point of view, I've seen it in person). Her friends are all weed smokers and partiers. I myself have never done a single drug/gone to a single party, and really the only reason we're still friends is because we both used to be mildly depressed, and we think each other is nice + funny. She refuses to acknowledge that there's a problem/she should get over the guy, and I don't think the guy cares about her much, so going to him isn't really an option. She's really athletic and so is almost never busy, and her parents are semi-anti-medicine, so therapyy/meds isn't an option. I'm all out of ideas, but I'm really concerned for her. Any help is much appreciated."

I'm trans F&gt;M and have gone through full transition. It doesnt have to be an issue but if its something you had questions about then I dont mind answering them as im quite open. 


My interests include:
* Gaming - anything from The Sims, to Fifa and CoD, to collecting older games. 

* Animals - they're all awesome, say no more. 

* Sport - anything from F1 to football (British) to cricket. 

* Politics - I'm quite a free thinker and tend to hold opinions on a case-by-case basis so I dont really hold a specific set position but I'm willing to talk to people from anywhere on the political spectrum. 

* Psychology - anything from serial killers to theories to social experiments. 

* Documentaries - anything from mental health to conspiracy to natural disasters. 

If you feel you have anything remotely in common or just simply want a chat then feel free to send me a message maybe with a few facts about yourself or your interests and I'll get back to you when I can depending on how many messages come through.

I told her about how when I cry I feel no sorrow. Mabye a little at most. It made her cry. I wish she didn't. I want to know if this is all normal. Maybe i need help? I really dont know and Im confused. I never really thought much of it till now. I really need help."
52,Parents have screwed me. Lots of issues. And I don’t know what to do.,"This is going to be a long vent. I’m 18 almost 19, and I’ve been extremely depressed. And I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. And there is just a lot I need to get off my chest.

There is a lot of emotional abuse my parents have put me through. My dad cheated on my mom many times, threatened to leave, and was hardly there. The was a lot of verbal abuse from both of my parents. I remember when I was young, my mom told me it is all my fault that she is sick and other stuff like that (she has chronic illnesses). My dad has threatened to beat me. They’ve done questionably sexual things in front of me. Which jacked up my mind and caused me to do some stupid mistakes as a hormonal teenager. I also remember my mom sexually touching me a few times when I was younger. And I didn’t understand at the time, but it fucked me up. And it is probably also part of what caused me to do the stupid stuff I did as a teenager. I don’t know if she was on her meds or what when these things happened. But when I talked to her about it, she says that it never happened, and that she would never do that and yada yada.

On top of all this, I was homeschooled and socially isolated all throughout my teenage years. Therefore, I have no social skills, and I don’t know how to make friends or talk to people. And I’m extremely lonely. 

They’ve also made me work for them from a young age. From the age of 11 or 12, I would help do construction type work or work on cars etc. and now at the age of 18 almost 19, my knees are jacked up and my health is deteriorating, and overall I just feel like an old person. 

Speaking on health, they’ve also never taken it seriously. I haven’t been to the dentist in over ten years because they didn’t take me to even get them cleaned all this time. And now I have a mouth full of crooked teeth and cavities, and I need to find out how to fix them since I’m 18. 

I’ve also noticed some symptoms building up and I’m getting worried. Ever since a young age, I’ve had a swollen lymph node behind my ear. I’m starting to have difficulty swallowing. I’ve noticed that I have double vision. One side of my face is dropping as well.

This has me worried because I have a family history of Muscular Dystrophy, Autoimmune Diseases, Arthritis etc. my mom has multiple chronic illnesses including Myasthenia Gravis. My Grandpa Died from ALS. My uncle has fibromyalgia. My grandma died from cancer.

I just all around have horrible genetics. And I’m worried that there is something wrong with me as well. And I can’t get checked or anything because I just simply can’t afford it.

There is also mental issues I’m dealing with that I can’t afford to get checked yet. I’m sure I have ADHD, obvious depression and anxiety. And who know what else.

Everything just feels hopeless. I don’t know what to do. And I just can’t take it. I feel like I’m cursed to live a life of pain. And I honestly just want to end it all. I really just want to die."
53,I found out I’m adopted and not an only child,"I found out I was adopted a few months ago. I’m 19 years old. I found out from my bipolar aunt who told me through text. My biological father is my adoptive mother’s first cousin. It was determined I would be adopted while my birth mother was pregnant, so my adoptive parents started the adoption process when I was a few days old. 


I also found out I have two sisters. I went and visited them about a month after I found out. They live across the world. My sisters are 21 and 16. They’ve always known about me. In fact my entire family- aunts uncles cousins even my two neighbors and best friends knew since we were 5 years old. 


When we used to visit India, we would meet sometimes but they kept my older sister away from me because we look alike and it would’ve confused me. 

A couple years ago I even found a video from my 7th birthday where me and her were dancing together and I didn’t question it at all even though we looked like twins. I remember thinking “yeah genes are crazy.. second cousins totally can look alike” I guess I never had a reason to think otherwise. 


I’m having trouble processing I think. Everyone told me I’m handling it well but to be honest I don’t think my body processed until after I came back from my trip. I’m processing everyday and it’s so hard because I don’t have someone with me all the time to talk to. I’m an only child. 


My adoptive parents love me a lot I know that. I think I’m having a hard time to process because it doesn’t feel like I’m adopted. I’ve been given so much love by everyone in my life. 


I’ve been FaceTiming my older sister.  Trying to continue to form a relationship and bond with her. It’s easy to talk to her. I have trouble when my birth mom takes the phone away and talks to me. At this point of my processing, I don’t want to talk to her. It makes me uncomfortable. She expects me to talk to her like I’ve known her my entire life. 


They’ve known about me forever but I really just found out and I need time. I can’t just form a bond with you magically. 

It upsets me when she does that. I also gained 15 lbs and with my face chubbier I see the resemblance I have with my birth mom and it unsettling. I think that’s because I convinced myself I look like my adoptive parents for 20 years and to finally see my self look like someone else is really weird. 


I don’t know. There’s so much going on in my head and everyone thinks I’m fine but I don’t think I am. I can barely focus. I’m pretty much failing all my classes whereas I usually get A/B grades. 


I saw a post on Instagram with a friend and her sister and the captions read: “the greatest part about having a sister is being able to call her my best friend” 


That brought me to tears because I don’t feel that way with my sisters and I want to be able to. It’s so hard with them being across the world and me trying to process and deal with what I’m feeling. 

It’s hard because although we’re sisters I’m afraid our relationship will always be that of cousins. 

Things at home are a little difficult too. My mom is bipolar and has depression. She takes her medication but sometimes she’s difficult. My parents don’t really consider my mental health and they prioritize my moms. I feel my mental health is falling apart and no one is taking me seriously to the point where I can see a therapist or a professional and get help. With my moms condition it makes living at home a little difficult and makes it feel suffocating. 

Earlier today I told my mom “I hate you when you act like this” and in hindsight I should’ve chose different wording but her response was “I know your older sister is teaching you this” and that BROKE me. Because first of all, my older sister is so sweet and respectful. My moms known her forever it’s her cousins daughter.  And it makes me feel torn apart and helpless. It makes me feel like I can’t try and form a bond with my sister because my mom feels whatever she’s feeling.  


I’m sorry it’s not an organized post but I need to let things out :("
54,Fuck life to be honest,"I don’t even know where to begin with this. But just life is a disaster. The mental pain, consumes me everyday. Getting to me. The thought of Chelsea is always there. I gave my all to her, she was always first, I did so much for her, always made sure she was okay..... she never did the same for me, never ever. She was my priority. I gave her so many chances, but she kept destroying those. Made a lot of promises to, to me about how she loved me, wont get with anyone, but still did. Lied to me, destroyed my heart. Going through one of the worst heart breaks ever at the moment. I can’t stop thinking about her. Just the thought of her with someone else kills me inside, I know she doesn’t know this is on my mind. This is all I think about. Doesn’t help that suicide is always there as well. Knowing there’s always another way out helps. “Just overdose...... life doesn’t matter anymore. Life isn’t for everyone”. So many times I nearly have, but backed out at the last second. I really don’t know why, I truely, truely don’t know what’s stopping me still. School found out about all the suicidal shit, called my mum. Told her everything. Had to tell my dad as well. I think they think I’m a danger, school thinks it as well.... school isn’t doing a single thing to help, just put it all on me and my parents. I don’t know how much longer I can take this mental pain. Depression, anxiety. Everything, what’s the point. When all these haunt my body. Everybody thinks I’m happy but I’m not, here is my confession. Still love Chelsea so much, but, don’t think she feels the same. Too caught up in this other guy. I don’t know if she’s gonna message me, I don’t know if I want her to, to be honest. If she does, might just send her this paragraph. She’ll know how I feel. My family life is okay at the moment I guess. I’m just unlucky as hell. Having been sick for so long, got a concussion as well from a friend, all while I found out Chelsea got with someone else. I can’t take this anymore, crying writing this. Savannah, Eva, Nikita, Spencer all worried for me. But I don’t want them to be. I know I’ll be okay in the end. No matter what happens to me. Might go out on my own terms. Depression has destroyed my mental state. I don’t see myself recovering from it ever. Lost so many friends, depended on people too much. Maybe, I was the problem in my last relationship with her. Maybe she didn’t do anything wrong. Was I too dependent on her? Did I try too much? Was I obsessive? I don’t know anymore. Maybe I’ll never find out. “I love you so much. I don’t want anyone else”. “Nooo Joel, I won’t get with someone else in chaing Mai. I love you, and only you”. Hopefully the mental pain stops soon. Don’t think it will. Considering while writing this, just to take my own life tonight, tomorrow, whenever. I don’t even know/care. I have no interest in life anymore. No interest in anything. Just wish I was dead to be honest. Wouldn’t have to deal with all of this mental pain anymore. Wish my family understood how I felt, and just, just let me go. I don’t care if it’s selfish. It’s selfish to give my all to this world and still feel like nothing, still feel like a waste of time, money, space, oxygen. Whatever. Because that’s what I am. I don’t deserve any of this I have. That’s what makes me feel worse as well. Getting what most kids, what most people work their whole life’s for, and still just wanting to be dead. Sometimes I just, I wonder what I’d feel like to be walking to my bus stop and getting hit by a car, a truck, whatever. Just, all the pain. Gone in a split second. Sounds nice, really does. I don’t care what happens to me next, just as long as death happens. I can’t imagine being alive for another, 30, 40 even 50 years. Scares me to think I’m gonna be around for a long time. Going to make sure that doesn’t happen.  Drinking and taking drugs to forget the pain, half the time I can’t get this shit out of my head. Just always drowning in my own thoughts, pain, whatever."
55,"I want to live, just not the way I'm currently living","So I have believe I have been suffering from depression for almost 1.5 years now (atleast I believe I suffer from depression) and recently I gathered enough courage to tell this to my parents and friends, they helped me, listened to me and I can tell that they do love me, but also they don't believe I have depression, they say I am just overthinking and it's all in my head and honestly I think maybe that's true, anyways I am not here to discuss about that. What I wanted to say is that when I told them about my situation I realised that maybe I don't want to die, I want to live, but I just don't want to continue the way I am now.

I want to progress forward, want to build better relationships with everyone, want a family and have kids (I know this all sounds cliché) but just not in my current situation, I don't want to burden anyone with my worries and mental health issues."
56,Forgiving People That Hurt You The Most,"I’ve realized recently after a conversation with my husband that I haven’t forgiven a single person in my life that has done me wrong. Mostly significant people in my life who have wronged me. Yes, I have gotten over the situations themselves but I haven’t forgiven the people responsible for the pain those situations caused. I feel like I need to forgive these people for MYSELF. To fully let go. But where do I start? What mindset should I put myself in to handle the emotions left over to be able to let go?"
57,An Odd Thing That I've Became Aware Of,"I dont know if this is due to a mental illness or something ( I am diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety) but Im very much easily influenced. Or get easily emersed into things. I wonder if anyone else expierance this and if anyone has any info on it. But ill read something, hear something, watch something and Ill easily attach to it and become it or do it in daily life. It can be the smallest thing to like a personality trait. Like Ill become that person mentally for a bit. Like Ill watch a movie and feel so mentally attached as if im in it, it doesnt even have to be a good movie? same thing with other forms of meida like comics or stories. And the more I think about it the more I'm like how much of my personality is mine? I dont know. I tried to do some googling but its really hard to explain or google. I dont know what this could be."
58,I desperately need advice... Situation down below,"So I have had this friend since 2013. We have been friends until last September. Me and my friend have been on and off a couple of times, but this time it was super nasty and it hurt me a lot.

For a long time now, I have been struggling with a very toxic and dangerous mentality. Basically I believe myself to be manipulative and a liar. It was because of these things that I got into an argument with my friend. I began to say nonsensical and confusing things, telling them to quit religion and to be your own man. Hell I even threatened to commit suicide if they didn't change... I feel very ashamed for this and since the parting, I yell at myself for being the way that I am now. I truly do hate myself.

But I want to change that. And this is a step I must take, but the thing is, I don't know how.

I don't know how to think in a more healthy mindset and I don't know how to make up to my friend for hurting them. Should I even make the attempt to try and apologise? They have blocked me on all platforms and I haven't tried to interact with them again since.

I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. But I don't want to be this kind of person anymore and I truly do need advice on how to better myself and if I should even try to explain myself and apologise to them. Please help me"
59,I don't feel fulfilled,"I feel like nothing I do in life brings me fulfillment, I'm doing the same things over again every single day and I hate it. I feel all of my friends would rather have someone else around, I know they are my friends but, I feel like I'm the last person in our friend group they want to be with at any given time, like I'm the last choice if no one else is around. I really enjoy talking with my friends and other people but I'm too socially awkward to go out and meet and talk to new people. I don't feel depressed or anything like that, more like a rut that I can't get out of."
60,I am gaining pleasure from suffering,"I have recently begun feeling positively towards overtly negative situations. Likely as a result of me trying to feel positively towards my negative life and forcing happiness. As an example I began laughing at the thought of me beating my future children earlier today, cut myself for that thought. Cant tell the doctors about this or im in deep shit, how should I proceed?"
61,My sexual assault story (trigger warning),"I'm sharing this in hopes that it may inspire others to speak up and no longer be silenced.

Shortly after my 18th birthday, I made a profile on a dating app (I'm not going to say which one at this time) uploaded some pictures, came up with a cute little bio, and I was all set. At first things were pretty slow, not a whole lot of activity, it was boring to say the least. But one night I saw this one girl and thought ""Hey she's pretty cute, I'll give it a try"" sent her a message and at first there was no response, but the day after I saw that she had messaged me back. We got to talking and we actually had a few things in common, I thought things were going really well, it felt like I had finally found something good. So we talk for a few days and I eventually asked if she wanted to meet up and go on a date, and to my surprise she said yes, I was super excited to go out on a date with this girl, cause she seemed really amazing. I remember she had told me she was gonna take an Uber because her dad needed her car, which was understandable, I thought it was a little weird, but what could go wrong, right? 

So, the day of the date finally arrived and i was super excited, we were texting has we were getting ready and she said she felt super excited about it as well. So I we planned to meet up at a restaurant, I got there first so I was waiting outside for her, we were texting for a bit then she stopped answering me for a bit, I wondered why, well when she pulled up in her truck and not an Uber 10 minutes later, I had my answer. 

We go inside and get a table then we ordered our drinks and browsed the menu before deciding what we were gonna get. So we both order, get our food about 5 minutes later, and start talking and asking questions to get to know one another. We finished our meals, I paid the bill, then we drove over to a Starbucks across the street and had some coffee and hung out in there for a bit. 

Now, again I wanna give a trigger warning before this next part. *TRIGGER WARNING*

We get done at Starbucks then she asked if I wanted to ""fool around"" in her truck, and being the freshly 18 year old I was at the time, (this was December 2019 I had just turned 18 on the 11th) I said ""yes please"" we got into her truck, drove to a semi-secluded area and proceeded to make out in her car. Now, since my eyes were closed, because i""m not weirdo who keeps his eyes open when kissing someone I didn't what happened next. We're kissing and next thing I know, her pants and underwear were off and she was on top of me. At some point during the kissing and stuff, she managed to remove the bottom part of her outfit within not even a minute. She got on top of me then got off for a quick second and proceeded to forcefully pull my jeans off, then my underwear, and since I had no control over the situation, I was fully erect. After pulling my pants and underwear off forcefully, she proceeded to stick my dick inside of her. At this point, I already knew I was being raped, I already knew what was happening. And since her truck was a confined space, I had no where to go, if I made noise she shushed me, has she raped me. she was pushing herself on me so hard I was pinned against the passenger seat, trapped, with no where to run. About 3 minutes before I was about to ejaculate, I told her ""shit I'm gonna cum"" she immediately removed my dick from her vagina and then stuck it in her butt (sorry for the crude wording but as I'm typing this I'm reliving it) she was riding it so hard it kind of started to hurt, next thing I knew I was cumming inside of her butt hole. It was not pleasent, she knew I was a virgin and she knew she could trap me. I sometimes still blame myself for putting myself into that situation so blindly. But, what's done is done and there's nothing I can do to change what happened that day. 

If you read the whole thing, thank you. So much."
62,Am I being childish or unreasonable?,"Throwaway account because reasons.  I have a boyfriend who I've been with for around 3 years and we are very close.  We enjoy the same types of video games and tv shows and enjoy playing them together.  But I have a problem I keep facing... I'm in college full time and he is part-time so he has more free time than I do so he is able to get further than me in games and tv shows.  At the beginning of our relationship, I showed him a game I really enjoyed and he became obsessed with it and soon he knew more about it than me and had beaten it many times over when I had yet to complete it.  Recently, I showed him a tv show I really liked and was watching it. He started watching it together and we really enjoyed it, since it was finished we could marathon it.  Yesterday he told me he finished watching it without me.  I didn't have time to finish it even though I was farther in it than him and was just watching older episodes with him but he finished without me.  

Both times I had just a feeling of hurt and depression and the feeling that why should I even bother.  It's gotten so bad I won't play a game I bought just because he got way too far than me.  Maybe I'm jealous that he has more free time than me... I feel so childish feeling this way.

What do you guys think?  Am I being selfish?"
63,Looking for information on several stress/PTSD/depression -related disorders for help in accurately portraying a fictional character,"As the title states, I'm working on writing a character for a fictional story. I want to portray him as accurately as possible in regards to his past, and I'm having a bit of trouble finding good information for some of the details of PTSD and related disorders, and I'm having some difficulties understanding how some of it works. Specifically, I want to better understand what happens during PTSD flashbacks and how they work, how dissociation works, how isolation affects people, particularly children or people who experienced extreme isolation as children, how children respond to traumatic situations and how they're affected by PTSD, and what other disorders and symptoms can be caused by severe PTSD/DESNOS.

If you have information you'd like to share, you can reply to this post, DM it to me, or you can DM and ask for other social media accounts I have (Currently Gmail, Discord, Office 365, and Flight Rising) and talk to me through there.

The disorders and topics I need details, advice, and firsthand accounts on the most are:

\- PTSD and DESNOS (C-PTSD) 

\- Dissociative disorders 

\- Effects of sensory and social isolation

\- BPD (Borderline personality disorder)

\- Somatic symptom disorder

Some other disorders and topics I'd also appreciate information on are:

\- Acute stress disorder

\- ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder)

\- Agoraphobia

\- Antisocial personality disorder

\- Bipolar

\- Depression

\- Self harm and suicide

\- Schizophrenia

Information you share won't be given to anyone else in context, and will only be used to better design a fictional character. If I mention any info given, it won't be accompanied by any usernames, defining personal information, or links or references to this post or any replies made on it. 

I don't work for any organizations, nor am I doing any studies. I merely wish to better understand PTSD and other related disorders and topics, and to be as accurate as possible in the portrayal of my character, as I feel a lot of characters written to have PTSD nowadays aren't as accurate as they should be. 

I will mention this subreddit in the acknowledgements of whatever media I decide on for my character's story.

If requested, I can post a spoilered comment including my character's backstory/source of trauma, if you believe it'll help in giving more accurate info.

If I've done anything wrong with this post, do tell me, and I'll fix it if I can."
64,Why do I want to die but not through suicide?,"I want to die, my life is just too bleak , but I don’t want to commit suicide because I think it’ll be worse on my loved ones. Instead, I hope its through some accidental means like a car crash or getting shot. Idk help me out. I’m 17 if that helps."
65,I did it again after being self harm free for a month,"Just when I thought I was getting better at coping my mental health and stop having self harm tendencies, I did it again last night. I’m so disgusted of myself how I kept telling myself that I’ll not do it again because my boyfriend and my family would be so upset to know that. My boyfriend knows about it but my parents don’t and neither do I wanna tell them about it. I started to get tattoos and hoping that it would maybe allow myself to like my body more and also curb with my self harm tendencies. Right now, I’m just thinking of the appropriate timing I can cut myself again without anyone knowing. I wish I could just stop craving for it."
66,"I am fed up with myself. I am tired of my poor decision making skills, poor self-confidence, poor attitude, poor social skills and dismayal mental acuity and intelligence.","I am 31 M. Finished my PhD in mechanical engineering last year. Disastrous PhD. No further offers of postdoc or jobs. I am continuing with my PhD supervisor as a postdoc.

Currently, I am waiting for my work permit so that I can start getting paid. Not have been paid for the last 3 months.

Already in 1300$ debt in my credit card. Immigration processing will take more time, thanks to coronavirus; I am screwed.

I really like a friend who's 4 years older than me. I want to ask her out but feel pressured about what my Indian parents (living in India) will think about this. I am also ashamed of my broke ass and don't want to ask her out like this. I never had a long-term relationship. I am not able to get myself out to date as well.

I am dumb for all the career and life decisions I have taken so far. I funked my 3 exams during my undergrad. Probably that was a sign to accept the fact that I am dumb and I shouldn't go for further studies. I still did my master's and PhD degree. Asshole me.

I am just fed up of not being happy."
67,I want to fucking kill myself and everyone I know tells me I should do it.,"I wish I was never born. The people I need to survive and get through life screw me over like they were getting paid to do it. My cousins tell me they are going to kill me and they wish I was never born. I slept at my cousins house one night, the cousin that I look up to and wish I was just alike. The person that I wish there was something I could have done or been to have her approval and like. She smeared poop all over me in my sleep bc in her jurisdiction I am “a lesbian” and unacceptable to her and have no right asking her to be my friend. All my other cousins and aunts and uncles agree with her and say she is ok to put me in situations where I will fail just to prove to me that I am “less than human.” The saddest part about it, she’s just in the list of terrible things people do to me and the whole setting me up to fail is standard in my book of interactions. It just really hurts when it is family bc aren’t they the ones who are supposed to help me but instead they are my worst offenders. I’d like to say more but crisis counselor just interrupted."
68,I think I am too happy.,"I made this account just to make this post. I'd like to maintain my anonymity to prevent people bashing me for my 'non-issue'.

I think I am too happy.

I was recently told I failed my Spanish oral examination, yet I feel no disappointment or anger or any desire to improve. I was lectured by my parents about my lack of drive and my 'fear of failure'. And I am still quite content.

I have an assignment due tomorrow, which I have not even yet begun. However, I feel absolutely no stress or dread... I even have the time to create a Reddit account to make this post. 

I haven't done any homework or studied at home whatsoever this entire school year. I am behind in my homework, my assignments are garbage, I'm probably going to fail... yet I still feel the same.

I am most likely going to fail in life due to a lack of drive, and I don't really mind. I don't care enough to take my driver's license test or to study for my exams in a few weeks, because I am content as is.

To me, the future and the past don't matter, I only care about the 'now', and now I am happy.

When I moved schools recently, I thought that it would be a good opportunity to start over, make new friends and become a better person, with better grades and a better future. Instead, I made no friends, I sit by myself during lunch and tap away at my phone. And somehow, I am content. I feel absolutely no urge to make friends. Occasionally, a teacher or a student walks up to me and asks me if I am alright, because the sight of me sitting by myself day after day must be depressing or something. I am absolutely not depressed, I am sure of it. I tell them I am fine, but I am not sure if they believe me.

I am useless to society, I have no talents and my only hobbies are reading, watching anime and playing games. And still, I feel happy and content and complete.

I live an incredibly comfortable life right now, despite my future being so unclear. I don't get bullied; bullies practically don't exist at my school (it is a very good school). My parents love me very much and I am grateful to them. 

I think if I was less happy, I might have some drive or some reason to improve, and my life and future would be better. But I feel no urge to improve myself or to work hard because I am satisfied.

I need help, but I don't want it. I am posting here just to sate my own curiosity, wanting to see if anybody else feels the same way, or to see how people respond. Anybody relate? Is this a mental disorder or something? Am I just a special case?"

71,I feel betrayed by my mom,"so today my family had a dinner together and we were all at my parents house, one of my uncles always has the tendency of “playfully” hitting me, and he came and hit me behind my leg obviously making it bent, so i turned and told him to stop it and just did a slight hit with the back of my hand on his back, and idk how he tripped and his beer felt off his hand, my mom started screaming at me for “hitting” my uncle when he had literally tripped me and made me clean the mess and also he said it was an accident and we could just clean it up, she didn’t tell my uncle anything and just kept on telling me i shouldn’t be hitting him because he is my uncle and he is an adult, keep in mind I AM ALSO AN ADULT I’M 3 WEEKS AWAY FROM TURNING 21 and i know that’s young but an adult none of the less. Also, I’ve been struggling with my mental health, idk what it is yet, but this issue was like my last drop, now i’m crying in my bedroom and feeling like if my own mother is putting others over me then who so i really have?"
72,Is it a headache or worse?,So I got elbow on my right side of my head  when I was playing b-ball. So far I used medicated oil on my head. I also have anxiety. I can’t tell the difference if I have anxiety headache or a real headache. Currently I am in bed and my head feels like it’s burning. I don’t know if that’s from a lot of thinking because earlier I was listening to music and my head was not this hot. I can’t sleep right now.
73,New normal life is coming soon,"I heard there's a chance that you can get the covid 19 virus but show no symptoms and just be a carrier. If so, I think it's just a matter of time until we stop panicking and realize this is going to be a new biomarker of our collective lives. Just stay healthy, stay away from people with weak immune systems (for their protection) and soon this will be under control.

The economy will return to normal and there will be more opportunities for growth than ever before. But remain flexible. 

Remote work is the new normal. 

You need a new approach to productivity. 

Spending time with online communities is important as a proxy for our social life needs. 

Establish rapport with people who have the right mindset for your mental health. 

Avoid consuming social media in a dark hypothetical feedback loop; this will deflate your mind and eventually your body.

Stay physically active. 

Don't succumb to nerd neck by slouching over and developing tunnel vision from excessive screen time. 

Give yourself calming breaks. 

Do whatever it takes to stay lean and sane. 

You'll emerge from this as a survivor and you'll be able to find others who've done the same.

74,I have some questions,"I just need to know what changes did you guys see when you started taking anti depressants, and how do you know when they actually are working? How do I get over this anxiety of not wanting to take them and just better myself and my mental health. I’ve been cooped up in this house for 3 days just depressed my family doesn’t care, cause to them I’m such a horrible person. I have depression, and pretty bad anxiety. But I guess to them I’m just crazy. They make me feel like some sort of lunatic for showing my feelings, when I never really do. I need to get better mentally. So I can get by financially and soon move out. I want to get out of this hellhole. I’m just wondering. I need help."
75,Would really appreciate any advice thanks guys,"I feel like I’m going to relapse again with my ED bc I’m having more depressive and anxious thoughts again and have been very critical of myself. I make sure I’m still eating but it’s stressing me out more, the voice in the back of my head is getting louder and telling me to stop eating any fats or carbs, which ofc doesn’t make any sense. 

I’m scared I annoy my partner with having mental health issues. He doesn’t really get that I can’t just be happier, less anxious or feel better about my body. Don’t get me wrong, he’s very supportive and has seriously helped me on my journey to loving myself, I’m appreciative of him. He tries his best...and it is enough. 

But what if my mental illness pushes him away...I’m too worried to talk to him about it bc I fear it’ll irritate him. However, if I don’t talk I’ll keep digging an anxiety hole. 

I’m so lost man."

Today I share methods for dealing with our fears and worries because of the Corona Virus (Covid19). As NEWS media outlets across the world show us the problems and suffering as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic we need to protect the mind and ensure that we are not creating more problems that arise from certain uncontrolled minds. In this video, I share 6 practical methods to help us and our loved ones during this difficult time…These methods I share can also be applied to other worries we may be experiencing too!

\#Coronavirus #covid19 #latest"
77,What do you understand about mental health?,
78,Universal perspective,"Everyone is a teacher, but that does not mean that everyone is correct.

There have been times in our lives where we have been a good example for those around us, while at other times we have not been a good example - if we recognize our own imperfections it helps us have compassion for all people and look upon all as equals.

Just because someone was wrong once, it doesn't mean they are going to be wrong forever. Similarly, just because we may perceive someone as wrong, it does not necessarily mean that we are right, in most cases we lack the perfect information required to make an objective and universal perspective.

It is important to remember that we are all imperfect and that we all live through the limited perspective of ego.

One may wonder, what is the right way to behave and live? As far as I know, it is to live in a manner that increases our personal freedom without harming others to do so - this is not easy, but we should certainly try.

Sending love to all beings. May we learn as much as we can from one another without making harsh and permanent judgments."
79,I want to stop the meaningless suffering,"My name is samuel, I'm 19 years old and already for 3 years I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder right after I had psychosis which lasted 3 days. Since then I haven't been able to be a functional member of humanity and I've been living a very shit life. I can't overcome the smallest of steps and every rock seems like a fucking mountain. Not that I haven't done anything right, I teach kids english. It's literally the only fucking thing I  can do, just help those who can't help themselves, yet I'm left in a downward spiral which drags me down to the bottom of my bedroom floor, which is where I am right now. As a product of all of this I started writing a pretty fucking poetry book about how much I want all this to fucking end and how much I want to love life. I hate every single god damned fucking word I wrote into those 106 pages. It took me one year to put it all together and now I just want to fucking swallow every piece of paper I use to write on before I put it into my PC. Not only am I a complete fucking failure, but I know fuck all about why I am this way. It just entered my life and never left. I've been to the hospital three times, once because I overdosed myself and second time because I sliced my face up with a knife in front of a mirror. No scars left, luckily, maybe I should've gone a bit deeper. I'm trying, you know?  I've been a regular at my gym, I'm a really good looking guy, I'm told that very often, and I do appriciate it, I really do, but that's still not a reason to stay. 

My biggest step lately was that I got myself an emotional support cat. I don't want to get your hopes up so I'll just cut to the point - I feel even fucking worse. The cat needs more fucking care than I ever did. I  barely shower or brush my teeth or wash my hands. I don't give a single fuck about the whole ''COVID'' disease and listen to music all the fucking time. I daydream myself away far too often and I can't exist without something on my mind all the time. I can't stop thinking. I even took this stupid fucking personality test ''Myers Briggs'' thing. Not that it is stupid, it is surprisingly accurate, but for me, in a way that only dampens my will to exist. Everytime I  got the same result from multiple test I was put down crying on the couch with my phone in my hands. I  got the INFJ type, which supposedly is the rarest, and for me, most stupidly fucking retarted one. I don't want to be fucking rare in this shit mate, I want to be characterless like those people who simply cannot understand me are. They don't have to deal with this constant contretempt of sadness and total absolute fucking hopelessness. Tragedy has truly found a great companion, let me tell you that... What do I do, friend? Do I just drift away into the nothingness or continue trying and trying and trying? I don't know man... I'm just fucking exhausted. So. Fucking. Exhausted. I couldn't handle another hospitalization. It's just so horrible. I'm afraid I won't ever graduate, I'm not exactly a smart person, because I really don't see the point of me knowing things I don't want in my life. I do photography very actively, I go to the gym very often, I teach english on occassion and go to therapy almost every third day, yet, I'm just feeling desperate. No amount of medication amounts to being understood. And in this world of filth I feel like the biggest sack of shit that ever crawled across the already fucked up floor. I'm so low, that death actually seems like a viable option."
80,Numb &amp; suicidal,"For the longest time I’ve felt so emotionally numb. There are things in my life that I should be happy for. That should make me not feel like this but a lot of the time I’m not really feeling anything but acting/feeling the way I think I should be. Everything I feel is more logical &amp; not actually there, this happened so I should feel this way. Instead of an immediate emotional response. I can’t even remember what being happy feels like at times. I’m always anxious about everything &amp; despite whatever good in my life I can’t feel it. There’s just this emptiness. If I could feel anything it would be sadness. Quite often there’s this wave of sadness that goes over me. I pretty much start to breakdown crying, pleading for the pain to stop, telling myself it’s okay, sometimes even hurting myself in different ways. It can last for minutes to hours but It never really goes away. There’s just always this sadness that follows me. I tried therapy but most times I didn’t even know what to say &amp; even when I tried my best to tell my therapist how I felt or what happened the advice she gave me never really helped. It’s gotten a lot worse now &amp; I’ve been thinking about killing myself for a couple weeks now. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way but I thought I was through all of that now. I keep thinking about how I would do it but I can’t imagine leaving my wife with such a burden &amp; to hurt her like that but sometimes I can’t bear it &amp; think she would be better off without me I just want to know what’s wrong with me so I can be better I don’t wanna feel like this anymore

I’m constantly anxious about everything that I can’t function properly, have panic attacks, emotionally numb, depressed, &amp; suicidal again but a lot worse off Unsure how to tell my wife
Tried therapy but it didn’t help

I don’t know what good posting this would do but maybe someone has been in a similar situation idk"

I feel depressed every single day and i am not able to deal with it usually i go to gym but since i am living with my bipolar brother and my mother with Tension depression i have to be the man of the house i have tried to search for a good therapist but none is trustworthy and whenever i try to follow a healthy diet “as i used to” my mother started feeling worse because she feels isn’t able to do her mother stuff “my family lives in a different country and visit us occasionally “
And i am living in syria ....any advice?
Thanks for reading this"
84,I want to be alone,"I'm 16, and I live in a house with my parents and grandparents,
I just want to be alone right now and don't know what to do, I try to isolate myself in my room, but it hurts them, they didn't tell me it,but I saw it on their faces. Plus I live in India which has 1.3 billion other people and it's close to impossible finding a lonely park around me. I don't earn so I live off my parents. I appreciate all the love I receive from them but I don't know what to do when I want to be alone to figure some shit out about myself."
85,I can't talk or say anything about my feelings or thought to my family or parents,"I'm a 23\[M\] and ever since I was a child I was never able to say my thoughts to the closest people to me which are my family. I have a family of 6 siblings and parents. I'm the youngest and I was always belittled and made fun of for anything I said or did. It made me go quiete and never say anything in order to not sound stupid and be humilated. Also, I was sexually abused twice when I was 8 and less and I've never said anything about it to anyone beside my ex. It is catching up with me, the fact that people who are suppose to give me an unconditional love, people who are suppose to be always there for me, I can't share the littelest thing about myself with them. Trying to say to them that I'm happy or I'm sad feels like choking. This made me feel so alone in this world and probably will result in me killing myself or atleast attempting for a bit of attention or sympathy without having to actually jst ask for it."
86,I'm scared I'm gonna do something I can't take back.," My mother is abusive, my father is a complete enabler and supporter, and the rest of my family is toxic and never believe me.

My whole life was dominated by fear and depression. The depression just got more and more severe, and now I've become so angry inside I barely recognise myself. My anger is a 9/10 nearly all day. I'm the most angry when I'm around my parents (I live with them). I have tried to reason with my parents and family to no avail. These days I'm so angry at my mother I regularly fantasise about all the ways she could die.

For years I've been finding ways to cope and survive with my depression and anger. They worked for a while, but my mind and body are simply exhausted from years of suffering. It's not that my coping strategies were bad, it's just that the suffering is too much. Two years ago my internal vocabulary started changing, and in my head I began swearing all the time. Over the past year the vulgarity has been slowly leaking out. I've started to become combative and argumentative with my parents whereas before I would censor myself and stay submissive. It keeps happening more and more and I can't stop it, even though I know it cripples my ability to be productive and might put me in a really bad situation. Plus my brother has literally been assaulting my mother as of late, and I feel schadenfreude.

I'm at my wit's end because my country is on lockdown due to coronavirus and I have to stay inside with my parents for possibly 3 weeks. Plus I have a repetitive strain injury that's making typing/swiping/writing painful. I do go to a therapist but we can't meet during the lockdown and there's no privacy for a phone call. And I am not going to be financially ready to move out until 5 years at least.

I'm afraid my anger will put me in a very bad situation as opposed to hurting others."
87,Mental Health and an interview,[removed]
88,Why would someone be forced to see a therapist? I need answers.,"Several days ago I was recommended to a therapist group by my boss. It was quite surprising to say the least. He said I HAD to go once my shift was over. I said I didn't need a therapist and I had work that needed to be done. He said that could wait; if I didn't go he would cut my pay for the month.

My group session is going to start in an hour and 50 mins. Help.

I live in Britain btw."
89,I have such a hard time trusting,"I feel like I’m incredibly paranoid sometimes. This paranoia results in me not trusting people. I’m in a relationship but have this feeling like I’m being cheated on. Here’s why:

She wanted to get back on a dating site (it’s where we met) but only because of this promotional offer and said we could take the promotional money and have a nice date with it. I was hesitant but ultimately said ok. She said to set my parameters to a certain range so I could find her and then we’d have a quick back and forth then set up a date to make it look believable so if the app needed to verify. So we did that and never heard any response from the app. After a week or so I asked if we could delete it. She said ok and then had trouble deleting it. She wasn’t sure if it could be deleted while on pause and so it took me showing her how to do it before she could delete it. She is a tech savvy person so this doesn’t make sense. Also it took me asking more than once. She didn’t want to delete it initially because we hadn’t heard back from the site about the promotion. 

Also, a family member of mine had surgery and I wasn’t feeling good to go out and do stuff. I wanted to stay in. She went to a party a friend of hers threw and said she wouldn’t be there long. Said she picked up wine called Ménage a trios and said she would FaceTime me later. I never heard from her, fell asleep, and woke up to a text saying she lost track of time. 

Ménage a trios makes me suspicious because she used to date a girl, early in our relationship she seemingly out of nowhere asked how I felt about threesomes, and so this just feels way too coincidental.

She’s going on a climbing trip in a few weeks with 2 guys and one of the guy’s girlfriends. Due to the type of climbing it is I wouldn’t be able to participate since that’s not my skill set. 

When we’re together and when we talk she’s very comforting and sweet and assured me to trust her. She says she loves me. She’s very nice and she knows I’ve had bad relationships in the past but that I need to trust her. She says I can lean on her. I feel like I can but my past makes that hard sometimes.

I have felt rushed to make big life decisions with her (we’ve been together little over a month but we’re both older so maybe later in life relationships move quicker?) and I have pushed back saying it’s hard for me to make those decisions and I feel pressured. She backs off and says she doesn’t want to make me feel pressured.

I don’t know, sorry if this is all over the place but I just feel like I’m being super paranoid but I also feel like I have cause for concern. Am I just being too paranoid or is my emotional/mental health vulnerability being taken advantage of?"
90,I care too much,I don't know how to get alone with everyone at work. I really dislike conflict and there seems to be a lot of personality clashes but I just want everyone to be accepting and to get along with each other.

92,Does therapy actually work? What if I don't have problems like I think I do?,"I live in the UK. I've been increasingly worried I may have mental health issues such as possible depression or anxiety and i might possibly be autistic. I have also recently found out my mom smoked during pregnancy. 
I have no friends and I'm on thin ice with my family. 
I don't know what to do."
93,IM SO ANXIOUS. IM SO AFRAID.,I cannot stop thinking about what would happen to me if i remain like this forever. What if I’m In this pathetic headspace forever?What if things are always the same? What if I never found people who love me and care about me? What if I’m never able to cure my mental illness? What if I’m this lonely forever ? I don’t want to be miserable anymore.
94,problem with self harm,im not going to go into detail since it doesnt seem necessary but since was 11 ive had problems with self harm . it doesnt help that i blend in with the wrong crowd and that by being who i am im just asking to be bulled. im just here to ask how i could cope with it because it just seems like when i frow my blades away i manage to get my hands on more.
95,Auditory hallucinations upon waking and stress higher than usual?,"32 F for reference. I’m so thankful for this forum. So for the last week, upon waking up I hear what sounds like a stapler or nail gun to the point where I get pissed because it sounds like something loud preventing me from going back to sleep. Once I get up to go to the bathroom it’s gone. I notice it happens more so when I’m coming out of a vivid dream. 

Aside from that, for whatever reason, I’ve been more paranoid of pissing people off lately. I got diagnosed with a serious genetic health condition that has limited my ability to work as much as I used to physically (however I’m still working PT at my current job (which is a hospital) and starting up a healthcare company with old coworker as well as continuing my career in web design on the side), but had to move in with a family member short term so I can make close to what I was prior to losing my health. For record, my health has been an issue for awhile but has only recently limited me as much as it has so its not necessary new stress. With that being said, I get overly paranoid about upsetting the family member I’m living with or pissing them off or if I visit my in laws I over worry about the same - this happens off and on. 

As mentioned, I work in a hospital, so with the virus, it’s been a madhouse at work but I don’t feel I’m stressed about the virus itself (I’ve been working at a hospital almost ten years so I’ve seen Ebola play out too), however, maybe I am. 

Long story short, I don’t necessarily feel more stressed than usual. 

Basically I’m worried I have beginning signs of narcolepsy or schizophrenia. I plan on scheduling an appointment with a mental healthcare professional soon, but am worried with these hypnopomic hallucinations and slight paranoia, I’m developing something more serious. I do have a history of OCD (irrational fears of schizophrenia, cross contamination at work, etc. - basically massive “what if” syndrome) for some reason (even though I have a good friend who actually does have schizophrenia who functions fine for the most part). 

Has anyone experienced something similar and come to find out it’s just underlying stress? I apologize in advance for how ridiculous this sounds. Thank you in advance."
96,Venting.,"I lost my no self harming streak, it was going so so well. At every family thing my brother always humiliates me by making fun of everything I like, or pulls my pants down or hitting my privates. 
I was invited to my sisters and he starts poking fun at me for me being fat, losing my job, my self harming and everything I said. Then he kicked me so hard I fell to the ground he kept saying ""you have nothing dont there"" and laughing at me in front of everyone. I went straight home and cut my arm.
I'm so sick of being the family joke, I'm so sick of never fitting into anything. 

My ex girlfriend just used me for money and cheated on me for an underaged boy. 
I loved her so much I never saw the bad in her when we were dating, she came in an out of my life for over 2 years. She would just cut contact suddenly no explanation I thought I upset her, I got so excited for the random texts asking for phone credit or money.
Then suddenly wanting to see me, she told be she was dating another guy during time she cut me off.
I went 3 months without hearing from her suddenly she wanted me see me she invited me to a skate park. Like the moron I am I went, got there she was hanging around teenage boys no older than 15.
She was 22 and she didnt have a car or ID, she want me to buy them alcohol I said no the only time I said no to her. She demanded I stay and I did and she ignored me except when I was going to leave.
I felt like shit, late that night she came up to me and asked if I wanted to play hind and seek. After half an hour one of the teenaged boys came up to me and told me she was having sex with one of the other boys. 
I got up and tried to leave she got angry at me and she made me feel like I was doing the wrong thing. Said she wanted to talk after she had a walk. 2 hours I sat then a text she'll call me the next day.
3 weeks later she did what always did and cut contact, haven heard from her since.

I know I was an idiot for staying with her for as long as I did, she was my first girlfriend and only.
My mind always makes relive that almost every night. 
I started LARPing a year ago, to he social again try and meet someone. I've probably done something weird without  knowing but all the women just didn't want anything to do with me. I just wasn't making friends. Until I met Rob, he said lets start a faction ""Drunken guard"" he said we go 50/50 kept asking for money I kept giving it. There was always an excuse on why he can't pay his half. I couldn't afford anymore, he start not talking to me, then he asked if he could pay me out for my half, he never did. The LARP group got super toxic no one role played with me found out Rob was gossiping about me. November last year I stopped going. I wanted to kill myself had plans. I've been pushing myself so hard this year to get better, I went a month with cutting myself.

Why does my mind kept hold of everything bad thats happened, why do I hate myself so muc, why did my brothers humiliation of me set me so so so far back?"
97,What’s wrong with me?,"I’m 20 F. I’m in college. Growing up, I was very shy. I had untreated social anxiety disorder that really got in the way of my ability to make friends, have a boyfriend as a teenager, and that sort of stuff. I finally got therapy and medication when I was 18 and I overcame it thankfully. 

Now I feel like I probably have depression. I feel like my brain just can’t ever let me be fully mentally healthy and happy, something always has to be wrong with it. 

Last semester of college was the closest I’ve ever felt to truly happy and mentally healthy. I had just transferred to a new college, I made a lot of new friends, joined a sorority, I had my first boyfriend. I just was having a really good life. It was really great. 

Then my boyfriend dumped me, my friend group dynamic changed some, I got used to the college so even though I still really like it it doesn’t have that exciting “new” feel anymore. I started to get depressed. I think a lot had to do with getting dumped. He really led me on and played with my emotions, made me really like him and think he liked me too, then dumped me and it was hard on me. Especially because I go to a small college so I have to see him around. And every time I see people post pictures with him my heart just sinks. Even though I wouldn’t get back with him now because he’s not the person I thought he was and I don’t think I really have the same feelings for him now I hate seeing him around or seeing pictures of him because it reminds me of everything and puts me in a bad place mentally. 

I didn’t like my class schedule that much. I started sleeping a lot and not eating very well or very much. I’ve always struggled with my self esteem and feeling like people don’t like me, especially guys, and so I guess once I felt like this one guy didn’t anymore it did hurt my self esteem deep down and it just didn’t help my already deteriorating mental state. 

I started to feel really sad and hopeless. And that’s where I am today, still feeling that way off and on. Classes got moved online because of the Corona virus so I’ve moved home and will have a month of basically spending it with my family doing my school work. I have good and bad days, but today has been a bad day. 

Any advice? I’m on an SSRI but it’s mainly used to treat social anxiety disorder and OCD so I was thinking I might need it switched."
98,My thoughts:,"I have a doctors appointment this Wednesday in regards to this topic but having never spoke about it to anyone before so I’m writing it here to just put it out there. I’m unaware if this is even the right place to do so.

First of all to anyone who takes the time to read what I have to say, thank you 

The reason I’ve decided to post what’s going on here is that I literally feel like I have no one else to speak to. I really hope someone reading this has experienced anything related to what I mention here and can offer advice on what they’ve done to help themselves and in turn could potentially be the cause of helping anyone who is experiencing anything related to what I say here.

I’ve just turned 22, as of a few days ago. The only people who acknowledged it was my birthday was my girlfriend + her family and my family which I’m thankful for. Part of me didn’t care because I work nights so I went into my birthday working, I slept though the day and then went to work at night so I didn’t really celebrate it. I also saw this coming as there has been no one in my life apart from these people for the past 6 months. 

In regards to work,

I hate work. I feel my attitude towards it is in the gutter and there’s nothing I can do about it. It would be even remotely nice to do something I enjoy, the thing is I have no idea what I enjoy doing. I’m not passionate about anything and my life isn’t going anywhere. I can’t picture myself anywhere in the future. I recently tried getting out the gutter and make something for myself and I began to learn a trade using a company that I’m now trying to settle a case with using the Ombudsman service, long story short I was miss sold the course and it’s allegedly a scam. 15 % of my monthly wage would go towards this and over the year and a half span I was with them there was a large number of red flags. Which now puts me exactly where I started a year and a half ago, but with a debt of a few thousand to pay to my Mum, luckily she was in a position to be able to help me pay off the remaining settlement amount but I was heavily reluctant to accept it, this is now a huge burden on my shoulders because I want to be in a position where I’m giving back to my parents not taking from them. A regular shift at work often involves me trying not to have a breakdown and going home, I’m past the point of being fed up. I’m feel numb to a lot of emotions and at least once a shift someone drops a comment about how I’m always miserable or I look tired all the time. Then when someone asks how’s it going I just say okay as it’s the easiest thing to do and I notice they rarely care about the answer to the question they ask. My commute involves driving under a train bridge and I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about plowing my car into it on a few occasions to try and stop the noise of everything. The only thing keeping me going was that I hate seeing my girlfriend upset and wouldn’t want to do anything stupid.

In regards to relationships,

As of very recent, my girlfriend of 2 years said we would be better off as friends which I saw coming as she had been off for a few weeks and it had nearly happened once in the past. I couldn’t of asked for a better first relationship. After speaking about it we’re now only calling it a break, because after speaking for every day for 2 years we had probably reached a point where there was the romance had faded and it wasn’t necessarily fresh. It was a new experience for us both as neither of us have had a relationship before. We’ve made so many good memories I’ll cherish for the rest of my life regardless of how the next few weeks play out. The girl is my best friend and while I never wanted her to feel this way and make her feel pressure from this, she is the only person I’m able to be myself around and the only person I feel I can tell anything to. My last bit of hope in this world and she kept me going on a daily basis. 
Me being a completely different person to who I was going into the relationship has to be factored in to us parting ways. I’ve constantly battled with insecurities throughout my teenage years and I guess they’ve just caught upto me at this point. 

In regards to confidence, self esteem &amp; insecurities,

My first memory of being self conscious was when I was on holiday with my family, we were stopping at a friends house and I compared my body type (Mesomorphic) to someone else who was an ectomorph. At this age (10/11) I knew nothing about these body types etc but I remember being upset by a comment from a parent. Then I started going out on my bike, became quite lean of what I can remember and at roughly 13, I stopped going out and put on a large amount of weight becoming insecure, introverted and my school work suffered because of this. I didn’t get good grades and ended up studying for a further year to then drop out at 18 to go full time at and train up to be a shift manager at a fast food restaurant for about 2 years. I hated telling people where I worked as it’s got a reputation to employ anyone and everyone. After leaving that job and getting my current job nearly 2 years ago I’ve been gradually losing weight and am now in the gym 3-4 times a week. I’m overly self conscious about my appearance, if I can avoid doing so I avoid pictures because I hate looking at myself. I know I’m going to regret this as there’s been many good memories that I haven’t captured with good people at that moment in time. I also struggle to go the toilet in urinals, I am physically incapable of doing so and this is probably the main reason why I do not go out anymore because I’m embarrassed to stand outside the cubicle and have to explain to everyone that questions why I’m stood there. 

In regards to friends,

Excluding my girlfriend, from my early teenage years, I feel I’ve never had someone I can call a best friend, it’s always been a group and there’s been good times don’t get me wrong but I feel to bond further than that there needs to be bad times that will make or break friendships to show who your real friends are. As of about 6 months ago there has been no one I can really call a friend, no one to speak to whenever I needed help. From the previous friend group, we all had different lives so no one was ever free at one time. I get as you get older people get busy but if taking 10 minutes out of your day to have a conversation about the well-being of someone you’re friends with to genuinely ask if there okay and listen to their answer is too much of an ask, are you even friends in the first place? 

There’s a lot more to say but I’ve gone on for long enough.

Thank you to anyone that read this far, I appreciate you and wish you the best."
99,Living with someone who need help.,"Living with a my housemate Today :

Seriously living with someone paranoid and that always has to be right even when wrong is fucking exhausting . 

Yesterday / This morning so far I been told that:

1) -26 degrees in Calgary is warmer than +4 degrees in Ottawa ..... 

2) That vaccines cause Autism and there’s proof about it ....

3) That the CRA (canada revenue agency) is a kabal running the world ...... 

4) Corona Virus is made up for more tax money.

5)She know and can predict everything that going to happen with the government because she worked there before ......

6) Shit fell off her closet shelves because doors where open in her bedroom . Not her fault she never opened her own door she says .... ( cats would not be able to open those 2 heavy doors) so now its my fault ......

Seriously i don’t know how to deal with this person anymore.....

As soon as she gets told somethings she does mot like or proven she is wrong she start speaking loudly accusing whoever of being after her. 

If confronted she goes into victim mode right away....

I’ve called the cops on her before and even her parents tried to get her into hospital but now they got a restrictive order for her not to contact her family anymore...

Im tired and trapped :/"
100,I can’t stop repeating thoughts in my head like “maybe I can stop repeating thoughts in my head” or “I can stop and i don’t want to”. What is this? How can I stop?,Idk if this is the right sub red. But any help would do.
101,"(NSFW, Trigger Warning) I accidentally viewed child pornography.","I was browsing the deep web out of curiosity (which I now majorly regret) and I came across a child pornography website. There were a bunch of videos on the home page that all played at once. Once I saw them my mouth dropped, I was disgusted and horrified. I wanted to look away but I couldn't for some reason, it's like I was frozen in shock and sheer disbelief that people could do this to innocent children. Now I can barely stop the images from flashing in my head and I feel traumatized. I don't know what to do, please make it stop! :'("
102,Nursing school waiting for letter,"Hello! I applied to nursing school beginning of January and I am waiting to hear back from them. I believe I am a strong candidate, I am applying to an associates program- I already have my bachelors in psychology, have taken 5 out of the 7 “recommended courses” (basically courses you need to take for the program anyways but they recommend to lighten the load during school. I have completed my TEAS, and a certified nursing assistant so I have healthcare experience and currently work in an inpatient psych unit. 

I find out sometime next week, but the wait is making me SO anxious. I am mentally preparing myself for the fact that I didn’t get in, not sure if it’s a coping method or what. I live across the country from where the program is, in my hometown, and really don’t like my job which is another reason why I want to start school. 

Any advice on how to get through the next few days?

Thanks!!"
103,Is this a form of a mental illness (TW: depression/ED),"So I’m a teenager, and I’ve been having thoughts about dying. A year ago, I was so afraid of dying and would do everything in my power not to put myself in risky situations. My first thought was: I don’t want to die, so I’m not going to do that. Now, I don’t really care. Deep down I don’t want to die I don’t think, but honestly my first response to something like: Corona is so bad, hopefully no one gets it! My response is: I want it so I can die. I don’t care. And honestly I don’t know if I do care or not. It could be just a typical response since I’m a teenager and all teenagers want to die because it’s a funny thing people say. Also my excuse for not dying yet is because I need to get skinny before I can die. (Possibly have an eating disorder or disordered eating/body dismorphia) I have no clue. Help. Thanks:)"
104,Is this a type of eating disorder? (TW),"So essentially, I have some odd habits. I think I’m fat but I have a bmi of 16.8 or so. That’s so bad because some people have way lower and want to get lower. I’m a teenage male, if that is of any interest. I typically eat 1,000-2,000 calories a day, which shows I can’t really be anorexic, right? Even though I’m a fat pig who can’t control themselves around food. I typically eat on my own terms I hate when my parents make me eat. My caloric intake is mainly just junk food. I started taking laxatives to make me skinny and go number 2 more. I exercise solely because I want to burn calories off. But my weight fluctuates a couple pounds. Like, I can’t lose weight cause I’m fat and can’t control myself. That’s got to change. Is this a problem, or should i just disregard everything? Thanks!"

106,Help to diagnosis: Specific Activities Leading to Physical Symptoms,"Hi,  
I suffer from some specific physical symptoms (coughing, diarrhea) and impaired cognitive function after doing some specific activities e.g. computer programming, studying specific subjects (e.g. advanced math) and hard physical activities.  
I haven't been able to put a diagnosis to this link between activities and symptoms, and thereby not been able to recover. **I hope for your help to point me in a direction to find a diagnosis or an effective recovering strategy/method.**

I started having these symptoms during my time at the university. They were intensified during my (stressful) final thesis (constant diarrhea and coughing leading to daily vomiting).  
It is now four years since I graduated. The symptoms have slightly eased, primarily because I avoid the activities that trigger the symptoms. This also means that I avoid specific activities that I used to love, which is unfulfilling.

Thanks in advance, M."
107,I would really appreciate your advice,"No matter what movie i watch, if theres a character who's the biggest loser in the world, in every aspect of their live, i start getting sad, cuz i relate to it. And the thing is that im not a loser. I dont know if it makes any sesne, but its how it is. Is everyone like that to an extend?

I know that it was bit of a random start but, i think its key to my mentality. I guess its because of my past experiences, which again, werent as bad, but i still got bullied. 
And recently, i came across a video, about a facial beauty and the way it influences the way people see us, and then i started thinking that it could have been the reason why i was treated the way i was.

Now, im a pretty nigga, forreal, but i developed this thing where i project my insecurities on things that you have from birth/have no control over. Again, this time it is your face shape, eye shape blah blah blah, the previous time it was something even more ridiculous like aspergers, and basically it goes on. And its not the fact that its more calming to balme things on factors that you cant change, but i dont even know. I think its just me questioning my seld if im even a worthy human, not in comparison to others, but just as a species, like, am i like other human beings? 

Now, i aint gon lie, i havent been out in a while, its not that i dont like it, but i just happen to not have any close friends at the moment. And again, i dont know if its just psychosis, from loneliness, or what but it definitely makes me a bit anxious. The thing is that when im around people i feel otherwise, i start feeling like a god, cuz Honestly, when im around others and remember that theyre nothing special, i even seperate myself from them, but ive been lonely in so long that it drives me crazy. Our break from college got elongated cuz of corona, and i hate it.

Another thing is that cuz of my past experiences as i said, i think i stopped taking myself seriously. Or i dont even know, fuck.. is it like that?? Nah its not. But if im out in public i always feel ugly. If you came up to me and asked me my opinion about myself i would say the opposite, and thats how i really think, but the fucking feeling is there. Its not that its 24/7 but it still comes and gies.

I mean, really, do pretty people even get bullied? Like i cant recall anything like that from my own experience. Does it really have that much importance? Most of the time i used to think that ugly people seemed ugly cuz they lacked charisma, but how you gon build charisma if you get bullied and leave negative first impression cuz of your looks. 

I dont even know what im talking bout anymore."
108,OCD - looking at thighs/legs/bulges etc,"Hi, would like to get your opinion on how to start habituation exercise, I have a weird ocd when I gaze at thighs of other people, and I felt discomfort/guilt doing that involuntarily or urge i dunno. Im not aroused by their thighs I just randomly look at them but felt guilty/uncomfortable/felt like a perv. My typical reaction is too avoid looking or use hoodie to minimize my peripheral vision. I haven't gone to real psychologist because of work/money but I found this yt about ocd by katie d'ath which is the closes to all of my anxieties.

Backstory I was sexually assaulted at work by a client, it was a slow day of fall of 2015 a client approach me for data entry task, as I get his details  his hand went to my left pants,  was shocked when he touched my legs then escalated to my groins feeling as his hand reaching my peepee, my only reaction was shocked and I cough so hard trying to be professional so he could notice that I am violated, stupid me didn't wanna create commotion in the office just cough so hard that he stopped like ehemm in a loud manner. That day I was violated, I couldn't erased it from my mind till this day. 


I dunno if that event might have caused my ocd guilt when suddenly gazing upon my seatmates thighs, sometimes bulges for men but most of the time it just thighs. for girls I usually notice if I saw someone who had fair complexion which trigger me to have a gaze, guilt/ struck again. My response is to look away or avoid being on that seat. But in the office my seatmates (men) has taken notice of me sometimes staring at theirs thigh, most of the time, I caught attention when they were fidgeting, my response when I have ocd is to wear my hood or look other ways. I dunno they might have noticed my being uncomfortable when I gaze at them, one of my peers moved his chair away so less sight of theirs. Im not aroused by that stares and thoughts of them accusing me a being a perv is strong, I dunno I notice most men won't come near me, even girls that they noticed me gazing at their thighs.

Other details is that I'm bisexual, aroused by both girls (hentai mostly, mia khalifa type) or men mostly handsome and athletic built - muscle fetishes - started muscle fetish when I was 12 or later). Also i have low self confidence I usually look down so as to avoid eye contact with me.

Is there any hope for perv like me. Help me.
Thank you"
109,UK mental health services,"I'm very keen to hear from any other UK people and to hear their experiences, especially those with paranoia, anxiety and delusions. Would also particularly like to speak to anyone who has had a schitzo effective diagnosis.

I've been suffering with various issues (paranoia, feelings of persecution, thinking my partner is cheating etc etc.)  for about a year and a half now and would really like to connect with others going through the same, or similar, mental health issues. 

I went to see my doctor a few weeks back, have been put on sertraline 50mg in the short term and also been referred on. Currently awaiting my referral to come through. Do any of you have any experience with the timescales and what I can expect? Is there any benefit to going private to get a quick diagnosis?"
110,I think I have a problem.,"I posted here a day or so ago about another issue. To give you some more context about my issues, that post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ficxf4/i_feel_like_i_am_losing_my_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I want to get help and plan on talking with my parents, but they are currently away from home on a trip right now. 

Since they are away, I am taking care of my sister who has Down syndrome. She is the light of my life and I love her so much. I would never let anything had happen to her. I would die for her. 

However, last night I decided to enjoy two chocolate martinis. Then I had two shots. I’m not sure if I had any more because I honestly can’t remember. I fell asleep probably around 10:30 PM and when I woke up at 5:30 I found that my sister had put herself to put upstairs, and that I ate an entire large bag of chips with salsa and left it all over the kitchen. I don’t remember doing this either.

I was always in denial of having a a drinking, but when I drink I’m always the drunkest one at the party. I am quite small and while I “know my limit,” I just ignore it because I don’t care about myself at all. I almost died from alcohol poisoning 3 years ago, and I was scared of alcohol for a year after. Since I’ve been back on it I always lose control when I drink. 

If I have wine it’s never one glass. It’s the whole bottle. I also used to have a problem with marijuana. I always HAD the be high. Life wasn’t enjoyable if I wasn’t. I smoked at least once a day for almost two years. One day I woke up in November and quit cold turkey. I threw everything out. I’ve smoked twice since then, but I have no desire to so. 

I would like to quit everything. I feel I am substituting marijuana for alcohol. If alcohol is accessible to me, I lose control. 

I just feel so guilty overall. I feel like I failed myself and my sister. I feel so guilty because I would never forgive myself if something happened to her while I was passed out from being black out drunk. She is everything to me and after neglecting her last night (from being drunk), I now see I have a problem. 

Im only 20 years old so I don’t know what to do. There are alcoholics in my family. My grandfather himself was an alcoholic and was known as the drunk in my community. He drank until the day he died even though he was advised not to because of medical conditions. I want to change now before decades go by. I don’t want to neglect the ones I love."

112,I'm 99% certain that my 17yo sister is faking mental illness and I don't know how to help,"**TLDR:** As the title says, my (22M) sister (17F) is apparently faking mental illness, as well as lying about other serious events. I'll go into more detail throughout this post, but that's the basic idea. It's creating a lot of problems and I want to know how to help her, but have no idea where to start. 

### Background

Before I get too deep into this, I should say that I'm pretty sensitive to these types of issues. I've struggled with my own mental health, had a long term relationship with someone who had severe BPD (they would maim themselves during arguments, try to bite me, etc.), and grew up with two other special needs sisters. So I'm pretty familiar with what these things look like. 

I believe that she probably has a real underlying mental illness, but the problem is that it's so buried beneath fakeness that it's hard for anyone to help her. She was recently forced to drop out of school because of these issues and has shattered her relationship with most of the adults in her life, aside from me, which is putting a lot of stress on me, especially since no one else wants to help anymore. 

### Evidence That She's Lying

I'll start with the things I'm completely sure she's lying about or that I know are true, then move onto the more vague instances. And for clarity, I'm going to call her Jane.

1. Before Jane dropped out, she was living with my Dad, stepmom, and youngest sister, in an apartment. Jane recently moved in with me after dropping out, so it's just the three of them living in that apartment now. I babysat my youngest sister a few weeks ago while they had a night out. While there, my youngest sister (elementary age) asked me questions about things Jane had been telling her. There were several lies, but the most serious was that Jane told her that our Dad used to rape our Mom in front of all of us when we were little, before this youngest one was born. I can't tell you how blatantly untrue this is, and it was kind of horrific to see my youngest sister thinking about these things.
2. At one point Jane had video evidence that our youngest sister was in an abusive situation with her mom (different from our Mom), but didn't tell anyone because the mom was buying weed for Jane. Only after Jane and the mom got in a fight did Jane release this evidence, which was months into this situation. There are other instances of Jane putting others in harm's way for her own gain, this is just the most obvious. 
3. Jane would constantly make up lies to our parents when we were growing up to get the rest of us punished, often hurting herself (scratching herself/hitting her head into things) to convince our parents that we had hurt her. When she was around six or seven she shoved a pencil into my brother's nose during an otherwise normal sibling argument. Around that same age she would sit at the desktop computer in our living room, look at images of roadkill, and then draw those images. There are lots of other cases where she was excessively violent at a young age, though nothing like this has happened since she was little. 
4. Jane used to watch a YouTuber with Tourettes syndrome and shortly after started imitating Tourettes at school (she was 15). This led to the first instance of her being removed from school, after which she immediately stopped showing signs of Tourettes. She started doing this again more recently after Billie Eilish came out with Tourettes, but has once again stopped. 
5. My aforementioned ex with BPD has large self-harm scars all over her body, anywhere she can reach herself. They are not like average self-harm scars; they are huge, wide, and very disfigured looking, and she told me that she had at points been able to see her bones because she had cut so deep. Before Jane and my ex met, Jane had never self-harmed before; just weeks after they met, Jane started to fill her arms and legs up with similarly severe scars. Again, they are uniquely bad, not like typical self-harm scars, and it's clear that her decision to start doing this was influenced (indirectly) by my ex.
6. Jane has been evaluated two or three times now for mental illness, and the results always come back inconsistent, with doctors telling us that she is trying to manipulate the results. This doesn't mean she doesn't have anything; by now it should be clear that something is wrong. But no one can properly diagnose her. 
7. I had a period of insomnia in high school that lasted a year or two, and at severe times would cause me to have very, very minor hallucinations (vague shapes in peripheral, random pops and slapping sounds, etc.; I was always aware that they weren't real). I mentioned it to Jane once, and she soon started repeating it to other people as if it had happened to her. She even asks me questions about what it's like, which I usually don't answer since it seems like she's just trying to make it more believable. 
8. I know for sure that Jane was molested when she was in elementary school, the person who did it (stepdad who is now long gone) has admitted to touching her (I went through a similar experience in a completely unrelated incident). I don't want to be too graphic, but the parts of the story that we know for sure happened are definitely not severe, just over the clothes touching. Well, she recently decided to tell me the ""full"" story, which included years of her being raped in her bedroom. Now, this is one of the points where I'm not sure what's real and what isn't. The story she told me was incredibly detailed and included things that I don't think the average person would be able to lie about. On the other hand, other aspects make no sense at all. Jane shared a bedroom and at times a bunk bed with our older sister, but claims she was raped without our older sister knowing, even though she was in the room while it happened. She also told me stories about him touching her under her clothes during certain events, events that I was in the same room for. I would've been a young teen at this point and I don't think I was so oblivious that I wouldn't notice something like this. But again, there's no way to know for sure, and I want to believe her. 
9. Jane frequently has panic attacks that always end with her needing to be picked up from work/school, and the nature of the panic attacks is always different. I'm not totally sure what a real panic attack looks like, so this could be real. But it seems overdramatic and only happens at times when it will garner the most attention (i.e., these attacks rarely happen around family, instead, it's almost exclusively around teachers, school employees, etc.). Her attacks are sometimes just her breathing heavily, other times she rocks and thrashes around making odd noises, other times she acts like a baby (I mean that literally, not in a cruel way), sometimes she says she can't remember who she is or who anyone else is, etc. Everyone who has ever been around her during these has commented afterwards (not to her) that it seems really, really fake. 
10. Jane recently told me that our Dad hit her shortly before she dropped out of school. This jumped out as being suspicious to me, as I've seen my Dad get hit by one of his exes before (the deadbeat mom). He didn't even react, he just waited for her to calm down, and then he asked her to leave and apologized to us kids. My Dad is a huge dude and is really into bodybuilding and stuff like that. He has an abrasive personality for sure, but I've never seen or heard of him hitting anyone before, and the only reason he would have to hit my sister is that she didn't do her chores or something, which makes no sense. I can't picture a huge, stocky guy like my dad slapping a teenage girl, let alone his daughter. My youngest sister said that to her knowledge this never happened. 

### The Illnesses She's Faked

I'm going to go ahead and stop there since this post is already insanely long. Right now, the mental issues Jane is claiming to have are:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Hallucinations
* Panic attacks
* OCD (inconsistently)
* Tourettes (inconsistently)
* PTSD (from events that are always changing)

### The Current Problem

My dilemma is that I feel like for anyone to go to these lengths to convince others they have these issues (even so far as hurting themselves and affecting their life) is indicative of a serious underlying issue (I think it's most likely BPD or Munchausen). I want to help her as best I can (which is why I let her move in with me) and help her get professional help. But she's so unpredictable, manipulative, and deceptive that it's hard for anyone to help her, let alone me. I'm also planning on moving out of the country in a year, which will more or less leave her on her own. 

When she isn't being ""ill"" she is a totally normal person and one of my best friends. She's an extremely talented artist, very funny, has great taste in music, clothes, and movies. She's a great listener and is very insightful. I love her dearly, which makes this all very overwhelming. I know I can't live her life for her or solve these issues alone, but I don't want to abandon her either. I feel like I can't talk to her about this because she'll either shut me out for not believing her or just completely ignore what I say. 

If anyone has any advice or experience they can offer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, and sorry for writing a book, ha."
113,"My father is adamant about me needing to go to church to make a full recovery but it just isn't for me, at least right now.","There's a three-day program my church is having that ends today and my dad begged me to go. I felt off suddenly yesterday, the second day, and he was like ""Let's go. Please. Let's go pray and see what will happen."" But honestly, that bothered me because why should I have to go to a 3-day conference with a visiting pastor just to get better? It gives me anxiety to hear that I won't get better unless I go to church and do this, this, and that. I actually started to feel better on my own yesterday but my dad just came to me now and kept asking me and then he got frustrated because I just stood there, not saying anything and he said, ""Other people are getting their breakthroughs and we're not and you're not even trying."" 

It bothers me and he knows that it bothers me. Things like this make me feel even more upset with God and make me want to separate myself even more. And based of what I've seen from going to these programs, I've been passed and so has my family so frankly, I'm not too eager to start again now."

115,Worried that I might be a narssist or have borderline personality disorder.,"For about 3 years now I've been worried that I might be a narssist, I constantly seek reassurance that I'm a good person and that I'm loved, I have very low self esteem and confidence, I take everything to heart when people joke with me or give me criticism, it's hard for me to feel happy and laugh, the only emotions that I feel are real are sadness and anger. I have a tendency to fall in love really fast and then push people away cause I dont feel good enough or that i trust them then afterwards keep strings attached to them cause I dont want to be alone. I constantly worry about how other people perceive me and if I'm cool enough so I check myself I'm the mirror alot through out the day. 
I get very envious over happy and confident people. 

I'm not sure why I'm like this but its exhausting. I just want to be held and loved and to cry. My brain never stops telling me negative things."

Before I went in, I'm a severe introvert, I had severe anxeity, depression, bi polar, and maybe BPD. To mentally not go crazy ( which I did for a bit) my brain shut itself off from reality. Deeply. Very deeply. 

Now, I fight to regain normal interaction with the world. The fact my anxeity was so twisted by the place, that I can hardly function is a separate problem too.

I drift, so to speak. Nothing seems real around me. I have to force myself to ""see"" anything. People, environment. Etc.

I'm scared this won't go away. Petrified. I don't even know if anyone can relate for advice"

121,had a terrifying dream last night and i cant even go to my best friend for comfort (TW DEATH),"Last night, I had a terrifying dream. 

For context, my father died 3 years ago.

The dream began with me as an 11-year old, standing next to my dad's chair while hes sitting. He was scolding me, talking about my mistakes, and how he was so ashamed of me. He told me that I was a horrible person, a spoiled brat, and that he was deeply ashamed. He really tore into me with his words. I was crying, and feeling my body get shaky and dizzy. I begged him to stop, but whenever I did, he just got louder. Eventually, everyone I ever cared for and love deeply joined in, including my best friend, tearing into me with their words, and i felt like i was going to faint. I was having a panic attack. Right before the dream ended, my dad told me I was going to die like him. Alone. 

Then, I woke up. I woke up shaking, sobbing, and alone.

The worst part is my best friend and I got into a fight a few days ago, so I don't know if I should go to them for comfort. My moms not home, and i feel like i have no one. I've been trying breathing exercises and stuff but it doesnt stop the thoughts. i really need help..."
122,Not an interesting title,"I was walking toward the entrance to a supermarket in my town, where I have lived for two years. A couple, a man and woman in their young 30’s, around my age, around my height, not dressed very differently than me, strangers to me on every way, were walking out. It was windy but as we were passing the woman said to the man, “[my name here] caused this to happen.” I heard her say it very clearly. I can only assume she meant people staying home under quarantine and to avoid getting sick. I don’t know why people know my name or my face or why they want to/feel it’s ok to hurt me but I wish so badly I could understand why they do that. I am very introverted and I always seek solitude so it’s a mystery. I don’t understand people like her, how they can be so mean. Obviously I did not cause a new virus or people getting sick. Getting victimized like that, just now, it makes me feel so disgusting, like I can’t stand to be on my own body. Does anyone know what this feels like?"

Medication change in progress.. kind of freaked out and looking for a safe place to discuss.,"Last week, I was diagnosed in a ""gray area"" between cyclothymia and bipolar II. I've been on cymbalta for 6 months trying to treat (misdiagnosed) anxiety and depression, and last Monday my psychiatrist and I decided to start weaning off of it while weaning onto a mood stabilizer.

My highs and lows have been even heavier since starting this change; I am so easily agitated, have random hypomania, and then crash into a weepy depression for a few days. 

Today, I just feel really low. Not weepy. My kiddos were being extra loud today and i could feel my anxiety rising, and then I swore I heard a, ""shh shh shh,"" like someone was shushing them, but no one was and I know I didn't say it. It's freaking me out. Is this a bipolar trait? Maybe a side effect of the med switch?"
124,Help please,I recently started feeling a few symptoms of depression and I remembered that they were symptoms of them and then I looked up symptoms of depression then I realized I have almost every symptom of depression other than hurting myself so now I'm scared that I have depression but I dont know what to do about it please give me feedback and tell me what I should do

126,Mental health problems??,"Today I got in a fight with my mom. She said that I don’t listen to what other people say and that I’m ignorant. Anyways, she ended the argument with “well, do you always behave like this when someone is trying to talk to you?! Like that time when your teacher told you that it’s annoying when you can’t sit still”  so I was wondering: do you have any tips to why it is that I can’t sit still?? Like, if I don’t move something I feel very weird for some reason, it’s like I have to move it.. (I do have anxiety but idk if it’s something else?) any tips???🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
127,Girls number I got in the club ended up being a tranny ( embarrassed ),"Girl I was talking to in the club ended up being a transsexual (transgender) or whatever

This is embarrassing. This Never happen to me before.  I got a few numbers and danced one night at the club everything seem cool.  Had a few drinks. 3 weeks later One in particular I talked to in the club I found out was a transgender. I never hung out with the person or anything. Forgot how the person looks like I just know their social media from doing research her pictures were super edited so I just moved on. 

3 weeks later this person calls me to meet it at the club. I was busy that night (thank god) but I started questioning a lot of things like red flags, she sounds funny on the phone.. her social media doesn’t have no old pics. Things just seemed weird. In my head I was like this might be a tranny.

Needed up finding out by typing her number in google , also confirmed she sent me and text saying she’s trans. I just blocked the number so fast.

I just feel disappointed and embarrassed I was in the club talking to a tran and didn’t even know it.

I usually be very cautions on who I talk to in the club . It was a high class club that doesn’t let everybody in so maybe it was passable idk. 
No one tapped me on the shoulder or anything that night like “hey watch out for those” maybe no one noticed I guess. Or maybe they did and just laughed.


I’m a straight male. Now I feel nervous talking in the club to chicks because I don’t want this to happen again, it be dark and loud in clubs where I’m at.

I guess the good part of the situation is I found out early and never met up with and did anything but still  It could been worse. But like I feel ashamed and embarrassed that my manhood is being tested.
I think about the situation since I found out. It happen month ago but it’s still fresh on my mind.

Just trying to move on from this situation. Should I seek a therapist or am I taking this too far?"
128,Does anyone else have moments where you feel impulsive and want to do something drastic with your appearance?,"In my case, I want to dye my hair forest green or teal after growing it out and getting it chemically straightened. Like, I just feel like my life's out of control, so I want to change my appearance to feel a sense of control. I'm also kind of digging the alternative look right now and want to emulate the ""big tiddy goth gf"" aesthetic.

Ugh, I'm such a fucking mess thinking about doing this kind of shit when I should be worried about finding a job. I feel like I'm stuck in perpetual adolescence and that I probably won't fully mature until my mid-30s. Might as well enjoy myself while I still can since I'm not getting any younger. At the same time, I need to buckle down and be a responsible adult.

God, this thread is a trainwreck, but I don't care."
129,for those who live by feeling...,"I live my whole life. by feeling. I let it dictate pretty much how i live and who i am as a person. and this can be a wonderful, wonderful thing. it really can be. letting your heart dictate and choose where it wants to go is an incredibly freeing way to live, and I’ve always wanted to be open. just live wide and be open so that maybe people will be open with me in return. I’ve had more “stuff” to deal with and process and cope and break down and understand than i ever have in my entire life. I pretty much spent the last 9 months processing a dream like life altering reality that I happened to find myself in (I’m not going to get into it but I was in a hospital for about a month and pulled from school for about 3, and had my final consultation just today. A year later) I know it takes time, and i’ve healed so much and know and have felt. on such a wide range. it’s truly incredible. But sometimes it’s almost too much. i’m just wondering if anyone else out there understands what i’m talking about. and how to deal with living a life by feeling. and how i can protect myself without limiting the beauty and bliss that comes with feeling the world around you."

131,Illness,"I suffer from mild depression, PTSD and Dysthymia. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and my self-esteem is low from childhood. Finally, after 10 years of that relationship, I started seeing a Psychiatrist and Psychologist. So currently I am on medication and I am trying to get better. But it's affecting my present. My present relationship with friends and my boyfriend. I keep on getting angry a lot on them and I want to stop it. I don't want my past to affect my present but somehow it is. It's difficult. They are supportive but there's a limit to everything. Right? Please help me out. My psychologist says that it will keep happening until I am healed completely so until then I have to control but it's so difficult. And when I get sad I go all in it. It's difficult to live.

133,How are inpatient treatment centers dealing with the outbreak?,"Having been admitted to two separate facilities in the past, I know that a mixture of visitors and outpatients often enter the premises on a daily basis. Are those people now barred from entering? I imagine it would suck for especially lonely patients to not be able to see loved ones during their time of crisis."
134,Link between past seizures and mental health??,"Hi there, I am 21F from the UK and I have been suffering with some mental issues from a young age. I am wondering if there are any professionals I can talk to regarding my current issues linking with things that happened in the past which may have contributed to my current problems. I used to have seizures as a child but they stopped around the age of 14. They would only happen once a year either on the last day of March or the first of April. I have read that Epilepsy can cause multiple mental health issues however I was not diagnosed with epilepsy as every test taken came back negative. The cause of my seizures is still unknown to this day. I am asking if someone could tell me if there could be a possible link between  my seizures and my bad cognitive and behavioural issues. I still have some absent seizures today however my tonic clonic seizures are no more. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression but I have concern I may have something similar to ADD.

I know this is a complicated request so I wont be surprised if no one has a clue! Thank you :)"
135,Is it too late for me? I fucked up my life,"So I feel like I've fucked up. Like really fucked up. The kind of fucked up you can't recover from. I don't know maybe I still can, but It's hard for me to stay optimistic or positive about my life anymore. It's almost like I've made every wrong choice in my life and now I'm paying for the consequences of my actions. I deserve to feel this way honestly. I have done nothing to better my life when I still had potential. I had potential to be someone. To do something meaningful with my life. I had potential to love myself at one point, but now I feel like I'm too far gone to even consider that anymore. I had potential to find love at some point in my life, but now it seems unrealistic. I had potential to do well academically and pursue higher education and do something I love. I had potential to be happy.
 
Instead I chose the easy path.

I chose to indulge. To live in the moment rather than building towards a future where I am happy. To do nothing at all except play video games all day. To isolate myself from everyone. To not develop myself as a person. To not even try anything that wasn't already known and comfortable to me. To chase instant gratification and not develop discipline. I chose to be this way and now I'm fucked.

It feels like I've come to this realization too late and it feels like it actually is too late. Too late for me to become who I could have been. Too late for me to turn it around completely 180°. Too late for me to do the things I should have been doing years ago. Too late to ever truly be happy with my life.

I'm 19 years old and I have done literally nothing with my life. Literally nothing. 
There are fucking 12 year olds hell even 8 year olds who have done more with their lives than I have. I'm a fucking loser. I'm worthless. Why I think I'm fucked:

I'm painfully insecure. Taking any compliment I ever get and skewing it into it somehow being manipulative or a compliment out of pity or something. 

Never developed good social skills (I'm painfully awkward around new people. Don't get me started on being around people of the opposite sex.)

I dropped out of high school. (To play video games and smoke weed)

I've never had a job. (I don't even know how/where to start. Even if I did get one I know I would still feel the same as I do now.)

I've never been in a relationship. (No social skills or dating skills. Anxiety. I'm fucking oblivious to how people operate, think, act, etc.)

I've never had any real friends. (Social skills, anxiety, fear, insecurity and painful past experiences.)

I don't know if it's even possible for me to recover and do the things I want/should do.
I want to go back to school, maybe even pursue further education. I want to learn social skills and be somebody people enjoy to be around. 
I want to learn how relationships work and be in one. I want to find somebody. To find love. I don't know even know how to love and receive love though. I hate myself and I don't know if that will ever change. I just hate who I have become and wish I could change and be who I dream of being.

Even if I did somehow manage to fix any or all of this, I would probably find something else to be depressed over. Like how it took me until 19 to snap out of whatever the fuck I've been in. To realize I'm wasting my life sitting inside playing video games and smoking weed all day still living with my mother. 

I would be depressed over how much time I've wasted not actually developing myself.
I feel like I'd be playing catch up the rest of my life with things that people were doing when they were in their early teens. I'd be filled with so much regret.

I don't even know who I am.
I don't know what I like or dislike.
I don't know my values.
I don't know what I want from life.
I have no personality.
I have no opinions of my own.
I have no character.
I have no skills.
I have no hobbies.
I don't know how to love or be loved.
I have no redeeming qualities.
I'm a sheep. I'm not my own person.
Who the fuck am I and what am I doing?

I need help."
136,I've never been more scared in all of my life,"Most people won't understand but I am so scared with everything with the Coronavirus. I just had two long stays in hospital. I had Pneumonia in February and was in hospital for a week and I had my appendix out 5 days ago. I'm so scared that I'm about to get the virus and give it to my loved ones. Also my partner thinks that I shouldn't be leaving the house just incase but that will really make my mental health suffer. I'm already suffering. I miss my family, I miss my nephew and my mother and father in law. I'm so on edge about it all and it's only day one of trying not to leave the house. I've already cried about this all weekend. Every time I open my phone or watch TV all that's talked about is the Coronavirus and it's honestly making me feel so depressed. I have nothing to look forward to. Nothing to do. What's even the point."

140,Is it racist to not be sexually attracted to white women?,
141,I am isolating myself from my family because I don't want to hurt them,"Firstly, I think I need to clear some things up for this to make some sense. Also, sorry if my grammar isn't the best. I am not a native English speaker.

I am pretty certain that I have some sort of eating disorder. I have never felt good about how I look, mainly my weight, and struggled with anxiety and lots of negative emotions surrounding this issue. I was (and still am) stressing over everything I eat, I count calories in every food and drink and I feel super guilty and if I am about to puke after I eat something quote on quote ""unhealthy"". I also used to exercise extensively (up to 6 times a week) and there was a time when everything I ate in a day was about half a cup of mashed potatoes (just potatoes, no milk or butter etc.) and a slice of apple. In that time I lost about 20+ kg in three months but thankfully had enough control to ""stop"" after this started to affect my day to day life (I felt weak all the time, had trouble focusing and almost fainted a few times when I was in class. apart from that I was in pain because I ate so little. this mixed with my naturally low blood pressure wasn't...very fun, to be honest). So I started eating really healthy to feel at least a little better. And thankfully, it helped.

Now I am a lot better then I was about a year ago. I still have bad days but those thankfully aren't as frequent as my good ones. I even can eat some junk food sometimes and I don't feel as horrible as before. I know this isn't a thing to be proud of but it still makes me kind of happy.

But this isn't the main thing that I wanted to write about. However, I think it's connected to my issue.   I always feel irritated/on edge. And these feelings are worst around my family, especially my mum. Every single thing pisses me off. If it's someone chewing loudly, making a weird noise, talking with their mouth full or watching me doing chores... It's tiring. I want to spend time with my family but it almost always ends up with me yelling or arguing with them. Or when I try to behave it frequently ends up with me holding back crying/panic attack because everything is super overwhelming, triggering and just awful. Or even better, I hide into my room where I proceed to punch and bite myself hard so I can focus on pain and not what is upsetting me so much.

 So I avoid these kinds of situations by...just not being there. I leave my room only if it's absolutely necessary and I almost always have headphones with music on or at least radio turned on loudly so I can be distracted from the rest of the house residents. And know that my mum suffers from it. 

My sister moved out a few years ago so I am the only child in the house. And well, my mum is a very touchy feely kind of person. She always wants to hug me and tell me how much she loves me and just wants to make my day better. But then I shout at her for whatever bullshit that annoys me at that moment and...it's just ruined. I love her so much, she is an amazing person and I only wish her the best in her life. Which definitely isn't me. I feel like such a horrible person and just thinking about this makes me want to cry as I often do so when there isn't anything to distract me from this fact.

I am a terrible child and they deserve a much better daughter than me. Both of them."
142,I just want people to pity me,And a lot of you can relate. It's easy to pretend like you don't. Maybe it's a comfort thing. Maybe it's a lot easier to pretend someone cares if they pity you. Maybe I've just lived a really crappy life feeling like people should care more
143,My anxiety makes it hard to differentiate between what is real and what is an overreaction,"First, some background:

I was diagnosed with anxiety when i was around six years old. I wasn’t treated with medication until about three years ago since my parents were to focused on the ADHD i was also diagnosed with since it was affecting my grades

Because of this, i am able to perfectly cope with my ADHD and don’t need medication anymore. However, my anxiety is still a mess.

My anxiety led to me being diagnosed with depression, which is genetic and rose to the front when my anxiety got to be too much.

I have a lot of problems that happen, physically and mentally, in relation to my mental illnesses. 99% of the time i dismiss my problems as an overreaction, which has lead to some long-lasting problems

For example, i thought that i had never had a panic attack before. I always thought mine were too minor to be considered a panic attack. However, when i explained one of those little episodes she informed me that i do in fact have panic attacks quite often, and that i should have told her so we could nip it in the bud before it got bad.

Now i’m even more paranoid about if i’m under-reacting to my problems.

Like do i have an auditory sensitivity problem? Or is it normal to be sensitive to noises in the morning and late evening?

Do i dissociate? Or is my spacing out, memory problems, and world-warping episodes just a side effect of my ADHD?

I wish there was a way to distinguish which is which. I once hit a volleyball weirdly and hurt my thumb. I thought it was just a bruise and i needed to suck it up, but t ended up being a really bad sprain and i was out for half the season.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to separate it all, please let me know. Thanks guys"
144,My foster mom is driving me insane,Ever since this whole corona virus thing I’ve lost even more of my freedoms than usual. She won’t let me out of the house and when she does she won’t let me go to the store. She canceled my hair cut and she won’t stop nagging me. I personally don’t give a shit about this whole coronavirus because if I die then I die who cares and it’s just so annoying being stuck in a house all the time now especially since our school closed for the week
145,my therapist recommended meds for anxiety,"and since i’m a minor, she had to call my mom before referring me to a psychiatrist.  

i feel like i’m a completely different person when i get home.  i feel like i put on this like happy bubbly mask but when i’m alone i get super down.  

my mom told me that she had never seen me anxious or sad, but i’ve been depressed for 4+ years now.  I know the meds will be beneficial to me, i just cannot disappoint her more than i already have."
146,Everyone around me is dying... Life is changing... it's not the same... is it supposed to be like this?,"I'm 28. I deal with my own mental health struggles as it is ( depression, anxiety, hopelessness ). However, what I am struggling with at the moment is understanding life. 

A lot of my family members are dying around me, from illness ( Cancer, old age, and otherwise ). Life is just not the same as it was when I was growing up. We don't do the same things anymore. We don't see the same people. I don't have hope and forward-looking as I once had. I feel a sense of despair.

Mom and Dad divorced when I was very young. Mom then went on to meet a very nice man who later became a Father Figure to me as my own biological Father was on and off the scene due to his own mental health problems. This new Father-Figure went on to develop cancer suddenly and died within Months, this was my first experience with death. It changed me. He was 53. I was about 14.

A few years later my Aunt, who was the life and soul of the family ( she was the artsy one, always held the family events ) developed liver cancer, again she was about 50. A year later my Mom's aunt and uncle ( my great aunt and uncle ) both died of cancer within 2 months of each other, they were mid sixties.

2 years after that I lost my biological Father due to liver failure and a multitude of other alcohol-related illnesses, he was 56. That was a weird time. I had an on/off relationship with him over the years due to his alcohol abuse and complicated family history.

A year later, I lost my wonderful Grandma. She practically helped raise me. She died suddenly, though was a fair age at 89. That one really stung.

That was about 3 years ago now and since then we have had other perhaps not so close family members pass on due to old age or otherwise.

I just seem to be surrounded by death... The family is not the same... 

Literally this evening, which is what prompted my post I guess, I heard that my Uncle went for a routine check-up and they found a tumor in his colon.

Is this just life? Going through all of these things just makes me want to run away and hide. It's too painful to deal with.

:-( 

Thanks for listening."
147,Exhausted and Sick.,"Every day, I come out of work and I lay in my bed and I just cry. 

I've been working really long hours, without days off, because a huge chunk of my team is at home sick or stuck in another country. For hours on end, I have to deal with people screaming and treating me like shit over the phone.

Its been 9 straight days. My dog automatically lays in my arms because she knows I'm going to start bawling.

To make it worse, I've been 2 days in with a sore throat. 

Today, it was hard to breathe. I nearly toppled over on the subway stairs because I couldn't catch my breath. I've taken my work stuff and placed it in a spare room with a taped-up sign telling whoever is left not to enter. It's been 2 days of possible signs, I cannot risk getting anyone else infected. 

I'm terrified. I have a 3-year-old. I cannot get him infected, his immune system is just starting to toughen up. It'll kill him.

 I cannot imagine having to deny him a hug when he comes running to me if I test positive for the virus. He wont understand. 

I purposely get home as late as possible. Grandma knows. She's afraid for me. I see her pray day and night in. I see it in her eyes, but from a distance, because she's older and at higher risk. 

I'm angry. I survived so much, put so much effort into recovering, into coping, into healing. I don't want this to be the end.

I hate this pandemic and I hate that it's come down to this. I'm tired, fed up, and sick of it."
148,Insecurities and social media,"For a long time now I have constantly compared myself to almost everyone I see. I pick out the insecurities in me and get jealous of what I see on Instagram! While I am completely aware that what we see is what people want to portray of themselves so it’s not “reality” I still compare myself. If I see my boyfriend has liked a post for example, part of me doesn’t care but the other part thinks “oh she is skinny, I’m not?” Or “she has a smaller chest than me, I don’t?” “Is this what he wants?” All this makes my mindset go to a horrible place and I feel as though I’m not good enough. Recently I made a new Instagram so I can post what I want and follow who I want to see. I thought it would help but I go to my old habits and fall across the same accounts and compare ect. How do I fix this and change my mindset?"
149,How to establish boundaries with a parent?,"For a little backstory, I just moved back in with my mom after living away from home for a few years. I'm starting to realize that I don't think we have many/any boundaries. Well, I know her boundaries but she doesn't know/doesn't care about mine. I feel like anytime we're home together, I don't have space where she can't/won't go. We have an extremely small house and can always hear each other talking if we're on the phone/etc. I feel uncomfortable closing the door to my room because I never did that when I was younger because I knew it made my mom uncomfortable for some reason. I still carry this uncomfortableness into my adult life. I'm still scared to close my door now even though I really want to. I'm worried that she'll ask why I closed it or be butthurt about it because she thinks Im avoiding her because I am. Even if I'm in my room with the door cracked but shut, she'll continue yelling at me thru it to talk to me though I was trying to give the hint I wanted to be alone. On weekends if I sleep in longer than normal, I'll wake up to texts from her if I haven't left my room yet. Nothing important just random things I guess she couldnt wait to tell me? Or was secretly trying to wake me up and make me open my door? I don't know. I'm in my twenties and feel like a teenager again. I don't really know what to do. She's a very controlling, anxious, and insecure woman. I want my personal space but I don't know how to ask her for it without upsetting her or making her feel cross. Any suggestions?"
150,Can anyone relate?,"Does anyone have an experience of a family member who has an addiction and a mental illness and who refuses to help himself? 
How do you deal with someone who goes from house to house hospital to hospital.. 
I know the majority might say its up to him since hes 24. His own problem. We cannot do anything. The issue is that we want to put him in a long term residential hospital but everyone says he has to make the call. He has pushed me i hurt my hip and called cops they didnt do anything. Weve called cops plenty of times... no help. Hospitals just take him out too soon. 
At home hes a pain. A burden. Not wanting to help with chores. Just breaking stuff. Not showering. 
Im at the point of disowning him as my brother."
151,I feel awful lately..,"Im 14.. I have zero friends.. I don't know what to do.. Im worried that its never going to get better. Im feeling awful all the time. I never leave my house except school. Im trying so hard I went out of my comfort zone soo many times to try to have friends but I always fuck it up. Im sick of it. I want to be alone. Why is it so bad to be alone? If I dont feel lonely is it really that bad to be alone all the time? I can't do it anymore. Im different. Im fucked up. I never gonna have friends. Im meant to be lonely. I know Im overreacting but there are so many older people than be who are lonely so whats the chance if now I can't now even make one friend? I don't want feel this way all the time.. Its breaking me. All this stress of being different, not fit in while everyone is going out with friends everyday. What can I even do? Is there a chance that I won't be lonely when I grow up? Is there someone here that felt the same at my age and now feel better?"
152,How do I admit myself to inpatient with Kaiser?,"I need a much much higher level of care than I'm receiving with Kaisers mental health services. I do not want to go to the place I was held at last year. It was traumatizing instead of therapeutic. So my question is how can I find a not shitty hospital that I can admit myself to and kaiser will cover it? I'm in the SF Bay Area and the hospital they sent me to was SJ Behavioral Health. I've also been to Fremont Hospital, but only the adolescent ward and I've heard horrid things about the adult ward. I need a place that works with eating disorder patients and those two hospitals dont. I was sent to SJBH because it was the only place that had a bed and they wanted to get me out of the ER as I had been there taking up space for 14 hours. 

Also I am not approved for inpatient ED treatment, they only approved me for EDIOP so they wont pay if I admit myself to an ED only place. It has to be a kaiser contracted psych hospital. This situation sucks. I just want to feel better."
153,Had an argument with housemate and feel awful.,"So after a walk today I got back and got into an argument with my housemate. When I got back he asked me to take my shoes off in case they were muddy when I walked through to the back door to take them off. The soles were clean, which made me not think about it, but I didn't appreciate the snappy tone he had. 

Then I accidentally brushed past him and he snapped again, before I muttered something and walked off. I then went to get some laundry and needed to remove some of his stuff from the washer/dryer. I didn't feel like talking to him after his tone earlier, so I put them by the side. He then stormed through and said ""you could have asked me to move them!"" in another aggressive tone. 

I then went upstairs for a bit in a foul mood, with the voices berating me in my head and felt like utter shit. I then went down for a drink and he came out of his room heading straight towards me. I interpreted this as him deliberately trying to cut me off, but I realise it could have been him not seeing me, but I shoulder barged him out the way. I probably shouldn't have done this, but I was in a foul mood, and wasn't thinking. This led to another argument and I blew my lid, saying how he moody he was when he was blabbering about how I nudged into him and didn't say excuse me. I said how I thought the gap was big enough (which it was), but stumbled into him by accident. He said I could have apologised, I said I didn't have time since he then was moody, and I didn't feel like apologising afterwards. He said he wasn't moody and said it was me being so.

This has pissed me off and I have done something I now regret. For the first time in my life I have self harmed. Only minor, but it has shaken me. I have scratched myself with my keys and thumped the wall. My fingers hurt, but I know it's not broken as I can flex them perfectly. They just feel a bit sore. I don't know what to do now and I feel awful. I am not apologising for things I should apologise for (the shoulder barge, being thoughtless with my shoes maybe) until he makes an effort himself for how he acted himself, but I don't want there to be a schism, especially as I have another housemate who heard the argument and urged no shouting. I am also anxious that she thinks less of me too."
154,Do I even deserve to live?,"I'm a failure in all ways perceivable. My exams are in two days and I've barely studied, I have no chance of passing. I have no friends, nor is there any point in making friends because I always manage to hurt or annoy or bother people. I'm unpleasant to be around and people avoid me on purpose. I'm fat, ugly, my voice is disgusting, I'm stupid and unable to grasp social cues, lazy and have no skill or talent whatsoever. 

I put off applying for jobs either because I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't want to work or because I feel like I won't be of any use as an employee anyway. I'm a waste of space. I literally have no redeeming qualities. If I've never been anything but a burden to people and this world in general, do I even deserve to live?"
155,I do not understand what is going on in my brain.,"This is new for me and I've never posted before but I need people to turn to. I am a 21 year old female and I do not understand what is going on in my brain, I am not even sure If I can explain it.

1. There is constantly , never ending, music playing in my head. But it doesn't seem to be the ""oh Ive got a song stuck in my head"" kind of thing people seem to talk about, its loud and its constant and it can change with out me even really noticing it. Its so much louder than the voice in my head, so much so that I sometimes struggle to hear my own self. It also means I become over stimulated and overwhelmed by my surroundings, even just simple convocation can be impossible for me.
2. I see certain events as colours. As strange as that sounds, but in the moment, if something is happening , my brain will just suddenly throw up a colour (e.g.blue) and start repeating BLUE BLUE BLUE and this can actually enhance the moment that Im in. For example sometimes during sex its like tunnel vision and my brain will just completely ingulf itself in colour orange, or I remember being on the train and having the overwhelming feeling of YELLOW YELLOW and just my whole body understanding the colour yellow as this environment and that moment in time.
3. I cant seem to stop dislocating, especially with large groups of people. When I am on my own it doesn't seem to be as bad or I just don't notice it as much, but when with a group of people or with my boyfriend sometimes my vision and sound just goes and I just kind of leave for a few moments.
4.  I can only explain things in images. So, I struggle to explain certain things with words as they just come to my head as images. For example I have the feeling of nervousness and sadness and lonely as all I can see it as is a plate and a sponge having paint poured on them. The paint just slides straight off the plate , but the sponge absorbs all these beautiful colours. I am the plate, and I see this image often in my head and it makes me feel nervous and anxious.

I really doubt any of that made any sense but if anyone at all know what any of this could be, or is going through anything similar please comment. I feel like Im going crazy."
156,I’m feeling really depressed.,"
Hi. I am a 25 y/o male who is really depressed rn. I haven’t been happy since I was 13. I suffer from social anxiety and ocd too. Currently I’m not on any medication for this. Before I was on Luvox and klonopin but it made me feel really slow and I just stopped it. Now I just puff on some weed but it really doesn’t help. I just want to sleep all the time. 

On the surface my life seems great. I have a family. A roof over my head, a new car, etc but idk I just don’t feel like being alive. It’s a pain waking up. I feel uncomfortable around my family now, especially my dad. Idk what to do. I just needed to let this off my chest. Any advice would be helpful."
157,tripped for the first time yesterday,never felt so euphoric. all of my meds are shit compared to this stuff. wish i could do it all the time.
158,Needing to cry once a day,"Okay well the title isn't entirely accurate but does anyone else in this sub feel they need to/cry at least once every few days? Maybe even everyday.

Like right now, I felt this immense overwhelming of emotions that I closed up and didn't speak. Yet in a matter of minutes later, my eyes had tears rolling down and I'm thinking about pain and relief?

It's a different reason every other time but after crying, I feel at peace. Feeling of uplifting.

159,Does using recreational drugs affect ssri progress,"I’m being treated for anxiety using cipralex, I was wondering if using recreational drugs will affect the progress. I’m not planning on doing so just out of curiosity)"
160,Beside myself,"Sorry I need to vent because I am falling apart. I feel like my life is falling about. 

My job is crazy because of covid-19 (food service manager), I am very high risk if I come down with it (not due to age but health issues) 

my depression is the worst it’s ever been because I self isolate as much as possible. I haven’t seen my friends or family since this started other than my boyfriend. 

Speaking of which. and worst of all. My boyfriend in the military was brought in full time and told me last night he will be gone for atleast a year and when I asked him about us he said we will cross that bridge when we get there. I didn’t even get to say bye to him when he left too.  I’ve been crying and having panic attacks literally all day. I can’t even function. 

And I’m supposed to go into work tomorrow and be a leader for my team. How."
161,"Lately, I've become super insecure about rejection","Hi,

I don't know how to handle this. Over the years, I've found my ways to deal with stress, anxiety and depression, but now I've developed a new thing, where rejection, brash comments and hurdles in personal projects really hurt me hard. It's like I'm ducking away from someone trying to hit me. I can't deal with this. It came up so sudden and seems to stay. What's going on here? Can anyone relate?"
162,I don’t know if my way of thinking of healthy anymore.,"I guess I’ve never been happy. Or well ever fully living in this reality. I don’t really saying what I have is ‘trauma’ but it’s what others would say. 

Ever since I was little I’ve just come up with ways to help things seems better, back then it was just dolls and toys. 

It just got worst as I grew up.

I’m not the smartest student, I’m not the best child and I’m overall not the best person. I’ve never been happy with what I do. My only form of happiness and what’s kept me sane is like.. headcanons for other characters.

I find my self attaching myself to tv characters who I share similar things with. Both appearance and personality wise. This characters usually stick with me for a while, and I super focus on the show or movie their from. 

But suddenly nothing feels like it’s working. I feel so disconnected.

To cope I’ve managed to convince my self that the simulation theory is real. The theory that nothing is real. 

I’ve convinced my self I am the only being alive and everything around me is scripted code and everything is planned. 

But I don’t want to be apart of this anymore. This can’t be real life. I want to wake up.

I want to wake up so bad, I wanna see what the real world is like.

Our universe is built of trust. Why do we call the colour red ‘red’. Because we trust the person who told us it was called ‘red’.

We trust things to create a view point. But there’s so many different options you can chose to trust- and I don’t like it.

It’s a nice way of thinking I guess. I don’t need to worry, because there’s no point.

But at the same time, it feels like I’m driving my self insane trying to wake up. 

I’m sorry for this, it’s mainly me rambling about how I just feel like a misplaced code, feel free to ignore.

TLDR; I feel like I’m going insane after (what feels like I have) convinced my self life isn’t real and I’m trying to wake up."
163,Unable to cope with the coronavirus,"I recently have had to leave home to homeless accommodation. I have no income, most of my savings have gone, I have £70 left. I have no one I can really ask for help.

The coronavirus and getting sick isnt scaring me, the fact I can find toilet roll, can't stockpile food, can't get any handwash when I should wash my hands super often. 

I'm alone and that scares me too, I soon wont be able to go see friends either and I am contemplating ending it before I get sick or run out of toilet paper among other things."
164,"I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me, is that too much to ask?",
165,Corona is making my anxiety act up,"I rarely get anxious until i feel stuck and i dont know what to do...so where i live, we finally got some rules and lock downs because of the virus. Im not stressed that ill get sick really. Im so afraid for other people and that they wont make money anymore and im stressed out about my grandparents. Plus i just need someone to ask if im okay because im really not okay. With the lock down i will be stuck in my house with my step dad who has given me a few anxiety attacks before and he loves to gaslight. Im stuck, i want to cry, no one i care for is caring enough to just send me a “you okay?”. Moments like these where i just avoid everything and my thoughts by laying in my bed, sleeping my days away and i dont want to do that, but that will feel better then feeling anxious constantly."
166,I’ve been so depressed because of this..,"I am a very social person. I have ADHD, depression and anxiety but take an amazing combination that makes my emotions a lot easier to manage. I was content as ever, until I had to report my manager for sexual harassment. They told me I have to be suspended for a week for the investigation.. it has now been three. I feel so useless not being able to work. I love my job with a passion. I work in hospitality so it’s an amazing outlet for me and I meet so many amazing people. I’m so sad though because I haven’t worked. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to do anything. I’m just so sad because I am not allowed to be the social butterfly I am and it’s ruining me. What do I do. 
P.S.- contacting HR tomorrow to get answers on when I can come back."
167,Ways my father ruined my mental health,"1. I know how to stop my crying in an instant (keep myself from breathing, any way possible)
2. I have suicidal thoughts
3. I've considered murdering him
4. I'm mortally afraid of messing up
5. I'm also mortally afraid of yelling
6. I'm still in this hell-house"
168,My family triggers my biggest breakdowns.,"I have 2 sisters, who I do not talk to unless they are at the same place. Both of them know that I have been diagnosed with social phobia.   
My parents know too. Except for my father who is my only support, none of them care, they just don't. Never ask how i felt, never tried to understand my behaviour. They call me a party pooper or the creep.  I see the world trying to open and be more understanding to people like me and my own mother literally just told me that with me she feels like she has a stepdaughter. ""I never laugh with you, you're so complicated.""  She also told me 4 times that she doesn't like me.   
Because I have problems adjusting to the world, I live with my parents, but I do as much as I can to help and stay in my room as much as I can. And I know she wants me gone.   
I just don't know how to deal with all this. Everything she says is a dagger in my heart really. At this point I think it will be easier for her not to have me in her life."
169,Hospitals Are Not Capable of Handling Mental Health Patients.,"As I type this, I am in a Hospital for Mental Health as I had a suicidal episode that had the police take me into the Hospital. Right at this very second, I am in an isolated room with nothing to do and a phone that is about to die. If their idea of helping mentally ill people is to lock them in a room with nothing but their own fucked up thoughts to drive them insane, humanity has no right to continue. What the hell is wrong with these people?"

Rn I don’t know if I can finish uni. I have this one essay due; something about foreign policy and it’s just too much for me. I‘m already working on it for the second deadline now because I couldn’t make the first one and I‘m just done. It’s not even that long but I can’t do it. I don‘t know how, it just freaks me out when I think about it. I‘m not coming forward, I have to hand it in in two days. I‘m desperate, if I don‘t hand it in I‘ll loose a whole year because of one fucking essay. And not only that but I‘ll also have to pay a bunch of money for it. I‘m done. Please give me some tips :("
172,I need help. Considering if suicide is my only option left. Coronavirus and gang stalking.,"Last night I was awake until morning shaking with a fever of 101 and sweating and my throat got worse and I have kept telling my parents on the phone they need to fucking self quarantine already because clearly they are at risk of having it and since I live by myself and don’t even interact with any other humans or leave the house (no job/school) except once a week when they come visit to go grocery shopping I only could have gotten it from them. Someone from my dad’s work was exposed and they have been feeling a little under the weather. But they haven’t been listening to me, they have just been going out grocery shopping and working

I have always been weak, I would get seizures from the common cold well into my teenage years and that’s actually a whole problem in that I still don’t know if this is just a cold because I always get awful symptoms and fever. But they still came to visit me after being exposed and now I’m sick. I called my mom last night scared because my head was so heavy and heart was pounding, and I have been drenching the bed with sweat, and she got mad at me for calling because she was tired and wanted to go back to bed. I felt awful and like I am a fucking idiot overreacting

They are part of the problem with this entire country and why this is such an issue, why people like Donald trump are president, they keep saying well I feel better or fine or I’m not that sick, my dad even said he’s a hero and an “Emergency Coronavirus worker” for continuing to go to work and “bringing food to the hungry children” (he is a food delivery truck driver) I said he’s literally fucking probably spreading it to tons of people shut the fuck up, they keep saying they don’t have room to care about the country they aren’t the mayor they have their own problems so they have to take care of themselves. Then my dad said I’m not going to be able to get disability because I don’t “look or sound that retarded” and I need to go get a job like he does (I had to drop out of my dream college that I got a $72,000 scholarship to go to,  I couldn’t do it because of schizophrenia and autism.) and my mom said she lost her job at Amazon because of me and how I got hospitalized. Well I didn’t fucking tell her she had to quit, I didn’t need or want her, she quit because she said the job was too hard

They keep saying I’m overreacting and “people are laughing about it and going to Vegas and bars right now explain that!!!There’s barely any cases we’ll be fine!! I’m just sick from allergies and working so hard!!!” When I called my mom last night because I was feeling really bad she got mad at me and said was tired and needed to sleep and even said my symptoms were probably just from accidentally overdosing on ibuprofen (that I was taking in the first place for my fever..... And didn’t even take the max dose)

I’m going to go get tested so that way if I’m positive they’ll be forced to stay home. To be honest I’m terrified though considering there’s only 32 “confirmed” cases in Oregon and I’m so afraid the trump administration will send more people out to stalk me. I will be turning myself into more a political target. I’m already a target by them and now they’re really going to have reason to come for me all because of my parents. But If I don’t do anything they could convict me, they will do whatever they can to spin things like that. I have been being gang stalked by this organization, that’s a subset of the group in Russia who got trump elected for months and there is no way they won’t up stalking even more if I test positive. To be honest thinking about that I don’t know what to do I want to die the stalking is so bad already. I think you won’t believe me but I can prove this is happening. It is so bad I am starting to consider if this could be the end for me, where I would reach a point where I just have to kill myself because of this group. Even if I test negative they will spin it some way, just for me going to see a doctor. They have been searching for something to convict me for, even if they have to lie or take video or audio footage out of context to make me look like I have committed some crime. So now it’s the end of the line for me all because of my parents"
173,I’m losing my mind..?,"I’m feeling like I’m losing my grasp on reality. Nothing severely traumatic happened in my life. I guess I’ve always thought about things differently than my peers. Some see me as odd or having weird interests. 
I have some friends but we don’t relate deeply.  I mainly talk to them enough so they don’t leave me behind. I don’t want people to think of me as lonely. I’m not lonely. I prefer to be alone actually.  It’s hard for me to type this because i never really talk about it. But I have so many strange thoughts. Some are random small things others are not so harmless. I’ve lately realized how little things actually matter. But. I still play by the boring rules.  Anyways. If you’re still reading I feel a static almost building. I feel like something very significant is coming. I don’t know what. But everything is so still and growing lately. I have felt this before this while covid-19 chaos."
174,i need advice,"so, i’ve self diagnosed myself with derealisation purely because after extensive research this is the only term that has the symptoms i experience.

i want advice, do i see a therapist? 
i’ve been feeling “out of it” for so long now i haven’t been feeling myself. i’ve had therapy before but that was to address my self confidence issues. within the last year i’ve had to deal with my brothers death and this hit me really really hard and i bury that all away with a reckless lifestyle. i’m 17 and i should be taking a lot more care of myself. since his death i’ve been worrying 24/7 about everyone and everything. i don’t feel the same way i used to and that’s not only about his death i feel different and it’s so difficult to explain but i just feel like i’m not all there. i don’t know what to do and i need advice. both of my parents are mental health nurses but despite that they’d advise me to go to therapy. i need someone to talk to and i want something that makes ME feel like ME. i hugely appreciate any feedback or response for a matter of fact.

175,Trisha Paytas is a hypocrite moron,"Hello people of r/mentalhealth, 
i have been diagnosed with DID not too long ago, it has been about a year. i don't use the 'we' pronounces although i do feel more than welcome to, i dont feel the need to. anyhow, i am here to talk about Trisha Paytas.
Trisha has 'come out' as bi, transgender, gay, a chicken nugget and planty more, but as of little less than two days ago she has come out as a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder.
of course, i am noone to be judging or telling her that she is not suffering from that disorder, but i do have the power to express my feelings towards it.
in the video she took a massive shit on everything people in the DID community have been building up for years, and all that with ONE video.
she called a diagnosed person ""crazy"", spread so much misinformation and hasn't stopped being ignorant and disrespectful.
doing what she does for money and fame is disgusting. i can't even pity her anymore because that's all she wants.
i am sorry for anyone feeling this way about her, and i hope she finds peace with herself and with others.

i would be more than happy to hear your thoughts on this issues."

What happens when BPD is left untreated because I’m starting to be a bit scared for my wellbeing! I literally had a GP shout at me last time I went about my mental health, basically refusing to write me sick notes and review me because he was a locum and ‘doesn’t know me’.

178,Accepting an Abusive Family Member,"Hi everyone. I have a question. Is it possible to have a good relationship with a family member that abused you when you were a child? Let's say an uncle molested or raped you after taking you in when you became an orphan. Him and his wife fed you and cared for you. Treated you like their children. 

Could you still have a great relationship with him?

Could you still have a great relationship with your cousins? (His kids). 

I understand it's complicated, please don't remind me that's it's complicated. I just want to know what YOU would do and how YOU would feel. 

Thank you."
179,my boyfriend is a paranoid schizophrenic,"ive been with my boyfriend for 6 months, i went into the relationship knowing that he had schizophrenia &amp; didn’t listen to everyone that said how hard it would be. at first i didn’t mind, i love him and id do anything in the world for him, but these days it’s getting rough. we had our first argument about a week ago, he was going on and on saying that he didn’t want me around my dad anymore, that my dad has me “under his spell” &amp; im obedient to him and on his side. he also seems to think that my dad is trying to one up him or just be against him. i tried to talk to him and told him that i understood how he was feeling and we didn’t have to go anymore. well the arguing progressed, and he got so mad he started punching a chair &amp; then punched the wall and busted his knuckle. today on the way to work he got mad at me again. he said ive never cared about him, ive always been against him, i don’t love him etc. he’s told me twice that i make him want to kill himself. he’s on medication but once I started working and wasn’t giving it to him every night, he stopped taking it right. i do everything for this man. ive fixed tons of things with our car, i work everyday, i pay our bills, i buy our food.. but he makes me feel like i do nothing, like it’s not good enough or i should be trying harder but i feel like im giving everything in me. im so drained &amp; tired and now im even scared bc he’s getting violent. he told me he wanted to beat me when we were in the car the other night.. just out of nowhere. idk what to do. im scared to stay but i don’t want to leave him, i love him and don’t want him to be alone. i also don’t want him to feel like im leaving him bc of his condition, bc that’s far from it. idk what to do anymore. someone help?"
180,(Hard!) Lessons about mental health I learned from being locked down in China for 2 months that I hope might help you,
181,Venting. It think,"I'm not old at all, so it makes sense as tow hy I dont know any of this but I just wanted to see if anyone knew anything about what I'm like.
I've also never really done anything like this,, venting in general not just online. Basically im sorry if this is all over the place and the quesrions are dumb

I dont really feel happy or sad, just sort of empty. I can pretend to be happy throughout the day but as soon as I get home, nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
I also dont outright love anything or hate anything, most of its just neutral. I just do those things to pass time and get through the day and onto the next. 
I haven't really spoken to anyone about this mainly because it doesn't seem like depression and honestly others have it worse, so I just tend to live with I suppose. I've tried to reaching out to friends but I immediately get dismissive because I feel needy and stupid. I'm a mess.
I think about suicide, I've written notes and I think about how I might do it. 

All of my opinions on things are just neutral. It's like I dont love or like anything. This can spread from music, to shows, to even my family and friends.
Theres nothing I love, everything is sort of just there in my life, and I assume things will just be filtered out until the next batch of things in my life come in and I just find them neutral as well.

I'm not a fan of any sort of sexual stuff. The only reason I want to have sex is so I dont feel like I'm falling behind or different from others. 
Everytime I've gone out with someone the furthest I will go is just kissing them on the check because I guess I just dont like kissing. 

I just feel so alone and awkward when texting or talking to my friends about my problems, so they just tend to fester. I don't talk to anyone, I dont go out, i just stay in my room anytime I'm free.
However, I did try going on friday but I was so socially exhausted (even after doing nothing) I just left without saying goodbye. They walked off one way and i just slid off to another path and went home. Is that weird? 

Like I said I'm sorry of the random assortment of paragraphs of my problems and short anecdotes. I just had to say something even if it was on reddit."

184,tips on loneliness?,"i just recently moved to my grandparents house where I'm barely around anyone which it's taking a hard toll on my mental health. I feel so alone most of the time even when I'm still keeping in contact with my SO thru text but i still end up feeling so alone. I was living with my mom before which I was around her 24/7 and we even shared a king size bed. at least then I didn't feel alone that much but ig I'm someone that has to be around other people even if we're not even talking. I'll spend some time with my brother and sister, but then end up having to be alone, as soon as I'm alone I feel such a dreaded feeling. I'm not sure how to combat this. I smoke weed regularly to help with physically pain and it helps with the loneliness but not for long. is there any healthy coping mechanisms that could possibly help me in such situations? any suggestions would be greatly appreciated"

Last month it started again, but this time it was much stronger than before, after about 3 weeks it started to get better although I still have it a bit, but the real problem is that now I can't really distinguish what's real and what is a dream; I mean, if I dream about dragons and those things I know it's not real, but if I dream about something that could be real i can't really tell if that actually happened or not. Another problem is that my memory got worse, I still have memories but it's harder to remember them. During the day I can't really feel emotions anymore, except for a constant state of anxiety. What can I do? Is it correlated to derealisation or could It be something worse? In this period I am very stressed and I am a teenager so maybe the hormones are involved? Help me please because I can't go on living in this situation."
186,"Been diagnosed with depression since I was a teen (32 now), but not sure the diagnosis is accurate or complete. I occasionally have violent or irrational outbursts that have gotten worse lately. Where can I go for a better evaluation?",
187,Never ending cycle in my head,"Trigger warning:
- suicidal thoughts
- self harm
- eating disorders

This is very long but please bare with me. Please help me help myself. I am 27F. 

To start with, I think my main problem is that I don’t feel like I have a right to say I have a problem. I am terrified that all these years of inner torture are actually all just bullshit. I feel as though, although I might feel anxious and depressed sometimes, and although I’ve self harmed in the past and fantasised about suicide, what if I’m actually just full of shit and I make this stuff up because I don’t have the back bone to actually face my problems and instead id prefer to be diagnosed with some mental illness that takes away some of the responsibility I’ve probably just been avoiding all along? 

This fear has stopped me seeking help in the past many times. This starts a cycle that sort of sounds like this: 
“I don’t have a problem, I just don’t want to be held accountable for my actions and I use the possibility of being mentally unstable to justify why I say and do shitty things sometimes.”
Then, this turns into a self pity party where I cry, yell, sometimes I break things, sometimes will have a full blown anxiety attack at the realisation this might be the truth. 
THEN this turns into a desperation, and I start frantically thinking HEY hang on these are total symptoms of a real mental illness, I should see a doctor. 
I book a doctors appointment and I go, knowing in the back of my mind I’m probably full of shit. I tell the doctor about my anxiety, fear, extremely low self worth and they put me on a medication and send me to a therapist. 
I take the meds and see the therapist (for a little while) and then I just decide one day that, because they don’t seem to be treating my issues with any urgency or I don’t feel like they really care, I start to read into their body language and conclude they would rather be dealing with someone with real issues and someone who really needs the help - not someone with just a fucking inferiority complex. 
I proceed to cancel all my appointments and stop the medication immediately and say “fuck it, none of this is actually real, I don’t actually even need to be here because I’m full of shit.”

Then I’ll push the experience out of my mind. Then I go to hang out with friends/go into public/get out more, and I start to compare myself to every single person around me and wonder why i can’t be more this, that, more like other people. Then I’ll have ONE tiny encounter with one person who doesn’t take my or my self esteem seriously, and that’s it. It would only take something so little for someone to say or look at me differently, but it hits a nerve when it does. They have ‘crossed a line’ and I will ‘make them pay’, usually I decide the best way is to kill myself out of spite to make them feel bad.

Then I start to plan out how I would do it, who will look after the cat, who will care? Would my family be okay if I did? Then I realise I’m a coward and would never have the guts to kill myself, and that none of this is real or legitimate and that I’m once again, full of absolute shit. - although if I don’t decide I want to kill myself out of spite for the other person, I decide that I need to go out of my way to make their life difficult as pay back, which I have never followed through with either. As soon as they say something nice again I’ll reconsider everything I thought before and change my mind again and they’re not so bad.

Then I realise, yet again, that these are the thoughts of someone who’s possibly mentally unstable. And so I book ANOTHER doctors appointment, and the cycle. fucking. starts. again. This has happened 4 times now with 4 different doctors and 4 different therapists, but the 5th time I tried my doctor didn’t even follow up with the referral which reinforced my belief that she too, thinks I’m full of shit.

Obviously a lot has happened outside of this too. I’ve seen one good therapist but I didn’t feel it got deep enough. She helped me figure out that I have an “a-typical eating disorder”. I was supposed to get help for this but alas, I decided that was all bullshit, it wasn’t real and I didn’t actually need help.

Objectively, I have been trying for years (because my doctors don’t or won’t) to diagnose myself (pffff, I know) with something so that I can get help that helps. I’ve been told I have anxiety and depression when I was a teen but I feel as though I possibly have symptoms of borderline personality disorder. A close friend of mine has this and she has helped me learn a lot more about it. I am terrified to go to the doctor to ask them to figure out if this could be the problem, and if not, then what the fuck IS my problem, do I even have a problem? Because it starts a new cycle all over again and I’m just not sure I can take that anymore. However, I am too scared to actually commit suicide and part of me wants to come out the other side of this toxic mindset. I feel completely and helplessly trapped in my own head. Please, somebody help me."
188,Concerned about my friend’s mental health,"My(17m) friend’s(17f) really close friend recently killed himself and she hasn’t been the same since. She just seems kinda out of it and she’s been drinking more. I tried reaching out last night and said I would be there for her and she accepted my help, but I don’t expect her to reach out bc of our history. I liked her a few times and even asked her out on a few dates. She rejected me and even stood me up on one occasion. I’m still concerned for her and really want to help her. What should I do?"
189,"17yr old male, hopeless and unstable","I’ve been struggling for about two years with some pretty terrible insomnia (waking up 6-10x a night), which has recently gotten worse. As a result I’ve become increasingly angry with the world, and with people in general. In the past, whether with good sleep or bad I had always been rather temperamental and often aggressive, but now things have really gotten out of hand. I truthfully feel my sanity slipping away. I’ve begun talking to myself, yelling, punching walls, enjoying the pain, fantasizing about killing people, raping girls my age, cutting them up, etc. I have horrible headaches, splitting pain, and am so full of rage. I blow off steam in my backyard yard cutting up trees with an axe, pretending they’re people. I made a deal with the devil to sleep better, but that didn’t work out, evidently. I’m on anti anxieties and a plethora of other OTC, prescription, and herbal sleep aids, non of which I suspect are working. I’m beginning to feel trapped, as if I have no choice but to just eventually release my pent up anger. I can’t help myself, honestly. I’ve seen doctors before, I used to be suicidal, and still kind of am. Any how, what do you guys think I should do, but I legitimately need some advice. Thanks"
190,Anger issues,"I just broke my door by hitting it and I broke down to my grandma, I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety,PTSD from my childhood and Asperger's. Basically I was playing Xbox with my friends like I usually do but my sister always comes and bothers me and she kept throwing stuff at me and yelling random things at me when I told her to go away so I got up and she went back to her room but I was so angry I punched my door and put a big crack in it. This is not a one time thing either I got kicked out of school twice for breaking stuff. But I usually don't do it at home and I'm going to a new school today and if I get kicked out I go to a residential school and I'll freak out. Any suggestions?"

192,I’m so fucking ugly :),It looks like I have down’s syndrome or something. I don’t. I just want to be pretty. Why can’t I look like a normal fucking human being?
193,This is making me very insecure,
194,Not sure how to feel,"Trigger warning: sexual

So, history wise, v bad mental health, what’s new! (Joking) and something has been playing on my mind a lot recently, I wanted just to put it out there and see what people think.

So, years and years ago, when I was 13/14 I was that reserved, nerdy kid who tried hard not to be gay and all that fun shit we go through. I ended up on a lot of chat rooms where people would talk and then trade msn (remember that?!) details. I remember vividly talking to this 18/19 year old guy (maybe older?) who knew how old I was and sweet talked me into ‘camming’ with him. 

Bare in mind that I was a very naive, reserved kid, exploring what it was to be gay in such a hateful environment (created by my own mind and religious grandparents). I’d never exposed myself to anyone before, hated the idea of it, but for some reason, I did with this guy. I remember it not feeling ‘right’, but I was  young, naïve and didn’t really know what I was doing.

It’s kinda ‘plagued’ me for years, just seems to pop up a lot more lately. I kinda feel violated, or even used by what happened. I’m not sure how to describe it, and I understand teenagers do these things, it happens, and much worse happens to. I just wonder if I’m overthinking it, or if my feelings of violation/being used have some validity behind it? Just a vent and a search for people’s experience with similar situations."
195,I wish I’d completely lose my mind,"My whole life I’ve struggled to function normally. It’s exhausting. Twice I’ve had brief psychotic episodes. I’ve gone through many extended periods of dissociation of varying length and severity. 

I’m so tired of fighting and clawing to get a grasp on reality. I’m good enough at pretending to be okay, that I feel like I can’t get help. I can just put on a mask. But I feel so tired and empty and terrified 24/7. 

I feel like I’m on the brink. And it sucks. I want out. I’ve spent so much of my life trying to get better and I’m tired. I wish I’d get worse instead. Bad enough that I’d no longer feel this responsibility to maintain my tenuous grasp on sanity. Or the appearance of sanity. I’m tired of hiding. I need to hand this off to someone else. I need someone to take care of me."
196,I’m honestly terrified of myself (serious),"I am scared for my own and other’s safety ATM, so I get these strange thoughts and visions out of nowhere of me, sometimes from a third point of view but typically in first person view, slaughtering my friends and people I dislike, it’s very disturbing. I do not intend to cause bodily harm to anyone but these thoughts and visions are slowly turning to urges to harm someone or myself, thoughts like “what if I stabbed him” or “what if I stabbed my arm” pop in my head and it caused me great distress, I haven’t opened up IRL because I would probably face some sort of issue with either school administrators or the local authorities. No joke not too long ago (maybe 2 months ago) if class hadn’t ended, I probably would’ve tried to kill this really annoying kid in my class, The pencil was in my hand and my hand was twitching, urging to move, I was looking at his neck and I was having a really hard day that day and he was being irritating. It’s so frustrating because as a guy showing negative emotion is “pussy-like”, and I have to bottle it up until something lights the fire and I explode in rage, I don’t feel safe, I do self harm, I have small knives but do not have access to firearms or large knives to any excessive weaponry 

Is this normal stress fucking with my head or do I need to go somewhere"
197,How I feel,"
Am I hunger. Or am I hungers slave.
 A deep feeling inside me always. Breaking through in times of in-toxicity. An emotional ball of wailing. Anxiety. Depression. Compassion. Construction. Love 
In the end no one can see through my mask my ego. Only I know how to reveal it. Only I can break it. Only I can truly conceal everything with the intellectual web of my mind. 

Happiness is always a thing people take for granted. You won’t even know it’s gone. Only you will truly realise a piece is missing wen ur most comfortable and sanctioned. The place where you’ll never grow but always feel happy. The place you’ll run to forever. 
But what happens wen that’s gone..? What happens wen ur mask is missing?
A vulnerability. So sensitive and uncomfortable. Always. 
But only you can build it back up and ride over the fields of doubt, doom, despair, depression. Only you.
In the end it will always be you and only you."
198,All the precautions being put in place due to the Corona virus is somehow triggering my anxiety and depression,"Before I start, I would like to clarify that I understand why all of these recommendations are being put into place, and I've been following updates from the CDC and appreciate their guidelines. 

My work (I work in a nursing home) has tightened security in our building and is making us work longer hours. That's something I totally understand why that's happening, and it wouldn't be a problem, but my boss and some people at work have turned extremely aggressive and it makes wanting to go to work harder.

Social distancing is highly encouraged. My local gym and my church have closed down for the time being (although my church has us streaming our sermons, it's not the same).

All my major events/trips have been canceled, and those have been the only things I've been looking forward to in a long time. 

Going to the store is just a bad scene from the hunger games. Everyone is becoming so violent and buying everything they possibly can that I'm to scared to go to the store anymore, and even if I could, my store might not even have what I'll need

This whole thing is driving me insane and the fact that we have no idea when this will all be over is making it worse. 

What has been helping y'all through all of this?"
199,My ex ended our relationship because she blamed me and/or our relationship for her long-term anxiety. Is this a common experience?,"Hi everyone

A couple of months ago, my girlfriend of 1 1/2 years suddenly ended our relationship.

We had been apart for a couple of weeks over Christmas ; the breakup happened when we reunited. Before Christmas, everything had seemed fine. We had even put down a deposit on a shared apartment; living together was her idea. So the breakup came as a shock.

She has suffered with anxiety for years, though was only diagnosed last November. She has an aversion to doctors and medicine, especially in regards to mental health. What she saw as the 'cause' of her anxiety changed from month to month (colleagues, friends, work...), though the overarching problem was her relationship with her parents. She left her home country to live where we are now to get away from them.

By November her anxiety had gotten so bad that she went to see a doctor about it. I had been encouraging her to do this. I went with her to the clinic each time and helped her to be consistent with her medication, both at her request. Soon she showed improvement; she was sleeping so much better, and was less stressed and worried. Her doctor had said that, after Christmas, her health would have improved enough to allow the deeper therapy to begin.

Christmas comes, and we both return to our home countries and our families. I don't know what took place between my ex and her family, other than it was a better experience than what she had anticipated. I also learned subsequently that she had stopped taking her medication within a few days of returning home, because she 'felt better and didn't need them'. She didn't consult with her doctor before doing this.

We reunited after Christmas, and the breakup happened. Now she blamed me for her anxiety. She said that she didn't feel comfortable around me. That she wanted to be independent. That she felt like my pet. A long list of problems with me. A couple were issues we had already resolved; most had never been raised before. This was completely crushing. We parted again for several weeks after this.

I soon entered therapy myself to get through this. Eventually I realised that it was unfair for my ex to blame her anxiety on me. I reached out to her last week to request a meetup, so we could discuss this and try to clear the air. She flatly refused. So we've barely interacted for two months. On the rare occasion that I've seen her, she seems fine.

Does this sound like a familiar pattern of behaviour for a person with anxiety? I really don't think I or our relationship were to blame. I'm willing to accept that I'm wrong about this, but having some context re anxiety would be super helpful. Thanks."
200,Coronavirus Advice (includes mental health tips),"**Introduction**

This post is includes general advice to better understand the coronavirus, and a list of suggestions to stay safe, calm, and to help ride out this storm.

Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that are typically mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), though rarer forms can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019, referred to as COVID-19, originated in Wuhan in Hubei, China, and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

At the time of writing this post there are 155,800 cases, 5,800 deaths, and 74,000 recoveries. The numbers are all expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks and months, and it is likely they will increase an an exponential rate until it reaches a peak, and then will continue to decline until the pandemic is over.

We should be taking this very seriously, however, we should not cause unnecessary panic or stress to ourselves or others if it can be avoided. Preparation and wisdom is the key mindset to adopt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Practical Advice**

* Wash hands - using soap and hot water to wash hands for around 20 seconds.
* Social distancing - reduce close contact between people for the time being. Read more [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/).
* Sneeze into elbow.
* Avoid touching face as much as possible.
* If you feel unwell, especially with a high temperature, persistent cough, you should either stay home, or consider visiting your doctor. **If in doubt, check** **local** **advice**.
* Do's and Don'ts of hand washing - [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dos-and-donts-of-handwashing-11583952006](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dos-and-donts-of-handwashing-11583952006)
* Not everyone you know is going to be affected or die, but you should be extra kind to others during this time regardless of what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

**Positive mindset**

It is important to maintain an optimistic yet positive mindset during this time to reduce unnecessary worry, anxiety and panic. Here are a few mindsets to consider during this time:

* We are all in this together.
* Many have recovered already, and many will not be affected by it.
* All bad things, including pandemics have the opportunity to make us love each other, ourselves and life more.
* Petty arguments and worries become less relevant and important during times of crises.
* If you cannot be loving and helpful in a crisis, then when can you.
* Those who survive may develop an increased appreciation for life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vaccines**

Scientists are working on vaccines, which hopefully will be available soon:

**Anxiety**

Here are a few links to check out for ways of dealing with anxiety:

&amp;#x200B;

**Stress**

Stress can inhibit our bodies' ability to fight off infections. Some stress is healthy, but too little and we may not take the right actions, and too much makes us more vulnerable.

From the following [article](https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html) on stress and the immune system:

&gt;*When we’re stressed, the immune system’s ability to fight off antigens is reduced. That is why we are more susceptible to infections.The stress hormone corticosteroid can suppress the effectiveness of the immune system (e.g. lowers the number of lymphocytes).Stress can also have an indirect effect on the immune system as a person may use unhealthy behavioural coping strategies to reduce their stress, such as drinking and smoking.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Activities**

These activities are more for those who have been advised to stay at home for some time.

* Read books
* Listen to Podcasts
* Listen to Music (especially relaxing music)
* Watch some films
* Play some games
* Writing - books, articles, poetry, blog posts.
* Comedy - films, videos, memes.
* Activism - do something constructive, such as online activism, or some form of volunteering if you can.
* Mindfulness
* Meditation
* Exercise

201,baby steps,"This past week has been really stressful for me, but I’ve made a couple steps in the right direction for my well-being and for that I’m really proud of myself. :)

My body image hasn’t been good since I was about 12 so that’s around 4 years. However, I slowly stopped having proper lunches all together over this past year since I don’t really have much of an appetite around lunch time anyway, but even when I do think about maybe buying some lunch my body image goes completely out of whack and I end up feeling way too guilty and shit about myself to have a meal - so then I’ll just either buy a small snack or wait until dinner. However, on Thursday, there was a themed day in the school cafeteria, and the food looked REALLY good and I was in a decently good mood, so for once I finally thought “you know what? fuck it” and bought the lunch. It was curly fries, onion rings, a hot dog and a caramel popcorn brownie with ice cream. So - compared to usually not eating a meal, that was a pretty huge deal for me. I haven’t eaten a proper lunch since then, but still.

Also, on Sunday I went for a walk, and for the first time in MONTHS, almost a whole YEAR, I went out in public without makeup. There weren’t nearly as many people outside as usual due to coronavirus so it’s not like many people would see me anyway but that’s still a MASSIVE deal for me, I’m usually WAY WAY WAY too anxious and terrified to go out in the open with no makeup on. I’m not saying makeup is a bad thing, but I feel like more often than not, I’m wearing it for the wrong reasons, doing it to hide my insecurities because I secretly hate myself rather than doing it because I like to do it or because it makes me feel good.

So yeah, though they were small, things happen this week that I wouldn’t imagine happening for a long time. So yeah, I’m proud. And no one can take that away from me. :)"
202,Looking for coping methods for reoccurring nightmares,"so for context, i've always struggled with mental health in things like depression and anxiety. recently, after taking a (safe) dose of lorazepam to help me sleep through some anxiety i woke up and apparently asked my mother to take me to a mental health clinic. i have no memory of doing this (because i was still loopy from the medicine at the time of asking), and when we were later in said mental hospital's waiting room, i realized my mistake. yes, that place might help most people, but the treatment there only made things worse for me. as i went there voluntarily and hadn't been admitted yet, i decided it would be best for us to go home. note that up until this point i was told they can't legally keep me there. when i told the woman attending to us that we had changed our minds and thank you, but we were going to leave, she told me i couldn't, because according to the answers i gave i was deemed unsafe to leave. i do understand she is just doing her job, but i believe there were misunderstandings about the nature of my answers. i broke down in a panic attack realizing i was trapped in this unfamiliar place with these unfamiliar people. my mother tried to calm me down and asked the people coming to take me back into the facility to step out for a moment so she could console me. one of the nurses coming to take me remarked to her coworkers about how they should put me in solitary confinment if i don't stop crying. didn't help. eventually my mother was forced out and they took me back. i kinda shut down when stuff like this happens, so i was very unresponsive at the time. they had me strip and examined my body, the nurse saying ""oh, been trying to cut youself huh?"" when she looked at my cat scratches (i petsit for a neighbor). she later cut the strings off of my hoodie and put me with the other minors. i don't recall a lot of what happened because i spent all of my time staring at a wall, drawing, or figuring out how to get out of there legally. i do, however, remember some key points that made everything worse. i wasn't given any of my medication, i couldn't sleep because of allergy related congestion, i was scared out of my mind the entire time, and was also told by the nurse practitioner that i would never find a job. thanks lady, you really fucking helped me cheer up there. i did make it out eventually by putting on a smile, but i'm still left feeling traumatized by the whole situation. 

now that the long part is over, i keep getting nightmares about still being stuck in that place and not being able to reach my mother (we're very close). i always wake up covered in sweat and shaking, and it always affects the rest of my day. 

does anyone know how to help with these nightmares? it's really getting to me and i don't even know why i'm still getting them now that it's over. i'm still new to reddit, so i'm sorry if i did this wrong. thank you in advance, i greatly appreciate any comment or support in help. it means more to me than you may know."
203,"I can’t handle being so stressed out about everything, please help in anyway you think you can.","I’ve got to be at work in 8 hours and I’m already stressed about it. With the hysteria of the virus that has been spreading, I’ve been unable to do my job as well as I want and have also been on the verge of losing my mind due to the fact that we have no help, just 3 people trying to make sure everything is supplied so everyone can get into fights over water and toilet paper all while I’ve been trying to wear 50 different hats on the job. I’ve got nothing left once I finish the job and then I’m stuck feeling like I didn’t do enough. I can’t stand it. Please help.... please."
204,Just stop talking to my imaginary friend (myself) and it feels so lonely.,"20M. I just wanted to try because everybody all say it's weird and no one do it except for little kids. But I've always been doing it.
 I tried to not do it since last night. Oh. Just realized this amount of loneliness, maybe the reason I can keep myself introverted is because I always talk to my imaginary friend, it's coping mechanism to make loneliness away.

I always been an avoidant and don't know how others live, could you give me advice or suggestions please?"
205,Important question regarding helping my father with mental health...,"Hey guys.. I'm not sure where to start so I'll just dive in.. basically my father as I know him is a really great, generous friendly guy and a lot of his shortcomings ive always chalked up to drinking (anger, depression) because it would often accompany it but there has been a consistent thing I've noticed where he will be the friendliest happiest dude one day and the next say he wants to die and he will tell me ""I always feel like this... you dont understand the struggles of not making enough to pay bills"" I cant say much to this aside from addressing the fact he doesnt feel this way everyday... 

he often goes on rants repeatedly telling me something regardless of how many times I say ""okay"" or ""yeah i get you"" and will profusely tell me I ""never agree with him"" or ""always think hes wrong"" which I simply dont.... I understand these sound like common behaviors of maybe a family who do not get along or have issues but  this does not feel normal at all... when like this he will also smile and make insults and turn very vindictive I think is the word... 

he refuses to believe he has issues and only got him to come close to admitting he does once in which he said ""maybe I do have mental issues BUT"" then ranted... if anyone can help it would mean the world to me.... how do I help him? what do I do if I cant convince him..? thanks so much!"
206,Please read this I’m so lost in life.,"Hi I’m Lana Kathleen Pritchard I’m 14 and I go to maysville. First If you reading this then I honestly hope you read this I don’t want this to seem like it’s for attention I just wanna show you why I’m like how I am. On November 5th of 2005 a mother of 3 kids welcomed a baby girl into this world she was named Lana after her parents favorite character on Superman and her middle name her mothers aunts name her mothers favorite aunt. As that little girl grew up she had dreams in her mind she was determined to be known and never forgotten, on her 8th birthday as she’s sitting at her table with the ice cream cake was laying in front of her she had the world at her feet she was loved by her whole family. Soon the little girl told everyone with confidence that she would be the first to go to college and finally leave this old dusty town behind she swore to never touch a drug in her life and always put herself first as she was growing into this beautiful broken smile girl still with them eyes that could melt a heart she found out what she wanted to do with her whole life she wanted to save the planet and the ocean life she decided to be a marine biologist she always kept her grades in science high but math was a different story she had always struggled with this topic but she was determined to get to her goal she worked hard. Go the the first day of 5th grade she walks into a new school full of people who stare as she walks down the hallway she makes friends but her speech impediment made it easy to laugh at her that day she was open to the real world the world dropped under her feet as she landed on her knees she learned to lie that day to her mom she made friends and everyone loved her. But she knew that the kids pointed and laughed and didn’t wanna be her friend that day she knew she would have to fake a personality to make people like her after she tried to be like everyone else she made friends soon she met a boy that boy made her feel like he didn’t care about anything she did wrong and she knew that’s who would be there forever till her best friend since birth that is family stabs her in the back and steals him she finally gave up on the thought that he wanted her but even then she stayed around him for 2 years till finally she learned he did noting but play with her just to get with her best friend and never wanted or liked the girl. Now we hit 6th grade the girl is sorta popular but she’s not happy inside and cry’s almost everyday but she kept her head up and tried to focus on the importants of her life but girls can be so mean she goes to school of scrolls thought her phone and sees and hear nasty comments and she laughs it off but she doesn’t let that go she repeats every comment in her head and wonders if it was true after a while she believed it. We hit 7th grade and she is worn out but still tries to keep it together till she finds new friends and smokes drugs and runs the streets soon she’s passed around from different people all promising something that they end up breaking giving her trust issues the girl thinks she’s hit rock bottom the dream in her eyes in clouded by a cloud of smoke that exits her chest she depends on the feeling that this gives her. Now she’s charged with theft and is given the chance to make this all disappear she does it and hopes to forget about the mistake but her family constantly talks and shames you on this and will never tell you that it was just a mistake and that it’s okay instead she is bashed with judgement and hate from the parents she looked up too and wanted to make proud soon it was revealed that she stole drugs from her grandparents now they can’t trust her and leave a lock on their door and always bring it up and how much you messed up and how they hate that I’ve done that because it’s now a inconvenience in their life. Now she’s at a different school as she has went to court two times over school she’s failing every class, her parents beg her to be a normal kid and don’t know how to help her. Her parents take her to multiple doctors and dope her up on medication that makes her puke and lose her appetite but she eats her feelings and when she looks in the mirror her eye turn blurry as she looks at herself and is disgusted by it because she believes every word she’s ever heard about herself she can’t even keep a relationship because she’s scared to be broken. Sometimes she sits in the shower fiddling with a razor wondering if she should finally give up and let her pain drip down into the water but she can’t bring herself to it she’s trying to stay positive she met a new guy recently and he shows her everything and treats her amazing but she’s scared and is pushing him away as she doesn’t want to be hurt again but she can’t help but love him but she’s scared because her own parents want her in a mental institution because they can’t find out how to help me they are disappointed at the little girl they raised with dreamers eyes is now a young lady who draws on her body and every Time they see her there is a tear in her eye and she’s always running the street to get her mind off of the past but her mom feels she a nasty whore who can’t respect herself but maybe she’s true at least thats what the girl Thinks. This girl has given up on everything she doesn’t believe in a god , Fate or chance or even karma and luck she’s so lost she’s ready to say goodbye. Hi I’m that girl and everything I’ve said is true but if you ever met me you would never believe that as I keep the crooked smile and dreamy eyes on my face but as I go back into my completely dark room as she doesn’t want to catch her eye on the mirror as i hates myself image I go two 2 different therapist and noting is helping I’m sore in the eyes and skin on my face from crying every single minute of the day I’m alone and everyone thinks it for attention. When I tell you I wish that I was never born I wish I wasn’t that’s not even my whole life just the important parts please don’t try to help I’m a lost cause."
207,I don't know who I am. Am I too far gone? Am I fucked up or something?,"I have no clue who I am or what I'm doing with my life. I don't truly know myself. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know what my values are. I have no opinions of my own.  I have no passions. I have no skills. I have no talents. I don't know anything about myself.  I don't even know what my dreams or goals are for my future.

 I don't truly know what I want for myself. I have vague ideas, but I'm not sure if they're even my own or taken from someone else. I don't know what I REALLY want from life. It's almost like I'm not even a human. I'm not even my own person.
I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. 

Is there something wrong with my brain?  It's like I'm a robot. All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY?

This is so fucking scary and I need help"
208,My relationship is falling apart and its all my fault. please help,"Hello reddit,I'm a 17 year old girl soon to be 18. I have been with my boyfriend for three years now,hes a very handsome sweet hardworking guy,he loves me very very much and i love and adore him but i have an issue. I'm a very insecure person,because of this i get very paranoid and my mind starts to wander and develop negative thoughts. I will begin to think things like ""I'm so ugly,someone as great as him wouldn't want me"" ""i have a horrible personality,he's probably with me because he feels sorry for me"" things like that. and honestly that's how i feel about myself.. i don't think I'm that great.

209,Coronavirus is making me scared to do ANYTHING,"You’ve probably seen this posted hundreds of times already. I know I have. I work in a grocery store and I’m terrified to continue working. I’m terrified to go out and see people in public places. I already have really bad anxiety to begin with, so this outbreak is making my anxiety go through the roof. The media is making the virus so much worse than it is. They need to stop doing that because it’s going to drive people like me, and others, absolutely mad. I don’t know how much longer I can keep hearing about the virus. I feel like I’m trapped in a nightmare that won’t end."
210,Research Project Regarding Mental Health Professionals,"Hi, I am a college student and am currently taking ENC1102. In this class, all students were put into groups for a project. My group’s project regards mental health professionals and how their relationships with their patients affects their own mental health. The link below contains a survey that we need to conduct for our project. It is completely anonymous and will really go a long way to helping us with our research.

211,Miserable and Lonely,"Hello there.. I used to be everyone's comfort zone but I have no one, everyone talks to me about their problems and I help them fixing it and being happy again and then they leave and that is it.  
I was never anyone's bestfriend, boyfriend or even favorite person. I just want to know how it feels to be loved from someone .. anyone   
and now with the COVID-19 Virus isolation I have to stay at home all the day and overthink about all of that, I confessed my crush and I GOT rejected because she sees me as a friend and only a friend, my colleagues say I'm a good helping person but it seems like I'm a tool or robot .. like I have no feelings or like no one even cares about how I really feel.  
smt tells me this is who I'm, like I'm the one who helps everybody he know and then he back to his loneliness and die alone, and I really don't like it.  
my mind keeps telling me fuck it and don't help anyone, but it just makes me feel worse. I want to have a normal life with friends who care about I feel and a partner who just loves me, I just wanted to feel loved, why is it that hard ?"
212,I’m trying really hard to go against my urges but I’m struggling,"I’m kind of a worrier, I panic a lot and think the worst in everything. in 2012 I cried for months about the end of the world and I obsess and make myself sick about situations..

I’m going through testing for OCD but it’s been postponed because of the corona virus 

I’m trying so hard to not think about the virus especially seeing as I’m 19 healthy and nobody I know would be affected by it, 

but I can’t help it I keep repeating to myself that it’s just the flu but people bulk buying and schools closing is really freaking me out and I know it’s fine it’s just the flu but it’s the state of panic in everyone that’s causing my panic attacks and I’m really really trying to stay away from it and not fixate but and I’m not worried about getting sick but it’s the quarantine and stuff that’s making me feel this way 

I just want to scream and throw things and everything to go back to before but obviously it can’t this is the new normal I just feel in a constant state of panic and I’m really trying to not go full on crazy on it 

Any tips to ease my mind other than distraction which is ineffective"
213,How to get the most out of online counseling,"I recently started counseling through BetterHelp and while it’s been helpful to speak to an objective third party, I’m starting to feel like I’m not being a good patient or something. Our sessions mostly consist of me talking and I often divert so I feel like I’m giving too much information at once. My counselor mainly just validates my feelings which is helpful but I want to steer the convo more towards us working together to create plans/goals. 

I understand counselors won’t explicitly tell you what to do but my question is how do I steer our sessions so that we can do vent, validate, then some kind of action plan? This may seem like a very particular situation so if anyone can provide any insight at all re: online counseling that would be helpful too."

215,What are the signs someone has never really struggled emotionally?,"I know this might be wrong to say, but sometimes when I meet people it's very clear they've never really suffered that much, you know? They just seem...happier. And less anxious and worried."
216,Anyone else ever feel like their life is one big punishment for something and you don’t know for what?,
217,How do I know I’m not faking everything?,"I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, Depression, and ASD, but I feel like it’s all been a result of me over exaggerating everything, and me looking for attention and pity. I constantly look down on people who fake any type of mental illness, but I’m so afraid I might be one of them."
218,New meds impairing cognitive function,"Xanax is the problem, I think. I’m only taking 0.5 but I’m pretty short/thin. Since taking it I can’t remember many words without looking them up, processing information is difficult, I’m having trouble counting small amounts of items quickly and my short term memory is shot. It feels like my cognitive function is severely disrupted. I’ve been taking this for 3 days each night for anxiety as well as Paxil and adderall + Wellbutrin in the morning. I would stop but I started Paxil at the same time, perhaps that’s the cause? Idk, help?"
219,I hate myself to the core,I lost my girlfriend because of my own choices and actions.  I lost the only person I ever cared about and it just feels like I have been sabotaging myself and the whole relationship the whole time.  Now I hate myself it hurts so bad and I have actually been whipping my back and strangling myself recently
220,please please please let yourself feel...,"     Whoever’s reading this, please promise me one thing: that you will allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling to it’s full extent. always. I know it can hurt. i know. but you have to allow yourself to open up and live wide. let others in even if they don’t do the same. feel the light in people’s eyes as you feel the sun on your face. don’t shut down or hide if something is hurting you. it takes a lot of time but eventually you will be able to appreciate the fact that you are feeling, even if it’s a really shitty feeling. 
     I was hospitalized back in march. for a month. and i was out of school for three months. and a lot of “feelings” went through my head. and at first i was overmedicated and couldn’t really feel that much at all. and this was right after having the most intense feelings i’ve ever felt. i remember being there in the hospital and i remember what it felt like. i remember what it felt like before i was in there, too. and after, i didn’t really allow myself to feel that much again. because the pain just wasn’t bearable. but time heals all wounds. i promise. whoever’s out there, whatever you’re going through, continue to feel whatever it is that you’re feeling and let yourself truly and fully heal. we’re going to be okay. we’re all going to be okay"
221,Broken society,"Society perpetuates the wounded man and woman. It's very hard to find anything in news or TV that supports a Divine Masculine and Feminine perspective. If you weren't raised in an environment that supports this, it's difficult to know what it even looks like. It's difficult to date. Especially as you get older.. We carry so much brokeness within ourselves from past trauma and lack of example. We often blame and accuse our partners for treating us this way or that. Blame our fathers or mothers for the trauma we carry from childhood. It's time to let all of that go. It takes a great awakening within to transcend the wounded man and woman perspectives. It requires a looking within. No longer looking outside of you for reasons or excuses. If you find yourself in these wounded categories, look within. We cannot blame anyone else for our personal condition and perspective. We are the architects of our lives.. We aren't bound by anything but the narrative we tell ourselves each day.. Let us all take a moment to step into our heart space today and focus on being that awakened man and woman. Not just for ourselves but for all of the beautiful souls around us.. As we look within we will find the strength needed to walk in the Divine Awakened Masculine and Feminine.. So much love to everyone! May your day be filled with strength, focus and harmony!"
222,"What does it mean, and how do you listen to what your mind and body tell you?","What does it mean when people say listen to what your mind and body tell you what to do? 

I am trying to work on my mental health and people tell me to listen to what my mind and body are telling me to do and to focus on that to know how to help myself, but I don't know how to do that.

I never know what to do or where to start and when people tell me to listen to my body I get frustrated because I don't know what that means or how to do it"
223,Tonight I’m making a promise to myself to stop drinking for good,"I struggle with mild depression and anxiety, and it gets especially bad around this time of year. To cope with this, whenever I would get invited out to a party with my friends I would always end up drinking way too much way too fast. While I only ended up drinking once every 1-2 months, blacking out every time I drank was very disconcerting to me, and I absolutely hated it. I don’t have control over my impulses, and i don’t know what impacts my drinking has had on my cognitive ability, which is another source of anxiety and I can only hope I haven’t crossed any points of no return. But the future is going to be different and I’m going to make sure it’s different. I’m an electrical engineering student and I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA for my first semester, and I want to keep doing well in school since learning is one of my passions. This among other reasons is why I’m making a promise to myself tonight to never drink again. I’m going to get rid of all of my belongings related to alcohol, and I encourage others to do the same. 

With everything that’s been going on in the world, I encourage all of you to try and stay safe and healthy. We can get through anything together."
224,"Ok um, hello. Quick question","Ok so say you cut and then a few days later it gets really itchy and you want to scratch it but then you are in public and people will ask why you are scratching so aggressively at your wrist and you say allergies but then immediately regret it because people will say you have the corona virus so you start having a panic attack but then they just say “oh ok, go take care of yourself and take some allergy medicine” and then walk away.

Like is that normal or is that just me, because for the live of all that is dark and spooky, my wrists itch SO FUCKING BAD AND I CANT STOP SCRATCHING AND ITS DRIVING ME INSANE! Please help and give me some advice on how to make the itching go down a bit. It’s 11:30 and I have to get up and 6:00 so that’s fun too. Anyway thank you and love y’all!"
225,Concerned about access to medication,"I'm concerned that I will not be able to fill/obtain prescription medications that are critical to my mental health.  I've read that sources that indicate base elements and complete products could be jeopardized, and I'm not sure what can be done about it.

Basically, I depend on a couple of medications to keep me functional.  And if there are shortages and I can't obtain them, I risk losing work or worse.

I have not cited any sources in this post, but I will if requested."
226,Coping strategies,"I do not know how to cope.  I'm 25F. When I was younger I would be shut down for trying to express my emotions. I no longer know how to react to a situations. I know most social cues but feel so distant while smiling, laughing, acting sad in situations. I do this to act normal. In addition, I do not know how to verbally express my feelings. 

I hurt myself. I punch walls. I can get hit in the face (it hurts for about 2 min) then walk away.  I always an urge to punch things and do uncalled things to others. I contain myself. I'm numb and empty inside. I have suicidal ideation but don't follow through with it.  
Not social. Can't keep steady relationships with friends. 
I've been called serious and told to smile on many occasions.  

I drink but not often.  It usually dulls me. 

The only emotions i know is hyper excitement, angry,   anxiety. 

I'm not able to explain this too well."
227,"Diagnoses SMI, what can I get for free?",I am currently living in Arizona. What can I get covered when I am diagnosed SMI? I am looking for inpatient services. Where is the nicest facility to stay at?
228,My Dr just blew my mind - folate and mental illness,"During a casual discussion about daily vitamins, my dr said, your family has a history of mental illness, so make sure you get a daily vitamin with methylated folate. I stared at her blankly and she proceeded to explain to me the connection between folate, folic acid and the production of serotonin and dopamine. This combined with the genetic mutation of the MTHFR gene, means that often families with histories of mental illness also have low folate AND normal ‘man-made’ folate supplements won’t help and might make it worse. Read here for details: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3869616/ and here: https://www.healthline.com/health/mthfr-gene. I’ve been struggling to treat depression and anxiety for 6 years and NO ONE HAS EVER MENTIONED THIS. 
TLDR; If your family has a history of mental illness, start taking a supplement with methylated folate"
229,All my friends left to be with SOs,"All of them. One of the got asked out by someone while on a job... a job that I got turned down from. The other, well, is dating my crush. My crush rejected me... and then asked my friend out... it fucking hurts"
230,Why do I secretly wish my teacher would do things to me?,"So I’m 16 and pretty much, I wish my teacher would do things to and with me. Like I know it’s wrong and disgusting because when I hear about this stuff on the news I’m disgusted but deep down I wish my teacher would do that to me. What does this mean?"
231,"For years I have been struggling, I just want the hurt to stop, but no matter what I do, it always comes back","I am a girl, almost 16 and I have no clue what my purpose in life is. Since I was about 9, my mental health has gotten worse. First was the development of self hate. I have tried many things to try to learn to love myself. I am now at a point where I feel empty inside a lot. I tell myself horrible things that I know aren't true, like calling myself useless, a waste of space, insane, messed up in the head. I feel hopeless about my future as I am pretty average at almost everything I do. Sometimes, I will go through a phase during the day where I feel indifferent and hateful. I want to hurt others and I care about absolutely no one or nothing during these times. I feel like I am losing myself as I have an urge to hurt others, and as a result, I isolate myself. I am not like this often however. I  cry a lot and I truly hate myself more than any other person in the world. I often put on a fake smile for the world and pretend that I am happy, I fear I will be rejected or treated differently if I tell others what happens in my mind. I also fear being a burden to others and I am scared that everyone I care about will abandom me if I tell people about how messed up I am. I am afraid to speak out as both my parents, and a couple of good friends have yelled at me or told me I am overreacting and that I am selfish and ungrateful my life. I admitted myself to a hospital once in fear that I may hurt myself. The experience mentally scarred me and made my problems worse as I felt abandoned and isolated, and the nurses there clearly didn't care about me, and also didn't have a regard for the others as they were telling at them. I lied and told them I felt better just so that I could leave that hellhole. I have a crippling fear of therapy now due to an experience I don't want to talk about. I also had another therapist tell me to go see a different one as the said that I couldn't be helped. I hate myself more by the day and I am slowly regressing back into my social anxiety. I feel like I am no use to the world and that nothing can ever help me. I also feel like no matter what, I always mess every up. I fear that medicine will revoke the little happiness that I have left and make me a hollow shell. I can't even bring myself to cry anymore as I have cried so many years in my lifetime. I often contemplate whether or not the world would be better without me and I think of all of the ways I could end it all. The only thing stopping me is the thought of how my loved ones would feel if I passed. I am scared to tell anyone my problems as I don't want to be a burden and I fear I will be told to just get over it. I fear even talking to my best friend about my problems. I don't know what to do anymore and I just want the pain to go away. I am hurting more than anyone in my life could ever know."
232,I hear and see things that aren’t there,I don’t know how to explain it really. Like I’ll heard people talking or singing but it’s usually incoherent. Then I’ll see people out of the corner of my eye and then when I look no ones there. Other times I’ll turn around and see something dart out of sight. Should I be concerned?
233,Why do I have these thoughts?,"I'm kinda new to this whole depression thing. I've been depressed for four years but it only just recently started getting worse.

My question is, why do I have the desire to self harm? I've only ever done it once like two years ago, didn't even like it, and moved on. But now anytime I look at something I could use to harm myself my brains just like ""Hey..what if you uhhh ya know..did that?"" And I just don't get it."
234,"I can't get evaluated for my attention issues until fall, but it's interfering with my career and relationships. What can I do in the meantime?","Looking for suggestions for things I can do while I'n waiting to get an evaluation for ADD/ADHD and to see if my attention issues are related to my anxiety/PTSD/depression. I assume I can't get on meds without an evaluation, so something like skills I can look into, therapy modalities, or even workbooks would be great.

I'd specifically love to hear about skills/modalities/workbooks that could help me properly pay attention in conversations so I can acknowledge them better. I'm really good at this when they're texting me, but I can't do it at all when we're face to face.

Things I've tried that didn't work: mindfulness practice, anxiety meds, depression meds. Alcohol helps, but I don't like drinking. 

Background:

I'm not appropriately responding when people are talking to me, mostly because I'm not paying attention to everything they're saying - but sometimes, I just have absolutely no idea what to say because even though I heard them, I'm not engaged enough to acknowledge what's said to me without them getting upset that I'm not acting like I care. 

My boyfriend can't take this anymore and is on the verge of leaving me (he doesn't feel loved or acknowledged), which would mean I don't have housing, but that isn't even the worst issue. I don't have friends, and because I also don't stick to tasks and complete them properly, I don't hold down jobs. This forced me to start freelancing - thankfully, this IS bringing in an income, but I feel like I could be doing even better with the right guidance. I currently make so little that the SNAP office decided I need another job to be eligible for food stamps.

My therapist referred me to be evaluated, since apparently the methods for handling this are different if the primary issue is attention vs something else that causes attention issues. I'll be hearing back in late summer/early fall to make an appointment. We really don't have a lot of doctors out here - I don't even have a primary care doc because I've been waiting for 8 months on waitlists. So finding another clinic would be really difficult, and I'm forced to handle this on my own for the next few months."
235,My last intense therapy session,"When I started I couldn't look my therapist in the eyes. I was fidgety, panicked and flashbacks were a daily thing. 
My Kessler score was the highest it could be at. 

Today, was my laat day. 
These short weeks have uncovered so much about me. What I take away from it is that I am strong and no matter my past, I will grow and things will be put into place. 
I'm more positive about my life and future. 
My Kessler score is at 26 now, still working on myself but I am happier than I've ever been."
236,Will cognitive impairment from drug use ever go away?,"I used synthetic cannabis for a while and experienced warning signs of schizophrenia as a result. My cognition also suddenly declined. It's been three years since I've used any drugs and the schizophrenic signs have completely disappeared but my cognition hasn't healed. I have serious issues with short and long term memory loss and not being able to hold information in my head. According to most sources I've read, cognitive decline from schizophrenia is permanent. Here's the thing though: I spoke with a psychiatrist recently and she said it was most likely BLIP (brief limited  intermittent psychosis), not schizophrenia. Is there any hope my brain can recover, or am I in the same boat as people with schizophrenia, considering the symptoms were so similar? Personally, I predict my chances of recovery are very low. But I need a tiny amount of hope to get through life with this terrible problem. However, I would rather hear the truth, even if it's that there is no hope."
237,Help please,"(I have PTSD and Clinical Depression)

238,"Does anyone else cherish silence? I genuinely enjoy sitting in silence, but this week is testing me. My nerves are at an all time high.","My aunt is getting open heart surgery Thursday, so my family came to our home state to be with her from Saturday to Saturday. My family is chaotic in times of crisis, it doesn't bring them together. So surrounding all of this my 4 aunts and grandmother have tried to drag me into their drama, I'm 18 I don't have any business being apart of their catty little fights they know all it does is stress me out. I can't handle my stress around them, they know exactly how to push my buttons and just go through me. I nearly saw red today because of the fucking noise. At my home, it's just me and my parents and my dog, the house is fairly quite even when all 4 of us are there. I stay in my room, I come out whenever everyone is home to visit. I get time alone to deflate. Here I have absolutely no privacy. My grandparents live next door to our second house here so they just come in and out all day, they slam the fuck out of the front door and won't wear hearing aids so they scream talk, I love my grandparents but they are going through me. I've been here since 8 last night and I already had an hour long panic attack, and then about lost my shit tonight. My aunt had some brain damage from her strokes, she is aware and capable but some things just don't click. She's grabbed at my nose ring 10+ times since last night telling me to take it out. She is sick. There is a pandemic going around. Don't touch my fucking face PLEASE. No matter how many times I've told her to stop she either forgets or thinks it's funny. I'm not entirely sure if her hearing has been effected but she has the TVs at full volume 24/7 she sleeps with it going and sometimes has 2 at the same time. I'm telling you I am going to fucking lose it. I cannot express how much I value silence at this point. I just want to sleep on the lawn to have some silence. So when I need alone time, I lock myself in my room. My mom has now figured out she can pick the locks with her fingers and just barges In, locked or not. I've brought dabs with me to help with my stress but she has the nose of a bloodhound and is waiting to catch me, she almost did this morning. I seriously can't be around my family sober right now it is driving me up the wall. I need silence. Even a solid 5 minutes of silence I just need it. I feel like I'm legitimately having just a multiple day long panic attack, this shit is stressing me out so fucking much. I love my aunt, I love my family, but they are driving me insane, literally."
239,february 25th,"my mental health had been slowly improving ever since i met my gf almost 3 years ago. but recently, since around february 25th, i can slowly feel my mental health slipping again and idk what's wrong with me, nothing has changed. my gf and i are having a talk this Tuesday (she hasn't said about what) and im concerned that if my feelings and thoughts do not clear i may find myself alone in this world once again: she has mentioned recently that she notices I've been regressing to that older self and i dont know how to stop that. I've contemplated hurting myself again but i dont know how i can hide my bad habits again as im not that young anymore and hoodies 24/7 would be very obvious to my gf. any advice is welcome, but i dont want a therapist again, they're fucking useless"
240,Anger issues,"I just broke my door by hitting it and I broke down to my grandma, I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety,PTSD from my childhood and Asperger's. Basically I was playing Xbox with my friends like I usually do but my sister always comes and bothers me and she kept throwing stuff at me and yelling random things at me when I told her to go away so I got up and she went back to her room but I was so angry I punched my door and put a big crack in it. This is not a one time thing either I got kicked out of school twice for breaking stuff. But I usually don't do it at home and I'm going to a new school today and if I get kicked out I go to a residential school and I'll freak out. Any suggestions?"
241,Worried about my cousin (advice),"Hi all,

My first time posting and I’m also not sure if this is a normal kind of post, (I’m so sorry if not!) but I’m getting worried for my cousin. She’s 21 and has in the past couple months started exhibiting signs close to schizophrenia. She hears voices of people she knows I.e friends and family. She is also very spiritual (believes in clairvoyance; things of that nature) so her idea for this all is it’s telepathy. She’s even said she talks to me and often asked me what color she telepathically sent me (I never know). The part that worries me the most though is that she has recently remembered a trauma with her father and the voices have told her to block him and she’s completely changed her opinion about him and wants nothing to do with him. I’m afraid this is a delusion. Her accusation came out of nowhere and it seems heavily influenced by what the voices are telling her. Im really not sure what to do, I don’t want to go to her parents just yet without more Clarity but I also don’t want to shut her down completely by not believing her abuse! She’ll sit next to me and just laugh to herself and shush herself. I don’t know guys. Anything really helps. Again, sorry if this isn’t the normal content."
242,How to deal with this ?,"so ive dealt with adhd and depression my whole life, its been a really rough road with a lot of mistakes made along the way, but after 25 years on this earth, in 2019 i really started to get myself together, most of it work on the mental side, but some in life in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

That leads me to now, the last 2 months have been stress filled as a tired to find a better job and work my way out of the nasty situation i was stuck in, i was right there, an interview lined up, and some things seemed to be going the right way, and yesterday i was told the company i applie ot has put on a hiring freeze, and found out a few hours ago my mom (who has supported me through all of this) has also been laid off.  


i am at a total loss at how to deal with this, im going to be looking for a job tomorrow but it all seems so... pointless.

This virus has paralyzed any chance i had at finding even basic work, and now im sitting here, after trying to help the person who has been solid for me through this all (my mother) while also wonder how im simply going to survive the next month or so.   


has anyone been through this ? does anyone have any ideas of what to do ? or is this the end of the line ?"
243,Why do I always confuse other peoples stories as my own memories,"Maybe this is normal but I still wonder. I'll often catch myself telling someone a story then halfway through catch myself and start to realize that what I'm saying may not have happened. And not in a compulsive liar kind of way, I only lie when I need to and I never consciously make up any scenarios or stories. 

It's just confusing because I really will think it's my memory and I slowly start to realize that it's probably something that someone has told me."
244,"4 Meditations For Managing Fear, Panic &amp; Pandemics","Given the current climate, I wanted to put out a simple resource that provides people with some meditation tools to best manage their mental state.  


Fear is a healthy response to danger, but unfortunately a lot of us are struggling with the overwhelming nature of the Coronavirus pandemic.  


My approach is very simple, broken into 'how', 'why it works' and 'variations'. They are written with the beginner in mind and as such are simplistic in their instructions and explanation. They are all variations of mindfulness practice, working on the concept that thoughts (all mental phenomena really) can be observed from a detached perspective.  


This detachment will result in less emotional reactivity and an increased ability to maintain functionality during stressful times  


My hope is that it will help people to better cope during this time.  To this end I also encourage the use of ongoing self care and therapy.

245,Why do I attempt to be social?,"All my attempts with being social lead to people being assholes, or me having freakouts and panic attacks that weird people out. Ever since I was in primary school I've been the weird kid."
246,"How I wrap a cut (please don’t cut, but I don’t control you so this if you cut and you don’t have bandaids) Also, I would suggest leaving it on over night, instead of during the day. It may be a little uncomfortable but once you are asleep you won’t notice it as much and won’t be tempted to pick it","First I grab a long row of toliet paper and fold it in half. Then I wrap it around my wrist tightly multiple times. Then I wrap ribbon/string around the toilet paper and tie it tightly in a knot. REMEMBER TO CLEAN IT REGULARLY! Leave it on at night and it will start to heal. I know cutting isn’t the best and you SHOULD NOT CUT! But I am a hypocrite so I’ll just say do what you want I don’t control you. Be safe. And please keep it clean! I use hydrogen-peroxide and rubbing alcohol  to keep mine clean.I love y’all! Please stay safe.

)The reason I suggest wearing it at night is because you won’t be as tempted to pick at it and fix it. Also, it’s unnoticeable to anyone unless you share a room. Also, it’ll heal better overnight. Or at least it does for me. Love you guys! Bye!)"
247,Time doesn't feel connected and I don't know how to deal with it,"I've noticed that most of the time, my days don't feel connected. This morning feels like it happened days ago, and yesterday feels like it was last week. It's like anytime there's a change in my location or who I'm with, it's logged as a completely separate and independent time in my head. For example, if I work early in the morning, then go to school, then come home and hang out with my roommates, I'll have trouble remembering things about the earlier parts of my day right away and they don't seem like they only happened hours ago. 

I've tried googling to see if other people experience this and how they deal with it, but I mostly get articles about dissociation. But I don't think that I don't feel real or something. It's more like time doesn't really exist or it has no meaning except for the here and now. 

Does anyone else experience this and have tips for how to handle it? Does it have a name that I just can't find? I think it effects other part of my life like struggling with schoolwork and deadlines so I'm trying to get a handle on it but I'm not able to see a professional right now."
248,I seriously worry how I'm going to react when my dog dies,"I dont even know where to begin, ill start at I was 18 when I bought her. I got her in my hands when she was 8 weeks old on the dot but I had already seen her and everything since a couple weeks before. Sophie is what I ended up naming her and she is my literal everything. She has been there for me throughout drug addiction and me sleeping in my car, I remember one night I was so tired, so down on myself and wanted to end it and I pulled out my gun I had at the time and she pushed it away from my head while I bawled. It's been a good couple years since all that and we both live very comfortably and she has always been just the most well behaved and intelligent dog. I have never ever had this connection with another soul ever and I love her more than life itself. But I think about me waking up one morning expecting her to be wagging her tail and looking at my sleepy eyed from the couch and she doesn't, and I say her name and she doesn't respond. Her eyes dont even open, that split second after I realize, that's the moment I really worry how I'm going to react. I had a dream that I just start bawling and go to immediately bury her in the yard and saying I wasnt going to stop crying until she was where she needed to go. So, maybe a story or two about people and their dog and or bestfriend passing and how they dealt/deal with it would bring my mind at ease."
249,Crying a lot,"
My cat has been missing for four days now. She’s not even a year old yet. I think my roommates or their friends let her out based on how they acted when I brought it up. But they won’t say anything. 

I can’t stop crying :( 

I miss her so much. She’s slept next to me every night and it’s so hard. I’m so sad. I just want my kitty :,(

I can’t stop thinking of the worst possible things that could happen to her. She’s still a baby. She’s so tiny and has never been outside. It’s freezing out too. And snowy. I’ve been walking around and driving around trying to find her since she disappeared. Nothing. 

My heart aches. I feel like I’ll never see her again. I just want to hug her"
250,i can’t help but feel completely alone,"i (16) don’t form real human connection anymore. i just feel like a burden most of the time, and it hurts me when other people don’t notice a mental health switch. some days i’ll just lock myself in a room for days at a time and stop trying, and my parents don’t notice. i feel unfair for saying this, because i can’t expect people to analyze my mental health, but i’m not a person that can just tell people that i’m struggling. i stopped taking my zoloft and i don’t know why, i just don’t feel like it’s worth it. my parents can’t afford to send me to therapy anymore and i haven’t been for months, and i feel like i don’t have anyone to talk to. every time i try to talk to my parents the words don’t come out and i just feel like a burden. i try to bring it up to my friends when i’m feeling down, but they just don’t seem to take notice. i can’t hold this against them, because they have their own struggles and i’m not able to be the most emotionally available friend for them so i can’t expect it back. now that my spring break has been expanded due to corona, i find myself laying in bed, watching tv or sometimes just staring at the ceiling. every time i text my friends i immediately feel like i’m annoying and distance myself. the worst part is i just give into the depression. i stopped trying to be happy, and i’d rather just lie around and feel sorry for myself. i don’t feel like a normal person and it’s suffocating me."
251,"Why do I see white and black shadows or orbs during the night and day? I’ve seen them all my life and thought they were ghosts, but I don’t believe in them anymore. Is there a medical reason for this? I’m not schizophrenic.",
252,Accidental overdose?,So I woke up today feeling so bad about myself I started crying and thinking about how everything is going wrong in my life also my boyfriend has been in jail for 5 months now so I wanted to block out the pain so I took 5 codiene pills which is 160mg of codiene and 1500mg of paracetamol is this going to cause me to overdose?
253,I don’t know where else to go,"I’m at a breaking point. I know I probably shouldn’t be turning to reddit for mental help, but I just don’t know where else to go or what to do. I have a lot going on but I’ll try to keep it short. 

I’m 20F. Struggled with depression quite seriously throughout high school. Saw a therapist for 5 years. Just stopped seeing her last summer. Recently I’ve been mentally in pieces. Anxiety through the fucking roof. I can’t sleep, every time I close my eyes my brain goes wild with FEAR. I feel that I am terribly annoying, I’m convinced that my coworkers and friends (barely even my friends anymore) can’t stand my company. I regret every single time I open my mouth. I feel embarrassed and hateful of myself. These thoughts swirl in my head, make my heart race and jolt me awake and into tears. I hate sleeping. I hate the nighttime. I fear it every night. My mom was so proud of me to know I stopped seeing my therapist last year. I cannot bear to break her heart and tell her I’m struggling again. My mom is one of the most important people in the world to me. I could not do that to her. 

My family is hard as well. I have a family member with anger issues, I won’t get too into it because they are a Redditor and may see this, but it’s very anxiety inducing to come home every day never knowing who will be upset, who will be arguing with who. My boyfriend and I are planning on moving out, which I am DYING to do, but it will not be until next year due to his financial situation. 

Every single day I just want to vomit 24/7. I’m never calm. There’s always a low, upsetting, terrifying, rage inducing buzzing in my head of just evil thoughts. I can keep it together on the outside quite well. I don’t think anybody has truly caught on to how much I’ve been struggling. I don’t want them to. I don’t want to scare my boyfriend away, if I explained this to him he would just tell me to see a therapist. And he’s right, I should, but I cannot break my families heart. I cannot bring this attention and guilt and pity onto myself. It feels terribly selfish, and with my mother already dealing with her own issues, I cannot put this on her. I’ll never forget her face when she first found out I was suicidal in high school, and I can not do that to her again. 

I don’t have any other close friends. I have coworkers I talk to, but it’s casual and work exclusive. I had a close knit group of friends, but over the past year I have been particularly excluded as I am the only female, I have a different work schedule than everybody else, and again, I’m probably annoying as fuck and I’m really not surprised they don’t want to see me anymore. I’m terrified to get close to anybody when my mental state is this bad. I’m so scared of being too annoying, scaring them away. I open up to people very easily and I know I wouldn’t be able to keep it together. 

It’s getting worse every day and I don’t know what to do. I am not suicidal, but I do not feel good about myself at all. Anxiety is my main issue, I have nightmares almost every night as well. Never consistent, always something wildly different but equally as disturbing. 

I don’t know who to turn to. I don’t feel like I can express this to anybody without seriously deterring things and upsetting them. I want to be able to handle this all by myself so badly but it’s becoming more and more difficult each day. Last night was the first night in years that I legitimately could not get a wink of rest. Usually I use CBD and THC to calm myself down and knock myself out, but it’s not working anymore these days and I’m scared, I feel trapped and deteriorating. I don’t know. I’m probably just yelling into the void with this, but I just thought I’d give it a go. I don’t know what else to do with all these thoughts and I needed to get them out. If anybody who sees this has any ideas, I would love to hear them."
254,How do I stop overthinking?,Everything that happens to me I overthink and start to hate myself. I start to feel like no one cares about me and I refuse to talk about it to anyone. Is there a way to stop the overthinking before it starts to effect me?
255,I'm lost and unable to find my way out,"I have so much to say I dont even know where to begin.
I'm a 27 yo guy from Europe and I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety disorder a bit more than 3 years ago. Prior to that I was your random normal guy, had friends, was doing ok at life and then depression happened. Since then, it has been a chaotic mess. The first 2 years were just me falling down the hole and pretending to be fine. And then at some point i started to harm myself. And then I tried. I tried to kill myself. But I dont want to die so I stopped what I was doing. And a year ago I started having those sparks where I could actually do something and push myself and I ended up going back to school and I graduated as a Web dev 9 months ago. And since then... nothing. Before the school I was living with my parents and I then moved out to my own flat in a big city. So during school I was seeing people, I even had a gf and everything was looking better by the day. But since I finished school, my motivation fall back to zero, I live alone in my flat, i never go out, i have no friends, barely no one to talk to and suicidal thoughts are back. I spend my days playing videos game and sleeping. 
The funny part is, I know what I have to do to get better, I know every single steps, but I have no motivation and I feel my depression holding me back.
I feel stuck, no matter how hard it try, I always end up falling back to this point. And I start to be tired of it, i really don't know how much time I'll be able to keep up before doing something stupid and it scares me because, well, i still don't really want to die even tho I feel like I'd be better gone.

My life feels as messy as my text but I'm just putting everything out there, raw, because I never talk about it since I have no one to talk to. 

I had professional help, it didnt help me and was quite expensive so I stopped it and I'm scared to seek any more help. I'm still on medication tho.
My family is of no help, I never ever shared my feelings with my parents, even tho I love them, we are not that close. And when i find someone to talk to, i just feel bad because i end up putting all my negativity on them and just vent how bad my life is and how useless I am. 

This is some piece of text so I really thank you if you made it though and I'll answer any questions you might have.
I just want to get better and get on with my life... so here is my call for help... maybe one of the last..."

257,I really don’t know what do I feel like I’m loosing my mind,"I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong here but the doctors are trying pin it too mental health and I’m in such a fucked situation. 

I am 17 and For a few months now I’ve had multiple range of symptoms which include weight loss, decreased energy, very reduced sexual interest, weakens, constant change in stool including bits of blood in it, reduced appetite sleeping a lot more, intense memory loss (including the date and stuff like table)  and a few more symptoms as well but I don’t want fully get into it.

I have been doctors and hospital so much recently and it always turns out they say it’s nothing but I just feel like something is  wrong it’s making me experience insanity I don’t want die but this shit is masking me so miserable I’m so paranoid all the time and can’t enjoy life like used too I really don’t know what do this shits pushing me to my grave and I generally feel like my end is coming soon okese hell someone."
258,I need help,"I’m 17 going on 18 y/o, and I feel like I want to and have to see a psychologist, but I don’t know how to ask my mom to take me to one. I have a couple of issues.

1. Sleep: It takes me at least an hour to actually go to sleep, and I’ve been waking up after 6 hours of sleep hot and sweaty for the past week or so, despite the fact that I sleep in an air conditioned room after being awake for 12-17 hours. So, I end up feeling extremely tired, but no matter how tired I am, I always wake up after 6 hours.

2. School work: I’m doing the IB diploma so I have a lot of work during the school closings, and so I have to push myself to work for almost all the time that I’m awake, because I know I won’t be awake for long since I can only get 6 hours of sleep. However, I went from being a week ahead on my work, to now a week behind. I’m so tired and exhausted, and even when I do work and stay up late, I only sleep 6 hours. This makes it so hard for me to work because I just have to exhaust myself even more to get good work, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist so I always feel like I can’t let go of something unless I feel satisfied with it

3. My father: I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, it’s not as bad as other people’s fathers, but we always argue and he’s always rude which makes me talk back, so it makes things harder. He’s always so loud when talking on the phone, this gives me mega headaches with my lack of sleep, so every single day I have to tel him to lower his voice, it’s like dealing with a child. Having to repeat myself over and over, and most of the time I can’t even tell him about it, or when I tell him it doesn’t result in anything, or he does lower his voice but then starts yelling again a few minutes later. Even worse, his phone calls usually last 2-3 hours, and he has several of these calls. 

4. Eating: My appetite is dead. I feel my stomach growl, but I still don’t feel the need to eat, and I don’t know why. I use to always feel dizzy and have severely bad headaches, but I’ve started to drink water and it has kinda helped.

5. Leisure time: Doing things that I usually enjoy doesn’t even interest me anymore. I’m always too worried about schoolwork and the fact that whatever I’m doing is just a waste of time no matter how much work I finish. Typing this post up is making me anxious, because it just feels like procrastination.

6. Pains: it’s probably due to the fact that I spent 90% of my time on a bed in awkward positions, because I don’t leave my room, but I’ve been experiencing subtle pains in my knees and back. Also, I have this weird urge to scratch the inside of my forearms constantly. It feels like hot water is going through them, and it just aches.

I’m always angry and exhausted. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been sad and shitty before, and I always dealt with it well. This is just too much."
259,COVID-19 has made my anxiety sore and I’ve stopped leaving my house,I live in the UK and while I am still going to work everyday. I have been having panic attacks at work (something I didn’t know could happen on my medication) and I will not leave my house for any other reason. My fear is not that I’m going to get the virus and people trying to calm my anxiety have only been telling me that I’m not going to die but that isn’t my fear. My fear is that there is this huge overwhelming issue with the world that I have absolutely no control over whatsoever. I’m too anxious to go food shopping because seeing the shelf’s empty will make it all seem more real and I’ll panic. My only hope is the fact I work in a school so I’m praying that we close. I just feel so unsafe and it’s very hard to describe to people why. I don’t know what I can do.
260,Cancer Survivor Designer - struggling to adjust,"I am a hodgkins lymphoma survivor - I have been in remission for the last two years. Over the last few years I have learned more about myself than I ever have been for. Cancer gave me a huge wakeup call and now I feel like it has completely whiplashed me out of my 'old' life and I haven't found my way back. It's like, once I was diagnosed all of the cards were thrown up in the air. I was off work, and was able to just focus on getting better, but now what? What I learned - not to sweat the small stuff, work is not the most important thing in the world, your health, laughing, being present, being with friends and family, travelling, experiencing, smiling, BEING, is what is really important. Well I returned to my full time job in the corporate world as a designer - I learned that I was the only one who learned from my sickness, and that the all-nighters, unpaid overtime, and unbalanced work/life balance were still in full effect. A constant internal battle, how will I do well in this kind of atmosphere, if I don't stand for these things anymore, if I am no longer able to 'drink the kool aid'. So much of my self confidence, and self worth was placed on how busy I was, how successful I was, what others thought of my work. So I quit, and decided I would work as a freelance designers, empowering myself with the option to choose my own hours, clients, and the projects I take on. SO much fear. SO much anxiety. SO much sweating 'of the small stuff' that I promised myself I would not do. I am lost, I don't know where I fit in anymore, I don't feel inspired, creative, or confident, ... I don't even know if I want to be a designer anymore. I don't even know what I like anymore. And now with the corona virus, more fear."
261,What do you do if you have nothing to live for?,"I’m 15 and my life consists of the same boring routine, day after day. I have nothing I’m passionate about, and all the things I used to like are now boring. 

I know I’m pretty much of a disappointment to my parents. Academically, they’re not disappointed in me, but they hate how I like to isolate myself and stay in my room all day. My Mom urges me constantly to wear makeup because I look bland without it, and both my parents tell me to get out more.

School is like a nightmare that I hardly believe is happing most of the time. I’m growing more distant with my friends, but they weren’t really my friends to begin with. I have nothing in common with them, and hanging out with them is like a chore I hate. 

My grades are still relatively high, but I’m losing all motivation to study. Why should I? I have nothing I’m passionate about, so how am I supposed to find a career I like? I really don’t see a point in pursuing a career I hate, working until I’m 60 and retiring to then die. I know it probably won’t be exactly like that, but it’ll be close. 

I’ve contemplated suicide, and the only reason I haven’t carried out with it is because I can’t find a method accessible for me that isn’t painful. And besides, ever since I was young, I’ve been excited about dying, I’ve always wanted to know what would happen after. And now that I’ve gotten this far in my life, I know that whatever comes after is probably better than my life right now. 

Most of the time I think about how everyone would be better off without me. All I do is waste time, money, and resources. I’m definitely not the favourite child, if I die, my parents will likely not care. My brothers are children any parent would be proud of, I’m just the mistake. 

I don’t believe my thinking is deluded, I overheard my Dad once say he didn't care if I ran away. And around a year ago, when I lost the motivation to get out of bed or do any personal hygiene, they just called me lazy and a leech that just sucked all their money away. 

To be honest, most of the time I want to get some sort of disease so I can have a valid reason to die."
262,Are you treated differently with diagnosis?,"Is it worth a diagnoses for a personality disorder? I fear my diagnosis will greatly affect how healthcare professionals will treat me. Condtion can't exactly be treated with prescription.  
I do not want a label on my head and people not taking me seriously with my complaints. I'm really not the one to complain anyways. 

1. Are you treated differently?
2. Marginalized? 
3. Do you have to state diagnosis on job applications? Schools? 

Thanks"
263,How do you cope when you realise human beings are capable of extremely depraved and cruel acts?,"I don't know if this is the right place for this or not, but here goes. [TRIGGER WARNING: TORTURE]
I found a video series about disturbing things on the internet by Nexpo and it seemed harmless at first, just trolls and other harmless stuff. But a few videos in, it talks about the Adrian Jones case. I looked it up and it made me sick and extremely anxious. The things that poor boy had to endure at the hands of his own parents left me reeling. 
A few weeks prior, an ex-friend of mine sent me a link on deathaddict forum called funkytown. It showed a man being tortured with his face ripped off and hands chopped off, while a man tore into his face with a box cutter. The same feeling of extreme disgust and fear crept into me then. After realising what was happening, I couldn't help but feel extremely scared and pray to whatever is out there to never let this happen to anybody I care about. 
Human beings are capable to extremely sick things and my mind is unable to fathom how one can find pleasure in torturing a living being. 
So back to my question, how do you, in light of such information, go on with your life, knowing that you belong to a species that has committed horrifying acts?"
264,This feeling lingers.,"For the last year or so, I’ve had the feeling that I wanna die but, I don’t wanna kill myself. I’d be completely okay with getting hit by a car, or killed in a shooting. Like I just feel I’d better off dead at this point. I hate my life and don’t wanna be alive. I also don’t wanna kill myself cause I don’t wanna hurt my friends and family. I don’t know what to do anymore"
265,What is wrong with me?,I feel empty all the time. I feel like a waste of space. I feel like my family feels the same way about me.
266,How do some people keep themselves dissociated all the time?,"You can recognize such people through social media. Their instagram consists of sunglasses and selfies, the whole world could be falling apart, but they always find a nice picturesque spot for a quick photoshoot.  Fear or the slightest some level of emotional vulnerability is blocked out.

They could be in quarantine, but still make an effort to find a lock-in possibly open to sneak in and quickly get out with several cans of beer.  

And then you have others, who are unafraid to write down their emotions on social media, even if it means being exposed to strangers. They slip in some subtle warnings, criticism, political commentary, concern for people from another corner of the world and signs of distress and, occasionally, some nice photos. 

I fall more into the second category, but I have a hard time getting into the minds of the first ones. What is it like NOT to care? And even if you do deep down, how do you skillfully seem unphased ALL the time?"
267,"No sleep, mood all over the place, anxiety through the roof","It has been months since I have had more than 3 hours of sleep during the night. I am exhausted everyday and am losing focus at work. I am a student nurse so losing focus isn't an option. I'm scared I'll causing harm to a patient. 
My mood can swing from the happiest to the angriest I've ever been in the space of 2 nano seconds. It's not fair on those on the recieving end of that. It just makes me more upset seeing those I love on the other end of that. 
I haven't had severe anxiety, only quite mild. But lately it's been panic attack galore. I don't really have any reason to though. I have an amazing boyfriend, great family and it's my birthday tomorrow. 
I had a bit of a run in with an ex which was anything but pleasant. He was physically abusive to me in the relationship and tried hitting me again when I bumped into him. 
I've also suffered two family losses (nan and unborn child) since the beginning of the new year. 

Any advice people?"
268,Antidepressants,"How do you know if these even help? I've been on meds for almost a year now and honestly I can't even say if it's helping me or not. These are long term effects type of meds. So yes it's hard to see instant change. But again, how do you know if it even has an affect on you long term. I tell my doc that it's helping me. But if I'm being honest and when I think about it, I'm not even sure how I came to that conclusion."
269,freaking out about computer storage,"petty ramble/vent. no tw’s i think:
hi. i dont know how to start this, but ive got the usual depression and anxiety. im really into open world games, right now im really into skyrim. skyrim ks only like 10 gb. my gaming pc is my baby, though im not the most savvy i try to take care of it as much as i can. it has a 2 tb hard drive. ever since watching that one vsauce video explaining that you cant really delete anything from your computer ive been freaking out about every little thing i download. after playing gta vice city i was very interested in 5. 5 is like 80 gigabytes and im not sure if it would even run on my pc. after about a week of worrying i decided not to try. i dont download any new-graphic overhauls for skyrim because theyre so big. anyways, ive been considering trying hitman 2. seems very interesting. but its 60 gigabytes and again i dont know if itll even run on my pc. ive been really nervous and scared and sad in a way because i want to play it but 60 gb is a lot and what if i dont get that back??? what if it doesnt even run well???? what if... what if.... i run out of space???? 2 tb is a lot but games are getting so large in size... ive been playing only older games because of the file sizes.. ive been putting off continuing my assassins creed game series story thing because of the files.. i use my pc for drawing and a few other things than gaming and i worry ill run out of room for my psd files and/or whatever the heck else. im just so so worried and i know im probably surely overreacting but i love my computer and i want to keep it happy and healthy and safe and... and..

please help with ways to deal with this crisis. if u cant, thats ok too. have a good day"
270,"Update - Saw my doctor about my anxiety today, and she made me feel so validated and that what I’m feeling is so very important.","If you’re interested, see my past post history for background - obligatory on mobile, sorry for formatting issues etc. 

Today I went and saw my doctor about the anxiety that has developed since I started working at the new facility. This appointment was after I received a call from work trying to get me to fill a shift this afternoon, of which I turned down. 

And I feel so relieved that I saw her. She straight away could see how bad this was affecting me, and the first thing she told me is I need a new job. I explained to her my dilemma of only being a new nurse, and she gave me some alternative options that I hadn’t considered. She reinforced that my mental health must come first, and has recommended I go and see a psychologist to help work through this, which I’ll be booking an appointment for tomorrow. 

She told me that them pestering me to work extra shifts is them trying to push me into submission and if I do the extra, I’m only going to make things worse. I explained to her that my anxiety has gotten to the point I catastrophized the phone call for nearly two hours after, and she agreed that I need to leave the job to ultimately get a good start of rectifying my anxiety. So the jump into mad job applications starts tomorrow. 

We’re going to try and stay off medication for now, but she’s more than happy to look at it in the future if I need. 

All I can say is, don’t ever feel like you’re alone, or that you don’t need the help. I never thought I’d be in the position I am now, but I also want to ensure my future as a nurse doesn’t get completely ruined because of one bad job. Seeing your GP is the first step in the road to recovery and I’m so proud of myself for taking that first step today."
271,Treating my manipulative self.,"I'm a 21 years old Male and have been reading a lot of books on how to obtain power and how vain and week most people are etc. This has largely changed my worldview and how I deal with people, sometimes manipulating them to do what I want them to do. I'm not feeling good about these traits that I have unknowingly developed during the search of understanding power better. I find that this need to control other people stems from my own weakness. I want to understand this process(conscious as well as unconscious) that takes place within me during manipulation to uncover and transcend the traits I have developed and make sure that they don't obstruct me having healthy relationships with people I care about."
272,How do I deal with Mental Illness tearing my family apart?,"First of all, disclaimers: 1. Throwaway account because of the sensitive nature of what I'm discussing, 2. I apologize if this is not the place to be asking or the tone to be asking in, I'm just really desperate. 3. Sorry about the length, I know it's a monster of a post. There is a TL;DR at the bottom and I tried to cut as much as I could, but years had to be condensed to sentences, here, and there was only so much I could cut. I really, truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it.

Here we go: I live at home with a parent just after graduating grad school while trying to get my feet under me. My older sibling recently moved in with us as well. My older sibling has severe ADHD, OCD, Bipolar, and a number of other conditions. My sibling is unable to preform simple task like cleaning up after themselves, and will stay in their room for days on end before exploding out into the world and spending unfathomable amounts of money. My sibling has *no* income and the family ends up paying for this. My sibling has already cost the family over $100,000 that, frankly, we don't have to spare. Crucial repairs have been put off, trips canceled, lifestyle changes have been made to accommodate him financially.

Money is one thing, but on top of this, my sibling has turned the house into an active minefield. My parent and I were cohabiting without much friction, but with my sibling here, every word is spoken with deliberate care in fear that we will trigger one of my sibling's conditions. A single stray word from my parent can *and* has lead to arguments that have lead to fights that lead to shrieking, crying, brutal verbal battles that I have to moderate in hopes of, if not diminishing the damage done, at least absorbing some so it can be spread around evenly. It feels like living with an abusive relationship in the house that everyone is afraid to step on and set off.

But, I know that it this is not my sibling. I remember him before this condition became so severe, and my sibling was a bundle of warmth and light and life. A genius, who conquered every interest, a master programmer, brilliant musician, talented artist, clever, witty, full of joy and a zest for life that is unmatched in anyone I have ever known. I know it's the fault of mental illness, but... knowing that doesn't make the money less spent. It doesn't make the verbal body blows land any softer. It doesn't make it any easier to look in on my parent after they fight and see them look up at me with tears in their eyes and ask ""I'm a good parent, aren't I? I don't know how to help them. I don't know what to do.""

My sibling is trying. He sees two therapists and a psychiatrist. He is on countless medications. But his conditions have been deteriorating for years and nothing seems to help. I love him so much and I just feel so, so powerless and I don't know how much longer this can go on. So please, if anyone has any advice, has experienced anything similar, has any insights or resources or can help in any way, I am truly desperate. Thank you so much for reading.

*TL;DR*: My sibling's mental illness is putting unsustainable emotional and financial strain on my family, and I am utterly lost in the darkness on how to proceed.

*PS:* I know, especially when there is one person around whom the conflict swirls, Reddit like to give the advice to ""Get this person out of your life."" We have tried to ""Cut my sibling off"" before and it ended when we found my sibling living with several hard-drug users in a rat-infested concrete basement of an apartment, out of meds and depressed to the point of attempting suicide. I truly believe removing my sibling from our lives will kill them, and I don't think my family will survive that."
273,"To me, self care is about getting outside and making the most of fresh air. In many cases, getting outdoors has helped me through many tough moments, and turns out it's a scientifically recognised cause and effect, so I wrote a little article on it. Let me know what your outdoor self care is!","I've been on lockdown in Singapore for the last few months and i've been struggling with not being able to get outdoors, there has been a lot of adjustment to keep myself sane. I've been supporting my wife while she undergoes leukaemia treatment and we've been working on our mental health app Bravely (hoping to launch soon!).

Still, I spend many minutes every day imagining my favourite places I've been to, lakes, mountains beaches. It's lessened the struggle a bit and helped cement those memories for me, but man! I miss getting out and about. 

Here's the article if you want to have a read.

Hope everyone else out there is staying healthy, and your families too. 

Be interested in hearing about what kind of outdoor self care you do?"
274,Any advice?,"Hi! 

I’ve been struggling with bad mental health since I was a kid. There’s a depression and anxiety history in my family and I’ve seen a couple of therapists but I haven’t been officially diagnosed. Lately things have been going crazy and I’m super overwhelmed so I was thinking about finally seeing a professional and getting the proper diagnose. 

Is it better to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist? I feel like I may need to take meds to normally function but I’m not sure where to go. Is talking therapy better? I’m super confused."
275,I may or may not have had an eating disorder.,"I'm 6'1, 135lb. I used to starve myself a lot. I didn't know how else to react with everything that was going on. I was upset with how I looked. ***So I resorted to fasting and fasting. I did that for about a month and half.*** I don't know exactly. But I didn't do it everyday. *I probably did it 4+ times a week.* *I always felt hungry but taught myself to* ***""resist""***. I managed to lose an unhealthy amount of weight and no one noticed so I kept on going. *I lost around 35 pounds.* *And dropped to 126lb.* I was unhealthy looking. But no one really bothered asking why. I talked to someone about it and they sorta convinced me to stop. I feel bad about my weight because people always point out how I'm skinny. But, the good thing is that I'm slowly gaining it back. I haven't done it for probably a month and a bit. I also got a girlfriend now and she knows about it. She made me feel comfortable and made me feel better in general. I'm happy to have her in my life. I'm putting everything back together ya could say.  Life's good:) I hope everyone has a good day/night!"
276,Fear of sleeping,"I hate sleeping. I'm so tired but I just can't do it. I'm afraid, it's so vulnerable, somebody could sneak in and kill me. I'm home alone, usually my girlfriend stays up till I fall asleep (she just dose it naturally). 

How can I get over my fear and/or cope and fall asleep"
277,"I've been diagnosed with general anxiety, I think it's more than just that because of past trauma","The passed 4 or 5 years have been shit, lost 3 of my best friends my senior year of High school, got kicked out of college (selling drugs and robbing[before this I had never been involved in these activities]) and had a family fallout. 

I've been doing great for myself since I've cut off my father but recently I've been struggling like I use to. I generally try to be a really understanding and empathetic person but lately the rage and uncontrollable sadness has been wrecking me. I've never been suicidal but recently I've been having alot more, well let's say twisted thoughts. I know this isn't me and I don't want to become the man my father is. The other day I punched a hole in the wall, I have never felt so low and worthless in my life. 

In addition I feel like I'm going through this constant change of emotions that scale from unrealistically happy to unbearably sad in the matter of seconds. My memory is absolute garbage, I feel like I can't remember anything from my childhood or short term either. It's so frustrating, it makes work so much more difficult. I feel like I've lost my will and there is no coming back from this. Most don't know how intense my issues are so anytime I reach out I feel like they aren't valid because im not a war hero and I pretend to be stronger than mental illness. I know I need to get help again but im just really discouraged right now. Just typing this thread is a challenge it's self because I have to jog my memory every 5 seconds so I've lost my goal with this I guess lol!

How do I find help? What type of mental health expert should I reach out to? Should I try talking about PTSD or is that their job to tell me? I don't want to force my diagnosis. And I don't do well with medication is there an alternative medicine I can try? Marijuana helps the most I've noticed but I don't want to be looked at as a ""self medicator"" just trying to score a med card. I have an amazing gf and we've been together since we were 17 (22 and 23 now), I don't want to give her the life my mother was forced to live. If anyone can relate, help, or just bullshit in the comments please feel free. Anything helps right now 

Anyways y'all have fun❣️"
278,Feeling some anxiety because of a couple things:,"1. My family is fairly fucked up and I like how everyone pretends their normal. Ridiculous. From verbal abuse, to paranoia, to threats of violence.

2. About 5 years ago when I lived at home my mom kept bothering me and annoying me, so I got mad and ripped up a childhood picture of me... a pic I was pretty happy in. Damn. :(

3. I live with my asshole brother who a a narcissistic fuck. I told him he’s the only one in my life who is an asshole and he should feel bad about me saying that.

4. My asshole stepdad told me when I was about 19 that “Oh now that you’re an adult, I’m not afraid to hit you anymore!”

I told my friend who’s about 10 years older than me about this, and he said:

“And when you weren’t an adult he was?!”

I thought that was kinda funny but I’ve considered many times my parents ultimately provide little good to this world and they ought to be hauled off to a psychiatric ward. Don’t want to end up there? Shouldn’t do stupid actions."
279,Memory loss and overall pretty much fucked up state,"My memory became very bad. It feel like i'm unreachable anymore. Even if i rest, i still feel tired. Everything is hard and constantly feel like my second breath is about to end. A little more and i'm over. When i live through a moment, i remember it, but when i replay it,it's dull and feels like it has happened, but i wasn't there. Like it's not me. Like i'm above all my life trying to watch it happening. Feels like i'm absent and i subconsciousnally do everything that i do. 

Feels like there's no way I can restore it.

Is in normal? What should I do?

I can't even talk to a psychologist. Last time i told her about it she was pretty negative about it. My parents are the last people who i'd wanna talk with about it. It's just that everything is going okay and i'll ruin everything."
280,Is it bad that I sometimes feel anxious that Im being watched at night?,"For example, I’ll be downstairs in my house, and I’ll be heading upstairs at night, and I’ll turn off all the lights, and sometimes I’ll feel like i’m being watched or there’s something lurking in the dark. It’s like a fear a child would have, but I still have it. 

Is this a sign of something bad like paranoid schizophrenia?"
281,Dose anyone just draw?,"I'm 17 m, I've had issues for many years both severe and not as much. I'm at a point in my illness where I just cant verbally describe the way I feel I just cant comprehend the depth of my emotions. So I draw them. Really just tryna relate or talk to other people who do the same thing I'm really losing my shit"
282,Different Therapy Techniques That Work For Depressed People,"Therapy is no longer a buzz word used by the urban elite of our country. Thanks to a lot more acceptance of mental health around our country, therapy has become relatively more accessible for people. By no means is it absolutely fine, but it is a step in the right direction. People who suffer from mental health problems like depression have more access to therapy, especially in the major cities of India and that is something we could not have said a few years ago. Nowadays, people have access to [support groups](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), top notch therapists and psychiatrists. This means that people, even if they aren’t comfortable talking about therapy with their family or friends, still have a way to deal with their mental health issues. So, how does therapy help people get over their fears, issues and everything pertaining to their mental health? Let’s have a look at some of the most commonly used and effective techniques of therapy. 

1) **Group psychotherapy -** Group psychotherapy is a form of therapy in which one, or multiple therapists treat a small group of people. [Group therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) is extensively available at private hospitals, clinics of psychologists and therapeutic centers. Studies show that group psychotherapy is effective for people with depression. One of the main reason people seek group psychotherapy is that it allows them to receive support and affection from people going through similar issues. Moreover, fellow group members also serve as highly accessible role models. Their dedication to the cause and progress can work as a great reinforcement for others in the group. 

2) **Narrative therapy -** Another highly effective form of therapy is narrative therapy. In this form of therapy, the psychologist separates the person from the problem. In a nutshell, it is all about encouraging the person to use their personal skills to come up with solutions for their problems. What this does is that it helps people objectify their problems. It also allows the person to create wriggle room for other stories in their lives. So many times, when you are going through something larger than you, you invariably work around that problem. What that does is that it consumes everything in your life. Similar to [group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), where you see other people’s issues to add more perspective to your problems, narrative therapy helps you look at your problems in a bit more impersonal way. That allows you to add more positive stories in your life, which ends preloving that stress a little bit. Narrative therapy is not about transforming someone. It is about transforming the effects of a problem. The aim for narrative therapy is to add space between a problem and the person. This allows the person to see how a certain concern is serving them, rather than it just harming them. This kind of therapy also helps put certain problems in different contexts. These contexts can be personal, social, political and cultural. What this does is that helps people see how they see themselves and their personal stories."
283,Needing to cry once a day,"Okay well the title isn't entirely accurate but does anyone else in this sub feel they need to/cry at least once every few days? Maybe even everyday.

Like right now, I felt this immense overwhelming of emotions that I closed up and didn't speak. Yet in a matter of minutes later, my eyes had tears rolling down and I'm thinking about pain and relief?

It's a different reason every other time but after crying, I feel at peace. Feeling of uplifting.

284,I love you all (my story),"I am a former mixed martial artist and boxer (stopped because of concussions, i loved to brawl and i was short and stocky so i fought the heavy guys) dealing with my concussions and bipolar, anxiety, and anger problems from past trauma and i will tell all of you i promise it will get better. If you are young men, you will grow into men stronger than guys that dont have mental illness cuz youll have survived. You dont knoe how fucking tough you are. Youre a god damn warrior. This is hard. We live with the pain of having enemies and being our own worst enemy and we still keep going. How are we not strong? We will always be resilient and we WILL find the promise land. I been to the mental hospital and ive had many cops called on me. And im telling you, if i can change into someone completely different you can too. I love yall!!!!!!! Always keep trying!!!!!!!!"
285,uhhh first love," The first time a boy ever told me he was in love with me was New Years 2019. Just like any New Years in Australia it was a warm night, I was wearing my favourite black shirt with the flowers on it with my favourite pair of doc martens. It was 3am and I no longer had any of these clothes on. I had gone to bed many hours before but was awoken by this boy I knew trying to finger me. Telling him to stop wasn’t enough to stop him getting his New Years score, nor did it stop him telling that girl he loved her. The most vacant one can feel is when they are lifelessly staring through someone, waiting for them to finish, all because the fight is too hard and they’ve given up. It saddens me how many times I’ve felt that vacancy. Love and intimacy is such a warped concept for me. The men who tell me they love me are lying, but I believe them. I believe many lies, maybe it is my autism but I do not understand how or why people can lie about that sort of thing, I never do."
286,I keep having auditory hallucinations and it's keeping me up at night,"Im typing this a t 4:28am sorry if the grammar is bad.

Recently I've begun to have auditory hallucinations moatly screeming, blowing, and vocal fry noises if that makes sence. It mostly hapens when i start to fall asleep, I have my cats in my room but no other human and there is no way in hell my cats can make those noises,  i haven't been getting much sleep at night and it's sending me into a tired, depressive, irritated state.

Does anyone know why this could be happening?
(I don't drink or smoke, I'm 13)"
287,to me,"this will probably sound confusing but i just wanted to say it. i’m just talking to myself tbh


Because you're you. and i'm me. And we're us.
And there's nothing we can do about it. 
You'll hate me, and I'll hate you back, but all we have is each other, just you and me. And we'll get through this. There's always a way out.
No matter how stupid or cringy you think that is, it will always get better. 
I don't care how much you hate to be you, or how much you'll run from yourself and change yourself so others will like you, or how much you literally can not stand just fucking being, or how you're so depraved that you're willing to be the fucking idiot of the group so that they'll laugh at your stupidity, just so you can feel something.                                                               
I'll be here for as long as you fucking live. And I know you hate that. 
But we're stuck together. and some things you can't change. 
It leaves a bottomless fucking pit in your fucking stomach just to think about waking up in the fucking morning and seeing everything normal, everything still going, and the world still turning. 
How you have to keep on going. 
How you have to keep on living. 
And even if nobody gives a flying fuck about you and your fucking emotions, about how you feel, because you’re the “funny one” who isn’t even funny, and they’re not supposed to take you seriously, I’m here.
You can get the words out to me when you can’t talk to them. 
It’s embarrassing, I know. 
So don’t tell them. 
You’re not supposed to feel. Ignore it, tell me, push it deeper down, and screw the lid on tight.
Because you’re me. And I’m you. 
And no matter how much you think it’s getting better, I’m here.
I’ve got the jar.
And when you come running back to me, bawling your eyes out, I’ll have the excavator.
I’ll push you back into that hole you fucking crawled out of like a disgusting worm and I’ll dig it deeper for you.
 Because you’re desperate. All you’ve got is me.
All you’ve got is you. 
You’ll never open your mouth. It’s too much effort to get the words from your brain out of that gaping bullshit spewing hole of yours. You’re fucking useless. You think you’re deep and complex, but there’s nothing going on in your empty fucking skull. You hate the dark turn that this always takes and it fucking hurts you. There’s always so, so much more to say but you don’t say it.
This is what it’ll always end up as. Your worst fucking nightmare. Pushing everyone around you away, because I hate them and so do you. 
And I don’t care if you’re sick of this. If you’re sick of me. Because you’re not. You’re your only hope and all you can do is live. And all i’ll do is be the big bad guy, but you know it’s you. You’re a soulless creature and you won't. stop. running. Running from me. Running from what’s real. You want people to pity you but you won't talk because you're afraid. They’ll just use it against you later or fucking forget in a second because you are nothing to them. And you’re fine with that.
You run and you run and you run and you run. 
You’ll always be a disappointment to me, and nothing will ever change that.
So try. Just try.
That’s all you can do.
I promise I’ll be here. Just try."
288,Finding ways to make it stop?," It’s like I don’t know where to put the pain, I mean there isn’t really anywhere it can go. I’ve tried so hard to make it leave and nothing ever works. It’s like I’m ok for a moment, if I’m lucky that moment lasts a while. Then it's there again, sometimes from nowhere. It sucks the enjoyment from what I’m doing and makes me want to drink until I sleep. It stops me in my tracks and there is nowhere for it to go. I think mental health is about prolonging the moments it's gone without being addicted to a substance. It’s far easier to drink a bottle of wine than to sit with the pain. Maybe it's about accepting the fact the pain doesn’t have a solution and it stays in you forever, and that is ok."
289,Diagnosis,"Just got diagnosed with clinical depression, adjustment disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety associated with visual and audible hallucinations, and an unspecified personality disorder. So now I'm probably getting discharged from the army."
290,I don't know what to do,"Im 15. I'm in second year of high school, and i always was a golden child in my childhood- talented, mature, calm, understanding. When i was small, my mom kept telling me that my grades were everything, so I've always put school before my social life, to the point that the only people i talk to are my parents. My dad didnt care much, so i've always felt worthless in his eyes- i had nothing to me except my good grades. With my 2nd year of high school i got really busy and i stopped doing most of the things i love (drawing and watching anime), and i tried doing my best at studying, but i immediately fell off the ""best student in class"" status, and my results now are mediocre at best. This took a huge toll on my ego, and ik it's so dumb, but now i feel like everything that made me, me, is gone, and no matter how hard i work everything i do will amount to nothing, so instead of studying i start closing up and playing games to make up for the attention i dont get. I cant talk with other people, I dont have anything to me, i cant focus for a damn minute on my studying 'cause i get something in my head that says that even iif i study it will amount to nothing. Yesterday i had a crisis for my character, and today, while i was having a video lesson, i broke down because i felt like a piece of shit for not studying. My prof called me the moment i finished crying,y mind was blank and i couldnt say anything meaningful. She went on saying how school isnt closed so i have to study nonetheless. My mom overheard and she came and started hitting me. 
I feel like i have nothing to me. I dont know what to do with my life. Please somebody help me."

292,I haven't left my house since Wednesday and now I've stopped eating or showering.,"This coronavirus thing is messing me up. I can't do anything. I'm so scared all the time. My stomach hurts and I feel nauseous.

I already have diagnosed anxiety and stress, and I have a chronic illness. My head is all over the place and I don't know how to gather the pieces and put myself back together.

My family thinks I'm stupid and that I need to chill, but I can't chill when I'm afraid to die.

I can't visit my friends or my boyfriend because I'm scared of going outside and especially taking public transport.

I'm constantly ridiculed and made fun of by my parents and brothers, but I don't know what to do.

I've seriously considered putting myself in a mental ward, but I'm too scared of being in a hospital right now. And because of trauma related to my chronic illness, I generally feel very uncomfortable in hospitals. 

I haven't showered since Friday. I haven't eaten since yesterday. I'm just shaking and crying all the time. My parents are yelling at me because I need to put my shit back together, my boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting.

Jesus christ I just need some sympathy. All this could've been avoided if my family just took me seriously. I need someone to take me seriously."
293,Vent: a lot of change,"Today I woke up feeling anxious. It a lack of sleep and immense amount of change. Today I am leaving Ottawa, a city I have lived in for two years almost. It’s weird because all I wanted to do over this past year was go home. My mental health severely declined this year and all I wanted to do is be home with family. Not that it is happening it’s bittersweet. I have made some good friends and I like the school I am at and my professors. However, I hated my roommates and felt isolated. Coming home was a struggle most days and I kept myself in my room to avoid awkwardness. It’s also weird because my school isn’t technically over I still have classes left to finish online. A lot of things changed in such a short period of time and I guess I’m just trying to deal with it

I definately feel like I want to cry but nothing is coming out. I feel a bit anxious and my appetite dropped but nothing huge has happened if that makes sense.

I guess I’m in the what if stage - what if I have an anxiety attack now, what about now, what about now. I won’t be home for two more days, until then I’m staying with some distant family. I’m hoping I am okay."
294,Seroquel or something else?,"Hey everyone. Earlier this year I was put in the psych ward under a hold order after experiencing symptoms of psychosis. I’ve had small episodes before but never anything to this level. I was experiencing all the symptoms of mania as well as visual and auditory hallucinations as well as delusions. During this time I didn’t sleep for 8 days and have a lot of amnesia surrounding it. 

Before all of this, even though I’d get the occasional brief psychotic symptom I was diagnosed with only depression as my moods were always very low. The mania this year is the closest I’ve ever felt to normal. 

Well in the hospital they concluded that they believe I experienced acute psychosis or brief psychotic disorder brought on by PTSD. I was held in the hospital for a month. 

I’ve been out of the hospital for 3 weeks now and have been on seroquel. I’m only on 50mg at night now, a lot less than what they had me on in hospital. 

Well I’m still experiencing 
Hypervigilance 
Feeling that I’m being watch through my computer and walls 
Visual hallucinations (rarer now and only in the form of shadow people)
Sleep paralysis 
The experience of “dying” or leaving my body at night 

And most concerning is moments where I suddenly “come to” and have no memory of what has just happened. Kind of like black outs. It’s like I wake up but I’ll be in the middle of a mall or driving etc. I thought I napped in the car while my mum was driving and I woke up only to learn that I was awake and talking to her and not asleep like I assumed when I woke. It’s been happening at least twice a day. 

I saw a psychiatrist today and told her all this but she seemed to brush over it. She advised me to continue seroquel but wean off it and then only take as needed. 

I just was after some other advice I guess as I still don’t feel “stable” or like I’m functioning. I don’t know if it’s that the medicine isn’t helping or if it is causing these symptoms. I also feel like it’s not just acute psychosis. I’m not sure. Has anyone had similar?"
295,I've been hurting for a long time. I'm on my way to recovery.,"Hi, my name is Barrett, I'm 24, and I've been struggling with mental health since about ages 11-12. I suffer from bipolar 1 which has sometimes induced psychosis. I also suffer from severe ADHD. Very recently I witnessed a traumatic event involving my abusive partner and I am in the developing stages of PTSD. I've been hospitalized twice and I have attempted suicide 3 times. August of 2019 I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. 

For the longest time I would gauge my mental health by asking myself if, gun-in-hand, I would honestly kill myself. For the longest time the answer to that question was yes. There would be a no one day every few months but they weren't common. Lately however, for the past few months, it *has* been no. I've learned that I may qualify for disability. I also may have the chance to move in with my best friend next summer. 

When you're in the depths of your mental health and someone tells you that ""it gets better"", it is almost impossible to believe them. I know that because I've been told that by many different people at many stages of my life. For me, though, it may have been the truth. I feel better. I still have depression symptoms and I'm currently suffering mental whiplash from the death of my abusive partner, but I don't want to die. For 12 years I've never not wanted to die.

I hope someone, even one person, reading this can feel a sense that they may also one day feel better. It's really hard. Trust me, I know how unbelievably hard just existing can be. Time moves forward, though, and brains mature and situations change. Thank you for reading this if you have."
296,"Quad shot of espresso at 7pm, relapse with s/h, opening up about my trauma and other brilliant ideas I’ve had this week","Throwaway account.

In September, I was raped by someone I’ve known for over a decade. Someone I loved, and for a long time I called a best friend; for a while, a boyfriend. What he did broke me in so many ways, and as a CSA survivor, split through the cracks that were already there. I’m still so very angry and recovery isn’t going very well. Therapy twice a week, but I still can’t leave the house on my own. I still have regular panic attacks and while I’ve come to terms with what happened, I’m still dragging myself through the hellscape that is the aftermath.

Less than two months after my assault, I hooked up with a guy that I knew from experience was a shitty person, but I thought it was the best thing for me at the time. My little diseased brain thought that if I just let someone else close, let someone else touch me and want me in any capacity, maybe I could stop... everything. I don’t entirely understand my thought process at the time but spoiler alert: it didn’t work. Shitty people don’t just stop being shitty people and it only made things so much worse. We slept together once and after a month of him doing his usual routine, I broke it off. This was in December.

Since then, I’ve had this entirely delusional thought that if I just told him what happened, told him everything I was dealing with at the time of our hook up, maybe he could understand. What I expected him to do with that information, I don’t know, but I knew it was something I had to do. Maybe it was closure. Maybe it was therapeutic. Maybe I just wanted to tell him since I couldn’t tell my rapist. So last night, I typed out everything I could without wanting to stab myself in the eyes, put it in a private pastebin post, then sent him the link. It’s been 24 hours with 4 views on the link (only one of which are mine) and no response. He’s been active on social media. I can’t say I’m surprised and part of me expected this, but still. What kind of person, no matter how immature and bitter, sees an account of someone they call a friends’ rape and doesn’t go, “oh shit that sucks sorry” in the very least?

Oh. Did I mention that he’s been friends with my rapist just as long as I have?

I’ve been struggling with self harm for nearly 20 years, and I’ve relapsed several times this year due to everything that happened. I want to make it very clear that I didn’t relapse because of him. I think I’ve just been desperately trying to find anything to make this pain go away. Running, spending time with friends, therapy, immersing myself in work, writing, distracting myself with video games... nothing works, at least not for very long. I didn’t hurt myself because some fuckboy didn’t pity me for being a victim and drop his entire world for me so we can live happily ever after. I don’t care. I don’t even want that. I guess I really just wanted someone to care, because I feel like I’m the only one that’s angry. I wanted someone to be angry too. Instead, I just got more indifference.

I’m okay now, I think. I have therapy today but I’m not sure how much I’m going to tell her. I know I’m a idiot for all of this— you can’t make people care, you can’t expect them to care, but it’s still absolutely heartbreaking when they don’t."
297,i hate this so much,
298,Is there any sort of treatment of process that can help me remember things?,I just feel like there are repressed memories to explain the way I am or the way I think. Is there anything that can help me dig into my subconscious to help me?
299,"I work for an Assisted Living facility, what low resource activities we could provide to keep the residents busy and engaged while in quarantine?","To be clear, we work with seniors and people with intellectual disabilities. We thought about purchasing some tablets so residents can Skype with family, and running virtual tours (if they exist) on a projector. All our facilities already have Netflix and etc.."
300,I feel like I have a personality disorder?,"So I’m obviously not on here to get diagnosed, and have plans to go to the doctors and go off their recommendation but I’ve had bad experiences in the past when it comes to diagnoses (I had a therapist who refused to acknowledge anything wrong and claimed “I think you’re just rebelling against your parents” when I was starving myself, making myself sick and self harming which eventually ended in an attempt two years after leaving home) I’m much better now but I’ve noticed something incredibly strange happening with my personality. I’ve gone from a very flamboyant gay “twink” to a relatively heteronormative bisexual within a 3 year period. But not in a linear sense. My personality switches between different defaults on the regular. Certain music, food and people bring out different personalities. And I’m not talking about acting different depending on circumstance. It feels like my gender, age, sexuality and personality changes. A friend commented that I dress like a completely different person every day and I’ve had friends burst into laughter when I’m speaking on the phone or to different people and I basically change into a different person. It sounds like D.I.D except not at all ahaha like I’m always me and I’m always conscious (I do dissociate a fair amount but Always come too) it’s really starting to take a toll on my life. Each personalities has different career paths and dreams, different friend preferences and I end up abandoning things when I’m spending a lot of time in one state and then regretting it when I switch back. I’ve done Alevels in Drama, gone to uni for computer science and dropped out and gone to art school. I had a relatively traumatic childhood which I won’t get into but again referencing DID thats what results in splits in personalities except it’s like mine only half split? I’m just asking if anyone has similar experiences, knows what this is or has any advice."

I don’t want to be mean or a bad person, if anyone has some advice please. Thank you for reading"
303,I don't know what's wrong with me. I get so hyper and angry and agitated and self-harmy.,"So every now and again, I feel a bit weird. It’s hard to describe. I can't even tell you how often it happens because i only just realised it's weird, but it's often enough that i've realised its an issue. 

 I get a lot of restless energy. Feel like I’m hyped up. Super focused. Easy to irritate. Much more likely to self harm or do negative behaviour impulsively. I also notice that if something hurts, like i scratch an itch a bit hard, i push harder to make it hurt worse and enjoy it (recovered self harmer so that happens to a small extent usually). When i've felt like this previously, i think i would cut (6 years clean) and ive held a lighter to my skin before. I've yanked my hair before out of not coping with how angry I am at not being able to sleep. I also do repetitive body focused behaviours due to OCD that hurt. The pain feels like it's releasing the feeling a bit. When i do things that help release the feeling, like chewing super hard things, singing loudly, writing, it gets better for a bit but usually returns.

&amp;#x200B;

 I think it’s typically when I feel bored or something has provoked strong emotion. I don’t feel euphoric or anything like that. Just heightened emotions I guess. I feel tense and my teeth are clenched. But nothing like wild, just enough to be like wtf. Significant, not nothing, but not like the description of bipolar. I have been feeling super depressed for a few days (more than usual anyway) and this morning was super fatigued and sad. Before I felt ‘manic’, I saw a knife and pressed my thumb down on it to see if it would cut my finger. So I guess that kinda behaviour started earlier today before I actually noticed I was heading where I am now. I’m just like heightened and hyper but in a negative or neutral way. I will sometimes listen to loud music or eat a lot or game intensely or just bounce my leg rapidly. If I'm out, I might drive a bit faster (still safe, i'm very cautious normally so its basically normal people driving), put headphones in with loud music, and just be a big glaring, angry person. I am just A Lot. I don't know if this coincides, but sometimes i also get super angry, like my sister did something stupid which meant that I had to clean up after her, but i was already at peak stress before that, so i was shaking and had to listen to loud music and leave the house to see a friend to calm down. I am nowhere near that point on a normal day.

I’m usually depressed so it’s a big difference in how I feel but I guess it’s not severe. Because of my depression, i'm exhausted, but when i'm 'manic', i've got tons of energy, and my body feels like it's revving to go. Externally, people would just notice i'm higher energy than normal, i dont act bizarre or anything.

I’ve seen manic. I’m not manic. I also don’t have bipolar and see a therapist for ocd and depression. I don’t know what this is and I don’t know how to describe it to my psych. Does anyone have any ideas that I can research to discuss with my psych? Or has experienced this?

304,I somehow managed to get over my four year long depression!,"I shit you not.  It was with an Anon who told me I was holding onto the past.  It took me that bloody long to realize that.

I'm a 20 year old female and I'm currently in my last year of college, I live alone with 2 dogs and I'm really busy every day.


I suffer •OCD (diagnosed at age 15), •PTSD (diagnosed 5 months ago), •depression (diagnosed at age 16), •anxiety (diagnosed at age 11), anorexia (diagnosed at age 15) 


I NEVER had any problems with memory, motor skills, thinking etc. But today while I was writing assignment I noticed I was writing like a drunk person...for example I'd forget to put -ed at the end of the word [looke -instead of- looked] or [everyo -instead of- everyone] etc. I then went a couple pages back and saw I was writing s*it...I skipped words, letters, I wrote e instead of c... 


Last couple of weeks I feel dizzy and overall numb/disoriented...could it be just fatigue or..? 


I should probably mention I had hallucinations too yesterday...I kept seeing event that happened 9 months ago which caused me PTSD...like I was literally living trough that again I could see it and I had the same feelings like I did when it was all happening...


What is this?! BTW my therapist is NOT working anymore temporary so I don't have anyone to ask..."
306,":/ Why is homeschooling ""such a big problem""","This is probably gonna be very long and nonsense like it always is. I'm 13 female and like in England also I'm homeschooled, have social anxiety, unexplained stomach pains, self harming and probably depressed which is why i go to a therapist/ ""Counsellor""(?)/CAMHS. I know i need help and I'm trying to open up and we asked them to do tests for autism and depression but they did nothing really.

1- They completely ignored the fact i have stomach aches and just said i need to do more sport related activities. 

2- They blamed my social anxiety and lack of a social life on homeschooling.

3- They AREN'T going to do the tests because apart from the concern of the family they also need the school to say I'm showing symptoms of depression or autism and i don't go to school. 🙄

4- Literally ignored me when i gave hints i might be depressed and when i said that i can't get out of bed and feel like i don't belong they continued telling me i should be at school.

5- She's not going to make another appointment or help us because i don't go to school.

307,"Are anti-depressants/anxiety meds more of last resort things, or can they be the first thing people try?",
308,How can I help my husband?,"Hi! This is my first post in r/mentalhealth.

So basically I’m 22 and married, my husband (I’ll call him A going forward.) is 26. We met 2 years ago and just got married in January of this year, and he’s the love of my life. Best decision I’ve ever made. 

We had a blowout fight the other day and he dropped the D-word on me. I was completely thrown for a loop, my heart shattered. He didn’t say he wanted a divorce, just that he wasn’t sure what to do and Maybe it’s the best option. We continued talking him thru it and he came to the conclusion that he is no longer proud of himself, he’s no longer as great as he used to be and he didn’t realize until this conversation that it’s on him to fix these things because no one can make him proud of himself, but himself. This is where we have the beginning of our breakthrough I believe. 

A is a Marine Corps vet; went in at 17, did 5 years infantry as a FAST marine. Meaning, he’s seen some shit &amp; repressed a lot of shit. 
Anyone that knows a marine (aside from some of you lucky few) know that being around a bunch of other just as toxically masculine men is not good for people, let alone being in the straight up military where they tell you to shove the feelings where the sun don’t shine &amp; do what you’re told to do, &amp; knows how it impacts our men. 

He doesn’t know how to deal with feelings. Doesn’t know how to articulate. He just shuts down. He’s been like this since before we met, most often I would see him that way when a former squad mate passed, but he also gets this way when minor things go wrong, or he’s having a bad day.  He’s made increasing strides in these areas &amp; I really am so proud of how far he’s come, but we’ve still got a ways to go. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that he doesn’t know how to accept the feelings he’s having and move on with his day. There are some things, like a friends death, that I understand are impossible to simply move on from. But a setback at work? Bad traffic? An Offhand comment? Not so much. He is unable to put on a brave face for family events that we have to go to when he’s like this, I truly believe it is holding him back from so much that he could be excelling at. He believes he is of no good and no use to anyone, that he has nothing to offer in life. This is simply untrue. I’ve seen my husband shine before and I’d love to see him shine again, and I just want to help him get there in whatever way I can. 

He’s a very masculine guy, doesn’t want to try therapy because he’s unable to put his feelings into words and doesn’t think talking to a stranger would help. He’s warming up to the idea of medication but I don’t know if he’ll go for it. We’ve done supplements in the past but they’ve helped minimally. I’m just not sure what my next step from here should be. I know that he doesn’t want to be this way, and I want to know what I can do as a wife to help him during this hard time we’re going thru. I know I can’t do it for him, but I want to be there for him as best I can. 

Let me know if I should post this somewhere else, I figured this is a good place to start. to clarify a little, I also have struggled with mental illness for years (anorexia, depression, GAD.) I’ve gone to therapy and done the meds, &amp; I’ve seen the changes they’ve made to my life. I’ve taken huge steps to get where I am over the last few short years, but I know men are different in some ways with these things and just in general things that worked for me may not work for him. Any and all help is so greatly appreciated &amp; thank you for taking the time to read my post ❤️

TL;DR my husband is depressed and I want to know what I can do to be supportive and help him get to the next level of recovery without trying to do the work for him. He’s a manly man and does not want help but doesn’t want to feel how he feels anymore. TIA ❤️"

I know some people can't recover, hell maybe I won't recover, although I feel signs of progress from time to time.

I was about to graduate high school as valedictorian but it seems meaningless now. I had a good future but now I will never be able to be a father, a husband, a normal person.

314,"Whenever someone is unpleasant towards me, I want to ruin their life and damage them emotionally.","I've just had another angry episode, and I've had a desire to do emotional harm to someone because they were acting unpleasant to me yesterday.

Yesterday, I was talking to someone online (never met this person in real life) about a game, I briefly mentioned that, because I had no interest in spending my own money on it, that if they were interested in me playing it with them they could gift it to me (I didn't think much of it, just figured I should give them the option if they wanted to play with me). however, due to a typo when I said "" I don't beg for gifts"", it instead came out as "" I do t beg for gifts"", and didn't notice this until he got back to me and started passive aggressively implying I was a begger. I had to explain the typo but he still acted like I was doing a slip of the tongue sort of thing. And then when I explained why I didn't want to buy the game myself (again I didn't even think much of it but he insisted on digging it in to get the last word), because I didn't want to support the company that made it with my own money, he continued to hammer in why what I said was stupid and wouldn't accept my truthful explanation as to why I even suggested it. 

After this, because the guy had a rather hostile and unpleasant tone towards me, treating me like I was a fucking idiot or a begger, I have wanted to honestly harass or emotionally damage him in a way so he will feel hurt by me. 

I've had these emotions for a long while. Since I young age I would often have problems with people, but I never used to want to...actually want the person to be so harmed emotionally that it would make their lives miserable. I always feel powerless and weak when people talk to me like this, and I just want them to feel some of it, so I can feel better about myself and they can realise they shouldn't have FUCKED with someone like me, rather than treating me like I'm some fucking rat to be kicked around and treated like some kind of lesser being all for innocently suggesting ""you could gift it to me if you want another player"". Why the fuck do people who are considered normal have these weird hostile attitudes for no fucking reasons?

&amp;#x200B;

This dude also got mad at me for abruptly leaving a game once, and he sounded like he wanted to fucking hurt me over it and really laid it into me. He never apologized for it either. The smug arrogant fuck probably still thinks he was in the right, when he wasn't, he should have fucking realised acting like that makes him a fucking asshole.

I'm done venting. I just really don't understand why in situations like this, I just want the person harmed emotionally, rather than just leaving them behind. I really want to know why I have these, I do calm down. But I always feel a sense of resentment for that person, and a constant urge to just...yell at them. If I was near them in person, I fear I may actually harm them physically."

 I don't truly know what I want for myself. I have vague ideas, but I'm not sure if they're even my own or taken from someone else. I don't know what I REALLY want from life. It's almost like I'm not even a human. I'm not even my own person.
I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. 

Is there something wrong with my brain?  It's like I'm a robot. All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY? I'm 19 and feel like my life is slipping away from me. Like someone else is living it for me. Like there is no ""me"". Like I'm just observing someone else live my life.

This is so fucking scary and I need help."
316,The thought of this part of me never leaving me scares me,"I used to feel disconnected a year ago. Then I picked up philosophy and started reading books. I started to feel how everything didnt matter. So, I stopped thinking much and went with everything like everyone else does and I was suceeding in it. I forgot what I used to feel and I could feel the change in me, even though I had turned into a person I wouldnt have liked and someone who was stupider than before but I thought it was all for the better. I started to pay more attention to my studies and got fairly good grades and I was actually seeing a future for me.

But recently, It started again but more intensely. I come home and dont want to change my college clothes and stay there without changing until someone knocks the door. I feel like there is something missing and that there is something that is worrying me. Little things that my friends say knock my consciousness and gives me panic attacks. The things they say are never really related to anything. They just cause me panic out of nowhere. 

Now, I cant talk to anyone about what I feel because they simply dont care. I have tried talking with friends but they dont care or that they dont know how to react. I dont know if its going to end again. But it really feels like it is not going to stop bothering me.

It is always going to stay with me. It really makes me want to cry my heart out that this will forever be with me. That this part of me will never leave me despite everything good that was and is me has left and will leave.

I find it so scary. I have no idea why I"

Dramatic?","I was recently diagnosed with rapid cycling Cyclothymia/potential bipolar (I'm in a gray area, whatever that means..) and the last few days I've been horribly down and weepy. Yesterday I was meh, and today I feel absolutely fine. It makes me feel ridiculous for the bad days and honestly make me question if it really felt that bad. Of course, then a bad day comes around again and I'm reminded that it is actually shitty and not a figment of my imagination, but dang.."
318,How do I become mentally strong?,"With all this Corona Virus panic going on it just makes me angry and bitter that people became so selfish and became hoarders of things like toilet paper, hand sanitizer, etc when in reality the flu kills more and including other sicknesses. Then its racism and xenophobia torwards asian people worldwide, dumb conspiracy theories saying that they know a friend from the Pentagon and they told them what's gonna happen in the next few days. Like how does things outside of the government gets to people? I'm just sick and tired of hearing the dumb things exit peoples months including their weak mentalities. How do I cope with a society that is just plain stupid?"
319,Coping Social Isolation from Coronavirus,"This social distancing and staying at home is giving me major anxiety. I’m a college student and my family is 500 miles away from me. Even though school is cancelled, my professor is requiring me to attend a hospital visit this Wednesday, so I’m not sure if it’s worth going home for 3 - 4 days. FaceTime and phone calls are different to me, not to mention I don’t really live with anyone. So, there’s no one to be around during these times.

I can feel myself relapsing from the lack of social interaction, but I understand the importance of managing this virus.

If there is anything that you can share that will help me cope, please tell us. I’m shutting down social media for sure, but any other thing I can do will help as well."
320,"I'm not sure if this counts,","I've had a mild anxiety problem lately, and it takes the form of nausea, and very rarely a full in panic attack. Anyway, I think I've started hallucinating.

I've had something like this go on for a very long time. And I think it's just becuase I'm tired. Anyway, here the wrap:
It was midnight in day, I was very tired, and closed my eyes, *I WAS NOT DREAMING*, and not even a second goes by when I hear the buzzing of a drone. J wake up to see the silloute of a drone, or a completely black one right above my head. I hear it, and see it. When I went to touch it, it flew slowly away and disappeared slowly with the sound following shortly after. Then another night, I was again, very tired at midnight, and across from me, the thick rope on my robe on the couch right next to me appeared to have started moving in it's own. I was again, 3/4 awake and not dreaming. I freaked out becuase I thought it was a ghost. It wasn't. In fact, the rope I saw moving was nothing like the one in my robe. Very strange..any answers? I don't drink, do drugs or anything. Is this anxiety? Or just fatigue?"
321,"A long post (sorry)--suicide attempt, hating my fucking piece of shit self, depression, anxiety... All in silence.","TL;DR--I am feeling suicidal, depressed x infinity, and anxious as hell...having a hard time dealing with my disorders...all in silence.

I haven't posted in a long time but I've been struggling really badly for the better part of this month. I half-assed tried to kill myself but it didn't work. I guess I didn't really expect it to work and I really didn't WANT it to work deep down. It made me able to release some of the hurt I'd been feeling, though it just built right back up in the weeks after that. I still want to die badly, and I know how I want to do it... But some things are stopping me. Our eldest daughter had just been in for Spring Break and it was such a positive experience for me to have her there for me when I was feeling bad. She saw the cuts on my arms and didn't judge me. She was gentle in her questioning about that and I felt safe talking to her. She is taking Psychology as a minor and I have to say that in the past few years (since she'd been in college), she has changed SO much in her attitude. I think once I had gone to prison because I had set several fires (technically I am a serial arsonist, having set much more than three fires, with three about which they know) she had realized that I am not just being dramatic or an attention-whore at all. This is how I've been her whole life (she is 21 now)...and for a good chunk of my life. I truly can't stop myself when I get the urge to set a fire, and tbh I really do not WANT to control it. I also don't want to break the law anymore...wherein lies the problem.

I guess I am just a piece of garbage and no matter how much my family supports me and loves me, I can't see going on in this pain that nobody can see. I have cut-up arms and people see that and just see a fucked-up woman who is acting like a stupid teen. Yep. That hurts...doesn't help either.

My best friend has to go back to Germany because of this COVID-19 thing (the university in which his father worked has shut down and gone to online classes, of which he has no part) and I'm so sad. He is on his way back today I think. I wish his family and him a good trip and a safe trip back.

Also, I have a new-ish thing going on: I can't speak when I'm around anyone else except my family. I was this way as a child but I guess it was nothing because I eventually taught myself how to speak to people even though doing so gives me the worst anxiety ever. I can now chatter away to my family (even in public) but if a stranger talks to me...I literally go mute. Even with the people in Program, where I used to chatter away all the time, I am finding it impossible to talk. That is because the one therapist had said that I should be locked up (criminally) for cutting and that it was ""so stupid because people cut and cut and cut...then just stop""...???? What the fuckity fuck? Now I have anxiety talking in that (supposed) safe place. Does anyone know of this has a name?

Fuck me... I can't finish this. The urge to cut is strong and I want to just burn everything in sight.

I don't want to say goodbye yet because I don't want to sound like a drama queen; I don't have a 100% sure plan yet. So...I will just withdraw into my own world again...silent and anxious and depressed...

325,This morning I found out a friend lost his battle with mental illness.,"He was a young, loving, caring free spirit. In the last year he seemed to start declining into what I believe (although it is only conjecture) was schizophrenia. It seems he succumbed to his wounds last week and took his own life. 

My message to anyone struggling is that someone cares. Most likely many people care, even if you can't see it. We want to help, just reach out.  Its sad that mental health gets neglected to the point that this is so often the result. 

Stay strong everyone."
326,A poem about my struggles with borderline personality disorder,"I’m Living Life on the Borderline 

There’s things In my mind 
that I sometimes struggle to find
things like who I really am
if I looked deep inside 
 
These intrusive thoughts,
keep invading my mind
and they lead me to believe
that everyone will leave me behind

There’s something explosive
inside of my chest 
emotions leak out
I can’t keep them suppressed 

Can’t tell what is real
I’m so dissociated
it’s like right after something happens
the memory is asphyxiated

I can go from pure joy
To exploding with anger
and its so hard to control
the impulsive behaviors

I have so many conversations
inside of my head
and theres someone inside of me
that says I’m better off dead

By the time I was fourteen
I’d made my first attempt
only a freshmen in high school
yet I was treated with such contempt 

Now I’m an adult
and nothings really changed
except for being told
there’s a disorder in my brain

Now I don’t want any attention
but I need some affirmation
does anybody really care
or am I just a mental patient"
327,Help me out?,"I'm a 16 y/o high school student in India,
who has struggled with ADHD all my life.
While I was in tenth grade, I lost my grandma and the loss and all of the pressure pushed me into depression.
I did all sorts of things during this phase like self doubt, distancing people in my life, and even attempting suicide.
I managed to come out of it in the 2019 summer break and have always valued my life ever since.

However, my ADHD still keeps making my life difficult every now and then.
I have a hard time concentrating on anything, I'm clumsy as hell and I've not been able to get any work done properly this whole academic year.

I have tried different things that different people on the internet like Tom Frank, Ali Abdaal etc. suggest. But none of it seems to help me out.
And I'm someone who has never failed on a test or an exam and has done well in all important tests.
However, nothing seems to help me this time.

I am looking for tips, techniques, methods etc to help me stay focused and study with interest.
Kindly help me out,
Thanks :)"

330,Baby steps,"This past week has been really stressful for me, but I’ve made a couple steps in the right direction for my well-being and for that I’m really proud of myself. :)

My body image hasn’t been good since I was about 12 so that’s around 4 years. However, I slowly stopped having proper lunches all together over this past year since I don’t really have much of an appetite around lunch time anyway, but even when I do think about maybe buying some lunch my body image goes completely out of whack and I end up feeling way too guilty and shit about myself to have a meal - so then I’ll just either buy a small snack or wait until dinner. However, on Thursday, there was a themed day in the school cafeteria, and the food looked REALLY good and I was in a decently good mood, so for once I finally thought “you know what? fuck it” and bought the lunch. It was curly fries, onion rings, a hot dog and a caramel popcorn brownie with ice cream. So - compared to usually not eating a meal, that was a pretty huge deal for me. I haven’t eaten a proper lunch since then, but still.

Also, on Sunday I went for a walk, and for the first time in MONTHS, almost a whole YEAR, I went out in public without makeup. There weren’t nearly as many people outside as usual due to coronavirus so it’s not like many people would see me anyway but that’s still a MASSIVE deal for me, I’m usually WAY WAY WAY too anxious and terrified to go out in the open with no makeup on. I’m not saying makeup is a bad thing, but I feel like more often than not, I’m wearing it for the wrong reasons, doing it to hide my insecurities because I secretly hate myself rather than doing it because I like to do it or because it makes me feel good.

So yeah, though they were small, things happened this week that I wouldn’t imagine happening for a long time. So yeah, I’m proud. And no one can take that away from me. :)"
331,I feel like a weirdo,"I have no friends. Literally zero. I haven't gotten out of my house for two weeks. I have no where to go. My mother constantly asking me if I have no friends.

I don't want to be dependent on other people to provide me with happiness. Can I be happy on my own? Is it possible to live life alone and be happy? Is me being 14 have something to do with how I feel?
Ooof I have no idea what Im doing.. I want so much to stop feeling all this guilt about not being normal and not having friends. Im so sick of feeling like this

332,Looking for a book to work on childhood trauma healing. Any recommendations?,
333,Come along on my journey?,Hey I posted yesterday and I was just ranting about my life I wasn’t in a good mood and I haven’t done anything bad but I wanna start a blog of some what to just vent and get advice from people that are like me so either I will do this on this community page or on my profile but I don’t wanna do it if nobody cares sometimes it will be depressed things or maybe a update on how I’m doing or what I’ve learned and I have great advice to give away I feel this could really be a thing that could not only help me but help everyone else. If it sounds stupid I’m sorry but it was worth a try.
334,Friendships make me feel crazy,"Please help me. I am driving myself crazy. I don’t know what is wrong with me, I have been diagnosed with depression but I don’t think it fits my core issues.

I really struggle with friendships. I have been treated badly (mostly mentally) by every non family person I’ve ever met and the results are extreme insecurity and feelings of utter self loathing. Whenever I make a friend I drive myself crazy wondering if I’m good enough, if they actually like me or gearing myself up for the eventual hurt. 

I met someone online as part of a game that I’m a club leader of. We eventually came really good friends and she told me I was her best friend, and ever since then I can’t stop thinking that it’s going to mess up somehow. She is very patient with me and it has helped enormously, except we must have different definitions of best friends. Mine would be she is my priority over other friends, I would message her first etc. She doesn’t treat me like a priority at all and I don’t understand how you can call someone your best friend if they’re not your first port of call. 

I am just so desperately sad and now in self destruct mode. Unfortunately as I am the leader I can’t quit the game or the discord as there are many members that rely on it, and oddly enough said friend once said if I abandon the game it’s like I’m abandoning her. She is quite emotionally closed off so this surprised me.

Anyway I’m rambling. I already know that I am intense so I don’t need that pointing out, I want to know if there are others that feel this way or how to stop feeling this way because it’s honestly making me not want to be here"
335,Should I cancel my Psychiatrist appointment after getting “better”?,"I was on a wait list to get into the psychiatrist and my appointment is tonight. My problem was severe depression and mild anxiety. While waiting for my appointment I was able to get better with the help of my GP who put my on a combo of Wellbutrin and Trintellix.

Should I still go to my appointment? If yes, what should I do, just them them about my old symptoms?"
336,i relapsed last night,"TRIGGER WARNING - i talk about self harm- this is just a vent because i can’t tell anyone this happened to me aha i apologize. i had a pretty severe mental breakdown and i’m not even sure why. i just sat on the bathroom and cried and all i wanted to do was watch blood come out of me in the shower. I had been clean from cutting for almost 6 years now. i started taking anti depressants recently and they’ve really been messing with my head even at 10mg. i felt bad before but now i feel worse. yes i have told my psychiatrist but he told me to keep trying them out. i mean i’ve only been taking them for like 6 weeks now so i said okay. i was trying to text my boyfriend my thoughts but he was playing video games and was replying really slowly and i felt even worse. i called him out on it and he felt really sorry but that honestly doesn’t make me feel better. i feel completely alone. all i have is my boyfriend. i pushed my best friend away. although i have friends, i don’t truly connect with anyone. lately i felt like my boyfriend is so comfortable with me that he gave up on trying. he even forgot to give me a valentine’s day gift until i started crying cuz he forgot and he went and got it but the fact that i had to get upset first made me not even want anything anymore. i just don’t feel special to anyone. i’m not doing well in school anymore and i’m so scared if my parents find out they’ll stop helping me financially. they already barely help me financially and i’m paying for my own schooling, but i feel like the moment i start slipping up they’ll cut it off. i’m only 19 so i can’t really support myself that well. I also was pregnant about a month ago and lost the baby. it wasn’t a planned pregnancy but my family and my boyfriends family were willing to help in every way they could and a baby who i can take care of seemed like a ray of hope that died. everything just feels like it’s caving in on me and i don’t know what to do anymore."
337,Is it bad to call something “depressing” if you’re not talking about clinical depression?,"I understand that casually using a medical diagnosis (like saying “oh she’s so OCD about the colors matching) is problematic, for trivializing mental illness.

However, I’ve also seen people argue that casually using terms like “depressing” or “anxious” or symptoms associated with mental illness, like “paranoid” or “deluded” is problematic. To me it seems like this isn’t accurate, because you can feel depressed without clinical depression, feel anxious without clinical anxiety, and be paranoid about something without being mentally ill. I wanted to hear what others think about this though."
338,TW: So I don't know if this has been talked about yet....,"So yesterday, I watched Frozen 2  with my kiddos. I got added to Disney+ and I was excited.  Honestly, I felt like the movie was great. It really showed a lot of tough aspects of being human, but there was one part that really stuck to me. I am schizophrenic. I have been my entire life with my first visual hallucination happening at the age of around 5 (that I remember). It got more severe as I got older, and I have been on medication since I was about 14. The meds keep it shoved back a little, but I still have auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, just not as bad as they are when I am un-medicated. 

When Elsa broke into ""Into the Unknown"" with ""I can hear you, but I won't,"" it really caught my attention. I have probably listened to the song a good 15 times sense watching it yesterday. I've just let it soak in, and I feel personally that the lyrics perfectly go with someone like me that has hallucinated in the past. The line, ""You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear,'' reminds me of all the times I tried so hard to ignore the loud voices in my head that are overpowering my own. All the times I have tried to trick myself into thinking that they weren't there. The chorus, a repeated ""Into the unknown,"" belted out at full volume, makes me think about all the times I went into my hallucinations, whether it be willingly or involuntarily. Sitting on my bedroom floor, hundreds of voices in my head, just in a dark bubble of nothing. Even thinking back on times like that, it's difficult to see anything but myself. I remember the feeling of losing control of myself and letting myself go to whatever was happening. I was going into the unknown. 

The next set of lyrics: "" What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake. Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake? Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me? Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?"" Almost all those lines reverberate with me the most. The endless sleepless nights whether it be because of the voices, or because in my mind, I am not even home in my bed but someplace far away.  All the mistakes I've made because I couldn't focus or was told by someone else in my head to do a certain thing, whether it was self sabotage, self harm, or worse. Which leads into the last line of the above lyrics, all the times I have doubted whether or not I was meant to be here, physically. With the voices telling me every dark thing under the sun, trying to convince me that I am not where I'm meant to be. To just let go of what is holding me here and say goodbye to the confusion in my brain. 

And finally, the last lines in the song surprisingly sit with me as well. 

""Where are you going?                                                                                                                                           
Don't leave me alone.  
How do I follow you  
Into the unknown?""  

When I finally found a medicine that quieted the voices, made the monsters go into their caves to only peek out every once in awhile, I was afraid. For the first time in my life, it was almost always silent up there. I was finally alone with my own head, and that's a difficult thing that a lot of people don't talk about. To try to discover who I was without *them.* 

If you haven't heard the song yet, here it is [Into the Unknown by Indina Menzel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1uoTMkhUiE)"
339,I’m scared that my problems could ruin my lovely relationship.,"Hey guys. Just venting here. I’ll take any advice I can get as well. I’ve been with my boyfriend for quite a long time now and he makes me so happy. He is literally the most perfect being on this earth. I want nothing but for him to be happy but I’m worried that my problems are bringing us down. Because of past abandonment, anxiety, etc., I am very clingy. I don’t really have anyone but him to be around so when he is not with me I am at a loss. Ever since we got together, he hasn’t been visiting his friends as much because I complain. I don’t mean to hurt his feelings or take away his firends. I just get scared because I miss him and I want to be able to talk to him. He’s also had drug problems in the past as well, and his friends are still doing a lot of drugs and every time he goes over there he gets wasted. It just worries me. Not totally sure what to do- as he makes me feel alive. Idk guys haha. I guess to sum it up I feel alone unless I’m with him. And when he’s with his friends I kinda feel let down so 👍👍 yay"
340,Being stuck inside brought back some depression...,"I haven't been able to go to work for 4 days now. At first I thought it would be great. I had a whole list of things to do from enjoyable things like video games, all the way to fully cleaning my apartment.

And it all came tumbling down when my depression came back hard. It's probably because I honestly use work to distract myself from it usually. And now that I can't go to work, I can't shake these thoughts.

I don't want to do anything at this point. Not even eat. Don't even have an appetite.

And I was doing so good. I was a few months in of having no depressive episodes after having one that literally lasted continuously over a year. And now I'm right back to square one after struggling for so long to be better...."
341,Are these thoughts a reason to go back to therapy?,"So I(24f) have nagging feelings of almost paranoia I think?

I’ll explain the thoughts. I’ve been medicated for clinical depression. And occasionally I think that these “meds” are just a tool my mother and doctor are using to keep my mind sedated. Kind of an idea that everyone on earth is locked out of a big secret that a few people, including my doctors and mother, know. Then, when I began to discover this secret, they quickly put me on meds so that I wouldn’t get any farther in my discovery.

I have moments when I can dismiss the idea as untrue. But it’s always pestering me. Beyond that idea, I’m occasionally convinced my parents are trying to trap me with them forever instead of helping me live on my own. I know, logically, this isn’t true. But whenever my parents try to explain how they are helping I get insanely, illogically furious.

I feel blurry and my memory is a lot worse on the meds. I know I exhibited thoughts of suicide and self-harm prior to these “meds”. And I’ve stopped those habits. That’s why (unless I’m right about being one of the few Knowers) I don’t really want to get off the meds.

Unless I get overwhelmed I can generally fight off these thoughts. Since I usually know they probably are just intruding, false thoughts, should I not worry about them?"
342,I don't know who I am. Is there something wrong with me? Am I too far gone?,"I have no clue who I am or what I'm doing with my life. I don't truly know myself. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know what my values are. I have no opinions of my own.  I have no passions. I have no skills. I have no talents. I don't know anything about myself.  I don't even know what my dreams or goals are for my future.

 I don't truly know what I want for myself. I have vague ideas, but I'm not sure if they're even my own or taken from someone else. I don't know what I REALLY want from life. It's almost like I'm not even a human. I'm not even my own person.
I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. 

Is there something wrong with my brain?  It's like I'm a robot. All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY? I'm 19 and feel like my life is slipping away from me. Like someone else is living it for me. Like there is no ""me"". Like I'm just observing someone else live my life.

This is scary as hell and I need help."
343,Timberline Knolls,"Hi, 
I have decided to do residential treatment after withdrawing from school, and the only option my family is letting me consider is Timberline knolls. I know administration and policies have shuffled around a lot in the last couple of years, so I was wondering if anyone had a recent stay/experience there that they would be willing to share with me. I am an adult (not adolescent) seeking depression/sh/trauma treatment. l am queer, in college, and a bit concerned especially about the bathroom situation. if you have info about tk involving those situations in particular, that would be super helpful. 
Thank you,"
344,Struggling with relationships,"I’m having a hard time right now feeling secure in a lot of my friendships. I feel like everyone is moving on and there’s all this distance between me and friends I thought I would have for life. I know that I’m fortunate to have had my friends in my life for so long, but I can’t imagine life without them. My four closest friends all live in different cities from me and we’re all post college and moving on with our lives but I can’t help but feel abandoned or forgotten. Then I internalize a lot of those feelings and I hate myself. Can anyone relate? Any advice or encouragement?"
345,I got a prescription.,"Prozac 5mg and probable increase.

I'm 15.

I'd like to know what you think about that. Because it's my first time to have a prescription and I'm a little bit anxious about it."
346,Childhood Abuse Survivor turned Trauma Informed Life Coach for other Survivors of Domestic Abuse -- Free Resources,"Hello everyone! I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. I have spent my ENTIRE life learning about psychology to try to understand what happened to me, why, and the effect it has had on me and my life. I spent so much of my life trying to figure these things out and then trying to heal from the traumas. There was a long period of my life where I was just completely miserable, hopeless, angry, scared, worried, sad, hurt, depressed, anxious, and so on…  

I have since turned my life around completely. I started my first business while I was completing school for counselling. At the same time, I was still working through therapy. When I accomplished all I could through therapy, I was in a stable place. I was able to function and survive. However, I still wasn’t living the life I wanted and had no idea HOW to get it.  

This is when I hired my first Business Coach. Working with her, I learned a ton about coaching, an area I knew nothing about. After gaining some different skills through Coaching, I was able to finally pinpoint what it was that I needed after my completion of therapy left me stable, but aimless: a Coach.  

I needed a Coach who had a background in mental health work. I needed a Coach who understood what I was going through, what I had done in therapy, and what I should focus on or work towards next. Unfortunately for me, this type of Coach didn’t yet exist. Instead of this discouraging me, I decided to become this Coach instead.  

I have taken my experience previously working as a Probation Officer, my education and experience in psychology and counselling, and my experience and passion as a survivor of domestic abuse and created a Trauma Informed Life Coaching program. This program empowers survivors of any type of abuse at any point in their lives to break the negative conditioning the abuse as had on them and to create and live a life that is genuinely happy, healthy, and successful.  

I have also created a social media platform associated with my Life Coaching practice to provide as much free information, support, and resources as possible to any and all survivors that are interested (including a 3 day workshop about anxiety):

347,Advice for helping my mental state until I can get health care,"Hello, I apologize in advance if this is not the kind of post for this sub and if it gets too long.

I am a college student from the US. I am struggling with my mental health. I believe that I have ADHD, but I can't get tested/medicated until I finish up the semester in May. I understand that I do not have the ability to diagnose myself so it is possible that I am looking for the answers to my problems in a diagnosis that I do not fit.

I have believed that I have ADHD for a while now, but after taking some amphetamines I feel certain. I don't usually do stuff like that, I am scared of anything and everything. After taking the amphetamine I felt as though I actually had control over my thoughts and I could think about something that I wanted to do and I would actually be able to do it. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but it was effective.

I don't want to go into too much detail because I often can't put my thoughts efficiently into words so I end up overexplaining. I don't even know if my self-prescribed ADHD is relevant to my main issue.

My issue which I need advice for is a sort of attention seeking behavior that I am pursuing. I don't know why I do it, but it happened first in high school where I took all of my medication at once knowing full well that it wouldn't hurt me. I ended up in the hospital after telling my counselor. I was very depressed at the time and I think that I just wanted my parents to pay attention to me (I have 5 siblings and at the time my sister had had my niece so she got most of the attention). It didn't really work or make me feel good.

Now to today's attention seeking behavior: I have decided to basically stop eating or to low restrict. I have dropped nearly 20lbs since January and I am 5 pounds above underweight currently. I have no intention of stopping my new habit until I am underweight. I tell myself that I can easily stop once I  drop below 100lbs (5'2F), and I honestly believe that. The thing is, I also know that my behavior will not get me what I want. I don't even know what I want. Attention? Sympathy? Control? I have no idea.

I don't do a lot of risk-taking behavior. I basically just like to follow all of the rules and I want everyone to like me. To me, I don't quite see this behavior as risk taking because I feel like I am not in danger because I am in control. It's strange how I feel that I control all things in my life even those things that I can't control, yet I cannot even control my thoughts or body enough to do basic things.

If anyone has advice on how to help with invasive thoughts, inability to act on my desires, and reducing the feelings of need for attention, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you to anyone who has read through this. I am usually reclusive even on the internet, but these are unusual times for me. I also apologize if my post seems poorly written or disjointed, my brain is basically full of static apparently."
348,Let’s have a substantive discussion about the effects of isolation and social distancing on mental health in the midst of COVID—19.*,"*️⃣ — I want to preface this post by emphasizing that social distancing is critical to containing COVID-19 in the United States and elsewhere, as are excellent hygiene practices and other scientifically-based recommendations. With social distancing, it’s important for higher-risk **and** “lower-risk” people to socially distance because, keeping community spread in mind, such mitigation tactics become ineffective unless everyone participates.

For some really helpful info on this, check out *The Washington Post*’s reporting: 
- https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/
- https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/10/social-distancing-coronavirus/

But at the same time, social distancing and isolation can have real, deep impacts on people who already struggle with things like depression, social anxiety, and the like, not to mention those in home situations that are, without getting into specifics, rough to be in (especially for long periods of time).

We all want to protect those for whom Coronavirus poses a higher risk — let’s start our conversation with that premise, because among good people, I think that’s true. But a lot of the disruptions to people’s lives have been painful, significant — and the mental and emotional health aspects of how this is hitting us as fellow human beings is really important, too.

So:

Let’s start a discussion about social isolation, social distancing, relationships, and mental and emotional health during this crisis. What are your experiences? Suggestions to mitigate things? The arts? Other conversation topics? 

I’ll moderate this post to add your discussion points. Let’s see where this goes, including how we can connect right now, how we can help each other and others, and what good we can do. 💛"
349,Already low on energy and now everything in state is shutdown,I was already feeling really low lately now my state shutdown everything and I cant do a single thing even if I wanted to. Guess I finally have an excuse just to go back to bed.
350,Sometimes you just have to take care of yourself,"I moved across the country with my friends and signed a year lease.  My female roomate immediately lost her shit and started threatening me with her suicide.  I tried to remain strong and help her but I got roofied at her bday party downtown and she left me alone (I found my way back to the group).  A homeless man almost stabbed me a few weeks later.  I just became a nervous wreck.  My relationship deteriorated with my roommates, and I tried to be reasonable and move out.  I offered to move into the basement to be away from them, even offered 1.5x rent.  I offered to pay half my rent and just move out and find a different place to live.  They told me I had agreed to live there for a year and they would do nothing to help me.

For 2mo I have just stayed in my room while they have used my furniture, television, and kitchen ware (besides some baking dishes and some cups it’s all mine) while I recovered.  I realized in the last week that even though she doesn’t speak to me and ignores me when I’m around, she still sleeps with my duvet and uses my yoga mat to work out.

I contacted a friend from my home town and finally opened up about what was happening.  He also deals with chronic depression and he told me that I just had to take care of myself.  I can’t help them, and I need to help myself.

Well, I’m quitting my job and going to go road trip for 5mo until my lease is up.  It’s the only way I feel I can be happy, recover, and reconnect with people that really love and care for me.  I’m selling my furniture and television and keeping my kitchen ware at a friends house.  I’m leaving nothing useful behind and just using the room as a storage shed.  I’m thinking about removing the shower head so they can’t use the shower in my room, (but your own!).  One of my roomates complained that I was doing ‘everything in my power to inconvenience them.’  I told him I was planning to be homeless for 5mo because they were forcing me to live there (like I’m not being inconvenienced?!), and he responded that this was my fault and I ‘don’t want to take responsibility for myself.’  I’m so excited to leave and have this be over with.

Thankfully I found a couple of great friends who are helping me escape!  I’ve built a sleeping rig in my car, and I’m planning to visit so many people in so many states.  My friends have all been so supportive, and I think this will be a great chance to reflect and reassert that I’m not crazy, and that despite all the gaslighting and entrapment, I am loved and free.

Long story short, I hope they enjoy living in quarantine without a TV and pans."
351,I may have mental issues,"I believe I have mental issues, after dealing with lots of maybe mental scarring events, I've been a very on edge person. People walking behind me fills me with anxiety as if im going to be attacked, Im constantly stressed out to the point of hitting myself in the face, and my anxiety goes through the roof by the thought of being alone without any familiar faces. Usually when i become upset I become filled with pretty dark thoughts. I try to play it off as teenage problems but i feel like its more than that"
352,I need help to move on,"Hi, I'm a female  in my late 20's and I can move on from my past relationship. I was with this guy for 7 years we spoke about marriage, dreams, life goals but he always said like he doesn't like to plan for the future so he broke up with me because I wasn't his crush . He told me like I wasn't wife material,i wasn't feminine enough , other people told me like he only was with me because was easy, we had the same hobbies so for him I was the meanwhile plate. he began to go out with her crush after 1 week and she only use him because she kick him for other guy, so I began to compare my self with her all the time, I felt lost, I felt like I don't know me.
he want a girl thin, with straight hair, cute,feminine , strong, but her crush was manipulative, selfcaring, only wanting the best for her. 

 So for almost a year I was so depressed, I felt ugly , I felt betrayed, I felt like I wasn't enough. I'm still struggling with this in my mind I felt like I wasn't enough, and when I saw me in the mirror I only see an ugly person.

A few friends told me like his crush only use him as a carpet, if she said come here he comes, they told me like that girl ask him to travel two hour to other state  in the night to saw her knowing he needed to work the next day really early, when in our relationship when I ask him if he can gave me a hand to take care of my cat only once a week, when I was far. He always told me like ohh you live really far away, it's exhausting for me to do that. I know this is not my fault, I know he is an asshole , but one part of me still caring for him  and wanted to help him. In my stupid mind, I though if I help him to overpass the obsession with his crush, he will realize the way I feel, but he told me to my face.(I'm not really care about you, I'm not feel guilt).I'm still ""friend"" with this guy but day by day is hard because I'm still loving him but he not and I'm struggling moving on."
353,FaceTiming a Psychiatrist??,"So, some backstory, I’ve been dealing with on/off depressive episodes and general bad mental health for a few years now, and my therapist finally nudged me to go see a psychiatrist. So, I made an appointment one and a half months ago(before the Corona Virus was on people’s minds), but today(the day before my appointment) I just found out the psychiatrist is only seeing people via FaceTime now. 

I know I’m going to sound picky, but I really hate this idea. I’m socially awkward and FaceTime is even worse than face-to-face, and I don’t think I’m going to get the same things across as I would in person. Also, if I’m FaceTiming the Psychiatrist from my house, I’m scared my family is going to overhear me and I’m not going to want to be as honest as I could. But, on the other hand, I’ve waited so long already and I don’t know when they’re going to start seeing patients in person again. 

I guess what I want to know is, would it be stupid of me to cancel in the face of the looming crisis? Or is that more of a reason to go now?"
354,won't be able to see my therapist because of coronavirus,my therapist won't be doing in-person sessions until further notice and i don't think i'll be able to get any privacy at home to talk remotely. anyone else in a similar situation? i really don't know what to do.
355,Tips for healing from PTSD and depression?,"For some context, I (17F) developed PTSD at 13 after a number of events. This may have caused my anorexic behaviour (not sure if I actually was anorexic though) when I was 15 that lasted four months. I went from a healthy 136lbs for my height to 102lbs. I always had mild to severe depression but this really increased at 16, along with what I have been told by psychiatrists and counsellors is a bit of anxiety. The PTSD and depression I am sure of as I am on antidepressants, whereas the anorexia and anxiety are somewhat unconfirmed as I have recovered from my damaging eating habits and am not convinced that I am anxious enough to officially have anxiety.

My question is, having suffered from these various conditions, how can I move forward? I am going to counselling, keeping in touch with friends, keeping up hobbies and going on daily walks, meditating and praying. Although I'd love to hear how survivors of these conditions have ploughed through? What advice would you give to a younger person going through this? Thanks!"
356,I think I have Separation Anxiety Disorder,"I get scared in school frequently about if something happens to my mum. I also feel safe only when around her and my Teddy bear, Bessie. I am 13, Male, and I live in Wales. Any tips on who I should see, what I should do, etc? BTW I am also being tested (not diagnosed yet) for Aspergers."
357,"Rest of the school year is cancelled, what do I do about therapy?","I can't afford to go to another person near me house, that and I don't know if I'd want to start over with someone new.

358,"My Girlfriend has some mental health issues, and refuses to get help. I need advice on how to convince her of the problem.","Me and my partner have been together for a little over 6 months. I love her dearly and she is like a best friend to me. I've noticed that over the course of our relationship that she has had violent and ""strange"" episodes. She sometimes forgets where she is, how she got there, and what she did that day. She forgets a lot of the time we have spent together and on one occasion she put her hands around my neck and attempted to strangle me, but she stopped after a few seconds. That was at the start of our relationship and since then she has not put her hands on me, although what made the occasion worse was that she had acted like nothing happend then she started to cry. I'm really at a loss in our relationship because there are sometimes when she gets really depressive and there are sometimes when she is really at ease and to be honest its quite jarring. This is not at all the stable relationship I want nor need. I've gotten her doctors and I've asked her numerous times to go but she has refused each time. I really dont know what to do and I'm not sure who to ask for help. If anyone has any advice on how to either get her to go or what my next step should be, then please give me some advice."
359,I don't feel anything,"So i don't know if this belongs here but...
So i've noticed lately that I dont feel anything very strongly. I'm a very bubbly person, always talking and joking with anyone that is near me. I just don't feel anything like sadness, happiness (other than having fun with friends, but that also doesn't last long) or nervousness
I have not had crushes in years, altought I know I'm not asexual or anything. I don't have any suicidal thougths, altought i have cut myself for hurting other people. My family is loving and caring so its nothing about childhood trauma either. I just wanted to share this as I said before I'm not sure if this belongs here. Thank you reading this far &lt;3"
360,Why do I stress for no reason,"Whenever I try to read a book, which I regard as benefitial, my stress levels instantly activate for no damn reason. I fucking hate my circumstances. No one is there to speak to: only to argue, debate and fight until one gets the advantage over the other. I hate this life which I call hell. My mind is so messed up."
361,Struggling with people’s ignorance,"Ever since a certain Youtuber’s video claiming to have DID, I’ve seen an increase in people commenting about the disorder itself being fake and that all the medical research is inconclusive, and that everyone who claims to have it is faking. I commented on a commentary video on the topic expressing my support for the woman that was called “crazy” in the original video, and received a reply saying that the she is faking it. This comment went on to say that any mental health professional that can’t find a cure for mental illnesses knows nothing about mental illness. I tried explaining that there is really no “cure” for mental illnesses in the technical sense and I was berated and told I’m uneducated and not using logic. This person was so condescending and kept calling me “hun” and “buttercup”.

I’m struggling with this rise in ignorance regarding mental health. I knew that people like this existed, I suppose, but never had a direct conversation with someone about it. And frankly it makes me feel like shit. It makes me feel like the fact that I struggle every single day and probably for most of my life means that I’m a failure, uneducated, and simply doing something wrong. This person truly believes mental illnesses are simply to be cured, and that a mental health professional’s role is to cure, otherwise they don’t know what they’re doing. And they treated me as if I was stupid and uneducated for disagreeing with them. I know it was just one person, but it has caused me to doubt myself, and it is difficult to see this attitude in action, even going so far as to claim that someone with a disorder stemming from severe childhood abuse is faking it. 

Thanks for reading, I needed to get this out."
362,Feeling hopeless and depressed during this pandemic.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi, everyone. This may not entirely be a post about Narcissism but more on mental health.

I know at this moment, I am not alone in my feelings of worry and uncertainty. But I already feel like these next few months are going to be very hard for me. During these times, I know that sacrifice is becoming important as we begin to understand how important social distancing is.

I have seen my favorite sports league being postponed and my favorite late-night show going off air- and everyone knows that it could be months until life gets back to normal. I know that there are more important things in life and at this moment, a sports game and a comedy show have become second to whatever we as people are facing. I fully understand that, I support all the suspensions and urge everyone to stay home and social distance- it's a no-brainer. I would give up everything if it meant it would save someone's life.

But, that doesn't mean it's easy for me. I have just lost the presence of two of the best things in my life and how I would cope through the hardships in my day to day life. For more background info:

I had to push off going to college and cannot drive- I failed my tests so many times and have no job. Due to this, I am home all day with very little outside contact. Although the new norm has become staying at home, not going outside and postponing everything- even though it looks like this should be easy for me because this was my life pre-pandemic but for some reason, it seems hard.

I feel hopeless. I feel like this is just an extension of everything that I have been through. I was making progress, I was going therapy and we were discussing my new dreams and plans. I honestly don't mean to sound selfish- I know all the other sacrifices people are having to make. It just feels like this pandemic confirms all the hopelessness and grief I feel. My friend shares stories of what's it's like for her and she talks about playing Nintendo Switch with her boyfriend to ward off the boredom, my brothers are downloading games and playing to their hearts' content. I see people online homeschooling their kids, people playing around with marbles to fill the absence of sports. Others are binging on Netflix or devouring the pages of books.

Me? I'm afraid I don't know how to cope. I had such a hard time pre-pandemic being isolated so I don't think I know how to cook during it. For me, it's not just about being bored at home, for me it's the revival of a few years of a harsh reality. I've just worked hard to recover from the trauma that I've suffered through last year...I don't know how I am going to cope now. My dreams feel null and void..I can't even being to think of what my future my look like after this. I honestly don't even want to go to therapy."
363,I don't know how I'm gonna make it through the COVID-19 lockdown,"It's the fifth day of school lockdown in my country. It's supposed to last two weeks, but there are more and more cases of the virus being confirmed, so they'll probably extend it.
I don't have any close friends, but meeting people at school and talking to acquaintances daily kept me feeling okay. Now I'm alone. The only human contact I have is with my family. I feel like I'm already going crazy, and it's not even the worst part.
When we go back to school in April (hopefully), we'll have two weeks at most before our final exams, and then the year will end. College/university starts in October. That five-month break scares me. I don't want to be alone again."
364,Need some advice - Experiences with counselling?,"First time posting on this sub, so apologies if this is the wrong one! 

Ok so a bit of backstory:  

Over the past 18 months or so, I go through phases of having really low moods where I believe I have no future and that nobody likes me and I convince myself I am useless so then I make myself feel awful. With that I have an overwhelming urge to run away and start a new life. 

Then a few days later I feel perfectly fine and content again. 

Anyway, I was referred to councelling but I chickened out when it actually came to making the appointment but now I'm willing to consider going for it.
 
What was your first appointment like and what could I expect if I pluck up the courage to go? (Atmosphere wise)

How would I know if I've made the right decision in going?

What would be a red flag?

Sorry it's a long post! Apologies if it's not in the right sub! 

Thanks in advance"
365,"Hi, I need an advice","I am using the Google translator because I am not very good with English. I decided to use Reddit because I have seen that many people ask questions like these anonymously in this app. I have a schizoaffective disorder and lately I have not been able to have an appointment with my psychiatrist or psychologist. I have taken my medication as it should be, and I have tried to avoid stressful situations; But despite that my hallucinations do not leave me alone, I can not sleep without having nightmares and I do not stop feeling miserable and wanting to cry for no reason.What am I supposed to do in situations like this? I'm desperate. Any advice? Thanks."
366,COVID-19 is really affecting my mental health and I don't know what to do.,"I've struggled with depression for years. Took breaks from school, gone through periods when I've done nothing but stay in bed all day. Failed many courses as a result. Terrible hygiene, binge eating, completely messy room.  Feeling completely hopeless about the future. Basically all the hallmark symptoms.  

 However I recently started doing so much better. I moved out of my parents finally into a student house. (the environment was very toxic but I was so afraid to move out because I thought the lack of accountability from them would make me worse). I started university again and developed a really set routine: Wake up every morning 7:30, shower, make breakfast, go to class. Study. I slept no later than 12:00. I started volunteering at multiple places. I cooked ALL my meals. I started to reconnect with friends I isolated myself from for years.  I was doing well academically. I even filed a petition to remove some of  my failed grades from my transcript. I was talking regularly to a counsellor and we actively were working on making good friends and getting out of my bubble. 

And then suddenly in the past week it seems like my whole life started crashing down. NBA (I'm a big fan)- cancelled. In person classes-cancelled, All my volunteering-cancelled. All the gyms-cancelled.  All the extracurricular activities I was in-cancelled. My church-cancelled. Even the public library is cancelled. All of my roommates were returning home so our house was empty and I was basically forced by my parents to come home. Now I'm essentially being forced to stay inside all the time. I honestly feel like everything I've worked so hard to maintain is falling apart. I have no chance of making friends now when nobody is even leaving their house.   But it's hard to express this to people without feeling like I'm complaining or being selfish. I've randomly burst into tears in the past few days. Just when I started doing well and thinking positively about my life and my future it seems like it was all snatched away. 

I had plans to also take classes during the spring term at my school (the spring term starts in May) but I don't even know if this will all be over by then. Trump literally just said on tv this could last until July or August. I feel like my life is over. 

For so long I avoided headlines about COVID-19. I even blocked words related to it on my twitter because I didn't want to surrounded myself with the hysteria and panic and I thought it was no big deal and people were overreacting. And now I can't avoid it. My parents constantly have the news on talking about it. It's all anyone is talking about around me. We visit a family friend yesterday and it was all they were talking about. I feel like I honestly don't know what to do. I know it seems dramatic but it always seems like something starts going wrong in my life when I start doing better. 

I'm just venting. I don't have anyone to talk to."
367,How do I deal with Mental Illness tearing my family apart?,"First of all, disclaimers: 1. Throwaway account because of the sensitive nature of what I'm discussing, 2. I apologize if this is not the place to be asking or the tone to be asking in, I'm just really desperate. 3. Sorry about the length, I know it's a monster of a post. There is a TL;DR at the bottom and I tried to cut as much as I could, but years had to be condensed to sentences, here, and there was only so much I could cut. I really, truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it.

Here we go: I live at home with a parent just after graduating grad school while trying to get my feet under me. My older sibling recently moved in with us as well. My older sibling has severe ADHD, OCD, Bipolar, and a number of other conditions. My sibling is unable to preform simple task like cleaning up after themselves, and will stay in their room for days on end before exploding out into the world and spending unfathomable amounts of money. My sibling has *no* income and the family ends up paying for this. My sibling has already cost the family over $100,000 that, frankly, we don't have to spare. Crucial repairs have been put off, trips canceled, lifestyle changes have been made to accommodate my sibling financially.

Money is one thing, but on top of this, my sibling has turned the house into an active minefield. My parent and I were cohabiting without much friction, but with my sibling here, every word is spoken with deliberate care in fear that we will trigger one of my sibling's conditions. A single stray word from my parent can *and* has lead to arguments that have lead to fights that lead to shrieking, crying, brutal verbal battles that I have to moderate in hopes of, if not diminishing the damage done, at least absorbing some so it can be spread around evenly. It feels like living with an abusive relationship in the house that everyone is afraid to step on and set off.

But, I know that this is not my sibling. I remember my sibling before this condition became so severe, and my sibling was a bundle of warmth and light and life. A genius, who conquered every interest, a master programmer, brilliant musician, talented artist, clever, witty, full of joy and a zest for life that is unmatched in anyone I have ever known. I know it's the fault of mental illness, but... knowing that doesn't make the money less spent. It doesn't make the verbal body blows land any softer. It doesn't make it any easier to look in on my parent after they fight and see them look up at me with tears in their eyes and ask ""I'm a good parent, aren't I? I don't know how to help them. I don't know what to do.""

My sibling is trying. They see two therapists and a psychiatrist. He is on countless medications. But his conditions have been deteriorating for years and nothing seems to help. I love my sibling so much and I just feel so, so powerless and I don't know how much longer this can go on. So please, if anyone has any advice, has experienced anything similar, has any insights or resources or can help in any way, I am truly desperate. Thank you so much for reading.

*TL;DR*: My sibling's mental illness is putting unsustainable emotional and financial strain on my family, and I am utterly lost in the darkness on how to proceed.

*PS:* I know, especially when there is one person around whom the conflict swirls, Reddit like to give the advice to ""Get this person out of your life."" We have tried to ""Cut my sibling off"" before and it ended when we found my sibling living with several hard-drug users in a rat-infested concrete basement of an apartment, out of meds and depressed to the point of attempting suicide. I truly believe removing my sibling from our lives will kill them, and I don't think my family will survive that."
368,how can i speed up my grieving process??,"my great grandmother very recently died and im VERY worried now. I cry every single day thinking about her and sometimes ive even cut myself, but now im scared about my school life. i still have a week left of spring break but after that i dont know what im gonna do. im mainly worried about the german classes, so far i know for sure that im going to due since even now when even thinking about a little german song she used to sing me i start balling my eyes out. I doubt that ill be any better than i am now a week later, i dont want to humiliate myself in the middle of class by starting to bawl my eyes out, but i also cant just excuse myself in the middle of class just to go cry because my teacher would be suspicous and i dont that bitches pitty.  So please tell me, how do i speed up the grieving process or how do i atleast help calm myself down when these shitty moments come up??? please help."
369,I believe my mom has some psychological problems,"Ever since I was a kid, or at least since i was 8-9 she always believed people were ""going into our house"" while we were out (it was just her and me, absent father) and I even remember her going to our next-door neighbour's house to yell at them once, convinced they were, as I said, ""going into our house"". It continued on to this day, with me being 19 year old now, still living with her. We've moved countless times, and the same delusion happens in every place. The specifics of it are: she think people are ""stealing her documents"" and are out to destroy her life basically. She believes neighbours are in on it, family (who she doesn't talk to) and even me. Well she isn't specifically accusing me of ""letting people get inside"", but she asks me once in a while ""Was anyone here today?"" when she comes home, sometimes says stuff like ""Remember, don't let anyone inside"". As you can guess, this means I don't bring friends inside, she doesn't bring friends inside, and I have to stay home while she's out (unless it's for work or school) because she wants someone to be in the apartment ""so someone doesn't come in"".

 Anyway, writing all this has been cathartic, as I don't have any close friends to say it to and it was basically my ""dirty little secret"" for as long as I have known that there's something wrong with her. Sometimes I also probably repress it, choose to not think about it. But it has, combined with her general distrust of people, made an impact in my life.

 Anyway n.2, I'm stuck with her until I move out, and right now I'm planning to go to college, so that's not happening anytime soon- if anyone has advice for coping with this, similar experiences etc., don't hesitate to drop a comment. 

Also, sorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit, I'm happy to move my post somewhere more appropriate if so."
370,How to stop overreacting,"In my relationship I always end up overreacting, and acting out even though I dont want to and it's at the point where it's hurting my relationship severely.

Just got a place together but I'm always afraid he's going to find someone else or better and so I always get upset and think he's going to leave. I also take things to heart right away and get super defensive.
I try to stop but then I overthink until I get angry and then I don't mean to take it out on him but I do.

I feel horrible and I'm unsure on what do to. The past few months we have gone through a lot, so I feel it might be due to stress but things are going good and yet I still act out."
371,Any other military members experience this..I cant take it much longer,"I used to be fine. Could be normal and I could drink and not lose my shit. But just after getting out things changed..it keeps getting worse, I don't drink anymore (except this weekend bc I thought I could handle it) but I've become anti social.. might have 3 friends. Ik shit from the army messed with me but when will it stop? I now cant move on from a past love and it came to a head this weekend after months of not talking, all it took was one look into her eyes and I was a bottle deep, railing lines, all while writing ""your not enough"" on the bathroom sink mirror in my blood. I hate this but I like the pain it's the only thing that has felt real in a very long time. I have no idea who I have become."
372,Extreme perception,"I’ve always been way too perceptive. I could always feel what other people feel. The worst part is that I get connected to people and they connect to me. For example, I wanted to drink something but I didn’t say anything (I didn’t even look at that bottle) and that guy handed me a bottle of water. Some time later I wanted to hug him, but he hugged me first. I also remember we sat at his place in silence. He didn’t seem sad. And at that exact moment I thought how beautiful it could be to see a man crying. Beautiful- because he trusts you so much he can show you his vulnerability. And at this moment he started to tell me about his father and how he abused his mother. And then he started to cry. I was really shocked because how could this be possible?

And it’s always like that with dudes who I really like and they like me. 
But the thing is I met someone who i connected to on a very weird level. Whenever I’m happy he’s anxious. Whenever he’s happy I’m anxious. And the worst part is, the happier he is, the worse my anxiety gets. It’s so scary. I don’t want to depend on that person’s feelings! How do I get out? I tried dating some people but they don’t really attract me I don’t like them and the don’t like me. How do I disconnect?"

374,Am I a failure for leaving college to better my mental health?,"I can’t go to school anymore. It’s killing my mental health. I was doing fine until I started this one class, the professor grades unfairly, somehow my grade dropped from 100% to a 63% from missing just one assignment. I’ve turned in 100% completed work but it only brings my grade up 2%. If I fail this class fafsa won’t cover for me anymore and I don’t have the money to continue going next year if they drop me. 

I know i’ll be disappointing my family and my boyfriend &amp; his family. Everyone in my life has very high standards surrounding college, they all think that if I don’t go I won’t be successful &amp; won’t make good money for my future. I want to be able to pay my bills without asking for help &amp; would like to work a better job than right now but I genuinely can’t stay in school anymore without wanting to die. 

Does anyone have advice or a success story of them leaving college? Thank you in advance."
375,"Psychiatry is a pseudoscience, they poison us. Nothing is real, I need to escape the living hell, but they keep stopping me. Why must We be forced to suffer?","Crazy to think everything you see are some neurons firing off to your brain. Nothing even matters, because nothing is real. I am in a living hell, ever heard of the astral plane? Stacked on stacked. Layers of reality.

And I'm trapped in my own personal hell.

Torment. Misery. Agony. Rage. Bitterness. It never ends. My soul is rotting, festering. Seething with hate.

HATE.

Is this my punishment? what have I done? The demon will never stop, I suffocate.

And you know what he says? Escape.

What you call ""suicide"".

You see, I am aware. You may think I'm not, but I am. The ""psychiatry"" industry, knowing we can expose them, drug and imprison us for speaking out. The ""mentally ill"" Even at hospitals they sneak poison into the food, but I am awake, I do not eat it.

We, We are just Guinness pigs for the government. It's torture, I guarantee MK-Ultra is still in place as we speak.

You've even brainwashed a full population of ~~people~~ victims into thinking happiness is more than a mere delusion.

You people disgust me."
376,How to make time feel longer?,"Not sure how to phrase this question..
So basically I work 7am-5pm. I don't get home from work until about 6pm. At this point I eat dinner, scroll through social media, then go to bed so I can repeat early the next morning.
Work is starting to feel like an endless cycle with no breaks. How do I make my time after work in the afternoon feel longer and more productive? I guess I'm struggling with work-life balance and it's destroying my mental health."
377,I wanna go back to my old high school and attack the son of a bitch who harassed me,"I’m 17 years old and I changed schools due to a mental breakdown. 

However, during my time at this school this guy named kyrie, a very fucking obnoxious skinny black kid with a big ego who thinks they’re tough harassed me in school. 

One time he even got his friends to harass me while I was talking to a friend. and one of them tapped my chest and another got close to my face and called me a pussy. 
I got angry and swung at him... but I missed... he dodged my punch. 

I felt so fucking embarrassed and humiliated that i developed a grudge against this guy and his friends

I’ve been feeling so worthless and angry and filled with hatred that I cannot stop thinking of hurting this motherfucker. I don’t even care if I go to Jail Or get killed. I hate myself because I’m a coward, I’m not intelligent, or talented, I’m not funny or charming or anything worthy of taking notice of.

I plan to wear a mask, being a baseball bat, and filled a Bucket with feces mixed with water, vomit, and rotten eggs. 

I plan to wait till school ends and when he comes out, I’ll pour the bucket over his head and attack him with the baseball bat. My immense hatred and anger fuels my motivation and once school starts again I’m gonna go through with it."
378,Want to vent,So I’ve been away from home the past 20months travelling and having fun not worrying about anything... feel good... I got back a few weeks ago and I’ve been looking for an apprenticeship and work until my apprenticeship begins... I’ve picked up smoking and drinking (both heavily) every night since being back. I’ve had really bad mood swings and I don’t know what to do about it. I know drinking away the problems isn’t the way but when I lay in bed alone at night my body falls into the same loop and without hesitation I pick up the bottle... I was so happy but now that reality has caught up with me I want to end it all... I felt this way before I left... also one of the reasons I left... but I can’t keep on running away from my problem but I can’t face them head on... idk
379,"is there a difference between chronic depression, major depression, and clinical depression?","i've been trying to find out the difference, but i can't. i know symptoms and such can overlap, but i can't find anything that clearly compares them. anybody up to help?"
380,I’m not very good at just being myself,"I apologize for the flair-less title, but I can’t think of a better one at the moment. I think this year has been one of the worst for my mental health that I’ve ever had. I started dating this boy in August. Everything has been really good. He’s very kind, loving, and understanding and he tries to help me the best he can. We always throw witty conversation back and forth and we play argue a lot because that’s just how our personalities are. Well, he’s very smart and witty and good at a lot of things. My last boyfriend wasn’t really like he is (not really intelligent) and I think it makes me feel like I’m less than him. I constantly think that I need to be more witty and come up with interesting things to say. I always feel the need to be better and sometimes it gets to the point where I get mad at myself and feel stupid because I can’t do something he does. My patience is wearing for some reason as well. I feel cornered when I get simple criticism from someone and I always blow things out or proportion. There’s a voice in my head that constantly ridicules myself and it’s not just with my boyfriend, it’s with everyone. I think I have very low self esteem and a underlying need to better everyone else. Maybe even anger issues. I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through this or what they did to try and get out of those negative mindsets. I don’t want to be a toxic person and I hope it’s good that I recognize these things so I can work on them. I just want to be the best I can be and accept myself for who I am. Any input would be widely appreciated. Thank you so much!"
381,I feel as though my destiny is suicide.,"Every day the call of the nothing wraps its acrid tendrils around me, the demon whispers sweet fallacies into my brain. I can never escape unless I follow. You see, I know the truth about psychiatry.

Pseudoscientist, we are their guinea pigs to experiment on. Keeping me alive just to watch me suffer.

Regurgitating useless fallacies and platitudes before locking is away in abusive prisons of hell.

Testing poisons on us, tied down and injected, the sharp burn and tingle of the needle. 

Brainwashing others that everything is okay, that they only want to help. Even the victims of psychiatry follow along like blind sheep. 

when WE are the only aware ones.

Hands wrap around me, pulling me under the dark water once more. But I follow, I come to peace. I will take my own life.

The heavy black wave crushing me. I am tormented, destroyed, bitter, miserable.

Help? HELP?? There is no help. 

Layers stacked on layers of reality. 

The simulation is tricking them all, I can't believe it. But others have, labeled as ""crazy"" and such.

The puppeteer must have a reason I've been chosen to find out, maybe I will meet him on the other side, which will come soon. 

My destiny is my near demise."
382,Maybe I just dont like myself. What do I do?,"I assume people are lying to me when they compliment me, I dont see why my boyfriend loves me, I feel annoying and when I see my reflection I think I look like those kind of people that everyone hates because they are weirdly narcissistic, idk I feel like I just have a hateable look. My friend told me I'm funny, but I feel like alot of the time my jokes are taken negatively and maybe I'm just annoying everyone. I wish that I could be someone else who was actually cool and relaxed. I feel like I'm really needy and my anxious tendencies make me annoying to my friend group because they will constantly leave me behind while I have to take my time or I'll get anxious and overwhelmed. I wish I could just force myself into submission of not being anxious anymore, I've literally tried beating myself on the arms and legs to try to build up a negative connotation of being anxious so I wouldnt do it anymore, and I guess as punishment because I should just be chill and not be so needy. When I look at my face in the mirror I literally feel like I look like a deformed monster despite people telling me I look attractive? And as soon as I have to be alone with my thoughts I'm just disgusted and annoyed by what I find. 

How can I change myself genuinely??"
383,Can't concentrate/function and I don't know what is wrong.,"So over the past few years, I have had increasing difficulty concentrating and focusing in school and at home. Most of the time I'm scribbling on my book or thinking about some random shit or fidgeting. At home, I usually can't sleep cause I am constantly thinking about more random shit, or I get distracted and end up doing something like reading or making music until 3 am. Sometimes I also get really excited or worked up and my brain just goes into annoy everyone mode and I can't turn it off. I now don't really care for much to do with school, and I am not really engaged by any of it. My interests are always shifting and changing and I have no idea what I'm going to do when I get out of school. I think maybe I have had this problem for a while, however primary school and the early years of high school aren't as tough and don't require as much work. 

So I'm in my last year of school and my attendance is shit and my marks have also gone to shit. However, my parents and everyone around me just keep telling me to just try harder and concentrate, which is becoming pretty fucking hard to do. I told my mum, who I can usually talk to about stuff, that I want to see someone about it, however, she just keeps blaming it on my phone or eating sugar. While this could be a contributing factor, I see many people my age with worse problems with both, who have no trouble at all.

To sum it up, I feel like I am trapped in my own thoughts half the time and don't really give a shit about most things at school. I'm from Australia btw."
384,Computer use,"Not sure if this the right place for this but has anyone experienced the effect of computers on your personality and sociability and mood?

I used to be a computer addict like 8-12 hours a day video games or poker or whatever. I took a complete binge of computers. I only now use computers as part of my sales job which is quite social in nature.

I have a deep phobia of the computer and internet and what it can do to my personality and extroversion.

Can anyone relate?

Is there science behind this?

Should I be worried that by using a computer or screen for 6 hours a day will change my personality, make me less social, and unattractive?

I literally am thinking don’t use screens as much as possible unless needed for a job or messaging something already planned to someone as extreme as this sounds.

I’ve personally found myself to be more happy the less screen time I have and the more I love my “life”.

What should I do?

Are my thoughts bullshit and just anxiety thoughts or is there a lot of basis to it and I should give them heed? I’m really confused."

386,"I'm fighting urges to act out in anger right now at an uninvited guest (family friend) whose stay coincided with the Coronavirus outbreak, and now we can't ask him to leave. My mental health is taking a huge hit right now.","**Sorry if this is** ***so, so*** **long. I have literally nowhere else I can express this because too many people are relying on me to be their rock right now.**

It feels like 3 weeks was a long time ago after being in the house for 2 of them, but a little over 3 weeks before today, it was just my boyfriend, my dog and I in our little duplex. This was before the virus had even left Wuhan and no one saw it as something that serious. I was working on a promotion at my job, and my boyfriend was working on getting into a programming bootcamp like I got into to do what I do for a living.

But then my boyfriend's childhood best friend (I'll call him Brice) came to live with us. He was only supposed to stay with us for 3 days, but Brice is a known moocher. Since my SO was 20 (he's turning 29 this year) Brice has couch-hopped living in place to place. I was homeless for 3 years from 17 to 20 (I am freshly 23) so I would totally empathize with this if it weren't for the fact that he lives with people with no intent to actually get a job, and kind of sneaks his way into people's homes and lives. For example, 2 years ago, Brice was living in another part of our state, but asked if he could come stay with my SO's family for the holidays. Brice and my SO have been friends since they were 5, so they were more than happy to have him. He was supposed to stay for 3 days, but instead, he stayed for 4, then 5, then 6... after almost a week, they politely asked when he'd be going home, and he revealed to them that his dad kicked him out. He knew this the entire time he stayed over, and while asking if he could stay ""for the holidays"" because he knew that they wouldn't turn him away if he said that. He also ate food without paying for anything, made messes, and never cleaned (rarely showered).

Again, you may go, ""Okay, well the guy was homeless. Cut him some slack."" I would have (because being homeless can lead many people to do desperate things to survive) if it weren't for the fact that for literally 3 weeks, while everyone was at work, he'd sit on the couch and browse Facebook, for 8 hours. My SO's parents were about to kick him out, because he's done this sort of thing for years. And for years, my SO's family and friends have passed this guy around, making him someone else's problem. He asked back then if he could come and live with us the day my SO's parents were kicking him out, and I told him no. I gave his friend a talk, and told him, ""Brice, I've been homeless before, and I'm going to give you a warning: If you keep doing this stuff into your 30s, no one is going to have a lick of sympathy for you. You're going to lose all of your friends, because you'll become known as the guy who shows up and makes himself comfortable and won't leave. You need to start doing something different with your life before you assume you can crash on someone else's couch and find that no one you know will have you, or want to be around you.""

Fast-forward to today: He asked if he could stay with us for 3 days, we said yes. This time, things were different because he'd been keeping a job for about half a year, even getting a promotion. He had an apartment with friends, but his two roomates were unable to pay their rent, so he needed a place to crash. We knew that him staying long-term was out of the question, because my boyfriend and I's relationship has been on the rocks, and we cannot handle managing a grown adult doing the things they need to do as well as ourselves. Brice claimed that he was coming to our place with a plan -- he had a friend a few towns over that said he could stay with him and help him get a job where he worked. He just needed a few days 'til he didn't have a night shift and he could drive the 2 hours to come and pick him up.

Surprise, his friend didn't come. We have reasons to believe (that I won't go into here for brevity's sake) that he knew his friend wasn't coming. He figured that we wouldn't turn him away. We were pissed, and we confronted him about it. We gave him a week to get a legitimate plan together or he would be homeless. The point that I warned Brice about had come -- everyone in my SO's family had been avoiding speaking to Brice because they heard he was coming into town and absolutely *no one* wants him in their house. No one wants him mooching, drinking up all the beer, smoking all the weed, eating all the food, etc. without remotely attempting to get a job and getting too comfortable. When it became clear that Brice was not taking our promise to kick him out at the end of the week seriously, I decided to do something that no one who has housed him has done: I gave him a resource. While it is absolutely Brice's fault for not being a freaking adult and solving his own issues, I do put some blame on the people that he's stayed with (my SO and his family). No one told him how much of a burden he was, and frequently acted like it was totally fine that he was staying, and would let him stay for WEEKS without any signs of change. They basically just let him stay until he was tired, and then kicked him out. I told him that he had an ultimatum of going to one of these programming bootcamps (or any other training program) or he'd be on the street.

So he finally started kind of taking things seriously. I took him to the foodstamps office to get them (I've had them multiple times) and was literally there with him for 5 hours. I took a gift certificate that I was given for Christmas at a shoe store and bought him a $60 pair of shoes because his had a hole in the bottom. I've sat with him and had talks with him about his future.  He found a good programming bootcamp, blew their skills assessment out of the water, and called up his father, who was actually more than happy to have him move in with them if he actually had a plan and a school that he was attending. His father is a senior dev in another state, and told him he would be happy to help him get a job.

Everything seemed fine... but then his dad told him that he should wait a week to see ""What's going on with this whole Coronavirus thing"" before he comes over.

And the rest is history. We're in our *fourth week* after him only having supposed to have been here for 3 days. He has various mental health issues, and while I have them too, he uses them to excuse why he shouldn't do things that he needs to do. I told him he needed to come with us to shop for quarantine provisions (food in the case that we have to lock ourselves in) before people started panic buying. My SO and I went and there were only 4 other people in the line that we were in. They all had full carts but it wasn't hard at all. He KEPT ON putting it off until the last possible minute until I literally demanded he go, and we get to the store and there is a line from the front of this warehouse store to the back. I'd successfully self-quarantined for two weeks because I can work from home, but had to go into an extremely crowded store because this adult didn't want to ""make himself anxious"" by going shopping, and he ""avoids the news"" because it ""makes him anxious"". Because apparently, it's my job to make sure everyone in this house has food. So even though I properly prepared, I ended up having to partake in these crowds because of this guy.

He's doing better, actually taking charge of his life and studying programming before his classes start. It seems like it's sparking a passion in him. But right now, it's the little things that are really, really putting me on edge in an already-stressful time. I'm fucking tired of not being able to walk around my house naked. Or to have hushed conversations about serious topics with my boyfriend. Or having to have him close the fucking door after he takes a shit because it makes the rest of the house smell like his shit. I'm tired of all of this happening amidst people questioning me how bad this virus is all the way up until the last minute to go shopping or to take precautions. On top of all of that, it's little stuff my boyfriend is doing, that I would totally be able to be okay with if I didn't have a whole third person to babysit. My SO is tired coming home from work, so I have been washing all of our dishes (not Brice's) and I work customer support right now(I work at a startup, so I have more than one job), so I literally have nothing but rich people complaining to me all day, and then coming home to making sure that Brice isn't suddenly becoming lazy, and that my boyfriend isn't pissing on the seat. I had to write Brice an itinerary the first week he was here to make sure that he didn't just sit in the guest room and play video games, which he does if you don't renew one for him every few days.

What I guess I'm saying is, I feel like I'm a mom right now. Like two people depend on me to keep things copasthetic, along with the whiny people at work, along with the fact that I'm the one comforting everyone around me that we can get through this ""whole pandemic thing"", because I'm from New Orleans and I've literally been through Katrina, and 3 other difficult hurricanes, as well as 3 years of homelessness. I've been without food. I've been without resources. And I still made it. And now I make enough money where if my boyfriend has to quit his job doing construction in the city to stop him from getting exposed then I can do it. But I feel like no one is doing anything extra to take a load off of my back right now. I was supposed to celebrate my birthday with friends at the end of this month, but I can't, because everything is shutting down.

I'm grateful to have gainful employment. I'm grateful to even be a part of a company whose sales are somehow going up *because* of this epidemic. But I'm still fucking stressed. I'm so, so tired. And the whole time, I'm being conscientious of Brice's (someone that is absolutely no family of mine) feelings and helping him get his life together, because even though he was a mooch, to be fair, no one has ever helped him get things together. But it's hard, because when I was homeless, I almost never had anyone to stay with. No one cared about me or did what I'm doing for him to help. And the few people that did, I certainly didn't piss it away by moaning about how I don't ""feel"" like looking for work. I am literally fighting not letting this all out on him right now because it wouldn't be right to do so, but I have nowhere else to express this. I can't go to a spa right now. I can't go get a drink. I can't do anything and my mental health, which was soaring from finally having gainful employment and climbing out of poverty, is taking a hit right now. And now, more than ever, I can't even express it."

388,A story telling poem about my experience with Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia 


I’ve got so many voices inside my head,
my Schizophrenia’s keeping them fed,
I’m starting to feel lost within myself,
think I’m turning into someone else.


I’m always planning my escape,
before my brain can escalate.

“I can’t find it,
where’s the door?
I don’t think we’ve been here before.”


Fight or flight is kicking in,
I can feel it in my skin.
My heart is pounding through my chest,
what is this?
I feel possessed.


“They’re out to get you,
stay at home,
you know it’s best to leave them alone.”

I can feel the panic taking over,
struggle keeping my composure,
start to shake uncontrollably,
I think the demons got ahold of me.


I’ve tried to drown them out,
but my head is in a drought,
my mind goes blank,
I’m in a daze,
somehow my body operates.


What was that?
I heard the door.

“Maybe you should go explore.” 

The hallucinations are back again,
no one’s there,
there had never been.


It’s okay,
I’m not crazy,
things are just a little hazy.

“Who are you kidding?
You’re so deranged,
stop walking around like anything’s changed!”


I just want to make my family proud,
but these voices are getting so loud,
they push me down,
to the ground,
I think I hear them laughing now. 

What’s so funny?

“It’s a game,
if you want to win you’ve got to play,
so pick a card and roll the dice,
Maybe tomorrow we’ll be nice.”

I picked a card,
they flipped The Fool,
I guess that means I’m just a tool,
a vessel meant for them to rule.
Which means tomorrow they’ll still be here,
emphasizing my every fear.

“Just close your eyes,
and relinquish your mind,
it’s time for you to say goodbye,
put that gun to your head,
we’ll be gone once your mind is dead.”

I’ve got the gun,
now there’s one in the chamber,
but let me leave you with this one disclaimer.

When I pulled the trigger,
my body collapsed,
then somewhere between life and death overlapped,
and my demons found their way through the cracks.

Now everything’s dark,
and it’s so damn scary,
I’m trapped with my demons,
in solitary."
389,In need of some help from mental health experts,I have a list of mental problems that i need answers to its driving me nuts please someone who is a professional please post on this
390,An honest Crisis Text Line review from a volunteer.,"I made a review of Crisis Text Line incase anyone is wondering what it's like to use the service.

Crisis Text Line is a suicide/crisis hotline that operates through text messages. I actually volunteered to work for them for a little while and used them a lot. As a result, I decided to give them an honest review. Please let me know if it is helpful for any of you guys.

https://www.thebipolarschizophrenic.com/reviews/crisis-text-line-review/"
391,There are so many things wrong with me.,"How I would describe myself:

Looks:
- Ugly.
- 2.5/10.
- Tall/long face.
- I look like Greta Thunberg.

Personality:
- Controlling.
- Moody.
- Weird.
- Selfish (at least according to my parents).

Things I do on a daily basis:
- Redo stuff. Everything needs to be equal/even and feel right. This text is taking so long to write cause I have to rewrite it if I make a mistake.
- I cough 24/7. I think it’s a tic or something, I don’t really know.
- I zone out pretty often. I usually do this multiple times during the day, most often when I redo stuff.

I really don’t like self diagnosing, but I’m 98% sure I have OCD. My repeating of stuff is affecting my life. The cough thing could be related to the repeating of doing stuff.

Some statistics (only estimated):
- I probably cough around 3-10 times/hour. I don’t know what the average is, but to me it feels like a lot. My friends and family are always commenting on it, they notice.
- I probably spend about 2-3 hours/day repeating stuff, washing my hands, etc.

These are my “stats”, I don’t know what to call them. Do what you want with this unnecessary information. You could also share your own “story”, I don’t know. Sometimes it’s just helpful (at least for me) to read about others."
392,I hate being alone (vent kinda),I've never felt this way until now. My mom started seeing someone and would spend hours away from home and she even stayed overnight (she said she would be back in a few hours). and ever since then whenever someone sits next to me I'm afraid of them moving somewhere else or go getting something. I cant talk to my therapist since she never set up another appointment when she was supposed to.
393,im sad (vent),"so this is my first time on a group page like this and it feels relieving to know that i might have this as an outlet and opportunity to let it out. i’m sorry if this isn’t what you usually see on your page but if anyone could help me feel less alone that’d b cool. so i constantly am sad sometimes i think i’m too in my head and that’s bad because i constantly overthink. i’ve dealt with depression for a couple years it on and off yk sometimes i feel ok and other times i feel like i could die. i have a boyfriend but as much as i love him u know the way he treats me isn’t right but i also don’t know how or what to do im way too attached to him and i let him do anything and everything he proved to me that i wasn’t worth anything and made me realize i don’t matter ik he’s not a bad person and is trying to help but he’s done not bad than good(sorry if this doesn’t make sense i’m all over the place right not but ever since i got with him and i caught him doing things i didn’t appreciate i fell back into my depression after 4 years, he made me feel worst of the worst idk what else to say"
394,How do you learn to love yourself?,"I don't know if this is a good place to post this, but I'm sure someone will let me know if I'm wrong. 

I recently did some soul searching and came to the realization that I don't love myself. Like at all. I don't know that I'd go so far as to say I hate myself, but I'll bet it's close. 

Now what? How do you learn to love yourself? 

Two years ago I lost 85 pounds in six months. I held it off for six months, then went hog wild and gained it all back plus more. I've been trying to restart my weight loss and I keep sabotaging myself. I know a huge part of weight loss is mental, so I'm sure I need to get that figured out first. But where do you start? 

I feel like I'm the Beast in Beauty and the Beast. I'm trapped in a body I hate and yet I have to learn to love myself. 

Just reaching out I guess."
395,The most hurtful email- FUCK THE NHS,"In december I tried to kill myself. Then I contacted the mental health service the psychiatrist told me to but they said i wasn't stable enough so in january I got the GP to refer me to the other mental health service. Then I heard fuck all from them. As you can imagine months without support after attempting suicide is fucking difficult.

In one of my crisis moments the other week I found their email address and sent them an email explaining my situation.

Today I looked at my email and realised I got a response. They said they had recieved my referral in january but ""somehow it was overlooked"". So they were going to call me.

They did try calling me, whilst I was waiting for my GP appointment so they agreed to call back an hour later. Several days later i HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN. they don't care."
396,I still feel like shit but that’s ok,"UPDATE TO MY LAST POST- 

Before I start I just wanna thank everyone who replied to my last post. I really do appreciate it, it made my day thank you. 

I’m feeling a bit better today. Life still isn’t perfect I’m fully aware of that. But I’m trying to learn to love myself and I know it will be a slow and rough path, I’m hoping In the end it will be worth it. 

I guess i do still feel lonely in the end and I do feel hopeless sometimes but I’m trying my best and I will keep going! It’s still hard for me to reach out for help when I’m struggling but I know I have people who are more than willing to let me rant when I need it, I’m so thankful for that. 

In the end, I’m not okay now but hopefully one day I will be. Thanks again everyone."
397,*Possible trigger warning* I keep having thoughts of starving myself,"For a while, I’ve been having thoughts of starving myself, I’ve never done it before, but I’ve been having thoughts of doing it, I’m not sure what could be causing these thoughts, I’ve been having these thoughts since 2018, long time, I know."
398,I need help.,"I just got a prescription.

Prozac 5mg : First week, then Prozac 10mg

And my mother is 100% against it. Because my cousin got Ritalin and became schizophren. And now she hates every mental pills. I asked her if she was going to ""hate"" me after that, and she said ""I will need time to accept this."", which I know, will be never. I'm currently 15 and I don't know what to do...

I would like to know what are the ""bad things"" that can happen.."
399,"Is it normal for a therapist to confront the parent, in a straightforward way, informing them that they’re part of the reason why their child is struggling mentally","When my brother was younger, around his last year of school, he was going through some stuff and my dad suggested to see a therapist to which my brother agreed to do so.

After the therapist had a few sessions with my brother, the therapist told my father that he wanted to have a session with him alone since he felt that he is part of the reason why my brother had been struggling.

I wasn’t at all surprised that the therapist had that assumption about my father, I was just surprised that he had decided to have a session with him(without my brother present).

My dad has a short temper, and at the time he couldn’t take criticism or an insult, even it was a joke (it has gotten better).

He was pissed and decided to stop contacting the therapist and of course made my brother stop going as well.

My brother is fine now, when I asked him about it once, he just said that it was nothing and that he has moved passed it when he started going to college.

I just wanted to know if what the therapist did was completely normal and professional considering my brother wasn’t an adult at the time and so it was best to confront my father about it bluntly.

I was surprised because I always thought that a therapist’s job is to basically help his client by identifying his/her problem and helping him/her to cope with it or find a solution to it and basically not involve any of the clients friends/relatives directly.

My question is : Was the therapist’s approach uncommon or was/is my understanding of how therapy works wrong?"
400,This feeling lingers.,"

For the last year or so, I’ve had the feeling that I wanna die but, I don’t wanna kill myself. I’d be completely okay with getting hit by a car, or killed in a shooting. Like I just feel I’d better off dead at this point. I hate my life and don’t wanna be alive. I also don’t wanna kill myself cause I don’t wanna hurt my friends and family. I don’t know what to do anymore"
401,My life is dominated by hatred,"I've been treated like garbage my entire life by the people close to me. They have done terrible things to me and as a result, I am too afraid to associate with anyone. Whenever I am with friends or family or even just out in public, I love the people around me and don't feel any negative feelings, but the moment I'm alone, I'm opened up to a slew of memories that fuel an intense hatred toward the people who have wronged me. The memories play over and over again and my hatred for these people grows stronger and stronger with each passing day.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached a point where I habitually go online and take advantage of my anonymity to express extremely hateful beliefs that would make me seem like an absolute monster. But once I step back, I realize that I don't believe these horrible things and that I'm simply driven to say this stuff out of sheer hatred.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people will tell me to go to a psychologist to work out my issues but in all honesty, I see my problem as caused by external stimuli. I don't see this as an internal problem but rather one that outside forces have caused. Talking to a psychologist or taking some pointless medicine won't remove the memories from my head. I also don't believe in medical intervention to solve emotional problems and will never consent to psychiatric intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help on how to cope with this. I don't like feeling hatred at every second of every day.

&amp;#x200B;

*Disclaimer: do* ***not*** *attempt to file a false wellness check against me; I am very wealthy and can easily sue whoever does this to me.*"
402,Extreme Obsession with Things,"Whenever I get into a new tv show, movie, or book, I get so obsessed with it that I actually end up avoiding it. For example, I just watched a new tv show about ice skating and now I’m overly obsessed with wanting to become a figure skater and have experiences like the characters in the show. This desire is so strong that it makes me cry at night and I become so upset that I’ll never have that sort of life. I then end up avoiding any mention of the series and try not to think about it when I can help it. This happens a lot when I watch new shows or movies, which is a big reason why I mostly just rewatch the same shows. One of my friends mentioned that she sees a similar sort of obsession in her little brother with autism, but I’m not sure if these are the same sorts of things (please let me know if she was completely wrong). I was wondering if anyone has a similar issue or if this is a sign of being on the spectrum? I would love to hear any opinions or suggestions to getting over this, if possible :)"
403,Mental health affecting friendships,I've always had mental health issues but they never really affected my friendships until recently. I feel a strong need to isolate myself and I don't want to talk to basically anyone. I used to be the exact opposite and depended on other people to make me happy and honestly needed to be talking to people a lot to just function. Not being dependent anymore has been really important for me but it seems like I've gone too far in the other direction. I make sure to tell my friends I still care because I truly do but sometimes I go weeks without talking. I don't want my dependency issues to come back but I also don't want to be alone. I don't know what to do.
404,Advice about therapy and corona,I have a therapy session scheduled for tomorrow afternoon and I'm really anxious about going. Not so much for myself but for my elderly parents that I live with. They are both around 70 with underlying health concerns. I would not be able to forgive myself if anything happens to them if I brought the virus home. I'm asking for advice for what you would do?
405,Not coping with med changes,"Autistic and some form of bipolar that's never been concretely confirmed as type 2 or rapid cycling or anything.

So for the last ten years I've been on sertraline. Initially I was on 100mg but that got bumped up to 200mg and then to 300mg during a bad time. I got bumped back down to 200mg and everything was... fine? 

Due to an illness last year it has been recommended I start on nortriptyline starting at 25mg and going up from there. In order to do that I need to come off of the sertraline and until last week everything was good. I'm under specialist care and under the psych's guidance I have decreased my sertraline and today come to a stop. I'm now on nortriptyline 50mg at night and 100mg of quetiapine.

The last week I have noticed that my ability to cope with... anything has plummeted. I got into a rage over the autocorrect on my phone because for some reason it cannot consistently capitalise singular i's. 80% of the time it just ignores that they should be capitalised. And when I say a rage, I mean, screaming, crying, hitting myself (for some reason it helps?) and being antisocial. Today I had to go to the doctors and pick up a script as I lost the original one. I spent the entire 20 minute drive trying not to cry or scream or both. I have no patience now, for anything or anyone. Someone going too slow on the highway? Someone not indicating or stopping suddenly? I can barely keep it in.

Honestly I want to just throw myself on the ground and scream. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to cope with this. I've got tears in my eyes as I write this but I genuinely have nothing to be angry/sad at? I'd rather be an over medicated numb shell than this."
406,Everything I know and hold onto is being affected by the virus.,"I know we’ve gotten loads of COVID-19 posts lately, but I need some help here. I’m not even in a risky location for the virus, and everything in my life has been cancelled. I’m 16. My high school’s gotten cancelled for the next month, and people are saying it could possibly even be cancelled until the end of the school year. And I hate school as much as the next person, but I need that routine and normalcy, and I need to see my friends and interact with people. 

I’m not under a legal quarantine, but my parents won’t let me see my friends or even leave my house, even though I can drive. They’re trying to schedule my day out for me, from waking up early to when I do my schoolwork, and I need a sense of control over my own life. I know I can’t really prove this over text, but if you’re willing to take my word for it, I’m a pretty responsible person. I’m both cautious and good at self-managing/not procrastinating. 

So I’m basically being quarantined and controlled daily. I say this not to condemn my parents- I don’t blame them, they’re doing their best and trying to protect me in a scary new situation, but that doesn’t change how I feel. I’m just extremely frustrated and I don’t feel like I have any control over my own life.

How are you guys staying sane in these weird times? On top of feeling restricted, lonely, and stressed, I’m also bored with not much I’m allowed to do except hang out alone in my house. Any help is appreciated."
407,What should I do about my brother,"After not seeing him for about 4 months, my brother who is 22 years old has been acting very strange since I last saw him. It’s been about 4 days since he has returned. Sometimes when talking and interacting with the family he randomly laughs and at other times he randomly nods his head. My mother just showed me a text that he sent her today and it said, “hello mother am i adopted?” She told me that yesterday at around 10pm she also saw him just standing in the open doorway to our backyard. When she asked him about it, he said the voices in his head told him to go there. 

I have no idea how he interacts with other people outside the family. What should I do?"
408,coronavirus is driving me insane,"I am an international student from Hong Kong studying in the UK. There has been a lot of people going back home because of the fear that there will be a huge outbreak in the UK after Boris Johnson's notion of herd immunity. 

However, I choose to stay in the UK bc 1. I think leaving rn is more dangerous than staying 2. My dad has health complications and if I had the virus, he might have a higher chance to catch it and have serious consequences. 3. I could handle everything alone here in the UK and I barely went out of my room even though I am not self-isolating.

Seeing nearly all of my close friends are leaving, even for those who originally said they were going to stay, really affected me a lot. I feel betrayed and lonely. I was meant to meet my long distance bf in mid April but now there is a high chance that the trip will be postponed. That makes me even sadder as my final close social support is not going to be here to comfort me irl.

I just hope I have made the right decision to stay in the UK as rn I feel like I have made the wrong choice."

410,I'm really worried about placements.,"Hello,

So this is half a rant, half asking for advice.

I am in my second year of studying Computer Science with Games Programming at University and I am really worried about placements. This whole year we have been told to constantly go look for placements which I have been doing but have only found a few that I am interested in. I applied for these and so far have been rejected after submitting the technical tests because I clearly am not good enough to pass. These placements are very competitive, with only one or two spots.

Not to sound cocky or anything, but I have worked damned hard throughout my time in College and University, but feel like I have messed up somewhere? Like I have gotten firsts in all of my modules, firsts in every coursework I have submitted and passed everything university wise so far by a mile, but then I get to these placements and they expect me to be far better and know a hell of a lot more than I do!

I don't know if it's me doing something wrong, whether the placements are too competitive, whether the course is bad or what. Nobody on my course that I know has a placement. Additionally, every placement is asking for stuff we have barely even been taught, like a programming language called C++ - they expect us to know this in a great deal of depth, however, we have barely been taught it?

I have made my own projects, spent months upon months on my coursework, researched content that we aren't being taught, sacrificed a tonne of my life to get this far, and it just feels like I'm never going to meet their standards!

My uni has been on strike for a month and is now entirely online due to coronavirus which I don't feel has helped at all.

I'm honestly burnt out at this point and can't face applying for any more placements, however at the same time know I will be really disadvantaged if I don't get one, plus not getting one will really affect my mental health.

Anyone got any advice?

Thanks"
411,I really want to die,"I don’t know, I don’t have some big important future plans for myself so I don’t have anything to look forward to. I’m a sophomore in high school, I’m supposed to be a junior but ya. I’m trying my very best to pass this year but I guess sometimes my best isn’t good enough because I’m failing again! I can’t blame anyone but myself, I just don’t have a lot of motivation to do anything anymore. 

I feel like everyone hates me and that I put everyone around me in a bad mood. I feel like they all talk about me behind my back or when I’m in the same room as everyone and they’re all laughing together I feel like they’re laughing at me. I think they only hangout with me because my parents tell them to and by them I mean my 2 sisters, my sisters friend that lives with us, and my cousin. 

I hate everything about myself. My sister once asked me to name a couple things I liked about myself but I couldn’t name any. I don’t like to open up and talk about that kind of stuff with anyone, it was pretty embarrassing for me to tell her that I couldn’t think of any. Sometimes I can’t even look at myself in the mirror, I mean I can look at my face sometimes but I can’t stand look anywhere else. It makes me feel disgusted that everyone has to see me like that. 

I haven’t had a friend in like 3-4 years. Soooo my family moves sometimes. I’ve lived in like 11 different houses in like 8 different states, the past 3-4 years we’ve moved 3 times. I feel really bad for complaining because some people move a lot more than me and go through very difficult things and they don’t complain so why am I always complaining? I don’t know the answer to that. Every move I had to go to a new school and start all over again, that was until my freshman year when my mom decided to put me in online school. After my freshman year my parents forced me to go to a regular high school, I only went there for 3 month before going back to online. No one talked to me at school the 3 months that I went, I cried and had panic attacks what felt like everyday, I went to the nurses office a couple times a week because i felt sick to my stomach being there, I started skipping my classes to cry in the bathroom and when the school counselor found out she started walking me to my classes which sucked but I guess I understand. While I was still going to the public school I tried to kill myself by taking a handful of sleeping pills, didn’t do anything except made my breathing feel weird, i felt like I was in a dream the whole time, then I threw up and acted like nothing happened so let’s not go into anymore detail about that(I’m not writing it off as no big deal, just not something I want to dig into, ya know?). Ya anyways, that last time I had a friend was in middle school and it wasn’t even one of those really really close friends where you’re like sisters and can tell each other everything, I’ve never had that close or comfortable of a friendship/relationship with anyone. I don’t know why I can’t form connections like that with others, it must be me tho, right? Because it seems like everyone else has somebody so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Even tho me and that girl weren’t the closest friends ever, she was the best friend I’ve ever had and I miss her terribly. I could always move back to where my friends were when I’m old enough(which is a couple months away) even though i don’t talk to any of them, but people change and I’m afraid that they’re not going to like who I am now and I’ll be right back to where I am right now. Wanting to die. 

When people say they want to die everyone’s always like “you have so much to live for” n stuff like that but I really don’t. I’m bad at school, I’m bad at connecting with people, I’m bad at being social and outgoing, I don’t have any goals or dreams of what I want to do with the rest of my life, I know I don’t have to have my whole future planned out but I feel like I’m so far behind everyone else my age. I don’t think I’d be a good mom, I don’t even think I want kids at all, I don’t think I want to be married either and my family says that because of that, there’s definitely something wrong with me. 


I have more things to say or write about I guess but this is already super long, messy, and not written very well so sorry. Thank you."
412,Feeling lonely and worthless. Any advice?,"Throwaway account because I don't want my family to find out I wrote this.

I (M, 20) have really been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past five years although I think I've felt really sad and out of place ever since I started school. I have Asperger's syndrome and I was always a lonely child. It didn't help that because I don't understand social cues it can sometimes make it really difficult for me to read a room. Just to clarify Asperger's is not in anyway an excuse for rude and unkind behavior and I still feel really guilty about several unkind things I said in high school. I sometimes wonder if I can ever get past it? If I can ever be clean and innocent again? But then again I guess I should have not said those things in the first place. 

But my biggest source of sadness and loneliness is the fact that I don't have a girlfriend? I can never attract a girl and I really feel terrible about that. I sometimes just lie on my bed for hours just feeling sorry for myself and dreaming about the day some nice girl will not only listen to me but also kiss me in mid sentence and let me cry my eyes out. And whenever she was sad I'd do the same to her (I would comfort her the way she would want to be comforted). I know I'm not entitled to any girl but i still feel angry at myself and constantly feel like the fact that I don't have a girlfriend is because I'm a selfish, narcissistic, stupid, awkward ugly freak. But I'm scared to get into a relationship because I'm afraid that I'll treat her less than she deserves to be treated. Act like I have all the problems and neglect hers and all the good things she does. I feel too scared to talk to girls I like. And when I finally pluck up the courage they're already with some other guy. I feel really sad and incomplete without a girlfriend but I know I'm not mentally in the right place to be in a relationship ATM. How can I take my mind off of it and when will I know I'm ready? Also what's the best way to approach a relationship when I am? Remember I have Asperger's so I have no clue. 

Another thing is that I have no choice at the moment but to live with my family who are super religious. They're Mormon and up until a year ago I sincerely believed in it too. But then I realized it didn't make any sense, I was appalled by it's continued backwards stances on LGBTQ issues (which I'm absolutely ashamed to say  I once bought but I promise you that I know better now and I always try to call out my church family and friends when they say something ignorant or bigoted even though they don't always want to hear it) and just in general felt really unhappy with it's strict rules. One that really impacted me was that you are not supposed to have sexual relations outside of marriage. And that includes your thoughts as well (for as Jesus said any man that seeketh in his thoughts to commit adultery hath already done it or something like that) and so that includes things like pornography and masturbation. Ever since I was twelve I would always go to the bathroom after succumbing to a bit of self love where I would always check the underwear for semen stains and if I would find a single spot I would feel so worthless because then I knew that I had sinned and so was ""unworthy"" to do my ""sacred"" priesthood duty (which you are expected to do as a boy beginning at age 12. The Mormon church doesn't allow girls to have the priesthood) and I felt like I was letting my family, my church and my God down. 

I love my parents and I always will even after all they did to me in instilling that mindset. But it still is annoying living with them and all their strict rules. For example even though I'm twenty I can't watch R rated movies. I can't even watch movies with swearing or sexual innuendos in them. Given that I'm going to have to self isolate for maybe a year, who knows, it's particularity frustrating. Then again it's all I've done my whole life so I should be well used to it by now. But it infuriates me that whenever I ask them about lifting the standards for me when I watch movies or TV shows in my own time they're response is always ""I guess we haven't been good parents if you want to watch movies like that.""  The only university they've let me go to is BYU Idaho online which has a lot of these same standards (they don't even allow students to be openly gay or trans) and you're expected to keep your mouth shut or you risk failing the ""honor code."" And that includes me having to lie and say that I not only believe in the church but that I also don't watch porn or jerk off. Otherwise I won't be allowed to graduate. I'm not even studying on campus. For the past three years I've been forced to study online which is so lonely while I have to absorb (otherwise interesting classes) with the church's filthy propaganda. Unsurprisingly they constantly gaslight you and I'm scared of caving back into them. I'm also constantly stressed out about being wrong about leaving the church one day and that I'll go to hell. 

I'm worried about leaving the church because I know it'll break my parents hearts. I have full confidence that they'll always accept me no matter what I do (they really are good parents). But It'll be hard because I know for a fact that if I leave the rest of my siblings will leave too. The culture of the Mormon church unfortunately drills into your head that if your children left the church it was because you were a bad parent.

One more thing in regards to my mental health. The workload of my classes are killing me. I constantly procrastinate but it's mostly because I bottle so much up (I have no friends to talk about this stuff too) and it really hurts my ability to concentrate. I usually do well at school but I feel terrible because I don't do as well as I feel like I should. And I constantly doubt myself because I had a ""friend"" who whenever I tried sharing my opinion and he disagreed with me he'd yell at me that I was ""retarded"" (he knew I was autistic but I don't know if he meant it that way) and that ""people like me deserve to die"" (I'm glad I never told him about my suicidal thoughts). And whenever I confronted him about it he would say ""I couldn't take a joke."" I don't think he meant those insults but it still screws my head up today and it was even more hurtful when my own brother (who I love dearly) sided with him over me and he would bring it up whenever he thought I was being overly sensitive (otherwise my brother is a great guy but sometimes he can be very thoughtless). I'm just tired of being a doormat.

Thank you to everyone who read the whole of this. I feel a lot better now. Please note that currently I can't afford therapy and my parents only want me seeing church therapists (some of which are surprisingly very good but there are still things that I'm comfortable talking to them about). But I'll save up for one someday.

But does anyone have any advice?"
413,Developing violent thoughts,"I've been depressed for years, but I was only diagnosed two years ago by a doctor. I got therapy and medication, however I stopped it all because I moved too far from where I was getting treatment. I know I should have continued it but a part of me was lazy, and I felt hopeless. I've been off medication for 6 months now and my emotions are getting bad. When I was depressed and someone made me sad, i would just sulk around all day and lay in bed. However, when someone makes me mad now I develop horrible anger issues. At the moment they're very uncontrollable, but thankfully I am still at a state where I can prevent myself from taking action. I've thought of doxxing, beating, wishing death, and sometimes even killing people whenever someone does something bad to me. Instead of being upset I just get violently angry and I can see what's happening and I want it to stop because I feel like I'm not me anymore. I grew up being very timid and shy, never took action, never stood up for myself and I think that anger has been building up for so long. I feel like a bomb waiting to go off. I just want advice on how to control these emotions. I am in college and I would go to the counseling center but school is closed for the next few weeks. If anyone has advice on how I can calm my thoughts I would really appreciate it. I'm scaring myself and I'm scaring the people around me too and i don't want this."
414,Voices inside my head,"I sometimes hear voices in my head and I wondered how concerning does this sound.

I can't see a mental health professional because I'm currently quarantined cause of coronavirus (I live in a very hot spot).

I've been diagnosed with BPD and BP2 (untreated).

If I stay quiet and my mind clears, the voices start talking. It doesn't even feel bad to be honest.

Sometimes I hear someone making funny voices, sometimes I hear a woman scream things like ""I can't take this anymore!!"".

Should I speak to a mental health professional asap, or is this kinda normal?"

417,Advice??,I’m currently a college student and ever since I was in junior high I went through periods of feeling emotionally numb. I don’t really feel sad but I don’t really feel happy. Sometimes it lasts for weeks and sometimes it lasts for months. I’m not really sure what this is or if anyone else has experienced this/has insight on how to deal with it?

419,Unlovable,"Hello everyone. I’m a 16yo with depression, anxiety, autism and adhd. I constantly feel so alone. It’s like a hole in my chest that can never be filled. I feel like nobody cares about me. If I die, more people would be happy than would be upset. I hate myself. I’m a burden to others. The world would be better if I’m gone."
420,I don’t feel like breathing anymore,"Hi, first of all sorry for using a TW account. I just need to let my feelings out before I explode. 

There is a song that used to console me, saying how spring will come - and with it a better mood. I have been waiting for years to feel even remotely happy. My depression has been with me ever since I can remember and although my family tried to understand no one ever realised how bad it really is.

I moved abroad nearly 5 years ago, went through major trauma but ended up luckily stabilising my life to a point about 2 years in. I initially loved it, had some brief drug encounters etc.

Nowadays I spend my days locked inside, unhappy unless I look like a perfect doll, dealing with an eating disorder and major insecurity complex. There is no way I will leave my apartment unless I feel immaculate. I have tried multiple ADs, but nothing had long lasting effects. Therapy never worked for me and I have no real friends that I can talk to. The only time I feel happy is after starving myself/binging or drinking at least a litre of wine (I am luckily able to restrict these harmful habits, but I feel dead without them). As much as I love my family we have a certain limit that we simply don’t cross. Feelings were never really considered, even as a child.

It has been incredibly difficult to even continue living lately. I don’t want to end my life, but I can’t keep going. It’s so difficult to just keep breathing. 

Even when it gets better it’s never for long. I tired recovering from my eating disorder (made my mental health worse), being spontaneous (caused major anxiety), talking to people (rejection because people felt uncomfortable).

I have no idea how to keep going and simply want to fall asleep while never waking up - but I am also terrified.

I don’t feel like living, but fear the unknown of death. I feel like I am in a limbo. I don’t deserve to exist. And yet I waste space in a 1st world country moping around while someone else deserves my space is much more.

The thoughts of ending it all consume my mind more and more very day, I stress about my existence and future. I BEG you - please help me realise why this isn’t ok."
421,"So today my girlfriend and I decided it would be best to end our relationship cause it hasn’t been good for either of us lately, it’s just been stressful to say the least","I feel like it’s my fault. I’ve been really depressed for about a year. Basically since I cheated on my last girlfriend. I’ve never felt worse than the look my ex gave me when I told her the next day and it’s been haunting me for a while. 

The girl I ended things with today, let’s call her Jane, was in my friend group when I cheated on my previous Ex, let’s call her Jill. Jane was among the handful of my friends that didn’t treat me like shit when they found out, cause it kind of blew up in the whole group.  

Half of them were on her side, saying that I was shitty to do that and they didn’t know if they could trust me as a friend anymore. They told me I didn’t deserve Jill in my life or as I friend and I should consider myself lucky that she still was willing to be my friend. Which honestly I didn’t want to associate with her at all anymore but I was too scared of what would happen if I acknowledged that fact to admit it.

The other half were pretty much on my side, and saw that I had been in a mentally straining and toxic relationship with someone who refused to get help for their depression and anxiety, and after her manipulating me back into the relationship the first time I broke up with her (1 week before I cheated) I was desperate for a way out of the relationship. Jane was among those friends. Those friends didn’t like that I cheated on her but they were much more understanding and much less condemning.

I don’t disagree with either side of that dramatic situation. I hate myself every day for doing that to her. I spent over a year in that relationship trying my best to be supportive and to empathize with what Jill was dealing with mentally, but it got to a point where she started projecting her feelings about herself onto me. That’s where it got really toxic. (Of course it took a lot of time and therapy to realize that’s what was happening)

After we broke up the second time Jill was still a part of my life, I think because she wasn’t fully ready to let me out of hers, so she was saying things like “you owe it to me to be my friend” and “give me closure”. And honestly I thought she was right. But I pried myself further and further away from her, spending more time with the Jane and the friends who still talked to me. Eventually, Jill dropped out of school. 

I think that’s something I still blame myself for. 

I know consciously that she didn’t need to be in college. She was skipping classes, constantly fighting with her parents over the phone about how she wanted to go home, and they would tell her she couldn’t. She had to stay in school and get a degree. They said if she wasn’t in school they weren’t gonna let her live with them. But despite those signs that she was bound to drop out anyway, I feel like it was my fault. 

Because I know she would have stayed in school if we were still dating. 

I know that she would have stayed an extra 2, 3, 4 semesters past her expected graduation date, retaking the same classes that she was always skipping. And I would have been suffering in a relationship that was making me hate myself. 

But at least she would have stayed in school. 

It was really hard when I found out she left, and that’s when I started emotionally disconnecting from myself and the people around me. I wasn’t able to open up. I was even shielding to my therapist. Finding ways to make it seem like I was talking about what bothered me without actually addressing what I was holding against myself. It got to the point where I believed myself and the fact that I was doing good and getting help and having friends and talking to Jane. Me and Jane starting talking and getting to know each other. 

And sleeping together. 

We were friends with benefits for the first three or four months after Jill and I broke up, starting a few weeks after the break up. Except we didn’t want our friends to know cause we thought they would think badly of us for doing stuff together so soon after both getting out of a relationship. So I was leaving their apartment where we would all hang out, walking out the door saying “goodnight, see y’all tomorrow” and then climbing into her window three seconds later. 

We were having fun, sleeping with other people keeping it casual, and then we started getting feelings. That’s when the “mom” of the friend group caught on. Or at least told us. She probably knew for a while. She told us it was “unfair” to her and the other friends because we were being “dishonest” with them. I guess. Idk. But it shouldn’t have been up to her what we get to do or who we tell about it. She disagreed. She (Mom friend) said that last time Jane was in a relationship she lost the boy she broke up with as a friend. What really happened is she stopped trying to reach out to him because of HER depression and anxiety and pushed him away. But that’s nomb. 

Anyway, because mom friend reacted so badly to us doing the dirty, we told her we would stop and continued to do it in secret. 

Bad idea, we should have said f you we will f if we want. But we didn’t. 

Moving on. 

Towards the end of the year, me and Jane were spending a lot of time together away from the main group, and started to catch feelings. We considered ourselves “talking” and made the relationship exclusive. 

Summer 2019

I hope y’all are enjoying, this shit has turned into a novel 

I, for some reason, decided to share a two person apartment with mom friend. Smh. Two depressed persons who have some buried resentment for each other under the same roof. What could go wrong. 

I would make trips to see Jane without telling mom friend where I was going, which made me act sus and I started to thing she was sus, which made me more sus. I have know idea what or if she knew. That made me more anxious because I had a whole relationship I was trying to keep secret from the person I lived with. That was hard. Then, halfway through the summer, my grandma was admitted to the hospital. 

Her liver cancer was getting worse. 

She was diagnosed in January of that year and we slowly lost her more and more each month. So I was in and out of school, going to visit her and my family, on top of all that shit that happened that semester, adding to more emotional disconnection. 

I refused to let myself feel any of the feelings my environment was inciting out of fear of complete mental breakdown 

My Grandma passed away in July of 2019 

I didn’t talk to a single person from school for a week, including Jane. 

At the end of the week, after the memorial service, I called Jane and told her I didn’t think I needed a relationship because I felt really mentally unstable and couldn’t be present in one. Things were weird, I was single for about two months, the longest time since I started dating in like 2016. 

Then school started back up in august and literally as soon as I saw Jane again I felt like I messed up by breaking up with her. Idk if I did. But we broke up again today so who’s to say. 

I’ve kind of said it all so to make that last semester short, I got more depressed, decided to drop out and now I’m home. Me and Jane tried to make it work from a distance, I visited a few times, she visited a couple times, and as time went on I got more and more distant in the relationship. 

I stopped being responsive during phone calls, one to two word answers, and it was hard for me to respond to texts. Today we finally had a serious conversation about it and decided it was best for both of us to end it. That was a few hours ago and I’ve been getting strong waves of depressive feelings since. 

I guess what I wanted from typing all this is someone who might understand. Or relate. Or be willing to give their two cents. I feel like shit and I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I wanna feel like myself again. Or at least close. 

TL:DR read the whole thing it took forever to type and honestly I got a little closure from it. Skim if you want"
422,I want to have sex with everyone.,"The title isn’t clickbait. That’s exactly how I feel 
I’m relatively new to reddit so don’t bully me too much lmao. 
I’m 21(f), relatively fair attraction. 5’7” and kind of a chubby/thick. I’m aware I have major self esteem issues but I’m not horribly ugly or anything. 
My deal is i need the attention of everyone, male or female, and I CRAVE validation. Doesn’t matter who you are, what gender, age, or level of attraction. I think about what sex would be like with nearly everyone I encounter around my age and older. If someone flirts with me, I’m not one to turn them down even if they are being disrespectful. This, of course, has hindered my relationships in the past. It all comes down to the fact that I’m a “whore”, I have no “self worth” but I’m aware of it (This is what past partners have said but that isn’t far from the truth tbh). 
Honestly some of the time I don’t even want sex, I just crave the feeling of being wanted and validated. I want men to drool over me, I want my body to be seen as an object. Doesn’t matter if I’m in a relationship or not. Y’all can roast me but also I’m looking for advice or any reddit diagnosis lmao. I really should not be acting the way that I do. I’ve talked to my therapist about other things but never this. I’m repulsed by my own behavior and mind which is why I’m embarrassed to admit it all. Help."
423,I know The Truth about Psychiatry but nobody wants to believe.,"In psych hospitals they chain you to a bed in a cement room and inject you with so many drugs you are left unconscious and drooling for days. Zombified.

They would even drug the food in the prison-like hospitals.

The Psychiatry Industry obviously works with big pharma and connections to the government.

My theory about them is that they are drugging peoples foods until they display abnormal symptoms, then imprison them in a ""mental hospital"" to ""help"" them.

But that's just the cover up.

They then test experimental drugs on the patients. Poison, essentially.

You think something that would help you would make you twitch, drool, decrease focus and concentration, barely keep your eyes open, and in some cases cause sudden death?

Essentially MK-Ultra reincarnated.

Of course the government has eyes everywhere, I'm sure that's why they have people following me around. I can see them.

My school keeps people trailing me, just waiting a chance to snatch me if I display any abnormal behavior. Thankfully I hardly ever leave the house anyways lol.

I can never escape them, I'm surely on a watch list now.

One of the worse parts is that they've managed to brainwash people into thinking that they actually help, and people like me that see the truth are crazy.

So, I'm just hoping by sending this out there other people will finally open their eyes or relate."
424,I need advice,"I often at times feel that there is a big answer to all my problems, that I am just not seeing. I am a outted, gay 15 year old, loner with a ego that nags at me like a tick. My mind is at a civil war with its self, one that has the ideals of class and the simple fact of knowing better the other half longing for madness, fun ,and sin. Its wanting to declare its own independence for my brain.  I get a stroke of jealousy from others with a passionate hatred and disrespectful for myself each day. Especially for a certain boy in school which I can never seem to run away from. I love him more than anything in the world, and if I could buy his love for a million dollars I would. But at the same time he seems to be a sort of arch nemesis to me.  he goes gallivanting off with his friends every day, with me being jealous from a distance that I can't join them. I have had a crush on him for almost 4 years now he seems so fun, and yet I still hear things about him that I hate. The way that he is controlling and is a "" Do things my way because I all way get my way"" type. Also because he seems to lack any sort of common sense.  Just the other day I had heard from a friend of mine that he had been "" Played for nudes"" by some 20 year old guy on the internet. The only thoughts in my head at that time was ""does that Piano Boy have any sort of brains in his head"". But I'm so emotionally attached to him that if something were to happen to him I would go insane. My life is so muddled up that I cant even verbally explained all the things that I need help with. But for now I will leave asking, ""How can I help myself"" and ""how can I get myself out of this unhealthy emotional attachment that I have to my friend"". My family members have not been able to afford any sort of mental treatment for my health, my school counsellors at times seem to not get the full grasp but my whole situation, and my friends; while I know they have the same feelings as I do are not, in the same situation as I am,  and that is why I am here at Reddit. Yes it is not the perfect place for mental advice but in days past I have seen how the internet has gather together to solve great mysteries of the world and I like to believe that the greatest mystery of my world is myself. So I ask? Can you help me."
425,Something Is Wrong With My Mind (HELP!),"Hi, this is my first Reddit post ever, so if it is messed up...my bad. Ok, so I would be doing an activity such as basketball or drawing or video editing. Then questions would start to appear. Like while I am video editing, I would ask questions like...""How can I make this a good looking edit"", then I would think like ""What makes something look good to the human brain"", then when I get an answer to the question it doesn't satisfy me. Another example, was when I was playing basketball a question popped up saying ""How does you know how to shoot without thinking"", and obviously the answer is because of muscle memory, but then another question would be like ""What is muscle memory"" ""What is a muscle"", Just dumb question that hinders my well-being. It is so weird and straining. Like for example, let's say someone asked""Why does painting look better than another one"", the regular answer would be ""Because it does, it just looks nice"". That answer wouldn't satisfy my brain for some reason. I would do tons of research on why certain people like certain things, to where I would go into brain chemistry and wiring and everything, and it still wouldn't satisfy me. Imagine basically never finding the answer to a question, and constantly trying to find it. But, it is like I DO KNOW THE ANSWER, but my brain won't shut up with the questions.

**TL;DR:** Imagine basically never finding the answer to a question, and constantly trying to find it. But, it is like you DO KNOW THE ANSWER, but your brain won't shut up with the questions. HELP!"

427,Reckless spending,"I've been getting more and more far from reality lately. Doing shit and not worrying about the consequences. The moment I got my first paycheck I went out and bought airpods despite the fact I have an android phone, leaving 50 cents in my bank account. I'd do this often in video games and shit, but I always thought real money would carry more weight to it and so I would be more careful. I've already made a lineup of stuff on amazon I'm planning to buy.

Then I realized I had a rbc client card. It has no expiration date, no cvv. I can't order stuff online. I was up until 1 am last night trying to find some way to order the stuff I wanted off amazon. I was so very disappointed. Then rbc glitched out and was giving me error codes all night. This morning it finally starts working and guess what. I have to go to a rbc location to get a card. And wait like a month for it to come in the mail.

So then I started looking at the items in the phone store near me and of course they have nothing. The longer I wait the more money I will have. I promised myself I will just buy a phone and case and stuff and that will be it. But the longer I have to wait the more money I will have saved up. Which means chances are I will buy some crazy expensive phone rather than the cheap one I was planning to buy with just the money from my next paycheck.

So here's how things will turn out. I will have airpods, a way overpowered phone I have no need for. And who's to say it will stop after that. I may go the rest of my life being unable to stop myself from buying. I'll have 0 dollars in my bank account walking around with gucci on airpods in and an iphone 11 pro plus. I'll look rich, but that'll only be because I spent all my money. And I will be sad in the end."
428,Does Lithium always make you gain weight? How does it make you gain weight?,"Hi,

I am curious about the weight gain side effect with Lithium.  Does it affect metabolism or insulin?  Cause water retention?  Or does it simply increase hunger?  

I was on Mirtazipine which is notorious for weight gain.  I gained about 25 pounds on it over. Months but was able to get it all off and keep it off (while still taking it) by not giving into cravings (which was very difficult at first).  Mirtazipine made me crave carbs like crazy for whatever reason.

Can you keep the weight off if you are disciplined when taking Lithium?  Or is it like some antipsychotics that affect metabolism, insulin, kidney function and/or cause water retention etc.

Thanks to any and all responses!"
429,A general helpful post about coronavirus.,"I'm no expert about this first. But, I followed news about this from the early january. I have seen videos from china, had a clue it will turn into a pandamic.
So, first if all in china. Death rate was around 3700 for I guess 60,000-70,000 cases. I have read posts about individuals getting recovered easily. It's scary. But, you probably won't die. Millions of people in china where under lockdown. Since, I knew about this from long time but looks like rest of the world is reacting now. 
Look your body's immunity is the cure. Best you can do, is sleep, eat, excercise. I understand it's scary in the beginning but weeks later it feels like old news and you will ignore it. I'm so sick of reading it everywhere honestly. My mental state is at like I die, I die ( which probably will not) I'm pissed at how so called world leaders handled it more than anything.
Precautions: I don't know what western media is telling you all. You gotta wear masks, goggles. Gloves and disinfect phones, clothes. 
If u can stay home don't even bother going out. It's not worth it. 
Things to do : learn a new language ( i'm learning spanish ), binge watch a show. Talk to your friends.
Remember times when u wanted a holiday so bad. Relax, it's not the end of world or you. Many people in china according to the news/videos I have seen got better in their home. [ immunity, doctors can't help ]
It's no way to take it lightly, but at the end of the world it's important to keep in perspective that to take each day at a time."
430,I feel lost,"Hi I'm new to this and I'm not sure how it all works but I needed to let it out. Lately I have been feeling down and out and it seems as though everything is going downhill. I used to be a perfect student and now it seems as though I have failed at everything.

Things started about four years ago when I began living with my mom. I had never lived with her so things were a little rough at first because we weren't used to being in the same household but I felt as though things would get better with time. Things were good but then this year they got a lot worse. It seemed like we were always getting into disagreements and never really getting along. It has gotten to the point where I don't even want to be around her anymore.

I've tried to tell her how I feel about things but then she gets even more mad or says ""this generation is too soft"", so I have stopped telling her how I feel about anything. I don't want to ask her for therapy because I feel like she will use that against me. I also am an only child so I really have no one to confide in. All of my family members support me tremendously, however they don't really know whats going on. My uncle is the only one who she tells anything to and he tries to tell her to calm down and see things from my perspective but then she gets mad at him and finds a way to turn it back on me.

I am not saying I am perfect because I have made many mistakes, but I feel like I have lost my mom and I have no one to talk to about it so I'm just stuck here having to deal with this until I am out of the house."

Im scared of everyone, because i give them the keys to my self esteem, but i dont know how to stop. I fucking hate my job. I have no real close friends, because i dont know how to be close to people in a way that isnt borderline obsessive, so i just keep a distance. Too much of a distance, i dont even talk to the people i live with. Not that id have anything to talk to them about, all i do is focus on my problems. Every day i wake up and try to force myself to be positive or at least feel okay, but i just end up operating on auto pilot. I want so badly to exist any other way, and i see exactly what im doing wrong but i cant stop myself. I feel so lonely, every day. Feel like no one really cares. Feel like everyone wants me to be something else, someone more fun, someone who doesnt care what other people think, and i dont blame them. I fucking wish i could stop caring. Wish i could talk to people. Wish i wasnt bored all the time."

The last time I had a solid personality or place to belong for longer than a month was back in 8th grade, and I was emo. I have been through mental hospitals and such for depression and drug abuse but nobody has ever helped me with this. I just want to belong."
436,Am I crazy?,"I often find myself talking to myself, out loud. Engaging in full conversations with myself. I always chalked it up to writers brain, needingnto sort out character thoughts. But, weirdly enough, my characters all seem to be a part of me, in each of my stories they take on an aspect from my pain and trauma inhale suffered, splitting it into different pieces. I find myself talking to them when I'm driving, studying, sitting alone, doing anything. Sometimes I just have conversations in my head with them. Constantly. I cant focus sometimes without being able to speak to myself. Often at school I get weird looks because I'm constantly whispering to myself. Making up stories for different characters, all which feel extremely personal because every story has a different element of my life in it. Am I crazy or is this just Writers Brain like I said?"
437,I don’t know if I’m alive.,"I went on a trip abroad for four months. Everything was going ok, I was having a pretty good time and having fun. 

However, one day, I was in the car with some friends when an elk crossed the road while we were on a highway, forcing the driver to turn rapidly to the left. The co-pilot thought we were about to get into the opposite side of the road and into a ditch (which wasn’t true), but out of instinct he pulled the driver’s wheel to the right side violently, causing the car to lose control and fall down the road into a small hill. The car skidded because of the snow and then processed to roll over four times. 

I hit my head against the window and I remember distinctly feeling a wet drip coming from my head. I touched it once the car stopped rolling and thought it was blood. 

When we got out I saw I had instead hit an airbag and the thing that was dripping was melted snow that had gotten in from one of the windows. I was fine except for a small bump in my head. We all made it with small scratches and not much else. The EMT’s checked us and said there were no signs of concussion and that we were lucky and fine. 

After that however, I felt like things around me started to become “bad”. People that were close to me became distant, work became unbearable and I started to feel alone. All around me things began to change. I felt as if I was in that tv show “the good place”, because all I felt around me was manageable pain, but pain nonetheless. 

After that, I felt like it took an eternity to fly back home to my country. Time went by slowly and the things and people that made me happy were distant and cold, until they stopped hanging out with me. I didn’t understand why and I would constantly question myself what was going on.

Family members began to get sick and all I could do was watch from afar. It was torture. I thought I would have to prepare myself to never see them again. Every single day I would wake up and expect a message saying they were gone. Thankfully they were not. But it drained all the life out of me. And to make it worse, I had no one to talk about it and it made my job performance drop which made my job a whole lot more hellish. 

Things got a little better eventually and then the whole Coronavirus thing explored. I had to get an emergency flight two weeks before I was supposed to leave and it was so rushed (I booked my flight and had 3 hours to get everything ready) that I forgot tons of important things. 

My country closed down the borders 12 hours after my flight got in. I didn’t thing I would make it. I thought I would have to go back and continue living this solitary torture. I just couldn’t believe it when I landed. 

Now, I am finally home with my family. But now I can’t shake off this feeling that if I go to sleep I’ll wake up back to the country I was in and realise it was all but a dream and I am still stuck perpetually in that hell of a place. I am so happy to be home, I don’t want it to be over. Sometimes I just don’t understand how I survived that crash so it comes to reason I think I didn’t and I am just in the Purgatory. I am so afraid to go back there I can’t even start to feel sleepy. My heart is racing and all I want to do is cry. 

Am I alive? Am I dead? Is there any way to know? What is happening to me? How do I take this feeling away? 

Please help me."
438,Is this considered age-regression?,"I recently stumpled upod some youtube videos about age regression and was wondering if something ive experienced is the same thing.

I rememer that when I was in late elementary school (4th/5th grade) there were some nights where i would go cuddle with my mom and act like a baby: I would talk in a baby voice and say nonsense. I don't remember if I did anything else. At the time I had a feeling that it was weird but my mom didn't discourage it. I eventually stopped doing it because I felt ashamed by it.

Now I'm an adult (23) and there are sometimes where I see photos of a cute animal or I see a cute stuffed animal and I get an intense urge to start talking and acting like a baby. I restrain myself from doing it because, again, I feel shame, but idk if this is a normal thing or if this is considered age-regressing??

Let me know what you think and what your experience with this is"
439,Please read,"Hi i’m 17 years old and i’m a Type 1 Diabetic from Plymouth (Uk) with depression and anxiety. i don’t really know how to word this but i’ve been really really bad lately with my mental health and here goes: idk, i’ve been depressed before and i’ve gotten through it, but somehow this time feels different? i feel like my whole world is crumbling down around me and i feel like i’m failing at everything i try, everyday i wake up to emails of rejections from jobs, i’m not gonna get my disability money so i won’t have any money for anything and i keep having to ask my parents and i can’t support them which makes me feel like a disappointment to them and a failure as a son, my sleep patterns messed up yet again and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better so what’s the point of trying to change when 2/3 months down the line i’ll be in the exact same position? i really REALLY don’t see it getting better i’m on the verge of crying writing this. i really really don’t know what to do. i’m in such a dark place right now. and secondly this whole coronavirus has me so unbelievably worried you don’t understand cause i also have really bad anxiety and i can’t lie i can’t stop worrying about this whole coronavirus being diabetic it’s such a scary thing and i’ve taken myself off all social media to try and escape the constant talk of it. it’s like i literally worry about anything and when there was talks of WW3 i deleted everything for a few weeks because it could be the tiniest thing but if there’s a shred of possibility it could happen it sets my mind racing, and those few weeks of no social media or anything was the best i felt in ages and obvs the coronavirus propaganda isn’t helping my depression and anxiety but i’ve been really bad lately anyway so i was hoping that just a deep social media cleanse would help but even after deleting everything (it’s been like 4 days now) i still worry and even if i feel the tiniest bit different to normal for whatever reason i go into such immense worry. i rarely leave the house anyway because of my depression and anxiety my mum is the same. my sister and dad go out the house but are always washing their hands and limiting contact with the public as much as possible but i still worry? and because this virus doesn’t seem to be easing off anytime soon my anxiety just seems to be getting worse. i just feel like bursting into tears because like i said before i’ve been bad before but this time just is so much worse i’ve never fallen like this before. and it’s super hard for me because i’ve been suicidal before but never gone through with anything and i just feel sometimes like i don’t wanna be here but not in a sense of death (because death worries me so much) but in the sense of i just wanna stop hurting and it’s hard because growing up suicidal i don’t know how to cope or what to do with my life because in the harsh reality i wasn’t planning on being here for this part of my life you know? but going back to my main reason for my problems with this coronavirus i just can’t stop thinking about things again,it’s on my mind first thing in the morning last thing at night when i’m doing something that takes my mind off it, it always finds a way back in. i just wish i could turn off my anxiety and depression even if for a day. i don’t know what i can do because i just hate this feeling of constant fear? i know you may think i’m stupid for worrying this hard about things but that’s just who i am i wish i could change. sorry for the super long message but i needed to open up to someone before i burst into tears."
440,Advice on friend who has mental health issue,"Hello. Trying to find a way to explain this.  First information about me.  I'm a 21 year old male university student with depression and anxiety issues.  I have little to no friends and spend most of my time alone.  I often struggle with my loneliness.  This post isn't about me.  It's about my friend.  

I met her in highschool and for whatever reason decided to be vulnerable and get close to her.  Tell her about my problems I've told nobody about.  As you may have pieced together by now, I had a crush on her.  Overtime I learned she has mental health issues as well to a much higher magnitude. Eventually, due to the stress that it caused to keep my feelings to myself, I told her.  She understood, but stated she was in a relationship.  There must have been a miscommunication or new developement I didn't know about, because I thought she was single.  Anyways didn't take it to great.  I didn't lash out or anything, but felt the extreme need to distance myself.  I didn't expect us to get together, but knowing she was with someone made me weird.  Anyways graduation rolls around and I decide to make a run for it and just disappear.  However, I could never bring myself to get rid of her contact info.

Fast forward sophomore year.  We go to different universities in different states.  At this point I think about her from time to time and still haven't completely gotten past everything.  For whatever reason I contact her thanking her for the support in highschool and apologizing for acting weird towards the end.  She says it's ok.  However, things have gotten worse for her.  I don't think it's my place to go into specific detail, but know that it gets bad enough for hospitalization rather frequently.  Anyways I say I'm sorry and tell her that I'm here if she needs it.  She says thanks, but I don't hear from her after.  Figure if she needs me she'll contact me.

Fast forward 8 or so months and I get a message.  Wants to see how I'm doing.  We get to talking and it's getting worse.  Out impulse I tell her we should start talking regularly.  We start to and after a while I start to get the full scope of how bad it was.  I start to check up on her regularly.  Her issues often make it hard for her to communicate consistently, so I am the one who reaches out a good 99% of the time.  It's been this way getting close to a year now.  My old feelings start flaring up.  

Now onto the issue.  I find the whole situation difficult.  Trying to be there emotionally for her when I sometimes don't hear anything for weeks at a time.  How to be there for her.  Being the one that exclusively reaches out.  I often find myself repeating ""I'm sorry that happened"" on loop.  She tells me she appreciates me and that I'm not a nuisance (after asking).  She says she's probably just as open to me to her therapist, if not more so, but I feel a distance between us I can't shake.  I often wonder if I call or text to much.  I apologize for this, but she says she's ok with it and that it's on her for not responding.  Have I mentioned I haven't physically seen her in almost 3 years.  And yes I have brought up my feelings.  Of course she said that she's in no condition for a relationship, which was to be expected.  I mainly told her for my own sanity.  Still told her I want to be there for her (don't want a repeat of highschool).  So there it all is.  I'm probably not going to get alot of advice or am breaking some sub rule and the post will get deleted.  Either way that's all of it."
441,Chaos and COVID-19/Feeling alone,"Life before the outbreak was fairly stable and controlled. I was still anxious all the time but broadly speaking things were going well, I am academically  stable and on track to graduate, I had a job lined up before I went back to my hometown.

Now that the outbreak has happened, it feels like the end of the world. I have plans that have been upended totally, my job opportunity is in jeopardy because of the impending shutdown of society. I've also been obsessing about how Ive seemingly not be successful enough and I'm afraid i will never have enough opportunity to advance my carrier. I don't know, it has ignited a total panic for the future and i just need people to talk to.

All input is appreciated, I just want to hear from other human beings."
442,Not sure what to do,"I’m going through a tough time with my mental health. My social anxiety is getting really bad and I have so many problems overwhelming me. I just feel really stressed and hopeless. I want to get help, I really do, but it’s a really bad time to talk with my mom about it. She’s really stressed lately since the Coronavirus is really affecting her work. I just don’t want to make her go through any more stress than she already is. At the same time, I don’t know if I can handle all this shit that’s piling up. It feels like too much and I can just tell I’m going to break and do something I’d regret."
443,Why does nobody believe me?,"Flooded with downvotes, called ""crazy"", saying ""you need meds"""
444,"We're all just the result of the evil powers that be. They intend to leave all of us physically-and-mentally-tormented souls to die, sad and miserable and alone. How can we beat the system?","It's the government/illuminati/whatever unnaturally enforcing natural selection, if that makes sense. The world is a super fucked up place full of 99% fucked up people and they think they're going to change that by not offering enough help and letting us die off. They aren't losing any sleep about my pain and suffering and likely inevitable premature death from mental and physical illness. All I needed was someone to care about me and help pick me up off my ass. And I could have been a productive member of society and hell, possibly have even gone on to use my brain to do great things. What they dont realize is they're not just killing off the most mentally ill among us, they're killing off the most intelligent also. And those aren't just delusions of grandeur. So many people are mentally ill *because* they're smarter and more aware of how shitty and fucked up the world is. I'm really stupid in a lot of ways considering my inability to pick myself up and take care of myself. Now I'm 99.99999% certain I have cancer that has spread like wildfire, and a whole plethora of other physical and mental illnesses. And it sucks and hurts so badly. But I'm just too afraid to go out and try to get help. Then there's studies that **DOCTORS ARE THE #3 LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH!** Think about that for a moment!! Think about how bad you have to be to be responsible for killing as many people as car accidents and heart attacks and shit! Plus if I step outside I'll catch a disease that will somehow fuck me up even worse than I already am and then I'll REALLY die even sooner and more painfully than I'm already about to. Its just so sad. I could've done great things. But the government doesnt want people who require resources. They want people who SUPPLY services and resources. I probably have my own FBI agent watching my every online move to try to catch me doing anything they can lock me up for. Imagine if they put forth this much effort to help make me better and turn me into a productive member of society. The things I could do and achieve..but nope. I'm mentally ill and full of unbridled rage and if I were to reproduce then it would likely just be another mentally ill loser like me and they cant risk that so it's easier to just let me die off. Fuck this world is so sad and fucked up. If theres a god hes one sick SOB lmao. Fml. 
How could we use our brains to come together and overcome the system that wants so badly for us to fail and die off? Cuz I know we're mostly depressed and anxious and unmotivated, but if overcoming our evil and malevolent overlords who are rooting for our demise isnt enough to motivate me then idk what is. What can we do? Create a website/forum with the goal of truly progressive deliberation for everyone? How can we ensure no man gets left behind like so many of us are everyday? Fuck its just so terrifying living in this shitty directionless space rock. I just want to be able to make life easier and more manageable and less cruel for myself and everyone."
445,I need some advice,I think I have a mental illness or many idk but I often feel many things at once and detached from reality and no one understands me. And on and offs of suicidal thoughts or just people I know plotting my downfall/judging me and because of this barely trust people around me and wonder would they notice if I left. At this point tho this is my last effort to find help because I also don’t want to make it a big deal and bring it up. I live in the USA if that helps

447,"Open Letter to my Schizophrenic Husband, Part 4...","Part 1:

When I look at you, I still see the freshly 20-year-old, outgoing, charismatic young man who carefully gained possession of what was left of my almost non-existent trust and fragile, teenage heart 13-years-ago. I still see the confident smile that belonged to a rambunctious boy who knew the world was full of possibility and opportunity, and he could conquer any obstacles that lay in his path. That smile... oh... that smile 😌 it melted so many hearts, and I’m so lucky to be the ONE woman who is still able to coax it out of hiding from time-to-time.

You are the man who saved my life more times than I can confess and the person who’s pure and beautiful soul I have been blessed to be able to create and build my life with. You are the devoted, adoring and incredibly nurturing father to our three magnificent children. You are my kindred soul... the universes answer to my life’s purpose... and... my darling... believe me when I say that I would be LOST without you...

I love you. Not in the truism sense of the word. Not because that’s what we, as humans, have been conditioned to tell someone with whom we show adoration toward... NO...I am chemically and cosmically connected to the fabric of your immortal energy. My spirit requires you... I NEED you in the same way I need air to breath and water to drink. You are my soul’s sustenance.

So that’s why... on the day when you tried to kill your self, 3-weeks-ago... I felt like a vital part of me died. For weeks, I have felt like I have been living with a stranger and I haven’t known how to look at you or even what to say. Not because I love you any less, but because I haven’t been able to understand how you could have gotten to that place where you felt so bombarded by your own mind you were forced to pushed every primal, human instinct to survive away and KNEW you needed to permanently escape. It breaks my heart to think about the agony you must have gone trough to get to that place where you felt like it was time to leave this earth, this life, our family and our love. I feel so guilty that I, your closest and most intimate friend in this world, never saw the signs and couldn’t be there to save you from yourself.

I’m so, incredibly lucky to still have you with me, and I’m trying my best to understand how that beautifully complicated mind of yours functions. I know you’re not ready to talk about it, but I would hope that you would forgive me for seeking advice from other’s who might also suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I can gain a better understanding of how you are wired and how I can be there for you now and everyday in our future...

I love you, baby and I am HERE FOR YOU... as long as we both shall live...

PART TWO
12/27/2019

We are growing accustomed to celebrating the small victories we have encountered over these last few, unexplainably difficult months. I like to think this kind of behavior has been therapeutic for your increasingly more fragile mind. It feels incredible to witness you smile on occasion and... my love... today is Friday and the kids are asleep.

It’s time to celebrate US... this rare connection we have. Our deep friendship and kindredness that has given you and I the strength to survive the ravishing fires of hell. Tonight... All we need is you and me in our purest and most honest forms, this old couch that’s certainly seen it’s share of better days, a couple of cheap beers and a music playlist that is rich with adolescent memories - those few years of our lives we had to struggle through alone. The years before I found you and we weren’t lucky enough to have loved one another...YET...

We require this moment where nothing is expected of us. Just a few hours when nothing outside of this toy and cheerio covered living room is of any concern to our collective psyche. We have earned this sliver of time to take all of our stress and anxiety acquired through the years and store it, for a few moments, away from our present minds - somewhere it can’t weigh on our cerebrum. And when our chests finally feel a bit lighter, It’s time to forget today, forget last week, forget last year and remember the tiny moments and coincidences that brought us to one another. It’s time to dive deep into each other’s lives and emerge from the depths as stronger and more learned version of ourselves. These minuscule clips of time seem to pass so quickly, but I know we are better for them.

Did you know that I love that you can still surprise me. I adore that you are still here to spend this moment with me, to share our truths and experiences tonight. I am fascinated by your life. Your story is an intoxicating book that I can’t put down. You are the most incredible human who has ever walked this earth and I’m genuinely grateful to be the one who gets to walk beside you, dance with you, and fall asleep in the comfort and security of your sturdy arms.

Words tend to flow from me freely when I’m in your presence because I know you’re the only person who has ever fully accepted and loved me as I am - in my rawest form - even my ugliest and most vulnerable versions. I love that you are habitually honest with me, even when the truth is both difficult speak and digest. I need you to remain this truthful with me, ALWAYS. I may not, in every scenario, know what to say or do with your truths, but I promise you that I can carry more emotional weight than you think me capable of, and your secrets are safest when harbored with me.

Laying next to you tonight, I was sorry to hear that your mind orchestrated delusions have become more negative and terrifying over the course of the past month. It’s hard to imagine the fear you experience when you wake up in the middle of the night to a faceless demon aggressively attempting to infiltrate our home and harm our children. I don’t know what it’s like to have an independent, entity narrate my life, boss me around, bully and break me down mentally and tell me that my time is almost over...

It broke my heart to hear you confess that you had planned to take your own life the day prior, because you thought it was the only way to make the unwanted haunting images, apparitions and disembodied voices leave you forever. It crushed me to learn that you had already begun your goodbyes to our children. Though, what confuses me most is why you believe that your strength and honesty are things you need to apologize for. I’m ecstatic that you love me enough to muster your strength in this moment with me today and I admire your courage to be honest about your waking nightmares. Its important for me to understand what you are going through so I can know how to help you navigate through this horror show spectacle.

I promised you, the day we fell in love, that you would never have to face this life alone. I have no intentions of breaking that promise now.

I’m still trying to process all of this. Its a bit overwhelming to digest this instant because It devastates me to know that you spend the majority of your days petrified in fear and polarized by anxiety. I wish there was something I could do to take that burden away from you. I’m not sure what those magic words are that will make all of your pain disappear...

That’s why I remained silent tonight and cried with you instead...

PART THREE
01/01/2020

Happy New Year, My Love!

I’m thankful to have had a 13th opportunity to kiss your gorgeous lips at the stroke of Midnight - Ringing in another New Year the way we always have. What would I do without you here beside me? Where and Who would I be without your influence on my emotional growth? I hazard to assume that I would DO nothing productive, BE nothing and go nowhere without you. You are my divine inspiration to exist...

Cliche as it may sound, I unquestionably slept as soundly as an infant, buried in your arms last night. Your scent, warmth and the weight of your body filled my dreams with pleasant, carefree imageries and I was excited to wake up beside you this morning.

Much to my dismay, the hopeful man I fell asleep with last night was not the same man I woke up next to today. The man I woke up with today was pale faced, trembling and petrified. He cried despairingly while gripping his skull and desperately pleaded with a hallucinatory force... Repeating his dissuasive mantra, “Please Stop.” “Stop.” “Please Go Away.”

I placed my hand on his back in an effort to calm him down. I rubbed him gently and repeatedly shushed and assured him that the voice he was hearing wasn’t real and everything would be alright. His anxiety consumed him entirely and caused him to spiral downward, in and out of reality, trying desperately to maintain his grip on his own physical existence. His personal desires and conscious thought became muffled beneath the howl of a sinister cacodemon that wasn’t actually there... 

I stayed beside the man I woke up with for the next two hours. Fearful myself, at times, hoping he would let my husband come back home to me soon. I sat, holding him tightly on my bathroom floor, as his fear caused him to violently purge every ounce of matter that existed within his gut. I began to shake uncontrollably as I held him firmly around the chest and calmly talked him down from repeated moments of hyperventilation and near panic induced shock...

He told me his angriest delusion doesn’t like me. He held me gently by the face and assured me that he would never hurt me, even though the voice in his head has been ordering him to, “SLIT HER FUCKING CUNT THROAT!” I told him I knew he would never hurt me... and then I ordered him to leave! 

I grabbed the bottle of antipsychotics that you have been neglecting to consume the past few weeks and forced him to digest one. I waited for several minutes that seemed more like centuries for you to come home to me. I watched his eyes transition from a tormented shade of dark grey to the beautiful, pale green eyes of the man I fell in live with. You collapsed downward, overwhelmed with joy and relief, as you found your way back into my shaken embrace, and tears poured from our eyes as you exclaimed, “he’s gone... I’m so happy he’s gone.” 

You are taking your meds regularly again, and we are sticking to our care plan. We had to learn a vital lesson in a terrifying fashion, but I can’t be more proud of your strength to persevere through all of this madness. 

You are the strongest person I have ever known, darling and I love you...

Let’s keep moving forward together. 

PART FOUR
03/16/20

If I wasn’t the one holding you tightly around your chest, calmly telling you how to breath and coaching down from a catastrophic panic, who would do that for you? Lately it seems like we are all each other has... no one really understands this. How could they? 

Do you know what scares me? The thought of having to do all of this nonsense without my best friend. It’s actually terrifying to not know if you’re going to be here tomorrow. How am I supposed to go about doing any of this without you? 

And there’s nothing I can say to make you want to stay here with me. Your pain is beyond my vocabulary and it breaks me into pieces to have to watch you go through the motions...
Struggling In a world where literally no one understands or even attempts to level with you...

I have loved you for 13 years. I made 3 children with you maybe that means NOTHING to someone, but it means EVERYTHING to me...

 I am crying tonight because I know it’s just a matter of time. Someday soon, I am going to wake up in the morning and my best friend isn’t going to wake up with me.

And I won’t know what to do..."
448,Help?,
449,Venting about my mentally unwell mother,"I know it's not wise to diagnose a family member without confirmation, but I'm pretty much convinced that my Mom has Paranoid Personality Disorder and have been convinced of this for a long time. She will never be diagnosed - she doesn't think anything is wrong with her. We're past trying to get her help. There's no way she would at this point and she's in her 60's, so why even bother trying to anymore? We're tired of her backlash whenever we bring treatment up, of her attacking my Dad like he's trying to work against her with everything. So tired.

Does anyone have a family member who has this personality disorder and how in the world do you cope? 

My anger towards my Mom is so strong right now after an unreasonable argument tonight. It's not fun to talk to her and I like being around her less and less as I get older. It breaks my heart to say this and I don't like the idea of talking about her behind her back and hurting her, but it's true. She's a VERY negative person, she judges people way too easily, she's mean towards others she thinks are against her (which is practically everyone), holds grudges for life against pretty much everyone except her children, distorts reality and truth, and she is so unreasonable. Hearing her talk negatively about people I care about sucks. Seeing her treat others, including my Dad, the way she does when she's like this is too much. She's 2 people. There's a sweet, loving side to her and then there's a hostile, paranoid side. But she's unleashes her hostile, paranoid side more than her sweet, loving side. We never know which side we're going to get and when we bring up certain topics, disagree with her, or she's just in a bad mood, then her hostile side is unleashed and none of us can handle it. 

I'm so tired. Tired of dealing with her. I'm sure everyone else is too. She's shut herself off from relatives (even her own) and only has us. I find myself not dealing with her very well even as the years go by. When she becomes unreasonable, I end up fueling the fire by arguing back, hoping each and every time that she will see my side of things - that she will see reason. I always have that hope. But she never does and I know why - I know it's not her fault. That's she's mentally ill. Hell, I am too. And I know I shouldn't argue back and should drop it, but leaving her thinking she's right and being on her high and mighty horse thinking she's won and having her way just makes me hate her. She's hurt a lot of people in her life and it's sad how my Dad has had to take precautions because of her. Has had to deal with her without her getting help. I'm honestly afraid that at one point she will go too far with things and hurt my Dad physically. After the argument tonight, I had that fear. That's what scares me most."
450,Hey! Can an old (20+) person speak to me who has numerous mental illnesses (depression being one of them),
451,I am breaking down.,"Mobile and it's late so there is gonna be errors all over this, sorry in advance if you read it and cringe at all the typos.

No throwaway, dont care. No one IRL really knows (cares?) who I am on here anyway.

I'm scared. I am so very fuxking scared. The doctors tell me that despite my previous issues my heart is strong, and that since I'm under 40, I will probably okay if I get corona. But still, I have heart disease. No matter how much I watch what I eat and exercise, I'm still pre diabetic.

I have flatlined before, I was fortunate enough to come back. I know what those few moments did to my wife and children's psyche. I am so afraid. We have a family business. We are going to have to shut it down, at least temporarily until things I'm the world improve. Dont care to shutter to help the greater good. Afraid it will be hard to recover and open back up later. We didnt panic buy and hoard, and we have enough to survive on. Tonight my oldest child and I cleaned and serviced the few guns we own. There are a LOT of whacked out addicts here. Not addicts that need help, addicts that are proud meatheads. They arent preparing to take care of themselves, some are vocal that they are already preparing to ""do what they gotta"". I have not aimed at another human since my time in the Military, could I even be able to do it again? I'm afraid, because most of all, I know that I am starting to succumb to my fears, fears for the health of my self, my family, my community.

I'm getting caught up by my own fear, and its shutting me down.

Thanks for reading, be well everyone, stay healthy and look out for eachother."
452,abusing unhealthy coping mechanism,"the past few weeks I've been really struggling. I'm studying abroad and have just said good bye to my family recently, I did well the first week but after that I either binge eat every night or down a whole bottle of wine to sleep. 

Every day I wake up and feel like absolute shit, especially when lectures start at 8 and I've got like 3 hours of sleep. But i just can't stop, it's like when the night comes I just can't resist the idea of ordering large amount of mcdonalds or going out to buy another bottle of wine. 

Now I don't struggle with being away from home that much, nothing really bothers me at the moment, but I guess I'm drawn into the habit of ruining myself. 

any advice?"
453,i’m feeling stuck in my life. help!,"i’m happy in my relationship but outside of it, i feel stuck and it’s starting to effect my relationship. i feel like i can’t do anything because i don’t know what to do. it feels like i’m waiting on something that’s never going to happen and idk what to do. please help me get out of this loop. thank you."
454,I'm too much.,When does it stop. When does the feeling of not being good enough stop. I wish I could forget you as quickly as you forgot me. I just want someone to not give up on me for once.
455,Is my Nausea telling me I'm Depression and what do I do about it?,"So lately I have not been able to eat much. I want to but I don't know why I can't. Whenever I do, I feel like I'm going to puke everywhere. The only time when I don't feel this way is when I am a little buzzed. I have been dating this girl and I wonder if it is tied to it. I'm pretty confident in myself but in the past I have went through the same thing with an ex. It was terrible, I would have to force myself to eat peanut butter crackers and chase it with water. At the time it was all I ate for a few months. And the whole time I felt happy in the relationship. In this relationship I'm happy, but what is the matter with me. Is it tied to some subconscious doubt or fear or something that I'm just not realizing. Even today, my girlfriend now made me food for lunch and I had to force myself to eat it. I hadn't eaten at all by that point so I know I was hungry. One thing to note is that I do lose appetite and do get nauseous when I am sad so thats why I have come here. Any help, advice, and assessments of what the hell is going on with me will be very appreciated."
456,Lately I've had a bad phobia when it comes to talking to men irl,"I 25F have depression, anxiety and OCD (diagnosed). Usually it's the depression side that hits the worst, but I've been very anxious lately. Can't sleep properly, not even with strong meds. During the day my muscles feel tense.

Today I had to go buy some vegetables at the grocery store, you might as well just have put me through hell. The clerk was a guy around my age and I just felt terrified. My muscles tense, I can't look at him anywhere, I feel an urgency to gtfo. This isn't only there but almost any man close to my age. 

Of course I haven't had the prettiest story with my dad, but this is a new thing for me. It did happen sometimes with someone I felt attracted to, but now it happens anywhere and it's become a real issue.

I have had a terrible year:

- Uncle died on Dec 31st
- Stepdad diagnosed with cancer on January
- Grandma (who I used to live with) has a stroke, loses her memory and now needs a permanent caregiver
- I have to move out of my house back to my mom's, no job prospects.
- I'm moving to Spain in june by myself.

Yeah it hasn't been peachy to say the least, but it worries me and makes me embarassed because it's very obvious I'm tense. Whenever I have to interact with a guy I feel sick to my stomach for a few hours afterwards.

Any advice?"
457,binged on my latest food shopping,"So I ate too much already of what was supposed to be a 2-week supply of groceries.  I feel too sick to sleep.  Why do I do this, I'm going to be low on food in a week now.  I wonder if I'll be able to get refills of my medications in time.  The meds aren't helping much but I'm scared of withdrawals if I have to go off them.  Fuck this virus and fuck my life."
458,There are days that I look back on and think that wasn't me.,"I am 36, of sound mind, married, work an important job and am in charge of people yadda yadda etc. But in the last few years I have been having days that I look back on and feel like it wasn't me going through that day. It wasn't me making those decisions because I would have done things differently, I wouldn't have said that or spent that much money or thought those thoughts. This only happened a fews times so no big deal, but all of the sudden recently it has gotten very frequent. An example is yesterday; I remember being there and watching it take place but I don't feel like I was the one at the wheel. It's really weird. Nothing bad has happened and I haven't spent all my money or anything like that, just little things. I don't have anyone I can talk to about it, I don't dare talk to my wife about it for fear that she would use it against me in a fight. I do have a doctors appointment coming up and will speak with them about getting someone to talk to. 

Has anyone ever gone through something like this? It maybe a normal life thing or just a stress thing, who knows.

I've tried googling this but I don't have the right words and haven't found anything."
459,I’m(20F) tired of struggling with BPD and I need advice on how to deal with this,"I deal with constant anxiety relating to any conflict or issues in my life I have this extreme distrust to everyone in my life and often blow things out of proportion in my head to the point where I have no stable relationships in my life I have suicidal thoughts very very often though I know they’re just thoughts and feelings and thoughts and feelings go away I’m constantly bored with my life and feel low just going about my typical day I don’t even trust myself to keep myself okay and my therapist and psychiatrist are so hesitant and to diagnose me with this or take me seriously they think my thoughts are unreasonable and just typical young 20F stress related thoughts but I’ve literally lost so much sleep obsessing about things I shouldn’t asking staying up until 2am almost every day of the week googling resolutions because I don’t trust my own judgement I go into a rage every here and there with my boyfriend and although he loves me a lot I know he’s still hesitant to take me 100% serious because of how often we break up and how impossible it is for me to ever stay level headed for too long I want to go back on anti depressants because back then my moods were a lot more stable and I didn’t deal with anxiety at all but I doubt my doc will prescribe them again because last time I tried to kill myself after a few months of using Prozac and being in the military that’s taken very seriously and could easily be a way to give someone the boot ... I guess I just needed to rant but I’m so tired of living in this head and in this body I’m not close with my family I have one good friend I’ve been on and off with for years and my bf who’s mom shows Jocasta signs but that’s a whole different conversation. Anyone with BPD out there and normal happy healthy lives? What do you do? Is there any way out? Would you recommend trying to go back on anti depressants or mood stabilizers although it will look horrible on my behalf depending on those as a servicemember? I’m already being considered for a medboard/medical separation or LIMDU/limited duty status and that would just be asking for an involuntary discharge. Should I just let it all play out? I’m not going to lie I hate living in this head and the whole work out stay social don’t impulsively spend go to church stuff gets exhausting after a while. I wonder if I’m better off giving up. 

TDLR; BPD has become too much for me to live with. I’m not sure how to cope and due to my job as a service mention the military it’s hard to get the help I need without risking discharge as I am already being considered for medical separation. What can I do to cope? Should I get anti depressants from somewhere other than the military facilities?"
460,Don’t know how I’m gonna cope mentally during this time,"I’ve been struggling with depression and my general mental health for years now and I only just started trying to do something about it, just started trying to see a doctor, therapist etc. 

Now there’s a global pandemic and obviously life is going to change for the worse. I’ve already been trying to deal with being lonely as it is. I live on my own and honestly, social interaction, going out with friends, family, talking and having fun together, that’s pretty much all I had in life to look forward to. I always told myself that whenever work is going badly or no matter how much I’m trying to deal with, I told myself that everything would be okay as long as I kept my mind on that next trip to the pub with my friends or the next time I’d see my friends for dinner and all that. Now I don’t even have that, now I have nothing. Nothing but myself and the darkness that lives in my mind. I had so many dreams for the future that I’m just seeing get crushed in front of me, I wanted to travel, I wanted to have new experiences, I wanted to one day have a family and now I can’t have any of that. I’ve lost the one thing in this world I had to look forward to, the one thing I had to keep me sane. Now I have nothing, I have nothing to motivate me to carry on or even want to live anymore. I’m struggling to find a reason to even want to get out of bed in the morning. 

I’m sorry I understand this probably sounds like first world complaining considering the crisis we have on our hands but I’m not coping. I can’t live like this, the complete social isolation for this long at a time is honestly more scary to me than any virus or disease. I just called my doctor’s surgery and they’re not even seeing patients right now. 

I don’t know how much more of this I can handle, is there a way I can give myself any kind of motivation to live right now? Is there any way I can even stay sane? Is there any hope that things will be normal one day and that I can finally live my life? Is there any way to convince myself that life is worth living whilst everything is crumbling around me? 

Sorry to waste your time if I have, I hope you’re all doing okay and that this chaos isn’t impacting you all too badly. 

Any insight or anything like that will be hugely appreciated. Have a good day!"
461,"Spiraling, booze",I'm spiraling and it hurts.
462,Help!,"I need help. I’m lost

I suffer from anorexia. Things were going really bad and it was a dark time but eventually I started eating. I still haven’t fully recovered though as I still have the same thoughts and skip meals very often. This was just the eating disorder part but the psychological effects it had on me are a different story. I’m suicidal. I’m pretty much always thinking of suicide. I wish i didn’t exist. My mental health was not that bad before but day by day it’s getting worse. I don’t really have anyone to talk to except one friend. Because of my disorder I successfully pushed away all the friends I had and now no one talks to me. I try to talk to them but get really anxious and it doesn’t work out. I have one friend who’s supported me through all this and she’s really great and she’s the only one I talk to but the thing is she has her own life, problems and friends. I cannot bother her with my problems the whole time. I don’t want to talk to my parents. I was depressed before but not this severe. My parents thought as I would start eating, I would get better and they still believe the same. But in reality, it’s completely opposite. My mental healths only worsened. And now when I’m sad, my family behaves as if I’m faking it. Look I feel really bad typing this about them considering they’ve supported me a lot but it’s the way it is. After you try so hard to recover from something you’d think your family would be proud and support you but they’re still of the same mindset that I’m not eating. Things are getting bad and now I get anxious around my own family. I can’t think straight if I’m in a room with any of the members. I get really anxious. I prefer to be alone. I don’t want to talk about this to my parents as they’ll only send me to a therapist and I seriously don’t want to see one because of a past experience and the fact that I’m sure I won’t talk. I don’t know what to do. I wish I could talk about it but I’ve already pushed away all my friends and the one that I still have, she’s already helped me a lot and I don’t want to bother her anymore. I really don’t know what to do. I wish it would all end."
463,Bullying and Health,"I have no idea how to start this, but I'm hoping to fine support as well as to vent.
I have moved to a different state go to university and am staying with a sibling. They bully me and make me feel horrible every day and I'm trying to move out desperately but I have health problems and I need to get tests (some of these they won't let me go home alone after) and it might be either fibromyalgia, MS or Friedreich's ataxia and it's making me really distressed knowing I may be severely impaired in the near future and even knowing this they still treat me so poorly. 
They keep putting me down and yelling at me about things that are incredibly hypocritical and although I've never hurt myself (other than hitting myself or my leg out of frustration) I'm starting to really consider it and I keep giving my myself small blisters on my fingers where I keep rubbing out of anxiety.
I am so scared about the future and I'm already missing time at uni and Im struggling to pay for bus trips to appointments and uni supplies because they are trying to raise my rent to an unfair amount. I am scared that I'm going to injure myself and I could really use some help.

TLDR : I'm in bad accommodation and am facing possible long term health problems and it is making consider harming myself."
464,Scary Thoughts,"I often have thoughts of myself falling down the stairs and cracking my skull open or stumbling into oncoming traffic, things like that. It seems to happen several times a day and I just space out of just think of my death and how the scene would look. It gets really scary sometimes, especially I’m alone and I’m suddenly realize that I could just make a little mistake and it would lead to my death and nobody would notice for hours. I don’t know how to deal with this."
465,I feel like my shell has gotten too thick to crack,"Ive been masking my emotions and true feelings since middle school. Im 19 now. I grew up as an insecure kid obsessed with being popular and cool and afraid of rejection and being bullied. I guess having shitty parents and a narcissist brother didnt help. But idk ive been lying to everybody about my deepest passions and putting on a front and hiding my genuine feelings for so long that I feel like the person I was supposed to be has faded away so much that im just a shell. 

I dont know who I am anymore, I dont like anything or have any strong emotions about anything. I dont get excited about the girls I like or show any interest to them or just friends in general, not just because im afraid but because I have no clue how. Ive tried before and I have no idea what to say or what to do and it doesnt come off the way I want or something. It kind of feels like trying to stick two magnets together that attract away from each other, its just impossible and the more I try the more resistance there is. Idk what im typing about anymore, im just salty that I cant get close to anybody or have people know who I really am even though I dont either. 

Does anybody know what im talking about? Is there a way to recover from this? I genuinely feel like all my true interests and passions were buried under my facade and now I cant recover my true self..."
466,Resilience,"Hi all,

I wanted to ask a question about resilience. I'm an 18 year old who has just finished high school and decided to take a year off to work and eventually travel. With the recent pandemic, the travel is sort of off the table at the moment, so my year is looking like it will consist of purely working and no study. At the beginning of the year, my mental health took a big drop. I've always suffered with chronic, moderate anxiety, but leaving high school not having a job with the whole year ahead of me really made me worry and become anxious again. This stemmed a lot from feeling aimless and lonely, which I filled with attempts to validate myself which always were unhealthy (e.g. continuously dating people even though I knew I wasn't ready, obsessing over boys and how people looked at me etc.). My genuine connections became less important when compared to self-validation, coupled with drinking which obviously didn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a job I'm in a better place, yet I have been thinking whether I should start university 6 months earlier (in June) than originally planned since my travel plans have been corrupted by COVID-19. Thankfully, I've learnt a lot about myself in the past 4 or so months in terms of learning to live without study and how to effectively deal with various types of adversity. My question is (finally lol), is this something that would build resilience for me, and more broadly, how important do you think resilience is in becoming the best person you can be in terms of your mental health? Should I go back to study early or continue on a more independent path of working full-time, even if I know it's going to be more difficult?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long story but it's something that I would love to get input on, please let me know any questions or further details if my story is not specific enough or confusing. Love you all ! &lt;3"
467,Giving back to the community!,"Hi! The start of the COVID-19 scare made me extremely anxious and due to all that therapy, I was able to manage it (somehow!) I know a lot of people are dealing with tough feelings due to this and wanted to provide something to the community. 

So, I'm creating a newsletter that I'll send out every week dealing with one specific topic- overwhelming feelings, depression due to the virus, etc. (I'll take topics from folks.)

Here's how the newsletter will look:
- A few lines on what I'll talk about 
- 3 tips for management
- journalling prompts
- Link to a meditation that helps me manage the issue for me (not regular)

If you're interested, just submit on this form: https://forms.gle/3dB8CnNE7W3X7JvK8

Do note: I don't intend to make any profit. I have had anxiety and depression for 7 years and through this expertise, I want to highlight the importance of mental health management. I have a page on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/notesonakinderself?igshid=1u6dvbf4il8hm), also NO profit."
468,Self Worth Help?,"i’ve always had issues with my self worth and now i finally want to work on it and heal myself. however, a major obstacle that i’m currently dealing with is the fact that i suppressed these emotions and now i don’t know how to bring them back to the surface. 

i know that i’m good enough and that i’m worth something but it’s still there. what’s something that you think would help me bring this issue back to the surface to heal and address it once and for all? i know that this will be a long process so any advice is appreciated!"
469,why is my brother so awkward?,"we have a very loving and open communication family. my brother is 12 and he is so shy? even with me... i speak to him all the time and try todo activities. we see eachother everyday.

he just loves to play his playstation games. he is really awkward, he doesn’t make eye contact and when he walks he has a forward head posture and he never smiles. he is always moody. 

i don’t know.. what can i do? how do i make him more comfortable? and more open? it’s like he’s closed off and only feels happy when he plays games. 

my mum and dad have tried to send him to football club or boxing and he always cries or throws a tantrum. he doesn’t get bullied.. and he has friends at school. he never says anything about school. some days he is happy and cracks jokes. but then he is always with people...

he is quite tall and slim... and i feel like he doesn’t walk properly... he walks weirdly. i do point it out so he becomes more aware but he says he walks fine. idk if this is because he always plays games?

thanks"
470,I dont like Myself,"I like all others, not Myself. I care about people but not Myself. Im ugly, Akward to be with, lazy and hates Psysical/fysical Activity and exercise. I cant forgive Myself and it feels like i do everything wrong even tho i do not. Everyone hates me, i can feel it. Shure there is 1 person outside my familj that likes me and probably more, but i just hate Myself!!!! Why am i so lazy, ugly and Why do i hate healthy foods and exercise. I dont deserve to live."
471,what the fuck is wrong with me?,"I've been diagnosed by a doctor with depression, anxiety, and OCD- but I feel like I have something else that just isn't explained by these.

I'm incredibly sensitive. if someone is even slightly rude to me, I'm thinking about it all day. if someone is just straight up mean to me or yells at me, i get like devastated by it. I'll cry for hours, even if i dont know the person who said it. I have a lot of self esteem issues because of this. I have almost like PTSD symptoms regarding these really stupid encounters. If someone is cruel to me, i will remember it forever and it will come up when I'm trying to sleep, and i end up not being able to sleep until i'm literally exhausted. 

I always feel like I'm in a fog. I can't think well and there are times where I can't think of the words for what I want to say. Talking is like a chore, and I;m constantly pausing to get my thoughts straight and think of the words I need to use to get my point across. Also I make a lot of stupid mistakes with fact checking and stuff and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot every time.

whenever someone is talking to me, I zone out. I'll start to think about something else, like trauma in my past. People get mad at me because I don't really listen to them. I can get the gist of what they're saying, and if someone is like ""ok then what did I just say?"" i can summarize what they were saying but I never get the important details. Also sometimes, I will ask someone something and they will give me an answer, and then I will ask them the same question a few minutes later because i dont remember what they said. 

It's almost impossible for me to get started doing chores. It will take hours for me to get up the drive to do it, and I'm miserable the whole day because i dread doing it. 

Some doctors have said I might have BPD or bipolar but I just dont feel like I fit those? maybe BPD when I was a young teen, because I got angry very easily when I felt someone was being rude to me, but I don't lash out anymore like I did back then. However, I do still feel extremely low when I get yelled at and it drives to me having ""S-word"" thoughts, and in the past they have made me attempt to actually do it. (don't worry about that happening to me now though, I'm in a place where I'm very happy, and I don't have to interact with the public)

Obviously I'm not looking for a diagnosis from you guys, but if you guys have any ideas of what it could be I'd like to talk to a doctor about it and get their opinion."
472,Is it normal for the brain to forget certain traumatic memories?,"Recently I’ve realized that I have no memory or can’t recall certain traumatic memories and I can only remember them when something triggers me.

Usually when something like that triggers me I would start choking on air, I feel like there’s a knot tied in my throat and I would start crying.

Is that normal?"
473,Volunteering opportunities during COVID for mental health,"I would like to volunteer during COVID to help people dealing with mental health issues. I'm not a trained psychologist and I am looking for efforts to tackle the mental health issues with evidence based approaches. 

Are there any organized efforts led by mental health professionals? So far I haven't been able to find anything.

Thank you!"
474,is it normal hearing some kind of light switch noise out of nowhere?,"I dont know what this might be, but I frequently hear switching noises anywhere I go, is this normal?"
475,Obsession,"My insecurity is taking over and I see myself spiralling. My partner is going to be working closely with an attractive girl and I can't stop feeling insecure and jealous. I keep on thinking about the various possibilities. I guess it's because I met him at work too and know how long the hours can be and people do get close (there's not a lot of staff). I know the girls name and I can't stop searching for her online, just so I can see... It's ridiculous and I hate myself for it, but for some reason I can't stop. My mental health is not doing very well anyway, I have been dealing with depression and not feeling my best, there's also the stress of university. I want to throw myself into something that makes me happy and feel good as a person, something where I'm not thinking about what I look like, but I don't have the time at the moment. I'm venting on here instead of searching for the girl at work, I will try and put a stop to these behaviours today, just wanted to get this off of my chest."
476,How do I tell my parents?,So I’ve been feeling depressed for quite a few months now and I’ve gone to a counselor about it and she said i was showing many symptoms of depression and anxiety so i was gonna go to my university’s doctor but because of corona my uni has closed down and I’m flying back home. I haven’t told my parents about this yet and I’m not sure how or what to tell them now that I don’t have an official diagnosis or anything yet. It’s not that they won’t understand but I really would have liked for it to be confirmed before telling them because in my own head I’m still not sure if I’m being dramatic or if it’s an actual problem.
477,anxiety when loved ones are on the airplane,"okay so i have severe anxiety when it comes to loved ones and whenever i’m traveling i get panic attacks on the airplane during take off, my brother studies abroad and is coming on holiday and i feel so anxious and worried it’s eating me up, there’s like this pit in my stomach and i can’t seem to get up and do anything ☹️"
478,COVID-19 Anxiety,"I know pretty much everyone in every part of the world is dealing with this right now, I know I'm not the only one. But like, there is so many things changing because this Coronavirus and it's not helping the slightest. I'm stressed out 24/7, not sure what will come next. Every day, every hour there seems to be new news about COVID-19. My work even just switched to to-go only model. Just lots of things happening at once. Sorry for the rant."
479,How can I cope with isolation during this COVID-19 crisis?,"I'm a 17 year old guy, turning 18 next month. My high school is closed for 3 weeks and my musical has been postponed. My parents are both at a fairly high risk for this virus, so they're taking social distancing extremely seriously. I am not allowed to go out except to the store. The thing is, I depend on the social interactions I have with my friends to keep my mental health OK. My therapist is not responding to my emails, so I can't really talk to him. 



But anyway, seeing my friends in person is what keeps me from completely breaking down. Every time I have a vacation from school and I dont see my friends for a week, my mental health decreases drastically. So not seeing them for a minimum of 3 weeks is going to take a serious toll on me, so much so that I'm not sure I'll be able to handle it. Especially because I'm only seeing my parents, and we don't exactly get along too well. Does anyone here have suggestions for how to keep myself from having a complete breakdown? Being social is such a big thing for me that I really do degrade when I can't be social, especially in terms of face-to-face social interaction. Thanks in advance."
480,Anger problems,"I have some really hard anger issues, littlest of things bother me very much and I just snap. At times I get really really frustrated and angry and I want to strangle them. This usually happens with my mother because she's always nagging me, questioning me and irritating the fuck outta me for pettiest things. 


I do a lot for her, I take care of the whole house which includes cleaning, cooking, taking care of the dogs, making their food, cleaning up after them, taking them for a walk, taking care of her, buying her meds. My dad is usually out of state for work. I stay off college most of the times ans study from home. Sometimes when I go to college, I come home hungry and she rarely makes food, always I have to order food from outside at like 3 pm in the noon. I'm tired of her. I'm loosing my patience. I want to just leave the house."
481,I hate talking about mental illness to others,"I don’t want to talk about depression or anxiety because both have become a popular trend to have. 

It took me 4 years to build up the courage tell my mom that I was depressed, and she just scoffed at me and told me to get over it because she had it a million times worse when she was a kid. 

I can’t tell anyone I know because it all just feels like a game of 1-Up, as if it’s just a competition to see who has the darkest thoughts, or who’s had it worse in life. I know there’s millions of others suffering from these diseases, so I just keep quiet about it because I just assume everyone’s going through something. 

I wish there was a way I could break this mindset."
482,I can't get myself to go into work.,"For some reason, every morning I drive all the way to work and get here 5 minutes early at minimum. I'm ready to head in, then I just can't get myself to get out of the car, and I end up sitting in there for 20+ minutes.

I don't know exactly why. Part of it might just be because I'm tired and hungry in the morning and don't have time to get something to eat. I work fast food and I haven't beem written up or anything yet, but this has been going on for a couple weeks since I first started. Could I get some advice on either how to get myself out of the car, or advice on what might be causing my problem?"
483,Feeling not enough.,"I hate days where you feel not good looking enough or days where you don't feel cool enough. As a teenager I spent a lot of time feeling insecure for not looking a certain way to becoming 20 and learning to love myself more, but every once in awhile, I get hit by something that makes me feel terrible about my face and body. I've stayed away from social media all the time / stopped paying attention to things that make me feel less than but sometimes it just happens.

486,Mental health going downhill fast,"I swear I can't go on anymore! Too many expectations in my life and because of the coronavirus situation, this is going to cause a significant delay and by then I'll be screwed anyways. I wanted to get started on something in June but now it may not be until the end of the year or maybe even next year. 

I feel like I've not only disappointed myself, but I've disappointed everyone else too. I'm just a huge failure that can never be happy! 

And it doesn't help that everyone is talking about the coronavirus at my job (I work at a grocery store) and I really want to go on a mental leave for 3 months but I can't cause even people at home talk about it too so that doesn't help the situation, otherwise I would just take that leave and get away from it all for 3 months.

I need to self-isolate for the next few weeks, so I’ll be all alone. This is going to absolutely destroy my mental health, as if I haven’t been bad already ... I don’t think any pills or treatments exist to heal this pain and turmoil right now. Not to mention all the other personal issues I’ve had to deal with that have been deteriorating me both mentally and physically. The world has gone to shit, I won’t even bother getting into everything that has happened so far this year because you all already know. Any ounce of positivity I had is all gone now. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel because every day seems to get worse, to the point now where I wake up daily thinking ‘what horrible thing will happen to me today?’ 

But all we can do is pray. May god be with us all."

491,I feel like everything is falling apart.,"I have been experiencing a large amount of anxiety recently.  and depressive symptoms. My mom died last year from drug related reasons , and it has been very hard since. Though recently its been particularly hard
I finally confronted my dad about going to therapy, and he was okay with it. But because of COVID19 many of the offices near me have closed. 

My girlfriend has been distancing herself from me, and barely seems to show any interest or sympathy for me at all.

Ive had 4 friends in the past week become hospitalized from suicide attempts.

I don't know how to cope with everything going on. Once I finally reached out for help , I am not able to get it. I have no motivation for school anymore even though I am graduating this year, it has become very hard for me to do any school work.

I am not suicidal, but all of this has affected me physcially. mentally, and socially. I feel like I've caused distress with my friends, especially with my girlfriend. 

I just dont know how to handle my emotions anymore. I'm constantly crying, and I feel like people don't respect me anymore because of it.

494,Starting a new subreddit on feeling... feeling life to it’s full extent (Subreddit: LivingWide),"Hello everybody. Recently I made a post about feeling life to it’s full extent, and how we can all start the process of opening up and allowing ourselves to feel again. It got a lot of really positive responses (and i’ll add it to the bottom in case anyone would like to read it) but i’ve created a sub reddit. For us. For those who have the power to truly feel their way through life. Or maybe need a little bit of guidance.

The subreddit is called LivingWide. This is a term that’s fairly new to me that I love to use. I think it really shows what it means to open up and allow yourself to really feel the full extent of life. And yes, when we do this, when we allow ourselves to feel everything, it can hurt. of course it will hurt. some of it will take a long, long time to fully process and manage. But i have been doing this for about a year now and i can promise you that when you allow yourself to feel everything, little by little, life becomes such a beautiful  and colorful place. 
I want to help people. I don’t want anyone to shut down and not allow themselves to feel anything. I’ve seen it too many times. We are human. We need to feel. 
If you think this could be a helpful community for you, please please check it out. thank you
Here is the original post: 

Whoever’s reading this, please promise me one thing: that you will allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling to it’s full extent. always. I know it can hurt. i know. but you have to allow yourself to open up and live wide. let others in even if they don’t do the same. feel the light in people’s eyes as you feel the sun on your face. don’t shut down or hide if something is hurting you. it takes a lot of time but eventually you will be able to appreciate the fact that you are feeling, even if it’s a really shitty feeling. 
     I was hospitalized back in march. for a month. and i was out of school for three months. and a lot of “feelings” went through my head. and at first i was overmedicated and couldn’t really feel that much at all. and this was right after having the most intense feelings i’ve ever felt. i remember being there in the hospital and i remember what it felt like. i remember what it felt like before i was in there, too. and after, i didn’t really allow myself to feel that much again. because the pain just wasn’t bearable. but time heals all wounds. i promise. whoever’s out there, whatever you’re going through, continue to feel whatever it is that you’re feeling and let yourself truly and fully heal. we’re going to be okay. we’re all going to be okay"
495,Self Isolating is what I do when I'm incredibly depressed... and now it's required of me,"Honestly, I'm terrified. I've been in a bad place lately for a lot of reasons, and one of my major tells when I'm getting really bad is I start to ignore everyone and hole up in my room and do nothing all day. I love it, in a way. I'm a recovering agoraphobe. But it also eats away at me. I don't do anything productive, anything that needs to be done. Anxiety starts to gnaw at me; if no one can see me or interact with me, maybe they'll realize how bad I am and start to hate me. I wallow in my own depression and filth and laziness. If I could survive without working or interacting with anyone I think I absolutely would, but I would also be incredibly depressed.

Now, with this virus, it's required to self isolate. It's been 4 days for me, and I'm not sure if I can take it any more. I asked one of my friends if I could hang out, just the two of us no big gathering, and she shamed me and called me ""selfish"" and that I could handle being ""a little lonely"" for a while for the sake of the world. I know she's right but she doesn't get how hard this is for me. I'm not doing well. I've spent the morning crying, wondering how I'll get through this without ruining any and all progress I've made and reverting back to where I was 5 years ago, when the agoraphobia was at its worst. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.."

Haven’t been showering like I should be, my room is a mess still have to fold laundry, etc. Today I got into an argument with my mother because I hadn’t taken a shower in a couple days and she can’t understand why I have such an issue with doing basic things even though it’s motivation related and I’ve told her that. Now I just feel like I’m not capable of doing anything by myself. I don’t really know what I’m looking for making this post. I think I just needed to vent in a safe space. Thanks"
499,My psychiatrist fights my refills.,"Hi, everyone

This is a rant more than anything, but if anyone has any input or advice it would be appreciated. 

I have chronic depression and bipolar disorder. I take an antidepressant and mood stabilizer. These meds have worked wonders for my mental health and I have been taking them for the past few months.

But, every time I try to get a refill of my medication through my doctor's office (which is also a formulary), my psychiatrist tries to talk me into going to a different clinic and getting my prescription filled elsewhere. This is because I don't have insurance. He shames me for not having health insurance and I don't understand why. I pay for my medication and appointments out of pocket because it's cheaper than paying for insurance.

I am on day three without my medication and the withdrawals are causing my mental health to deteriorate. It is a fight every month to get my refill and I'm sick of it. My doctor does not advocate for me and I feel like I'm doing something wrong by having to take medication for my mental health."
500,I’m an Introvert but have to deal with annoying extroverts in school.,"Please read if you have the time :)

So I’m in my second last year of school and I don’t mind lessons too much, but I’m currently having a difficult time dealing with friends and people I know. Most of the people in my group of friends push each other around, shove people behind doors, grab people etc. but I just want to chill. There’s like a select 3 people (who I consider mostly assholes) that will do this a lot (although it never happens to them because they’re too big) and a few others who join in. 

I just find this shit immature and want to chill. It’s no problem if they want to do it between each other and leave me out of it, but I always end up getting dragged into it. Me and one of my friends usually just sit and try to chill whilst everyone else fucks about like idiots but because we are sitting down, this makes us both easy targets.

This shit just really gets me down and causes me anxiety. I don’t know what to do and I can’t exactly just join a whole new friend group randomly. I already strongly dislike school and this just makes me absolutely hate it. I just want to feel happy and anxiety-free again."

502,Had an argument over my self esteem with my boyfriend and haven’t heard from him in over 2 days. It has taken a real toll on me.,"I don’t really want to go into the details of the argument. But I’m worried and sad and can’t sleep not knowing what he’s thinking or what to do. That on top of being stuck in the house with this corona mess is driving me insane. He’s pretty much my best friend and the only person I turn to for all of my problems. He listens and he’s caring and is just an all around amazing person. But, not knowing when or if I’ll hear from him is just making my chest tighten up and I can’t stop crying when I’m alone. I’ve never really felt this alone until all of this hit at once. 

I’ve never been in a silent treatment before, and I can’t really talk to him first because I don’t think he’ll respond. I’m fine with wanting a break, I just wish he had told me that before disappearing. All of this is just making me feel so alone and anxious. It almost makes me feel like I’ve lost the one thing I cared about and the one thing that cared about me. But no stupid old me had to have a low self esteem and run him off. I probably deserve this amongst other things. Good job me."
503,my hallucinations. part 1. (not sure if this belongs here),"my sleep hallucinations.
def: hypnagogic hallucinations are imagined sensations that seem very real. They occur as a person is falling asleep, and are also referred to as sleep hallucinations.

often when i am falling asleep i will experience sleep hallucinations, these hallucinations seem very real to me and often include dissociation. my hallucinations have started to happen outside of my this but in this entry i will be discussing my sleep related ones only. i will be reporting these in sections as the types of hallucinations i experience differ greatly. there are only really three true parts to my sleep hallucination side of this tho.

Fake Conversations and Situations.
my first memory of one of these sleep hallucinations happened long before my drug use, i was on facetime to a group of friends and started to drift off slowly. i ended up in this half asleep- half awake dreamy state, having a conversation with somebody who was no longer even in the call- i genuinely believed me and this person were having a conversation and i spoke out loud so everybody in the call heard. i eventually snapped out of this state and completely woke up when i started to realise that this wasn’t actually happening at all, i was very scared by this. i tried to laugh along with my friends as i explained to them what had just happened but on the inside i was absolutely terrified. this started happening irregularly and unpredictably over the course of the next couple of years. i can’t lie when i say that my drug use seems to have increased the amount of times i have these kind of hallucinations. these have stopped becoming just out loud talking and sometimes are/include: visuals, scenarios(such as being in a rocket ship?), auditory hallucinations and texting people with disorganised words that really make no sense? like literal word salad messages that only make sense to me but clearly make no sense by the time i’ve woken up and are conscious again.

EPS (exploding head syndrome)
this one is by far the easiest to explain and actually is a rather common condition. sometimes when i’m falling asleep i will experience loud noises such as banging or bombs exploding in my head along with my body being completely paralysed while i am conscious. this feeling is scary and uncomfortable but has started to bother me less because i know exactly what it is when it happens.

“The phone thing”
the phone thing is similar to my the fake conversations/ scenario part of this because it’s in the same dreamy state. my eyes will be shut and i will genuinely believe that i am typing on my phone in my head. like i will see the phone and see myself and the other person typing although often the texts seem very disorganised and sometimes don’t make much sense. this will sometimes lead me to ignore people’s messages for long periods of time because i believe i am already having a conversation with them.

all of these things happen between once or twice a week at least? sometimes i’ll go a while without having them and sometimes they’ll happen several times a night.

not entirely sure if this belongs here? would honestly just like to hear stories from others as a means of clarification or see if i can get a bit of help? wrote this for myself first but thought maybe it would be a good idea to post about it?"
504,Anyone here who lost a loved one to suicide?,"Hi! Any parents here who lost their child because of suicide? Specifically those who lost their only child.

I'm an only child and planning to end my life soon. As you all know, the only reason most suicidal persons hold on to life is because we don't want our parents to be sad.

I know you were devastated,but I wanna know how you guys dealt with. 

How long did you grieve? 
How painful was it? 
Was it bearable? 
How long did it take before you accepted what happened?
Did you blame yourself?
Did it make you suicidal too? Because that's one of my fears as well. My parents might end their lives too if I end mine.."

I have the worst memory imaginable. Especially short term, I hate myself and other people.

I feel like my life is a cage, I’m stuck in it. I have no clue where to go. I don’t know why I have no drive or ambition to accomplish anything anymore.

509,How do I best help my boyfriend?,"I have ADHD and my boyfriend has depression, possibly caused by ADHD too but he refuses to get tested for it. We have a great relationship overall. He’s kind and supportive of me and I can tell he genuinely wants to get better but doesn’t know how. 

His depression used to be really bad but we got through it together and it’s been a bit better. Which is great! I’m so so proud of him! However, because of his depression hitting him in his teens and the way his family was ran he never really learned the be an adult. He knows how to save and stuff but getting help around the house is like pulling teeth. Getting him to do or try anything he doesn’t want to do is difficult. Which I understand because my adhd makes it hard for me to but I went to therapy and got meds. He refuses to try either and putting a strain on our relationship. 

I want him to be happy and confident that he can preform basic tasks but I’m not sure how to do that without forcing him to do things like laundry or cook very basic meals. I try to help walk him through it but he’ll just stop in the middle and make me finish. If I wasn’t the only one working this wouldn’t be an issue but I am. I work most days and he’ll volunteer to do things around the house but when the time comes he falls through. For example I asked him to do the laundry last week and he never did so now I’m putting it way while washing another load because now we have more laundry. I just want to be able to rely on him and help him gain the confidence he needs to be an adult but I don’t know how."

They buy expensive things for everyone except themselves, even their parent who really treats them poorly. I’m kind of worried about it. I think they should treat themselves more and they should be in their #1 spot but I can’t convince them, they say their friends are family will be always #1.

I had hoped to go to residential treatment but was only approved for eating disorder IOP and the waitlist is 1-2 months. I ended up in the ER on Thursday because I've also been abusing benadryl and I  collapsed and my dad called 911. She said the most dangerous place for me to be is the ER. So now I feel like I might already have it. The only thing she could offer is to not leave my house for the foreseeable future (which doesn't matter anyway, my county has a shelter in place order) and mailing me Zyprexa to stimulate my appetite. But the thing is I'm too scared to take Zyprexa. I know it will make me gain weight rapidly. The only ED resource I had, a weekly group, is now cancelled.

I was deppressed for 3 days where i couldnt get up from my bed to go to the bathroom and i was very determined to commit suicide. My apetite was shit and i barely ate. My medication didnt affect my apetite before i felt deppressed. I lost alot of interest and pleasure for the days. After the days i started to feel better but the saddnes struck me some day and i was feeling down again. Some other days i feelt very much more confident in socialising with people but i dont think i ever felt manic, but ive had days where i felt extremely good and happy. And that was only the length of one or 2 days. My dad is bipolar type 2 hypermania and i suspect iam developing it. Can bipolar people have short episodes that only get to half a week? Ive had periods where i isolated myself from people in months and then being social again. Could it be my adhd or something else or am i normal. im so fucking confused of whats happening to me or whats wrong with me.

And, to put it as short as possible because I am currently terrified of what id to come, she is being being very vocal about how is unable to handle the isolation and that she very well might try to end her life. Her mother has refused to let her have any visitors (the main visitor being myself), and i told my partner that she and i needed to respect that. The last thing i want to do is cause her mother stress because I know that this all comes from a place of worry for the well-being of her family. With that, my partner is now stuck at home alone dealing with being isolated with her depression and I am so incredibly terrified that she may do something and I have not even the ability to go see her for just two seconds.

516,Workbook,"Is there a workbook that you would recommend for grief related trauma, depression, anxiety and/or body image issues?"
517,"Some possible tips for dealing with isolation during the COVID crisis, whether you are depressed or not.","Hi Everyone,

This is a difficult time for many people, whether they have mental health issues or not.  I've noticed several people posting and asking about how to deal with the isolation/lack of being able to socialize during this time.  If you are also dealing with depression, keeping yourself isolated can be even harder, no matter where you are in your recovery process.  So here are a few ideas to help you through the tough times, and hopefully help you deal with isolation.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded. 

Keep (or start) a routine of some kind, even if it has to be amended due to closures and cancellations. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, schedule activities for yourself, go to bed at the same time, etc. Schedules can help reduce stress, help us keep our focus, spread our activities over each day, so that we aren't over loaded one day, and under scheduled another day, and helps us stay organized.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.  As I mentioned, I have been seeing others post about this concern about the isolation related to the virus, so have a scroll through the other posts, and comment to some one else who is in the same boat, saying 'hi', chat and see if you have something in common, or like the same sport, or music, or books, or some small connection, and then keep in touch and/or 'chat' with the others on this sub. Maybe people can all make some new online friends that need some socialization to feel a bit better during this tough time.  I get it is different than real life, but it's at least a little way you could try and get some socialization.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

Here are some types of Relaxation techniques you could try-----

**Relaxation techniques----** (I prefer # 2 &amp; 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

518,Relating my situation to a song,"I came across an artist, Alec Benjamin. I started listening to his songs and kind of got hooked on a couple of them. One of them is ""mind is a prison.""
Whenever I listen to them I kinda feel low though but still reminds of not doing something such as overthinking. 
Just wanted to share this cause I don't think so any of my friends listen to his songs. Plus I don't if it's a good idea to listening to them daily."

521,Has anyone here reported their abuser? What was the outcome? If you have any knowledge or experience I would really appreciate any advice,"trigger warning for assault and rape.

It's already been... I think 3 years by now? Or almost? I have PTSD so my timeline is fuzzy and I'm working to reorganize my brain. But point is it feels like it's been too long to report what happened, my bf tells me it's not but idk how the police would see it.

Ex bf did stuff like gripping my arms too hard when I'm trying to get away and leaving bruises, throwing me across the room, throwing stuff at me (left a huge welt on the back of my head once), general intimidation,  touching me inappropriately in public when I tried shrugging him off of me, and then eventually it just escalated into him well I guess raping me but there was one specific incident where I fully 100% believe turned into rape while the other incidents I feel like I didn't speak up enough. This incident involved him hurting my back and me screaming to get him to stop, I said ""stop"", and he said some straight bullshit - ""no one is going to hear you scream"". And he was fucking right, because we had screaming fights often where ik the neighbors heard and beard me crying but yeah no one did anything about it not even me. So anyway I have nerve damage on a few inch spot on my back from that specific incident. 

My stomach is getting all twisty thinking about that. It is the main reason I wanted to report him to the police and report that this was something someone did to me. Otherwise I'm paying the medical bills for it, if it can even be treated which my doc said I'd have to see a specialist if I wanted it to be looked at further, and that's extremely unfair. He also cheated on me, I believe gave me chlamydia but that's also something I'm unsure about. Overall he was not a good person, not to me at least, and very manipulative and untrustworthy. Idk if any of this is enough to report him and idk what would come of reporting him or if it's even worth it. And I would like him to have a record so future people interacting him can possibly find out what he's capable of. I feel like he's a monster walking around freely. I don't really have proof and I don't expect him to go to jail or whatever but I just want justice I guess??? As much justice as one could get in this type of situation?"
522,Please wait," 

Reposting some of this, hopefully this will resonate and help someone else, please, if you have no one else to talk to PM me, Wait, just wait, just until someone replies to you.

I'm a multiple suicide attempt survivor. Don't ignore the signs. I wouldn't have tried to gas myself in my car x 4 if someone had read the signs, (I'm going to my car and gassing myself, can you feed my dogs?), real subtle! If someone had reached out I would not have tried to kill myself, all those times.

I have depression, I have tried to commit suicide at least 5 times, usually triggered by emotional events in my life. I am lucky to live in a country with socialised healthcare and I am within walking distance of a hospital.

My last 2 attempts I stopped and walked to the hospital and got counseling which stopped me. I was just lonely, sad and down, triggered by some relationship stuff at the wrong time.

Please, please, this is an illness. You should not feel ashamed about your mental illness, there should be no more stigma about it than asthma or diabetes. It is an illness and needs to be treated. Your local GP, or hospital or any other health professional will not treat you like a leper, you are an ill person and will be treated like any other ill person who needs professional help."

524,Today in Therapy,"My therapist and I went deeper into the idea of ""the Bully"" today. The basics are that sometimes you have a thought, but it isn't really what YOU think. It may be something you learned from societal pressures or something like that. So when you have that thought of ""I'm useless, I can't do anything right"", blame the bully. My Bully is a couple named Karen and Brad. But today we talked about a new sort of bully. The one for depression, who tells you thinks like ""It doesn't matter anyway, so why bother?"" You know, when you NEED to do laundry, but you just can't be bothered to care. I named her Shelby, and you know what my therapist said? He said ""Don't just ignore Shelby. Hear her out. Let her say her piece, and then decide if you actually trust her. Because sometimes Shelby makes a good point, but only sometimes. There are times when you actually do need to stop trying to clean or be productive and take a nap. It's good for you. But Shelby wants you to do that all the time and you know that's not helpful. Be suspicious of Shelby."" 

And frankly, I want that on a t-shirt. 

Be suspicious of Shelby, friends.
And remember, you don't want Karen and Brad's money anyway."
525,"Do I have something wrong with me or am I just ""touchy"""," 

Everytime certain people touch me or my things I get this weird ""feeling"", like their mark is on me somehow and I can't get it off. People say Im a germophobe but I dont think about the bacteria themselves or getting sick, I just think about the essence or feeling of that person getting on me. So I always ask my mom not to step on my guitar wire or my ""still-good"" clothes when coming into my room, but she just does it anyway, and I just inexplicably cringe and get this painful rage, which I dont externalize, I just get irritated or exhausted and sigh at her ""please dont step on my things"", to which she usually just denies it or says ""sorry"" indignantly. Another example, earlier she knocked on my door and opened it and barged in, which cancels out the politeness of knocking so why even bother knocking. Anyway, I was in here recovering from an awkward day at school and she just startles me, and touches my doorknob (the latter of which being what made me really uncomfortable).One time my dad patted me on the shoulder and I just instinctively put my left hand in my sleeve and rubbed his touch off the shoulder when i thought he wasnt looking, but he saw and I got chewed out for being touchy and hurting peoples feelings all the time. everyone's been telling me I have to stop being so touchy. Ive never really tried explaining it to them, apart from asking them not to touch me, bc i feel like im just making it up, but they keep getting mad at me and saying Im too touchy and i dont know how to stop having this feeling. Also, if the person doing it is a friend, or a stranger that has evident hygiene, I dont get uncomfortable. Its only with family members (except for one of my brothers and my sister who i never fight with, so maybe that has something to do with it) and people i dont find appealing. So how do i get rid of this."
526,I managed to get on a mental health hold twice in two months,"I recently got out of a mental hospital in February, after a seven day stay (it was a 5150 that turned into a 5250, that's a 14 day hold but didn't have to stay the full 14 days), and I only got out by lying through my teeth that I wasn't suicidal anymore (I still suffer from suicidal thoughts).  It was a pretty terrible place and I thought all that crap was done with but I managed to get on yet another 5150 hold just two days ago.   Luckily I got sent to a crisis center instead and they discharged me after I told them I had no plan for suicide.   But I still managed to get on a hold so soon after getting out of a nuthouse.  The psych social worker who put the hold on me even said she put the hold on me because I was in the ER again so soon after getting out of a mental hospital.  So now I can't even go for help ever because I'm going to get locked up and punished again, which just makes my situation worse. What the hell am I supposed to do?"

528,memory loss?,"over the past few months i've noticed my memory is getting progressively worse, i know it's normal as you age but i'm only 15 and i can't remember anything i did last week. it makes schoolwork really difficult and everything just so much more frustrating. i think ""oh i need to text this person"" then a second later right as i pick up my phone i forget what i needed to do. 

is this a result of my anxiety or is it normal?if so are there any ways to improve my memorization?"
529,Terrible thing I did.,"when I was young, like 12 or 13 i would go on omegle and other online forums looking for guys way older than me to talk to cause i was lonely and sexually confused. one time I found this guy and he liked incest. He wanted to do things with his son and daughter. I forget their ages but I know it was young. Like way young. I honestly do not remember most of what we talked about or said but I remember he told me he had his son in his room or something and was doing things to his son sexually and that he was telling his son how we wants him to have sex with me. I dont remember how it made me feel initially I just know I got super uncomfortable and left. It's been like 7 or 8 years but I cant stop thinking about how I probably contributed to that child's abuse and I feel so fucking shitty that I could participate in that especially since I've suffered from child abuse. I also struggle with pocd and it just makes things worse."

I think it's linked to the Venlafaxine but i'm not sure on the exact date that my periods started becoming longer. It's rather annoying but not a huge deal . I guess i'm more curious than anything.

* Menstrual irregularities such as increased bleeding or increased irregular bleeding."
532,COVID19 and self harm?,"Hello
I’m a 23 year old female whose struggled with SH for a while now. My biggest triggers are anxiety surrounding being in and having control, and self hate towards myself. I guess that all somewhat ties together. 
I’m hoping fellow Redditors can give me some advice on avoiding self harm with everything going on now. I still have a job (as of today) but all I can think about is losing my income, not being able to eat, getting kicked out of my home. Then it starts turning to darker worries; what if i can’t fill my prescription, what if my diabetic dad catches covid and dies, what if society crashes all together....

Maybe valid worries, but not doing me much help stewing on it. I woke up for the first time in a few months with the urge to self harm again to gain back some control. I know other people are probably feeling the same way as me. If anyone has anyone words of advice, tips, or tricks that work for them it would be greatly appreciated. Or if anyone just wants to talk about how they’ve been  feeling feel free to message me. 🖤"
533,Help me please.,"I'm becoming more and more violent every day, since the 9th of march, I'm starting to feel like I'm going to hurt someone, and I'm scared to even leave my house at this point.

In my own dreams I've seen myself do unspeakable things to make people suffer.

I'm typically a person who wants good in the world for everyone, but now all I feel is anger.

Please, I need help and I'm too afraid to get it in person because I feel like I'm going to hurt someone."
534,"I can't stand it when people say ""stop apologizing"" or ""don't tell me you're sorr"" or really anything that is against me saying sorry;","I'm not talking about the times where you shouldn't feel sorry for. I am talking about the times where people scream and yell at you, then yell at you MORE for saying sorry. Fucking unstable bastards, what else do you want me to say? Every situation where this happens was after something MINOR. Yet they act like I killed their whole family or did something immoral. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I  get snarky and be like ""well fine then, fuck you. Is that better?"". What do you want me to say???? These people are bonkers, more bonkers than I'd ever be. Fucking... Getting so worked up, calling me names, screaming, trying to hit me, all because of tiny shit that literally do not mater. 

if it was something big, I'd care. But i fucking get attacked for being human. I get attacked over tiny shit that a normal person wouldn't freak out over. Goddamn. I hate being told I'm shit over things simple as putting a dish in the wrong cabinet. 

You know what's wild? Everyone who ever does this to me are older than me. I turned 18 last year. Was screamed at the most by my sister during that time, who was 24. Nowadays, I deal with it from my roommate sometimes, who is 28. Though, he has bipolar disorder and you cant tell by the way he talks/acts that he isn't sane-of-mind during the freak-outs. He also apologizes hours later. Compared to my sister, who wouldn't care regardless. Miserable druggie.

Still, I hate dealing with it."
535,I can’t help your mental health if mine is just as bad,"Over the past two weeks I’ve been dealing with an insane amount of people texting me asking if they can just vent. I don’t know how to say no. My girlfriend has especially been going nuts about how shitty her mental health is. She’s been saying things like “I’m becoming a background character in your life.” How do I explain to her that the more she talks about her horrible mental health, the worse mine gets? I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, major depression, and social anxiety. And with her telling me that she needs me in her life, that puts so much pressure on me. Things like “I’ve never felt this was towards anyone before.” seem so sweet to others, but I just can’t handle it. I just don’t know how to tell her that I can’t constantly listen to her venting."
536,I am scared,I’m currently a freshman in college and my spring semester just got canceled. So now everything is going to be online.

I just feel extremely anxious and sad about the coronavirus. I’ve never seen anything like this before. These are scary scary times.
537,Whats happened Recently,"Hi my name is Loui. If you're reading this the chances are you sorted by new and I just wanted to tell what has been the worst days of my life for me. I just hope that someone will see this and may just relate and feel not alone. 

Let's start from the beginning. I met a girl through an app called Yubo. We talked for a month before deciding to meet in person in December 2019. That day was I can say was one of the happiest days of my life and I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes. Over the last couple months we fell in love and met up quite. a few times. My parents didn't like her, well my dad wanted me to get rid of her and never speak again, while my step mum was dubious about the situation. Over a few weeks, my parents brainwashed me into dumping her. At first I was ok, with this and she was heart broken. It was only last Friday when she decided to hang out with a guy I was told not to worry about. They went and did the exact same thing we did on one of our dates. Same place, same meal after. This then sent me down a road of self destruction. I started having panic attacks, crying my eyes out and self harm. this was 2 weeks after we had broken up. Then Saturday night I laid in bed at night considering ending it all. I didn't because I had hope she would take me back. I then spoke to her and on Monday I asked is she had caught feelings for this new guy. She responded yes. I was broken. I didn't know what to do. I still don't. Last night again I laid in bed crying my eyes out and proceeded to punch myself in the face, calling myself worthless, useless and that I shouldn't be alive. I managed to get through today but I don't know about the rest of tonight or even tomorrow. I have no one left anymore and it makes me wonder where do I go from here. 

Any response will be appreciated.

Thank you"
538,Baby Steps,"This past week has been really stressful for me, but I’ve made a couple steps in the right direction for my well-being and for that I’m really proud of myself. :)

My body image hasn’t been good since I was about 12 so that’s around 4 years. However, I slowly stopped having proper lunches all together over this past year since I don’t really have much of an appetite around lunch time anyway, but even when I do think about maybe buying some lunch my body image goes completely out of whack and I end up feeling way too guilty and shit about myself to have a meal - so then I’ll just either buy a small snack or wait until dinner. However, on Thursday, there was a themed day in the school cafeteria, and the food looked REALLY good and I was in a decently good mood, so for once I finally thought “you know what? fuck it” and bought the lunch. It was curly fries, onion rings, a hot dog and a caramel popcorn brownie with ice cream. So - compared to usually not eating a meal, that was a pretty huge deal for me. I haven’t eaten a proper lunch since then, but still.

Also, on Sunday I went for a walk, and for the first time in MONTHS, almost a whole YEAR, I went out in public without makeup. There weren’t nearly as many people outside as usual due to coronavirus so it’s not like many people would see me anyway but that’s still a MASSIVE deal for me, I’m usually WAY WAY WAY too anxious and terrified to go out in the open with no makeup on. I’m not saying makeup is a bad thing, but I feel like more often than not, I’m wearing it for the wrong reasons, doing it to hide my insecurities because I secretly hate myself rather than doing it because I like to do it or because it makes me feel good.

So yeah, though they were small, things happened this week that I wouldn’t imagine happening for a long time. So yeah, I’m proud. And no one can take that away from me. :)"

i mean he talks to himself in the mirror, fully convinced it's another person. dissociation, 
but sometimes the reflection is doing other things, that bmo is not doing

that one episode when the world is in black and white and bmo is interacting with house hold appliances and animals pretending to solve a mystery, could be imaginative or totally delusional probably disconnected from reality and i think that's psychosis

and that one time finn and jake weren't talking , using signs instead and he was fully convinced they were replaced by aliens or some other shit like that, he isolated himself in a hole in the wall and starting rocking back and forth, probably catatonia

what could any of this mean? is he psychotic?? or am I reading into this way too much?

544,How to solve Anhedonia?,"Anhedonia is causing me so much pain now, I feel helplessly stuck in its grasps, all psychologists have been useless and I can't go to any different ines anymore, what do I do?"
545,"Can't enjoy anything I do or make, can't open up to my friends.","This is a very long ramble/rant and I apologize, but it just all needs to get out of my head and go *somewhere*, and maybe I could find some answers or advice by putting it out there, because quite frankly this is ridiculous and I'm tired of it. Rest assured I have no desire to die, but this is a daily thing and I want it to stop, and don't know how to convince myself. Everything is a debate or an argument for me, including when my opponent is myself, and I don't have sufficient counterpoints to win. I won't blame you for skimming, and I've provided a **TL;DR** near the end.

I think it started when I met one of my friends. He used to be abusive (he isn't anymore and feels endlessly remorseful about who he used to be and has improved, he isn't a concern currently, so for now I'll be talking about what he did in his old state that is now gone.) Before that point, I remember being very open, expressive, and loved what I made. Which, for reference, is art, writing, and characters.

To all of my friends, I was still emotionally open and would make comments about how much I loved/valued them, would comfort and support them, etc. I really looked up to my abusive friend specifically, because he seemed very 'cool.' Collected, alluringly distant, and an amazing sense of humor. So I ended up becoming very attached to him.

However, he was remarkably judgmental of my interests and would frequently shame them and me, for example putting down my preference of drawing animals instead of humans, putting down my non-human characters as inferior to his, dismissing the games I liked, etc. But still I think I was fairly happy and open, just not so much with my interests, which was fine at the time; his personality otherwise was enough to outweigh that caveat.

Well, one day he suddenly logged off of our primary platform. Me, bubbly and unaware and wanting to hang out with my best of friends, as well as figuring it was a joke of sorts since our friend group would sometimes tease each other by blocking or leaving and then coming back

 I messaged him on another platform, playfully teasing him while expressing my fondness for his company. His reply was seething, declaring me annoying and instructing me to not bother him anymore. Not just for that message, but in general.

I know and acknowledge that this is a fairly minor thing that *really* shouldn't have had much of an impact, but regardless of how unreasonable or disproportionate my reaction was, it happened. 

Being directly told that I was unbearably annoying by someone I looked up to as much as I did, in a moment where I was completely vulnerable and expressing nothing but my affection and appreciation for them, wounded me and made me completely shut down and change as a person. I would hide everything about myself, from my feelings to my interests, to make everything all about him. Whatever he was interested in would dictate the current topic, and my interests (that I was open about) could only be related to his, because I could be confident that they didn't bore or annoy him. I stopped showing him my art and characters out of internal shame, and would change or deflect the subject ifever he brought them up. I would never initiate conversation with him and would instead wait for him to come to me, out of fear of annoying him and losing his friendship. It all became a mask of sorts that I had to don around him and the other people in that friend group.

What further exacerbated this problem, is before him I had another childhood friend who I often talked to and had known for several years. She had her issues as well as I, but we were open with each other. Around the time I met the abusive friend, she had to cut contact for months due to an array of troubles at home. So with the loss of the one friend I could be myself around, I had to wear the mask almost all of the time; there *were* no other friends to get a break with, or talk to.

Over time I got more comfortable in the mask than outside of it; being secretive, aloof, and mocking the concept of expressing affection was becoming second nature. So much so that when my childhood friend *did* finally get to contact me again, I had changed too much, and we couldn't relate anymore. Where we used to be happy, bubbly, and open with each other, I now had the ingrained instinct to be distant and dismissive. We've never had a significant conversation since before she left.

Years of upholding this attitude passed. I'd say it became first nature. I found that being distant protected not only my interests and feelings, but everything. As long as I was numb and unfeeling, as long as I never acknowledged emotion, I would never be hurt. I learned to divert any thoughts of sadness or other negativity to the point where they never appeared to begin with.

To my friends and to myself, I had become the cool, collected, amusing, and alluringly distant friend who never lost control, had a great sense of humor, and never bothered anyone. And thus was the reputation I had to maintain, I decided. To admit anything else would be taken as weakness.

But a lot of time has passed, and I've come to notice some things and changes. Where this was originally a mask that I could take off and relax from, it seems to have become stuck, so to say. Even anonymously, even among people who have no idea who I am or was, the defenses I've built for someone who's no longer a concern remained.

I have new friends, now. The formerly abusive one is the only one who stayed with me out of that old friend group, and he's changed. Even he has discarded his cool facade in favor of opening up to me about all of his troubles, spending long nights talking and crying to me about everything, being completely vulnerable. But even seeing this display of full and complete trust in me to not judge him or strike when he was weak was not enough for me to lower my own defenses. I simply can not fathom the idea of trusting someone else to offer this same service to me that I did to him, and I can not bring myself to be openly supportive or emotional, even when it's absolutely needed.

One night, I thought he had taken his own life. I cried to myself in secrecy, *but even that was not enough for me to say something supportive or show emotion to him*, which I did berate myself plenty for. The eternal suspicion and defensiveness affects everything that I say and think. I'm always worried that I'm being played for a fool, lured into a false sense of security or safety just to be suddenly wounded. And in a way, my mind felt justified in it's caution, because he *didn't* kill himself, as he revealed a few days later. *If I would have dropped the defenses and shown vulnerability then, I would have been made a fool of*, my mind decided, despite how absolutely stupid and selfish that is.

My new friends are a stark contrast to myself and the old friend. They're open about their troubles and their support and their emotions and their interests. They show off their creations confidently, and what they make is so amazing and inspirational to me. They're fun and caring, and don't judge me beyond a little playful teasing, which we all do to each other in good fun. But even then, knowing this, even knowing that they admire and appreciate what I do show, even knowing they care about me as a person, I still can not be wholly open, either with my feelings or with my interests.

I would never say what I just said about them to them directly. To do so would be making myself vulnerable, and I can't bear the thought of being wounded again.

I have to nearly force myself to show off anything I'm invested in, whether it's media or what I've made. And when I do show it, I still have to act dismissive and distant from it, out of fear of them thinking what I love (and by extension, me) is stupid, worthless, or otherwise not up to their standards. Furthermore, I still can't offer my friends emotional support.

Albeit weathered, the defenses and worries remain, and over time have even festered into all new creatures.

Recently, three of my friends met up together. As other than this all of our connections are online, this knocked out three people I often spoke to as they were naturally more occupied with enjoying each other's company for the duration of their visit, leaving me with an unusual amount of alone time to think. From this experience I've discovered a few things.

* I rely very heavily on my friends, which conflicts with the aloof attitude that suggests otherwise.
* This is because I evidently require at least daily social interaction with someone in order to distract myself from my own mind. I think this is due to a formed habit/reliance from usually talking to someone for lengthy periods every day (between having a sizable friend group and most of them, and myself, enjoying very long VCs.)
* When given too much time to think and nothing to think about, I will turn on myself. Unless expressed or released in some way, these thoughts will persist undeterred and distract me from all other tasks.

As I mentioned, I used to be very good at diverting negative thoughts. It became so normal that it was no longer a conscious effort. I think either the 'dam' has broken, or I've simply fallen out of practice, because I can not seem to shelf the negative, paranoid thoughts that are now plaguing me. In fact, they seem to be becoming more aggressive, coming right back the moment I'm alone and not occupied by a task that requires **all** of my focus.

Now not only am I assaulted by fears about what could happen ifever I was vulnerable around anyone, regardless of how unfounded, but by fears of being left behind. Because of all of my issues, my mind's newest worry is that I'm perceived as an extremely dispensable person.

I don't show any of what I'm invested in, I don't initiate conversations, and I don't make super personal connections, and I'm just not very interesting all-around compared to some of my friends. The biggest thing I provide is humor, jokes, entertainment, and distractions.

My mind is trying to convince me that now that my friends are starting to meet with each other and are extremely happy with each other, I will ultimately be deemed boring and repetitive, and left behind by all of them. Being left alone means alone with my mind, which is a thought that sickens me, as it would mean a constant battering of paranoid thoughts without distraction unless I can re-train myself to divert them.

These two worries conflict; the fear of being left behind and dismissed, and the fear of forming attachments and being hurt again, and the constant internal argument between them is wearing me down. I know that being hurt is a part of life, but I'm terrified of it. I desperately long to lower the defenses, stop worrying, enjoy what I love openly and happily, and trust my friends; it's all the most appealing thing I could think of.

But the fear of someone I admire, including my friends, dismissing it as worthless, or hurting me when I open up to them again, shatters me instantly. I've posted a piece my writing before- a very, very personal, emotional piece that I was even proud of- and had an idol of mine just *jokingly tease* that it gave them secondhand embarrassment, and even that *still* destroyed me all over again.

I'm extremely frail but have the reputation and front of being tough, and I don't know what to do. I just want to be able to relax, trust, and truly enjoy what I make, but I'm always stopped by my own paranoia. I've started entering a loop of deciding what I make is never good enough for me to show off, and I just keep scrapping and remaking it. I can't even *force* myself to begin to extend beyond or open up my defenses; I've tried when I'm anonymous and have no risk to my existing connections or persona, and even then, I just can't, no matter how much I want to. I don't know how to do anything without feeling unbearably awkward, embarrassed, or uncomfortable.

**Tl;DR**: Way too overly worried about being ridiculed, which prevents me from being confident and comfortable in what I make, as well as paranoid about being hurt for being vulnerable, despite both of these fears being unnecessary in my current surroundings. No idea how to get over them and move on. Frustrated, tired, sad. Any input is welcome.

Some notes:

* Seeking any professional help is out of the question. Other my own obvious unwillingness to be vulnerable, I'm trapped with very unsupportive parents who are entirely in control of my situation for reasons I don't want to get into. Any solutions or advice should ideally be things I can do on my own.
* ""Just do it, it'll be fine"" is an appealing thought, and one that I've tried. The fear physically overwhelms me, and I stop and retract into the tried-and-true safety net. I know that I shouldn't, but knowing it and doing it are two separate things, apparently. This also goes for things like ""just break through and talk to your friends.""
* ""Just do what you like and don't worry about what others say"" is also an appealing thought. That's what was going through my head when I put my heart and soul into that written piece and had it be insulted by someone I idolized. This is all-around a difficult thing for me to do, it seems, as this is the approach I've tried and failed several times. I see what my friends make and can't help but find it so much more interesting and better-made than my own crafts, thus the shame and paranoia comes back, and I go back into the safety net.
* ""Your new friends will definitely not act like the old one."" I know. I believe it. But again, the fear never completely leaves, and if I try to put all of my trust in them, it will overwhelm me and pull me back again.
* ""Talk to the one who originally hurt you."" It was *so* long ago, and he already feels bad about who he used to be and what he's done, I don't want to make him feel even more guilty by opening up about how he seems to have caused all of this to his longest, closest friend. He's diagnosed with mental illnesses and suicidal tendencies, so I don't think this is a productive venture.
* ""This is all incredibly minor and it's dumb that you're worked up over it."" I know, and I've tried to tell myself that, too. Mind can't seem to trump matter here, which is part of where my annoyance and frustration comes from, since I can usually logic my way out of issues like this.

Even now as I force myself to post this, I find I'm bracing for someone to say I'm stupid, haha. I may indeed be stupid, but I'm in this situation regardless and also getting desperate. This is the only way I can think of to get some external input to perhaps sway the argument and ground my mind."
546,Anybody else w/anxiety NOT worried about coronavirus?,"I’m a very anxious person, always dealt with anxiety and depression throughout  my 25 years. During Hurricane Harvey in Texas, my therapist told me I thrive under urgent situations because it’s what my anxiety has prepared me for all these years and I was the one in my family staying on top of things. I didn’t think much of it but maybe she was on to something. 
I live in Mass. now and we are working remotely because my job caters to only elderly people. There’s a lot of changes and urgency in trying to keep our elders safe and equipped to stay home safely. I am chillin though. I’m not worried (yet), I don’t feel scared of what may come, thankfully don’t feel scared of losing my job right now. My boyfriend is a little more anxious in wanting to go to the grocery store every day to buy stuff we may need. But I am totally fine. Just wondering if maybe anyone else with anxiety has been feeling this way? Perhaps it’s the years of learning to cope with anxiety or fight/flight situations?"

553,I'm sorry but I feel really low and I need to rant about it.,"So 2020? I start a career I've always wanted to start making good money, that gets fucked by this outbreak. So that's left me unable to pay my bills, or even eat. What little I do have goes to support my child (which I truly don't mind) leaving me completely without. I don't even get to see my son due to my malicious ex, he's 9 months old this month.

I haven't fucking eaten in about a week, my entire fucking substanance is tap water at the moment and what little tea and coffee I have left.

I've started talking to a girl but she's losing interest in me because she thinks I'm not interested as every penny I have goes to my kid (which again I'm fine with, just annoyed they're taking every penny).

I've had a dream job torn from me because of an outbreak, I'm skint, so hungry I'm actually in pain, will probably lose my custody battle as I won't be able to afford my fucking child support and when I finally have a chance to move on that gets fucked over by my shitty situation.

Just as everything is getting better it all falls to shit.

I can't even pay my rent so I'll probably lose my house 

I deleted Facebook almost a week ago and not a single friend has reached out to make sure I'm okay; I received one message and it was to ask me for money. 

Then I try doing something truly altruistic and decided to apply to do the Covid-19 medical trials, I get in, and people just assume I'm only doing it for attention, or am just lying outright even though I keep repeatedly showing people the stonewall evidence that I'm not. 

I just want to end my life. Hunger hurts more than anything, I miss my boy so fucking much, I can't seem to even hold myself together and last week a rope broke so I can't even kill myself properly.

I'm pathetic, a truly awful father as I'm not there, and I only deserve the true end of death. Hell, I likely will be on the streets to soon.

I feel very emotionally numb and when I get drunk I suddenly start crying about everything and I can't stop talking about things that have been bothering me during the day, even small trivial things. I also have noticed that I have trouble noticing and reacting when someone is bothering me in my everyday life. I mean, I notice it somehow subconsciously but don't understand that I feel anger.

I really overthink EVERYTHING and I know I have a problem but I want to recover and be like everyone else... I feel like my boyfriend is very careful when joking around me now and I feel terrible..... because we have talked about this but this is something I have to solve by myself.

Here's the original email I sent to the charity. If you have a minute, please have a read and let me what you think is up, how I could help etc.   


*""I’m emailing because recently I met up with an old acquaintance from uni, her name’s \[let's call her Sami\], and immediately when we started hanging out in person, I noticed she was very much not herself. She was talking to herself, consistently mumbling, laughing… her personal hygiene wasn’t great, and she wasn’t able to actually hold a conversation. When I asked her a question, she’d trail out mid sentence and go back to mumbling, and the things she had to contribute to conversation made me feel like she wasn’t that well-connected to reality.*

*Her mother came to drop her off to our hangout which was a bit of a red flag, and she explained to me that Sami wasn’t very well, but it wasn’t until her mother left, and Sami and I started trying to talk that I really saw how badly unwell she was. When the time came for our hangout to end (we were at a restaurant), she went to go back to her mother, but I didn’t actually feel comfortable leaving her to walk the streets alone even though she had a destination that was round the corner (her mum was just shopping nearby).*

*Sami’s not that close-a friend of mine, I’ve only known her a few years, and can count the number of times we’ve spoken on one hand. She’s usually very intelligent, thoughtful, sharp, and jokey. Completely different to who she is now. What’s more, she’d never said anything in the past about having any kind of underlying disorder or condition, so this was a complete shock.*

Pardon the crude analogy, but I feel as if I'd need to relieve a lot of sexual tension and I know I could just masturbate in that case... I could really use that kind of mechanism right now for my emotions though. But unless some conditions are met, I have trouble crying.
Even if I'm really sad or troubled like I am now, I still need something specifically hurtful to me happening so I can cry.

560,I'm Addicted To My Anxiety,"Anxiety is a normal part of the human experience. It evolved as a tool we could use to detect threats in our environment and adjust our thoughts and behaviors accordingly to ensure our safety. When functioning properly it can be an effective warning system. Healthy anxiety is merely a form of information that we can analyze and act on if we see fit.

Chronic, excessive anxiety is something else entirely. It floods our body with unnaturally high levels of cortisol and adrenaline for extended periods of time. It can wear down our immune systems and overwhelm us psychologically. Uncontrolled and superabundant anxiety can be like a giant maniacal spider, snatching our every thought and spinning each into its darkest iteration.

We may be in a state of constant worry, obsessing over past mistakes and fretting about what lies in store for us in the future. It may become difficult to leave the house, speak to other people or trust our own decision making. Our worst fears, however outlandish, may seem always on the verge of coming to fruition.

I’ve lived with chronic anxiety my entire life. It ebbs and flows, but it’s always there, a shadow I can’t ever seem to shake. Sometimes it would be so bad it would feel like my brain was on fire. I was afraid of everything, all the time. Getting through the day was a feat of extreme mental and emotional endurance. From the moment I woke up all I could think about was slipping back into bed and receiving the temporary reprieve of sleep.

These days my anxiety is consistent, but stable. I’m never comfortable. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without shifting positions. Leaving the house requires some serious psychological prep-time. My brain isn’t on fire, but it itches. And yet I’m rarely in serious distress. I don’t have the flu. It’s a low-grade fever.

There are even rare moments I feel no anxiety whatsoever. These are the moments when I panic. If I’m not feeling anxious then something is really wrong. It’s only logical that when anxiety is your baseline, no anxiety is an indicator that something has changed, and maybe not for the better. So when these moments come I hold my breath and wait for the other shoe to drop. Feeling okay? That’s not okay.

I’ve actually grown fond of my anxiety. I rely on it. It gives me energy. It gives me focus. Unless my depression has totally taken me over, I’m ready and raring to go. Fight-or-flight. Do-or-die. The intensity of this psychological state is addictive. Every day life can be dull. Anxiety gives it teeth. There have been times when I would purposely get myself wound up before going in for a shift at work. I needed my juice to get through the day.

Who would I be without my anxiety? Calm, chill, relaxed? Someone who can take the time to think things through rationally and who doesn’t overreact or respond impulsively? Someone who could take the energy spent on excessive worry and put it towards things that are more healthy, productive and positive? That doesn’t sound so bad, actually. But I would really miss the rush. Anxiety makes me feel like a soldier in a war zone. And I like it.

What can I say, I’m addicted to my anxiety. I’m addicted to the hormone high. I think I’ve lived with it too long. Out of a desperate need to cope, I developed a toxic, dysfunctional way of relating to my illness. It’s holding on to me, and I’m holding on just as tightly to it.

This needs to end. It won’t be easy. This is an addiction and a mental illness rolled into one. But it’s possible. The first step would be to say:

*Sorry, anxiety, I’m just not that into you anymore*"
561,Panic attacks,"I’m a 20F student and lately I’ve got pain on my chest, my heart is racing and my breathing gets fast when I feel anxious. Now with the self quarantine it gets even worse because I don’t have a rhythm in my day schedule anymore. I have got this for a few months now and I think they’re panic attacks. It happens when I think about a subject that gives me anxiety a lot especially when I’m alone. I don’t really know what to do, but I really want it to go away.

563,Can someone help me with figuring out what is going on with these feelings?,"I made a similar post a while ago and the commenters helped me in deciding that I was probably having a rough time with my Bipolar. I've started taking my meds again and some things have vastly improved whilst others haven't.

Right now I often get so angry at everything. Someone says the wrong thing - I'm pissed off, something takes too long - I'm pissed off, I think the wrong thing - I'm pissed off or if I get something wrong - I'm pissed off. And not just mildly annoyed; I've been containing it mostly but when I can't I'll throw into a fit of rage. I'll throw, flip and destroy everything I cam while I feel angry. In the past I've attacked people when I've been so angry and put people in hospital only to later get angry soon after because I feel so stupid about it. Right now I don't know how the world works and it's unfair, though I'm too scared to tell anyone unless they say it is fair and I'm just a little bitch or something. I've considered killing myself a lot over these past couple of weeks. Though I can't do that as I don't believe I actually want that. Though I do often want to seriously injure other people and think about it whenever I'm angry, which is very often. When I'm calm I'm fine and feel guilty as hell for some of the things I think or do but I feel liable to do something dangerous soon. I can't talk to anyone as I know they'd either not listen or they'd charge me with every crime they can, lock me away and throw away the key, testament to the world's unfairness. I hate to say it but I loosely plan acts of terrorism in my head while I'm in this angry state. I can't win, I'm pissed off, I break nearly everything I own and I want to kill myself when I'm not breaking something.

I want to cry, I wish I could cry. I can't and I don't know why God can't give me that courtesy. 8 years, I hate my mother, I hate her boyfriend, I hate the people I live with, I hate my life and I could say I'm going to do something but I'll probably just swallow this shit whole, have it go unspoken of and carry round this shit like a stone in my shoe hoping to God each day I'm alive isn't one I kill someone."

566,Finding Myself After Breakup,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to come on here and share what I've been going through lately. The past couple of months have been excruciating. I guess the downward spiral began when my boyfriend left me. He manipulated me and put me through a lot of mental agony. He cut off communication all of a sudden and didn't tell me why he ended things. He would text me a little bit, call me, but would always make excuses about why he couldn't see me. Eventually, I told him that sending time together is important for me, to which he replied in a gibberish text days later. 2 months later, with barely any communication, he texted me at 1:30 AM saying that he saw no future with me which is why he treated me like this. I definitely got the hint before, but I guess I was hoping that he'd come back. 

After he left, I felt like something was wrong with me. For the past two months, I was confused and mainly blamed myself. I couldn't function or do anything; I even didn't eat some days. I think that I was depressed. I went into a research frenzy, trying to make excuses for him and went deep into psychology, like reading about attachment theories, anxiety, etc. I guess I was just trying to cope. I tried so hard to let him and the memories go, and I still do, but images keep flashing in my mind from our time together and I can't stop them. Even though I know that he is toxic, I want him back, and the fact that I want him back makes me more depressed because I then blame myself. I tell myself that I am not self-sufficient or strong enough to be content with who I am. 

Now, I want to get back to who I was before I met him. I was very motivated, focused, and genuinely happy, even though I was alone. I am trying to finish my assignments that I have put off (semester papers), but still don't have the motivation to do anything. It's like I can't find meaning outside of him. 

Any thoughts? I know this is a lot, but any help would be much appreciated :)"

I can’t deal with the stress of being myself, dealing with my past and trying to get through in a country and a world so toxic. I can’t forgive the people that fucked me over. I can’t forgive myself for letting people fuck me over. I don’t want to fucking feel anything anymore."
568,How do I start to fix this?,"I’m a 20 year old female currently living with my boyfriend. I work for him as a photo editor but no work is coming in right now due to the virus. I don’t know if I’ve fully faced some of the things that can be going on for me mentally, but I want to start to try and fix it. I knew there have been plenty of periods of time in my life where I felt happy, productive, motivated, and energized.

I’m currently feeling super avoidant in life. I need to get my license but avoid driving because I get all anxious and worked up. I’ve been studying life and emotional intelligence coaching for the past year or so and I want to start working with people, but I avoid that because phone calls and FaceTime makes me feel anxious and I just feel like I don’t have the energy to face any of it or move forward in life at all. I also feel like who am I to coach someone else when I’m currently feeling like such shit myself. 

I feel like I can’t take even the tiniest bit of criticism without being destroyed and beating myself up so much, and I have moments where I feel like I’m being criticized when the person tries to make it clear I shouldn’t feel that way. I’m just so sensitive and sometimes it really sucks. I’m a highly sensitive person (read more in r/hsp) and I feel stuck in this place where everything just feels like it’s too much to try and achieve.

I just feel such little motivation or energy. My only motivation right now is to not bring my boyfriend down with me. I’ll bake him cookies to show him I’m still showing up but I find anything I do throughout the day it’s really just for him. Outside of that I don’t feel any motivation at all. 

When I start to feel this way my relationship with food gets so shitty, too. I really don’t like the way I my body looks, I’m not overweight but I’m not super tight and toned. I also struggle with acne a bit and I know food affects this. I get really anxious and eventually just feeling depressed after eating certain foods like pizza or ice cream. I used to just throw it up when my anxiety about it got to that level but I live with my boyfriend now and would feel so embarrassed if he ever caught me doing that, and so then I just feel depressed about eating it in the first place. I find myself eating more when I’m not hungry when I’m not feeling great mentally. Sometimes if something comes up and makes me sad enough to take away my appetite completely I almost feel relieved that I don’t want to eat. 

I try to exercise once a day to keep my body moving but outside of that I find myself doing something for my partner or just sitting on the couch, on my phone or watching Netflix. I try to tell myself “why don’t you practice Spanish” or “why don’t you read that book you’ve been meaning to get to” but I just don’t feel the energy or motivation. I feel so weighed down and just trapped at this point. 

In high school I was a high performing AP student who was always busy and sleep deprived, working insanely hard all the time. I don’t know what happened to that person, I feel no energy or motivation and I used to work myself so hard, where did it all go? What’s happened to me? I dropped out of college because I was paying to work down a path I didn’t even want to be on but I feel like I’m stuck. I guess I just need help and advice on where to start, what to do. I know everything is connected, but I don’t know how to approach it all and put the life back into myself. I just need help clearing it all up I guess."
569,I'm afraid I'll never be happy again,"Since childhood I have struggled with mental illness and as time goes on, the light at the end of the tunnel dims. I remember when I used to be totally unaware of myself, carefree and content. It was so long ago that I honestly don't know if I'll ever feel like that again. I used to love other people, going outside, and playing. Now I can barely get out of bed or take care of myself. I'm so depressed that I can't even take my medication on a regular schedule. School is a nightmare, though I'm out of it right now due to the pandemic. I have body dysmorphia and can't look in the mirror without picking myself apart. I'm losing sight of hope."
570,COVID-19 &amp; My Suicidality,"Hi all,
I wrote a short essay on my experiences so far doing social distancing and shelter in place. I hope it gives people who are feeling similarly some solidarity. And just opens the box for discussion on how people with mental illness conditions can cope and help and also ask for help during these times.

571,Just need to vent a little,"I'm just having a really hard time of things right now. I feel like there isnt a day that goes by where the loneliness and isolation isnt suffocating. I don't remember the last time I went more than two days with crying. It's literally been months. 

I keep getting chest pains, struggling to breathe. Feel sick and anxious constantly. My heart hurts. Like my heart literally aches and it's horrible. 

I'm so so unhappy right now. Theres a little nook in the woods near me that I found before. It's really awkward to get to, so no one else seems to go there. Its quiet, and the scenery is nice, even though it's a bit industrial. It's just a place I get drawn to. I keep thinking about going up there and just ending it. I dont suppose I will, but the thought of it really is bliss. I'd literally love nothing more at this point
I'm so tired of feeling worthless and unwanted. 

I just wish i had someone I felt like I could talk to who might understand, but I really don't. Not a single person. I've thought about counselling but I dont honestly think it's fair of me to take that away from someone else who probably needs it a lot more.

It's just really hard. I dont have any real coping mechanisms. I have no motivation for anything, I cant bring myself to do anything useful anymore. 

I'm just so sick and tired of everything. I'm just exhausted. I just want to be able to sleep and not have to worry about waking up ever again."

The double-standard is crippling and wears on a person eventually. Can’t imagine I’m not the only one feeling like this.

Women can be so oblivious to their own self-absorption it’s actually impressive. 

So without going into details I’ll just leave it at that. Feel free to list your grievances here as for me think I’m gonna just stew in my mind for a bit - y’all be safe."

I reminded her about the virus and she said ""I know"" and ""nah, it'll be fine"". Selfish. Fucking selfish. She could literally put her baby in intensive care (yes, that has happened to a young baby) because she wants get drunk.

I'm worried for my boyfriend's mum who has MS and suspected COPD. He's also scared she is going to die. I may not even see him for months. 

My friend is going back home even though her dad (potentially) and sister's gf have got corona (she has asthma but her mum basically blackmailed her to lol) and I will miss her so much. 

I will have to quit driving lessons I have spent £100s on. I may be on my own for 1 - 2 months or move back to my hometown which gives me severe anxiety. 

I can't concentrate on my uni work. It just all seems irrelevant. 

I will not go on holiday this year.
I will not have graduation this year.
I will not work at my temp job, loosing out on £100s
I may not be able to get a flat. Fuck, even hire a van to do so. 
I will not have a normal final year of uni. 
I am meant to start my masters. 
Or start a job - who knows if this will happen. 


The worst part? I am convinced this will be a regular thing, alike the flu. I will never have a life without covid-19 in it. The world and my life's paradigm has changed. 

The government are shit, and too many people will die. I want to get off."

I feel like empathy for people who annoy me.
I have an extremely violent taste in pornography. Such as r/guro and porn that involves rape, beating, and blood.
I used to kill animals for fun, I don’t anymore. (I have a tender spot for animals)
I threaten people a lot, and non of it is idol threats.

579,We got stuck in different countries because of Corona,"I miss him so much. I just want to be with him right  now. This whole quarantine thing would be much more easier with him. Nothing seems fair anymore in this world. Everthing seems wasting away and there's nothing I can do about it because always somebody else decides for us. I'm trying so hard to be hopeful and positive. I want to see him. 



I know that right now the priority is to be safe and healthy for everyone. I keep reminding myself it'll be okay, it's temporary, I'll be with him soon...But it's getting harder to believe that. It's getting harder to be strong and live the challenge of today for a joy of tomorrow."
580,I self harm and I need help...,"None of my friends know this, but since I (F16) was 10, every time I get angry or sad because of something or someone, I feel the need to hurt myself. I often need to externalize my emotions and I throw them on me to punish me. Mentally I don't really make me feel good but I also bite and hit myself. At every bad event in my life I feel the need to do this because I feel like I deserve it even when I know that it's not my fault.

But today I really made a mistake and I hurt myself with a blade, on my hand until the wrist and I feel so fucking bad. 

I don't want to get addicted, I need help... :'("
581,Has anyone else afraid that they can loose their mind?,"I have a depression for a few years now, but now I feel better generally but every night I get worse.

582,Obsession,"Hello,

I am 23f. I have a history of depression and anxiety. I am also currently 17 wks pregnant. Since I’ve become pregnant, I have become obsessed with looking at my husbands twitter account. He uses it for nudes. I check on it at least 2 times an hour every single day to see if he’s liked any new nudes. 

I know I have insecurity issues that adds to why I check it so much but I just don’t know how to stop. We essentially have no sex like, he’s spends a lot of time playing video games, and I have no social support that is physically present. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t stop obsessing over it and it is definitely having a negative impact on my mental state (sometimes I cry multiple times a day about what I find during my obsessive looking) and a negative impact on my relationship. I just feel so lonely and lost."
583,Mom dosnt care about my #1 trigger,"I know this is fucking stupid but the sound of chewing and forks scraping drives me fucking insane
I'm not talking like a little bit angry either, I'm talking like on the floor kicking and screaming for it to stop. I've literally self harmed in the frenzy of these panic attacks by beating myself in the head and boxing my ears to make the sound stop
She knows this has bothered me for literally 6 years now and whenever I'm forced to come home from school now she dose it like crazy and I have to just leave the room untill she stops and she wont even wait for me to leave the room before she starts doing it 
Seriously does she just not give a fuck about me or something? What the fuck am I suposed to do after I've told her over and over and over and fucking over again"
584,My life is falling apart with nothing to help,"I guess this is more of a rant if anything but I just need to day something, to break it down; I have police on my back for massive crimes I didn't commit my career isn't working out and I find it difficult to continue what I'm doing, I'm pretty sure my relationship is falling apart because of my mental health issues and how I was raised.

I have depression, transient global amnesia, psychosis and something I over came recently but can see myself falling back into easily is drug abuse.

To say the least I honestly just don't feel like life is worth a single fucking second more, the only reason I'm still here is because of my gf, it's just, nothing is working and I'm just tired of life.

Any one else feeling the same?"

590,Ptsd troubles,"I'm will say that I've never been professionally been diagnosed with PTSD, but ever since I was 10 I've been plagued by vivid flash backs and nightmares as well as common panic attacks. Though I have been diagnosed with a eating disorder  and depression, as well as my slowed development. 

As much as I've tried to get my parents to get me diagnosed, they have always refused, and I am legally not allowed to go to a therapist until I'm 17. 

Their refusal is also as to why i possibly have it. 
I've been a victim of abuse for most of my life, though I've only been verbally abused by my parents. 

Its my sister who is the real abuser. She has been physically, verbally and mentally abusive to me, for as long as I can remember, though it started getting bad after my 8th birthday, though it got bad after she broke my wrist when I was 10, which was also the start of my problems.
 
Throughout the years its only gotten worse, until a couple months ago. When she full on attacked me, it was the worst thing she's ever done to me, I am not sure if it's because I can remember it much better than the wrist incident, it was also the first time I tried to fight back. It didn't go well

Ever since then I've taken a toll for the worse, everything has been bad for me, I can't eat properly, or even leave bed some days, I've lost about 15 kg in about 3 and a half months, I haven't talked to any family in a few days, and I haven't talked to friends in about a month. People are starting to worry and I don't know how to explain it to them. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to either get away from my situation, or somehow get better?"

592,Serious question,"I have a question, who in their right minds burns their arm to stop them from self-harming?"
593,"Very confused about my mental state, looking for attention(?)","Hello! I'm not sure how to go about this, nor what I'm hoping to gain here exactly. I was hoping to talk about this in therapy, but my upcoming appointment was canceled. 

I've been in therapy for over a year now, and would just like to say first and foremost I don't think I have any severe mental health issues. I've mentioned lightly about a diagnosis, and he had said if it was necessary he would've/would mention anything. I trust him, and so far we haven't talked about ""what's wrong"" but we've just been talking. Part of me believes it is, truly, better not knowing if I have any sort of illness.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to do my best to explain this, but I'm not sure how well I can. 

At one point, around age 14-15, I had felt like I was trying to give myself a mental illness, or that I was craving a mental illness diagnosis (I struggled with addictive behavior around this time, and feel a lot of shame about this time still). My sadness felt fake (not like a lie, but forced), crying felt fake, or dishonest, or it felt like I was making myself fit a description of depression, or general despair, I would research whatever I could to try to better understand the situation. It felt like I was constantly trying to find reasons to ""prove"" I had an illness, and I definitely found things which I think have had a major impact in my life from the past, but it still felt like I was acting like these things hurt me/caused sadness, when, in reality, they didn't. I think a lot of the feeling was a disconnection, sometimes a nothingness, apathy? It was a really odd time. Upon learning about anxiety, I read, and read about anxiety, and it felt like ""that's it"". Although, I still don't feel like the feeling was anxiety. It's like I saw how many people were struggling with anxiety, and just how much attention they were given, and it's like I craved that, and I tried to prove to myself it was anxiety, which I feel terrible about (I kept most of this to myself, although I thought and though, I tried not to involve others because it felt wrong). After time, going into therapy, and starting to take classes in public school (previously home-schooled) the feeling slowly went away. At one point towards the end of 2019, the best feeling, I just felt genuine. Sadness felt genuine, happiness felt genuine, I wasn't forcing emotions, and I didn't feel like I was craving to be diagnosed with something. I felt content, and connected. At this time, in therapy, I felt like we were making really good progress and some repressed things were starting to surface, and dealing with the feelings felt really good.  

&amp;#x200B;

  But, things started to go downhill. A few weeks of not feeling like myself, trouble thinking, going into a lot of weird and bizarre thoughts, feeling insane, a mix of varying feelings, ended up landing me back to feeling very similarly to before. I feel like a lot of this sounds really disorganized, all over the place, I really don't know how to explain this. I do still feel better than before though, there are much more good days and much more mental clarity. It's almost entirely been internal. 

  For awhile I've gotten back into that mindset, I've been looking at a lot of articles trying to ""figure out"" what's wrong. A thought I had before I've been thinking again, not sure about its legitimacy, but it's like; I want to be diagnosed with something, because if there's nothing wrong with me, that means I'm ""broken"". Or, it's just my personality, or my mentality, which was really distressing. For awhile, I really think it would make a lot of sense if the problem was from anxiety, I think a lot of the things that have been a huge struggle for me have been anxiety related, but I really don't believe it is anxiety. It doesn't feel like it, in my gut. It feels like something in my control. 

&amp;#x200B;

  Right now I've been really thinking that I may have OCD. I've done research, and it feels to me that I'm struggling with, if anything, moderate OCD. Mostly Pure O OCD? There's been a lot of awful thinking, intrusive thinking, and now I'm learning about intrusive feelings? Some thoughts are almost leading me to believe like they aren't intrusive thoughts, but actually my thoughts. My whole state hasn't been necessarily painful, sorrowful, or unbearable, there's just been a lot of overthinking, stress, distress, and frustration. But what I feel that's ""bad"" still ""feels"" like I have control over it. I feel like if someone else decided I had an illness, I could just relax. I would trust what someone else said.

I feel like upon seeing others talk about their struggles, the awful things they experienced and how much I feel sympathy for them, it feels as if I'm trying to find things in my life as to bring sympathy out of others, which also, is really upsetting. Partially feels like I'm trying to compete with others sufferings, saying, ""hey, I'm suffering too!"" even though that's not how it works. My mood and mental clarity is fluctuating a lot, and I'm just feeling very dishonest and fake. Like I'm acting or trying to manipulate others. I've kept most all of this to myself outside of therapy. When I have thoughts about talking about things, usually out of worry that it's something I said above, I've tried to keep things to myself and avoid being toxic.

I'm sorry if this is very unorganized, or if I'm rambling. I know I got very wordy, and this is a lot. If anyone has experienced something similar to this, or have an understanding of this, I'd really appreciate it. I'm not sure if posting here was a good idea on my part, or if this is appropriate, but It's something which I thought was worth doing. Thank you for reading as well!"
594,"Now that I'm functioning well, I feel invisible","My whole life I've dealt with mental illness, and have had a feeling of alienation, of ""differentness"", and I strived to work on myself and my world view in order to feel accepted and normal. Now I work in customer service, I have friends, and everything I thought would make me happy, and while it has brought me great joy I would never give back, it's also made me feel a little empty. Like, all that struggle, everything I've been through, is just overlooked. New people I meet don't see it, and I don't show it. Now, I'm not cured, and I still struggle every day. It's just invisible, because I made it that way. Life just feels a bit... shallow now. Superficial. I have a lot of fun and people (for the most part) like me, but I feel like I'm carrying some secret around with me. If I open up to people, most of them are shocked, or run away, or judge me. It makes me not want to be friends with them. After all this time trying to be accepted, I've learned I don't want to be accepted by the people who judge me anyways. Because they only act like they accept me. People don't know me, and it feels a lonely. Is there anyone here that relates to what I'm saying?"

596,Is this OCD? I am really struggling,"Hello everyone, the past two years of my life have been a major struggle...in fact the most challenging years of my life. This all started from a bad panic attack I got from smoking weed. After this panic attack I experienced dpdr and feared something major was wrong with me. I have becoming obsessed with the idea that something is wrong with me. For two years now I have been researching non stop about what is wrong with me. It reached a point where I was researching a minimum of 8 hours a day (this is when I decided to see a doctor). My idea of a “good time” or “free time” is taking mental illness quizzes online. On my commute to work I am listening to interviews with psychotic people and mental illness information videos. At my job I am listening to these same videos through my AirPods. Within the last two years I have been fully convinced that I am bipolar, schizophrenic, borderline, histrionic personality, psychopath, sociopath, schizoid, manic, and in a state of psychosis...and the list goes on. Keep in mind I have never experienced a break down. My doctor told me that I was not psychotic and seem totally “normal”. This diagnosis made me feel good for about two days and then my fears were back in full swing. I have now been to four doctors who all have assured me that I am healthy and not psychotic. My most recent visit to the psychiatrist informed me that I am not “crazy” and am dealing with OCD. Once again I am doubting this diagnosis and am convinced something is majorly wrong with me. I am still researching because each time I just know I am going to find the answer I am searching for...this is never going to come. I am constantly asking those around me for reassurance with statements like “do I seem sane?” and “Am I crazy?” I cannot stop researching this has consumed my life. Please give me advice on what to do I am miserable."

600,Is it possible to become more emotional?,I went through a lot last year because my dad was in the hospital for a long time (hes fine now and at home) and I realized that I became kinds unemotional over the course of the time. I remember times where I felt very sad about some movie endings but now I just feel next to nothing. I actually want to become more emotional because I think it makes life a lot more interesting so I want to go back to being more emotional. Is this even possible? Any advice is greatly appreciated
601,"I know the truth, please hear me out.","I know the truth, please hear me out.

A Person comes in saying they feel anything atypical, the doctor jumps on the chance and sends them to see a psychiatrist or to a mental hospital.

The hospital is fronting for the government, essentially MK-Ultra II, who then test experimental military drugs and poisons on the victims by mixing them in with food or just saying the pills are something else than given.

This also benefits big pharma because they can test experimental drugs on entrapped people.
If anyone finds out about the conspiracy they are just labeled “delusional” and imprisoned.

Then drugged and poisoned to the point they can’t walk straight or remember their own name so you don’t spread the truth.

Or “Accidentally” overdose you...

I’m sure the NSA has already seen my posts, but they can’t strike too abruptly. The school works with a mental health health clinic, They told the school to send stalkers watching me in school, waiting to kidnap me and silence me. 

I’ve literally seen people follow me around, it’s not a hunch, it’s a fact.

I’m positive my phone is already hacked. 

I suppose the only thing I could do is publicize it, or strike them first before they strike me. 

This is the glitch in the matrix, 
I’ve recognized that the reality most people adhere to...., well, it isn't actual reality. It's a fabricated reality we are raised to ""think"" is authentic. 

I am awake.

I don’t know why people try and call me delusional when something as insane as the original MK-Ultra DID exist. 

What should I do?"

603,im so desperate for answers,i so badly am chasing this feeling i felt today it was nothing at all just nothingness i wasn’t thinking or anything it i just knew i was something. i feel like suicide will set me free and it was a message i always want to prove something is real i want to know we are real and it’s not just a simulation or sum shit and i can’t seem to wrap my brain around this i just feel like it’s the key to open the door to all the answers i’ve had suicidal urges for a while like i wanted it i don’t know why there was just something telling me to do it and then there’s something telling me not to do it. homicidal though are frequent too it’s always the same though i’m on top choking them they are staring me in the eyes and as the life leave their body i feel a way i can’t comprehend i’m stuck battling this constant battle in my head like there’s 2 different thought process (idk the right word) like the urge to cut my eyelids off will pop into my head and then another one will saying don’t or like the urge to cut open my arm and cut the main vein out in one big piece and there there is the thought that says don’t. i feel like i am fighting a battle in my head i always feel like a made a bad choice or i’ll just randomly get déjà vu and i don’t know why i feel like only way to set myself free is suicide. i don’t know what this post it supposed to i’m so desperate for answers i spend all day just in my head
604,I am going to get my life in check,"With the coronavirus canceling everything in life i was looking forward to, school hiking trip, birthday party with my best friends, family trip, getting my braces off, softball and track season (the only sports i like), and other stuff too, i have been really down in the dumps. Yesterday i worked so hard on a project for school i didn’t eat anything all day, didn’t drink water, didn’t go to the bathroom, or do anything but sleep and work on my project. It left me feeling like shit physically and emotionally. So i’ve decided that now that i have online school/spring break for the next 3 weeks at least i am going to improve my life. I am going to work out at least 5 days a week, even if it’s something small like going for a walk with my dog, i will do something active. I am going to eat 3 BALANCED meals every day. Not just fruits and vegetables crammed down my throat. I am going to find meals that i enjoy and are good for me. And i won’t just use some magical diet that’s supposed to fix my life. No i’m going to eat meals that fill me up with everything i need, including the right amount of fats and sugars, in the right proportion. I used to not eat breakfast because i didn’t have time but now classes start later so i want to get in the habit of eating good a breakfast. I refuse to let the coronavirus keep me inside and let it ruin me, instead i will use it as an opportunity to improve my life. I know and accept it won’t happen all at once and some days i’ll slip up, but that’s ok as long as i keep trying. I’ve tried to implement these things in my life before, but i feel like i rushed it too quick and expected to all change at once, which left me unmotivated in about a week. This time I understand and accept it will take a very long time for this all to take place. I hope that i can use these next three weeks or more to start getting myself in the right habits. It won’t be perfect but that’s ok. If you any advice on either how to make this sustainable, or even good things to eat, or good workouts for any part of the body that would be amazing. Thanks!"
605,Has anyone had any success with overcoming mental illness or improving mental health?,"Can anyone who has any success in in improving your mental health offer suggestions or advice that you think could be beneficial? 

I’m trying to avoid the medication route as I’ve not really had much success with it and I’m looking for more natural therapies. I’ve heard that it’s possible to form new/permanent connections or pathways and you can essentially re-wire the brain. I’ve heard of cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapy, so maybe if you know of any specific techniques or resources such as websites or apps that are effective. Maybe hypnosis or meditation would help. 

I’m really struggling and it has become so debilitating. It is affecting so many aspects of my life and I’ve finally reached a breaking point where, out of necessity, I am ready to fight back after years of this.

If this is of any help, I’m a 32 year old. I have experienced some trauma (physical), have had a few major surgeries for medical conditions which were permanently life-changing. As far as mental health goes, I have been diagnosed with a few different things. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated and I’d like to thank you in advance. I hope y’all are staying safe with current health scares and are doing great in general. You all rock 🤟🏻"
606,"""I Love You, Happy Birthday, Good Bye""","I don't know that this is the right sub for this, but I don't think anyone will tell me I'm wrong.

Four years ago, I moved across the country and five months ago, I started a new job. Since I left the old one, everyone that I spent four years getting to know and trying to be the best friend I could be to have stopped talking to me. 

In spite of having to go to my new work, I was very alone today. 

I reached out to my grandparents, and was expecting to hear from my mother at some point, but I never did. She's never been able to hold on to a phone for more than a few weeks and always just replaces it with a new phone and phone number, and she hasn't given me the new one since the last time she lost the phone. So I couldn't find her.

The reason this is important is today is my dad's birthday and the day he died. 

I was 12, and saw him hours before and then went to spend the weekend with my grandparents in another state. 

I have always taken comfort in fact that the last words I ever said to him were ""I Love you, happy birthday, goodbye.""

You can't beat that.

But 19 years later, today was still really rough.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening."
607,I can’t sleep and I feel like garbage,"I’ve been trying to sleep for the past 6 hours, but no matter how tired I feel, I can’t seem to fall asleep. I’ve been running myself ragged for the past little while with work and taking care of things in my home, because no one else will. Now I’ve got 4 days of work in a row that will more than likely be 10-12 hour days. I just want to be able to rest. That’s all."
608,I never realized how much I needed my son until today.,"I don’t usually get overwhelmed like I did earlier. I tend to over think a lot of things, but I can usually work myself out of my own head. This coronavirus thing has had my head spinning over the last week and I’ll admit that some of it is self induced. 

I’m a recently single dad with split custody of my almost 3 year old son. His mother is great and he is very safe and well taken care of when he is with her, so I don’t ever worry about him being with her. I had a vacation planned for last week and I went even with everything virus related seeming to ramp up. I was gone 6 days and while I had a really great and enjoyable vacation, I spent my nights worrying about things at home, mostly worrying about whether or not I had everything at my house to keep me and my boy safe and taken care of. 

I got home late Sunday night and had to work Monday, so after work I finally got a chance to “stock up” and spent over $200 on stuff that we really did need, but it still didn’t make me feel prepared. I got my boy last night and for the most part we had a really good night together last night, and same with most of today. But for some reason my mind started to wander while I was making dinner and I suddenly just fell apart. I all of a sudden just turned my back to the stove and sunk down along the cabinet next to it. 

My son was just playing around in the living room, and I don’t know what lead him to come to me but he did, and when he saw me he just ran and gave me one of the most genuine snuggles I can remember. 

I never really thought about needing him. I’ve known for a long time that he made me a better man than I could have ever been on my own, but it wasn’t until today that I realized how much I need him and his selfless love. I got myself up off the ground and finished making him and I dinner and have spent the rest of the evening just loving on him. 

I still don’t know what I think I need to feel ready for whatever this virus has in store for the world, but I know that no matter what I’ll have this irreplaceable love on my side."
609,Hearing voices at night,"When i was younger, i used to hear a man screaming when I closed my eyes at night to fall asleep, and only during that time, and no i it was not hypnagogic as I was not falling asleep I would literally just close my eyes. I cant remember how long it went on for, maybe a few weeks. On another occasion I heard children laughing when I closed my eyes to sleep.  This stopped for about 8 years and then a few days ago when i closed my eyes to sleep I heard a mans voice say “hi” very clearly, then when i closed them again I heard the same thing in the same tone. Does anyone have ANY idea of this or experience with it."
610,Going Home (Coronavirus),"I am international student in Florida and classes were canceled for the rest of the semester. I wanted to go home because I get really depressed when I'm alone and I don't think I can make it 2 months alone without having a breakdown or recurring to drugs daily again. My family doesnt want me to go home because they say that it is a waste of money and I could get coronavirus on my way home (bus, airport, and airplane). I have been in quarintine for a week and I dont have any symptoms. Should I go home and risk my physical health or stay here and risk my mental health?"
611,Strategies to avoid self harm and perfectionism?,"Hello, I just have a ton of stuff on my head but I really don't feel like writing an essay about why or how I've come to self harm in the first place. Recently, I've been having a lot of impulses to self harm. I recognize the triggers. One of the big ones being having my schedule not go according to plan (This one almost always gets to me) and the second one is feeling ugly or the feeling of not being perfect enough to do anything (not as bad as the first). I'm a major perfectionist and the coronavirus crap is further messing up my routine and mental health. It's ridiculous, I can't believe I'm doing this to myself. It's almost laughable. I've already cut myself several times these past few weeks. I've gotten to the point where even clapping my hands very hard or harming my feet by kicking stuff feels good because I just don't really like myself. I want to get better, this is really embarrassing and I don't want it to get worse... I'm 21 and right now my future looks like crap, this self-harm is bringing me even deeper into this negative spiral. I can't help but think of myself as a stupid loser. While I've only struggled with suicide ideation (which I'm coping with) I hadn't cut myself since I was 12 until now :(

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Strategies to avoid impulsive self harm? How to cope with perfectionism and negative outlooks on the future."
612,Help. I think my friend is depressed,"My friend is going through a very difficult time, and has confided in me that she constantly feels sad and like she doesn't deserve to be alive. She says she's suicidal. I would really like to help her and be a good friend, and would like some advice on what to say and do. I've already told her I will always be there for her, and that she should see a therapist. So, how should I proceed?"
613,You are here.,"This is a message to anyone who needs to read it. Maybe you don't even know you need to. Maybe you've been struggling for years, your whole lifetime or maybe it's just started recently. You've been through so much, so much that others don't know about. Your whole story, your unique experience is, as you know well, only fully and completely understood by yourself. Do you feel empty, hurt, anxious or desperate? Do you feel like you have tried everything humanely possible to feel something? Are you working so hard every day just to function and feel human in someway? Are you lonely? Or maybe you're surrounded by people and you feel even more alone. Maybe you feel like nobody has ever understood or cared or given your experience the time of day. Maybe you've lost someone, or maybe you hurt someone and you're constantly replaying the mistakes you've made. Or you hurt yourself. Do you feel like you're trapped in your own mind and are constantly being tormented? Do you feel as though you're drowning and no one is there to save you?


I hear you. I see you. We understand you. Humans are all creatures driven by pure emotion, our feelings can't be reasoned with or be put into a box. Though we are all intricately unique and our lives are so drastically different, we all suffer. We all hurt and are in pain. This life can be hell. Though I may not physically be near you, I know your struggles, and how close you've felt to giving up all those times. You don't know how connected you truly are, even when you've felt so shut off from the world. And after all those times people have hurt you. This world can be so cruel, and yet you have to call it home. It can be a hostile place for your mind and I see that. 


I want to acknowledge right now how monumental it is that you are here right now, in this moment. That you are existing to see this wherever you are. Take a deep breath, do you feel that? Close your eyes and then open them back up again and look at your surroundings. You are here, and that may seem like very little, but you know it's not. You've stuck around and kept going through all those horrible nights, all those times that you questioned if you could ever be loved or understood. You kept going for your own reasons, maybe that is someone else, or just a curiosity for the future and what could be or a stubbornness to not leave till things are better. Whatever your reason may be, you're doing it. Thank you for being here.


You are valued and so important. You have so much worth that you might not be able to see right now, but let me tell you it is there. You deserve to be happy, and to live a good and full life. You deserve to have your dreams come true and to love and be loved. You deserve to be listened to and supported. 


So here is to you. To seeing another sunset, to having another one of your favorite meals and holding your pets close. To finding your people and healing your wounds. To finding something that you love to do, and sharing it with the world. To someday be in the position to help somebody else."
614,Today I broke,"This fucking pandemic has got me anxious as fuck. I stopped going to the gym this week because my university is closed and the gym i have access to, i would go but i don’t want to risk my family with this fucking bullshit virus. I don’t see any soon end to this and that’s what’s killing me. I need to work out, it has been my only way-out for 1 year and a half. It has cost me shit tons to be consistent and to get results, I feel so much better when lifting weights and even if i’m doing something at home, it’s not the same to workout with a couple of bands and my bodyweight. it’s not enough. I need certainty for one time in my life, if it’s gonna be someday, let it be today. I can’t handle all this anxiety and no way to take it out.

Is anyone going through something similar?"
615,I have a question,"Why do I remember all the mistakes IV made right as I'm going to sleep, I dread sleeping because I don't want to think about these things, is there any way to prevent this?"
616,The coronavirus is honestly paralyzing me in fear.,"I don’t care if I get it. I’m 21, I think I’d be okay. But at 15 I lost my mom and I am paralyzed in fear I’ll lose my dad. Not only would it be an incredibly painful thing mentally, but I’m already mentally ill and need treatment. And I do rely on him financially. His insurance helps me afford my treatment. I’m in trauma therapy over my moms death right now. I can’t imagine how far something like this would set me. I can’t lose him, he’s my dad and I love him. He is a laborer and he does work for the county and they can’t just send everyone home. I’m scared.

I feel numb outside of fear. I’m afraid of losing my summer to this virus. I’m afraid of a lot with this virus. 

I’ve been playing links awakening on my new switch the past few days and that’s the only escape I get. But it feels like I’m just ignoring my problems. 

My job is being unreasonably demanding of me and I feel crushed under the weight of all this. I feel I’m underwater and my vision is blurred and sound is muffled. 

I don’t want to go to work. I want to stay home. I want to sleep. I’m not happy."
617,LSD conditioned me like Pavlov.,"A few months ago I took some LSD and had a horrific experience. I was hearing repeating voices and getting stuck in thought loops. Two months later, about a month ago, I decided to try again. It went just as horribly.

I’ve learned my lesson and I don’t plan on touching that stuff again. The problem I have now is that every time I hear music, especially classical music, I have a momentary panic response that lasts one second or so.

I’ve boiled it down to two particular facets of music that seems to trigger this response reliably; repeated sounds like melodies and drums, as well as the sound of string instruments like violins.

I fucking love classical music! I’d really like to be able to listen to it without getting mild heart attacks every few seconds."
618,Feeling fat lazy and lost....,"Hello. I just need a little bit of advice.
For the the past year me and my partner (currently my carer) have been looking after his little brother and sister while his mum went to work. This was fine as it gave us something to do most days of the week and we got to see them. But she has changed there schools and because its closer to my sister in laws she has asked them to pick the kids up from the new school and mind them. No big deal.
But now im at a place were I feel like im just bored. Im 27 havent got a job (mental health reasosn) i did voulneteer but had to stop when she asked us to mind the kids which was fine. With this virus going around as well theres not much I can do at the moment.
Basically I feel fat (been over eating) lazy and tired as I have no bedtime routine anymore because whats the point if I dont have anything to do.
I know the easiest solution would be to just get out and do something and eat healthier but I have very ltitle motivation to do this. I would make an appintment with doctor as I have recently comenof medication (like a month and a half ago)but again with this virus going around I dont really want to take up any appointments of people who need it.
I dunno what the point of this post is. But some kind words could help?
Thanks
Xxxxx"
619,About to have a mental breakdown,"Wow. This has been a terrible year thus far. Let's see: I got no call back from multiple jobs. Everyone who was here for me has left (eaither to be with someone romantically or they just left me because I'm awful). I got rejected by my crush at the end of last year who is now dating my former best friend.

I really think that she hates me. She turned me down, and then later on, asked out my best friend. After she got with my friend, she told him to stop talking to me and told a lot of people to cut ties with me. It's been really rough and I can't do anything about it. I don't know what I did to deserve this but I wish it would stop."
620,My Temper Makes Me Feel Broken but Feels Good,"I posted this in another sub too, the following is mostly the same words on that post. I don't want to come across as edgy, because this shit ain't that deep. I have a temper and ways have, but I like having one and don't want it to get better. I like how anger makes me feel, immune and strong to others opinions, taking control of my emotions. Whenever I feel like I'm calming down I'll force myself to stay mad or get angrier, in situations where something small happens, like me dropping something, instantly I force myself to get pissed if I don't naturally. I'm even scared of going to anger management because I don't want to lose my hot headedness or be told that I can control it and it's not severe in me. Seriously what the hell is wrong with me bro, is this some type of condition?"
621,The fact that this sub is broken people helping broken people inspires faith in humanity.,"I’m not saying we’re all broken, I’m sure many of us are here to help others , look for resources and hear others’ stories. But i do think that this community banding together is something really special."
622,"I'm a fucking mess. Can't stop cutting myself, can't see or talk to any of my friends, lack inspiration and drive, do shit at school, my parents have taken all of my previous outlets away because of the later, I stay up all night, and I'm considerring killing myself when my family goes on vacation","This sucks, it really, really, fucking sucks. Each day there's always something that sets off a hurrican inside of me and I need to cut myself and numb it or I feel like I'll drop dead and cry till my throat is bleeding from the soreness. I have no idea what my mental health conditions may be but I'm 100% I'm not ok. I need help, I seriously need to get help. When I can't use the knife I lock myself in the bathroom and cut my face with the razor, and the worst part is that it works, as soon as I draw blood I'm fine until the next breeze of wind sends me spiralling down self-harm lane. I can't see a shrink because of the quarantine and now I'm stuck for a whole month with the same family I constantly disappoint and get bullied/tossed around by. I don't think it's ok to feel and be like this, to be such a burden to everything and everyone, is it? I'm a waste of space, a stupid, lazy, lonely, bitchy, overly-sensitive waste of human space"
623,I think I’m Bipolar but I’m Not Sure,"I just wanna preface this by saying that I know I should be speaking to a professional about this and I was planning on it but due to COVID-19, all my appointments got cancelled. 

When I was in highschool, I remember having days or weeks where I felt great and happy and motivated, but then suddenly I would feel depressed, unmotivated, and sometimes suicidal. After moving out for college, the depressive lows have become more frequent and they last longer. I’ve had days where I could barely drag myself out of bed, or I would skip classes because I know if I force myself to go, it would only increase my depressive state. 

I’ve been doing a lot of reading online about depression and I do have all the symptoms. But I also have some symptoms of Bipolar II. (Random days where I feel motivated. I’ve had days where I like plan on designing a board game, or create my own comic, and books, and then it would last a few days, sometimes weeks and it would suddenly stop). Similarity, I have days where my sex drive is very high and it’s led me to some dangerous sexual encounters. So I was just wanted to ask if anyone out there has Bipolar Disorder and how you found out you had it. I know self diagnosis can be very negative so I’m trying not to do that, however I’ve just been doing a lot of reading about symptoms and experiences. I’ve just been confused in general lately about whether I’m overreacting, or I actually need help. 

Thanks in advance!"
624,Crosspost from depression I just need some help,
625,Anyone else get unexplained compulsions/tics? (anxiety),"I've only been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (selective mutism), so this could maybe stem from that or something else.

In middle school (a very stressful time for me), I started getting what I guess could be various tics or compulsions:

- I pulled out my hair (which I know can be a whole disorder itself, trichotillomania) until I had a bald spot on the crown of my head.  
- I made a small vocalization (almost compulsively, because I sort of wanted to make sure I was still able to speak)  
- constant unnecessary sniffling  

More recently, I get a compulsion to knock on wood whenever I think of something bad happening, and also to draw shapes/patterns with my hands that have to be even/a certain way."
626,Does anyone feel like they’re in a constant state of fear?,"Like sometimes it’s not as noticeable, but when you’re by yourself, it’s like a feeling in your chest of just being scared?"

628,Unhealthy Dog Obsession,"Although the title might sound like a joke, it is not. About a month or so ago, I discovered a Shiba Inu rescue around my area. I saw one of the dogs on their website, and immediately fell in love with them. I grew up with 4 German Shepherds, Reddit, from the time I was small. My parents separated two years back, and my father kept the house and all of the pets, all of the dogs and cats. We rarely visit as he is not kind and the house brings bad memories about for my mother. My mother, she works two jobs, one in the daytime and one that begins two hours after I come home from school, that she doesn't come back from until 9/10pm. Needless to say, I get really lonely. When I embraced the idea of having a dog again, my loneliness melted away completely. It became apparent that I would finally have a friend to go outside with, in all my free time. Somebody to run around with, by cute clothes for, play with. I immediately applied to multiple of these Shiba rescues and every single day for the past month or so, I have been invested entirely in checking up on them, checking my email and my mother's email multiple times a day, making sure to comment on every photo on their social medias, etcetera. I would even go to shelters with my mother to see some dogs, to ease the compulsiveness a bit. It's starting to take a toll on me, and it fills my mind all the time. When I'm alone, I'm looking at photos of Shibas, watching videos, everything, and it's become so emotionally exhausting. I feel like I'm waiting for something that is never going to come. This is such an insignificant problem, I know, but it really does feel a little hopeless. I don't want every day to be disappointment. I don't want to think of them every moment, and yet I'm not sure how to stop. Any advice?"
629,Do you ever feel like you are just not “made “ or are compatible with being alive? Like you can’t get though stuff but not very well and everything is a worthless struggle?,"I honestly feel like I was not made to be alive... I have horrible social and organisational skills and my anxiety crippled me to to point that I’m lazy and lie in bed. When I try to be productive I’m both very slow and not efficient and it doesn’t really help me anyway 

I honestly feel like I was not “made” to be alive... I’m like if you only used a walkie-talkie instead of a cell phone, I can get stuff done but not very well no matter how hard I try 

Is a life of “just getting by” really worth living... struggling everyday with torturous thoughts? 

I don’t want my life to be consisting of me going through the motions and holding back my destructive thoughts and having break downs behind closed doors"
630,Wellbutrin?,"Hey guys I was just prescribed Wellbutrin 6 days ago. The first 3-4 days my doctor advised me to take only one pill and then begin taking twice as said on the bottle. Since I’ve started taking it twice a day I’ve experienced some anxiety symptoms &amp; am having anxiety about past events in my life. I was prescribed paroxetine for my anxiety but didn’t really get into the habit of taking it because I felt my anxiety was circumstantial so once I got over what I was feeling I stopped taking the paroxetine. Anyways I’ve cried so many times today &amp; have had heightened anxiety. This is really the first time I’m experiencing symptoms with Wellbutrin. 

About how long will these symptoms last? And also should I talk to my doctor about taking the paroxetine with my Wellbutrin?"
631,"I'm dreading going back to our home, and my life.","So I'm a 13-year-old boy that lives in Ontario. It's the end of my vacation with my mother and sister. So the house I'm going back to is dreadful. It's old, rotten, and it's from the 1800 hundreds. My father is a verbally abusive, lazy, stupid asshole. We are buying a new very nice farm but with this COVID stuff, it's getting difficult. 

So my mother is lovely, but she's left me uneducated. ( I can't go to public school because my sister went for a bit and got badly bullied.) I really try to do it myself, but I don't have the discipline or the structure for it. As for my social life, it's pretty much none existent since I have a lot of social anxiety, and there isn't much to do in my little town. It's really sad seeing posts on social media saying that it's so hard to live when being so isolated I've been like that for my entire life. I'm just dreading walking up to that old smelly house, and my depressing life."
632,Am I Insane???,"I took a test online and it said I was bipolar.  I didn’t use to be bipolar.  My family has a personality trait to be skeptical of everything and I kind of am too.  Sometimes I do things I don’t want to do, does that mean I’m schizophrenic?  Please help."
633,"How do I know if I need to cry? If I do, how do I let myself","My OCD and anxiety were fine earlier today but later on they got absolutely terrible.

Right now I feel like shrieking, screaming loudly, letting it all, maybe I just need to cry bur I don’t know how and if it’s what I need.

I hate how society trains guys not to cry... it makes it so harder to do so when we actually need to"
634,Wellbutrin with anxiety medicine?,"Wellbutrin?

Hey guys I was just prescribed Wellbutrin 6 days ago. The first 3-4 days my doctor advised me to take only one pill and then begin taking twice as said on the bottle.

635,Could this be caused from mild OCD or something else?,"I was wondering if this could be symptoms of OCD or if its just caused by anxiety.. I often hear a voice in my head telling me I have to do something or else something bad will happen. Its been increasing a little recently but it has never been extreme to the point where it severely impacts my life. However, I'm not sure if its normal because I do suffer with my mental health, so I wanted to ask the wise people of reddit lol. For example, I'll hear a voice in my head telling me I need to go back upstairs to my room when I'm running really late for work already to make sure my lights are shut off and my door is closed, or else something bad will happen. Other examples are that I'll think I have to clean my kitchen counter off or else I'll die or if someone comes downstairs before the episode of the tv show I''m watching is over, the guy I like won't speak to me again or I'll fail an exam or whatever. I don't know if this is normal cause I've been told by some friends that they experience similar things. I just wanted to ask if anyone else can relate and if this is normal behavior because I feel like its slowly increasing and I don't want to go too crazy haha. I appreciate any responses to my post!"
636,i'm an asshole,"i make every conversation so i can say a specific thing about myself that i thought of beforehand. i don't want  to be like this. i care about people and i want to listen but it's just like talking about myself is default mode for me. i don't want to talk about myself. no one likes me and they all pick up on how self centered i am. what the fuck. how did i end up this way. at my deepest level this is not who i am. how do you get out of default mode? just kidding, i know how. but it's too much work. i'm lazy. i only want to be alone and make my music and paintings. i don't want new friends, i want to occasionally message old friends who already know the sensitive person on the inside who is slowly disappearing. what path will i take? i don't want the emotional side of me to disappear but it's 70 percent gone already. i want it back. i'm so cold now. it's so fucking bad.

i'll be more coherent.

i haven't made new friends in years. i haven't been in love in years, i'm turning into something i don't want to be. i want to be in love again but no one's ever right for me. i can't feel that way again for anyone anyway. i think i just need the right person to break my shell. i know this could be considered unhealthy thinking.

don't tell me to go to therapy, i can't afford it. if you have the same problem, what do you do? what helps you? i need new ideas. i want to change. i do still care a little bit."
637,Can a peaceful death be “traumatic”? I am desperate for help.,"There’s a lot behind this very brief story but it’s 2am and I don’t have the energy to write it all out. Still this will be wordy. 

A little over 5 years ago, one of my close friends died. Prior to his death, he was hit while crossing the street by a drunk driver and was in the hospital for a long while. I was there almost every night with him. He eventually got released and all seemed well. I was getting ready to leave for college and I did and he told me when I left how excited he was for summer and how much we were going to go to the beach. Little did I know, he was going to the doctor and ended up being diagnosed with late stage tracheal cancer. At 18. 

I found out after his diagnosis and took it as days went on. A few months later, I got a call from a mutual friend who said that everyone was at his hospice and they didn’t expect him to last the night. I booked an 8 hour bus ride in the middle of the night and ended up getting there around 9 am. 

No one was in the room because his dad was outside smoking and informing extended family. He was alive at the moment. I was there alone with him and he wasn’t really “with it” from multiple strokes. I talked to him and at one point thought he wasn’t breathing but it was “normal” for him. Well a few minutes later, he stopped breathing and I just knew. I knew because a second before, he had actually moved his eyes to lock with mine. And I swear I watched the light leave them. 

Obviously he passed at that moment. Now my question is, I have felt for awhile now depressed and extremely anxious to the point where I’ve had to be sedated multiple times for panic attacks out of nowhere. Recently, someone brought up that this could be a traumatic event and I might have a mild form of PTSD that I have never worked through. My nanny passed away this past weekend and it has only gotten worse since then. 

I don’t want to do anything in the past year. I can’t do laundry even though it’s a huge pile in my room. I can’t bring myself to walk my dog who I love more than myself. I can’t seem to even get up to bring myself food sometimes. Some days are fine but some days I don’t get out of bed. The only time I’m okay getting out of bed for is my job. I’m a paramedic and I know the stress from that isn’t much help but I love it and it doesn’t seem like stress to me. 

I need advice and guidance. I plan to see a psychiatrist but I’ve had such horrible experiences with psychologists that I don’t want to talk anymore. 

Please tell me someone knows what I’m going through or has some insight."
638,I think I need help," Im 17 years old, I started to have panic attack and anxiety when my ex told me she's going to study abroad in a few months in September in 2018. Of course I was scared to lose her, I told her about my panic attack 2 weeks later, she thought I thought too much and threatened me if I keep having panic attack she's gonna break up with me, so I had to live with it. Afterwards long story short I broke up with her. Then I quit school in April in 2019, since then I've never really talked to anyone. Then it got worse, I started to have negative thoughts like killing/ harming myself, so I asked my mom for help, she just told me to ignore it and let it go away, sometimes she even got mad and said im troublesome because all she thinks about is work and money. And I returned to a different school last month. I don't like the students around me because I'm scared to talk to them. Last night I called my mom and told her I bought the wrong cable, then she was furious and kept yelling at me, at that moment I couldn't take it anymore so I screamed, she casually said ""Why the hell are you screaming?"", obviously there's no reason for me to scream but I have told her about my mental health issues a lot of times, and she doesn't listen. My teacher is probably the only person I can talk to and my good friends have disappeared. But I can't ask my teacher for help all the time. I don't know what to do anymore, my school grade's terrible and I have no talent whatsoever."
639,Do you think a hotel would let me book in to self isolate for two weeks in the UK? I have nowhere else to go.,
640,My brother just told me to ‘shut the fuck up’ because I was eating chips and woke him up or something?,"I’m not making this up. Apparently a book fell from my bed when I woke up or whatever and he initially woke up, obviously a mistake but I figured it wasn’t *that* loud as I’ve used the microwave, etc late at night too.

Anyway here’s the funny and sad part: this angry late 20s man otherwise known as my brother storms out of his room and says I’m being too loud.

Uhh what? I was eating chips with my moth closed and sitting on a bed. He starts making of me, saying I smoke too much weed, etc just to see me react. He gets very close to me, like puts his head on me and that obviously violates my personal space so I push him away.

I had a pile of clothes on my bed so he picked them up and threw them. I started getting pretty damn irritated that I was being attacked for eating chips quietly so I opened the video record app and put my phone in my pocket.

Was also very condescending insulating I’m dumb by talking slow.

What should I do? How can I set clear and firm boundaries that have a real impact?"
641,I am confused,"People around me hate me for random reasons. I don't even speak much but they tend to bully me and tell me that it's normal and I should take the body shaming and all personal attacks as jokes only.

I never cared what other people said to me or about me, but now it's hitting me hard. I am a kind of a person who believes that one should take jokes and everything in the same amount of jokes he makes on others. Now I don't joke or even talk but I'm being cornered in group chats or whatever.

People sometimes ignore me/my messages for no reasons. Like I didn't even say anything bad earlier and neither I did something to hurt them. But they behave like I never existed or I don't deserve to be treated like a normal guy.

Even If I behave 1% same like those people, again I'm targeted.

What should I do? I tried not giving any fu*ks but this is too much right now."
642,I feel like I’m going insane,"I’m going through an awful breakup and everyone keeps saying it’ll get better but it’s only been getting worse and it’s not just since the breakup it’s been getting worse for years and no one seems to care. I sit alone all day and no one says anything to me and when I try to reach out it feels like they’re straining themselves to talk to me and it makes me feel so alone constantly. I wake up in the morning and I cry for hours because I woke up and have to keep living in this hell. No one on this miserable planet would give a shit if I killed myself right here and now and every time I tell someone that they give me the same bullshit response “everyone goes through this, it’s just a phase, it’ll get better, you’re not alone” but then when I try to tell them anything about what I’ve been doing to myself they don’t respond and they just tell me they’re unequipped to help me but I don’t want help I just want someone to care. It’s been so long since anyone actually cared. I spend my nights beating my head against a wall or slamming my fists into my head to hopefully kill myself from the trauma or I tie a noose up and stand on a stool and rock it back and forth to get the adrenaline rush just to feel something other than this overwhelming existential dread and emptiness. The only one keeping me from actually doing it is my cat who at this point is the only one who loves me and would be the only one who would care if I was gone. My life is a fucking joke and I wish it would just get to the god damn punchline already. People talk to me sometimes and then they say something and I just want to rip their arms off and slam their head into the pavement to get them to shut up. Sometimes I get a rock and pretend it’s my ex and I beat it with it until my knuckles bleed and imagine how I would beat her within an inch of her life if I got the chance and could get away with it. I want more than anything for her to kill herself. Every time I type the letter “i” into my keyboard the first autocomplete is “love you” and it makes me so irrationally angry and yet sad at the same time. If I could get away with it easily id love to saw her limbs off and use her as a living punching bag. I feel like I’m becoming more and more of a risk to myself and others physical safety and well-being day after day and I wish I could put myself in a mental hospital so I could maybe get help but I can’t afford it and no one would care for my cat. I feel like I’m in a fucking book about mental health awareness and the dangers it causes because I feel like my mind is becoming nothing but harm and pain and torture and new ways to hurt/kill myself and others. I want to die more than I want help. I feel like the whole world is just one big fucking joke to make me miserable so I have to see everyone else so fucking perfect around me and so god damn successful and all they have to do is say “oh I’m sad” on their fucking Instagram post and everyone flocks to their side and then I tell someone I wish I was dead and that I want to hurt myself or someone else and they write it off as a fucking joke and it makes me so fucking mad that I just beat myself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and I want this to end I just want to fall asleep and never fucking wake up because what I wake up to is worse every day and I’m going insane trying to handle all of it by myself and I tell people that I think I’m going crazy and they look at me like it’s a joke and I want to rip their eyes out and make them eat them and scream at them “FUCK YOU IS THIS FUCKING INSANE ENOUGH FOR YOU” and watch them bleed and make them beg for life and then kill myself and leave them crying, alone, blind, and covered in my fucking blown out brains."
643,Severe OCD to BDD to Conversion disorder (or real illness) ?," Hi Reddit.

I really do not know what to do. I’m at the end of my options and do not have any solutions in sight. With what is at stake, I thought I would turn to Reddit in a last ditch effort. 

I just want to start off by saying I have tried to use all the appropriate channels, ie talk to a psychologists, a neurologist, and a general practitioner but not being the patient has led to either dead ends or not being able to interfere due to doctor patient confidentiality. 

My brother (who I’m beyond close to my whole life) has had various transitioning OCD throughout his life. It has gone through stages of being severe to being manageable. It has moved focus from one thing to another. Everything was under control until his wedding engagement fell through. After this he went into obsessive compulsive or a body dysphoric mode with extreme focus on tiny bumps on his skin. This led to life threatening depression and psychosis. My mom and I had to spend 18 hours a day making sure he was unharmed and away from the mirror for 5 months. It was scary (3 emergency visits over suicide attempts), exhausting, and emotionally draining. Suicidal thoughts filled his brain at all times over tiny or indivisible dots on his skin. During this time he tricked us for months that he was taking anti-depressant/anti-psychotics. Eventually all this stress and self-neglect led to me getting ill. My body was shaking, had pain in my stomach, nausea, numbness, headaches ect… Him caring about me snapped him out of his delusions. 

He then began extensively researching what could be going wrong with me. Putting all his focus and energy into investigating, he was convinced I had a life altering disease. Because of the symptoms I exhibited I had MRIs set up for MS, blood tests for Lyme disease as well as other things. After weeks of waiting and with all of my test coming back clean my family as well as my brother were relieved. But couple days after this, my brother started to exhibit the same MS symptoms I exhibited. He poured more hours looking into multiple sclerosis and now Parkinson’s. Day after day, he rapidly developed more and more symptoms. He says he knows he was obsessive in the past, and acknowledges the timing seems consequential but says he is rapidly developing unbearable health problems, including a tremor. His psychologists does not believe him, a neurologist (who does not know his background) says he sees a tremor that can’t be fake and that it is Parkinson’s. Our general practitioner (who knows his background) sees a slight tremor and is unsure what to think. He is in his early 30s and while early onset PD is possible (I’ve have read it is mostly slowly developed). He has gained 20 symptoms in a month and a half. He does not want a second opinion, a DAT Scan or meds to confirm diagnosis because he knows “100%” and the first neurologist in a 20 minute appointment confirmed it. After preventing countless suicide attempts over imaginary bumps on his face (which he now acknowledged as crazy) he says he does not want to seek help but live for a year without help and then “end it” before PD sets in.

Because of all the hospital visits and coming in contact with a sick doctor (possible corona virus) he is in isolation at his house (by himself). All phone calls revolve about Parkinson’s and his symptoms, and not wanting to live with them, and why won’t we believe him. I have noticed he is still going on dates and talking to people on Tinder, but he says it is just to keep his mind occupied so he doesn’t feel in as much pain.

So my question is: am I dismissing PD too fast? Could it be it? It seems he really is in pain. But He won’t accept any other option, couldn’t it just be stress? Conversion disorder? Lyme? Psychotic break? A little bit of discomfort mixed with OCD? 

My Mom and I are drained. 6 months of 18 hour days have had an impact on our health. We cannot continue doing what we have been doing. But it’s an impossible task to talk to someone who can only think about one thing.

How do we proceed? How do we help him? Any advice or guidance would mean the world. Thanks.

TLDR:

\- Sibling has severe OCD/BDD for 6 months, delusional, psychotic, suicidal, and refuses help.

\- Drains family to the point where I get sick.

\- My health problem snaps him out of it and he begins to investigate it unhealthy.

\- Begins to exhibit symptoms of what I was experiencing, and it grows rapidly and worsens.

\- His psychologists does not believe him, a neurologist (who does not know his background) sees a tremor and says it is Parkinson’s, and a general practitioner (who knows his background) sees a slight tremor and is unsure what to think.

\- The neurologist said it is impossible to fake a resting tremor.

\- He does not want to live with it and would rather die.

\- Should I believe he has it? - Is it stress/conversion disorder? - What do I do?

\- Family can’t go another 6 month at 18 hours a day but the consequences are too dire not too.

\- Advice? Thanks."
644,"i desperately long for something, but i don’t know what it is",does anybody else feel this way? i’ve felt this way literally for as long as i can remember and i’ve never been able fo figure out what it is i have wanted all this time. does anybody know why i might feel this way?
645,Just feeling a bit empty.,"I get attached to people too easy, it sorta makes it hard for me to even be friends with anyone. sometimes I wonder if I'm better off alone lol"
646,How do i get past my trauma from a toxic relationship. So that it cant affect my next relationship.,"I've been in a relationship for nearly three years. However, we broke up in feb 15 2020. I broke up because after everything I've done for her she's still unable to actually fight for our relationship. And i just grew tired in how easily she leaves the relationship. In just one fight regardless if its a petty fight there's always a probability that she'll break up with me. After breaking up I've realized that i already have enough reason to leave but i just cant use it as a reason because it happened a long time ago. She cheated on me somewhere the september-december of 2018 and even before that up until our break up i often get verbally abused about the things i tell her because im vulnerable. How she tells me that she feels dirty being with me, and how the guy she cheated me with was a better man than i am, regardless of me trying to work things out in our relationship(that was somehwere ber months of 2018 as well). she once told me to even kill myself (just once and out of anger). Anyway back to the story. After a week of our break up one of my female friends confessed her feelings to me, i actually like the girl due to her personality but i know i have a gf before so i didn't really entertained that feeling. At some point my ex knew about this and somehow i felt like she diverted the story of our breakup of me finding someone new that's why i left her. But the truth is she was being toxic and made me feel irrelevant for how she easily leaves our relationship and prioritize something else but then comes back for ""choosing me"" and also for the reason that i was verbally abused. Tho the girl and me aren't really in a relationship but our feelings are starting ti develop. i need an advice how to move on from the trauma my past relationship gave me and how i should stop thinking it's was my fault. because i honestly feel guilty for leaving her and for picking myself and making myself happy."
647,Opening up to therapist about sexuality?,"I’m a bisexual girl and one of my last love interests was a girl. It’s been over 2 years since we were a thing but were still friends and I never got closure. I want to one up to my therapist about it so I can work through it and recover, but I’m scared of coming out to my therapist. Any advice?"
648,Rough breakup,"I’m not sure this is the correct sub for this post, i’m just looking for any type of relief honestly. I recently went through a tough breakup with the girl i love more than anything. The breakup was my fault and i’m struggling to cope with the fact she doesn’t want me back. I have accepted that it is my fault, and i understand that i do not deserve to have her back but i just can’t figure out how to mentally deal with life without her. It’s extremely tough to think about ever being happy again when she was the only thing that made me happy. (We broke up off of a stupid little fight that i over exaggerated on, and a bunch of bottled up feelings blew up the relationship). If anyone has any tips or advice on how to deal with something like this because even after 2 months i am completely broken. Tonight was one of the worst nights going through it, she blocked me and unfollowed me on all social media so i assume that is it. I called my family and explained i might not be around too much longer. I don’t want to die, i just don’t see myself ever being happy again and it kills me to think that way. If anyone has any way to help me deal with this, i would greatly appreciate it."
649,"I can't stop lying, I'm the worst, I lied about DID","For 4 years I lied that I have DID, I didnt even know what it was, it was just all because of an imaginary friend and the coping for loneliness, I started ""acting"" as I have a different name, age, and a personality, I then started to suspect it was DID and I went on with it, I can't stop, now I'm slowly convinced that I have DID as I'd go insane if I can't ""switch"", even feeling a presense of that ""Alter""

But it was just all me, I don't know what to think, even this post is confusing, I wanna come clean, but something is preventing me"

651,LIVID-19: Acknowledging my Mental Health during the Coronavirus,"I’m having a hard time dealing with this.

I am confused because I am not an expert, I don’t know which source to trust, so I have obsessively sought out facts, as if it were my job.

I am drained because I have watched the situation unfold, week after week.

I am scared because all the cases that first came to this country landed on my doorstep.

I am frustrated because Europe does not seem to be following the same actions as Asia and I don’t know if it’s an intentional strategy or not.

I am stressed because I have seen it coming but have not been getting information, updates, and a public response I needed to hear to be reassured.

I am angry at those that have displayed ignorance, lack of interest, even worse — were in denial or dismissive, thought/acted in a selfish way, and lacked humanity or compassion.

I am disappointed that apart from one friend, none of my close circle have asked after my parents, who reside in Asia (but it is not entirely their fault — I also blame the media).

I am worried that it may be a long time before I can be reunited with my parents again; they are old, and I want to be there for them but I can’t, and I know I should stay away from them since I’m in a country that seems to be letting it spiral out of control.

I felt isolated long before people started self-isolating.

I am anxious because I can’t even bring myself to go outside knowing how I feel.

If I can feel all this in the comfort of my own home, I can’t even begin to imagine how health workers have felt all this time waiting on the front lines.

I have felt many things, but I have not felt panicked at the thought of starvation, or myself dying from this.

The lack of certainty has not affected me much either, rather the lack of control over how others have behaved.

How do you feel?

Ps. Strangely, and I didn’t expect this outcome, but I feel better after writing this.

Pps. You don’t know me, so I’ll just quickly mention that I haven’t lost my sense of humour, it gets me through the day.

654,Is it bad that I don’t worry or get upset about things that don’t effect me?,"I was talking with some people today, and they were talking about how messed up this whole coronavirus situation is, which I agree, is really out of hand. They started talking about how sad it is that so many people have died from it. 

I started thinking, and I realized that I don’t really get upset when things like this happen. When people die from some tragic accident, I tend to not be very upset about it because it doesn’t directly effect me. 

The coronavirus is different because it’s effecting everyone, but it still doesn’t bother me that it’s effecting some worse than others.

658,Bestfriends ignore me,"Just want to vent and maybe someone has encouraging words for me. My best friend (f) and I (m) know each other since roughly 3+ years we've gotten pretty close 2 years ago and I would call her my best friend since we've graduated. We saw each other at least 2 times a week to watch movies eat sushi etc. And then started working together and saw us nearly everday at work but not privately anymore, a few weeks ago she started to cut our conversations short, replied only with short answers who made it clear she wasn't interested in talking with me. Now with the Worldwide quarantine we aren't able to work anymore and I haven't seen her in 2 weeks and written only 1 or 2 times since then. I am torn apart if I should try to engage less in trying to establish more contact and give her more space, because I know that I have no right to demand contact from her, and showing her that she kinda hurts me with her behaviour because I know that she likes me and if we met everything would be fine between us. But im also scared that if I show her that im hurt that she will interpretate this as, ""hey give me attention"". It's just that I want a little bit more contact from here, I am tired of one sided friendships even tho I know that she wouldn't hurt me intentionally (I hope). Sorry that this got so long, formatting because of mobile, english isn't my first nor second language and I don't even want to start with gramatics. Thanks for listening."

I undergo the same symptoms experienced under SAD i.e rapid heart rate, hyperventilation, trembling, trouble concentrating and restlessness but it's not because I think I will be ridiculed by people or I'll be embarrassed Infront of them , it is just triggered by the presence of people. Merely the presence of human beings or sitting close to them even if it is my own parents results in the symptoms being triggered."
661,"I get in this crazy mood when I get irritated, but don't know what the root of it is. I want to fix this, but need your help to know where this comes from.","This is not the first time this has happened.
Something doesn't go my way, so my mood drops. I expect the person to ignore it, so eventually I ignore it myself and feel better, but the person always notices, and stops whatever their doing, which stresses me out and irritates me even more, until eventually I get really pissed out of nowhere.

Usually, I was fine with it, I would deal with it on my own and the other person wouldn't even know that for about 30 minutes I was going absolutely crazy inside.
But now, I have a boyfriend. I love him to death, but I've had this happen to me a few times with him. He is the sweetest, and is extremely patient, and I become his priority in this situation. But I'm sick of this happening, and it ruining our days of hanging out, and I'm so scared one day it'll be too much for him.

When I get angry, he unintentionally gets a little upset too, which then makes me feel absolutely awful, and then he tries to fix things, I mean, he tries so so hard, but when I'm in these moods, I don't want to move or even talk, so I feel even more horrible for intentionally not making efforts when he's trying his hardest, but mentally I'm truly stuck, and then he feels bad because he thinks he's not good enough for me, and then that's what just tears my heart apart, because I want to make an effort and apologize and feel better, but it feels like a nightmare when you just can't scream for help. I'm just silent in front of him, but inside I'm bawling my eyes out.
And I know that if I force myself to speak I'll cry, and for some reason my brain refuses to do so. 

I want to work on this, and never be like this anymore, but the thing is, I don't know where to start. I know you're not in my head so it's hard to tell, but if you have any idea what my problem might be (anxiety? ego? fear? etc..), I'd love to hear."

I'm not happier and still feel out of place. My best friend and I don't talk anymore and no one from my old school bothers to message or catch up with me. I have no one I can talk to and it feels like no one really cares about me, I mean sure, I have my parents and brothers but they never seem to care about my feelings or how my day has been. They all find something to complain about or get cross over. I'm extremely self conscious, my nose piercing came out today, with no hope of it going back in and I'm so sad over it because it was one of few things I actually liked about  msyelf. Another example is on our Sports Day, we played volleyball, screwed up the serve costing us points and I just wanted to curl up in bed and cry for hours on end. I have self harmed before and still do because it's an outlet for my sadness and I know it's dumb but it helps. I would love to see a therapist or something but my older brother has just started going and I don't want my parents to have to deal with two children in therapy, but that's another thing that makes me feel crap. I constantly feel overshadowed, wanted to be vegetarian, brother did it first, I'm lesbian and my brother is Trans so if I tell anyone in my family they'll be frustrated that they have two ""not normal"" kids, I'm originally from the UK but I had a friend with an extremely obvious accent and so she always got asked questions about it and there's just so many examples I could go on and on. I don't know what to do at this point and really just want to sleep all day everyday, I lack motivation to do anything but I still do just so the few people who know me don't see anything is up. I feel like a massive nuisance in everyone's life already and don't want to be even more of one by asking for help."

666,I work in a grocery store.,"I suffer from anxiety, minor depressive disorder, and PTSD. 

I'm currently employed full time in a grocery store and this entire pandemic is draining me completely. I recently worked 9 days straight, doing overtime to meet the demands of these panic shoppers. 

I'm fucking scared out of my mind right now. Everything that usually goes through my head on a day to day basis is coming through. I've always had fears at my work of ""what if our shelves go empty?"" ""What if we can't get the supplies or stock we need?"" 

Everything I've been scared of is coming true. 

I'm also a high risk person. I suffer from asthma and have had bronchitis and pneumonia more times than I can count. I'm scared for my own life but I know that if I dont show up to work, people won't get the food and necessities they need to survive right now. 

What am I supposed to do? Now is not the time to talk to a therapist. How do I deal with this anxiety?"
667,Found out my girlfriend has mental illness,"I just found out that my girlfriend has been taking medications for a mental illness. She wouldn't go into details, but said she used to have hallucinations, which occurred after drinking alcohol. She was then put on meds. I asked her if its possible to wean off the meds, but she said they are for life. What mental illness does this sound like, and should I be concerned for her well being? Are there alternative treatments for these illnesses, or will she always be dependent on a pill?"
668,What is wrong with my sister?,"For years, there has been problems with my sister. I’m just wondering does anyone recognise these behaviours/traits and can perhaps attribute them to some kind of illness or disorder? Our relationship is becoming more and more strained. We are both in our twenties now and there is 5 years between us. Over the years, these are the kind of things that happened: 

-she sexually abused me as a child, multiple times. 

-whenever she babysat me as a child, she would verbally abuse me screaming at me, and just really frightening me in general. 

-she has lived a lie, pretending to be in college when she had actually dropped out. She allowed my parents to pay for her “studies” and cost of living for almost a year. She even went shopping with my parents for their outfits for her graduation. She told them she received top grade in the class only to make up a very weak excuse as to why they couldn’t attend her graduation, she told them it had been changed to a date they were on vacation, which made them feel guilty. When she came clean about this, she did so via a handwritten letter and also with gifts - as if that excuses anything. She also promised to go to a therapist. Which never happened. 

-she has stolen from my parents, many times. She has taken their credit cards, gift cards and used them. Taken hundreds of $. She had denied this until my parents threatened to call the police. 

-she is very negative in general - she seems to enjoy having something to be pissed off about. She still lives at home and doesn’t pay anything towards household costs, but constantly nags my parents about different things, she will be pissed that there’s food rotten in the fridge, but the funny thing is it will be *her* food. Things like that. 

-she is manipulative, my mom is a very gentle person and if she has done me wrong and I stop speaking to her, she will cry and play the victim to her. Like a child. She sometimes manages to twist my mom into thinking I am the one who’s stepped out of line, until I show her  logically and objectively that she is manipulating her. This is awful for my mom. 

-she would say she is someone who doesn’t care for social media, but in fact she spends an awful lot of time and energy trying to protray her life and relationship in a positive, perfect way. 

-I really feel she has a much higher sense of self than is normal, if that makes sense. When people don’t treat her with the utmost respect, she takes it extremely personally and feels very sorry for herself. But at the same time, I really get a sense that she enjoys this kind of interaction. She lights up when she has something to lament about. 

- as you may guess, our relationship nowadays is very strained. I feel that she undermines me and my career. It’s strange, but she continuously insists on helping me or even *doing* my work for me, which is ridiculous. I spent years in university studying for this so logic would say that an untrained person could not do this work. I’ve explained this to her, but she is always trying to involve herself in my work and I find it so strange. Similarly, with any  interests I have that may be outside her idea of normal, she will put them down in subtle ways. 

..with all of this in mind, the craziest part is that if you met her, you would call me crazy. There’s no way she’s capable of this behaviour, you’d say. You’d see a empathetic, intelligent and well put together woman. 

I really don’t know what is wrong with her. Reading that, you would say my parents should have been much tougher on her and I agree. They know that now, but unfortunately she is not at a stage where she can be told what to do by her parents anymore. 

Any thoughts or similar experiences even would be so greatly appreciated."
669,Idk what write here but just know I'm really depressed right now.,"Heres a little recap on what's got me down.


I broke my glasses. (Ik that's not that bad but it doesnt help my situation.)


My brother, whom Ive hardly seen since middle school and miss dearly, is now in jail for beating his wife pretty brutally. So badly in fact he's actually lucky they only charged him with domestic abuse, yea it was B A D. 


I recently learned the woman I had wanted to spend the rest of my life with is having SOMEONE ELSE'S  baby.


My grandmother, who wasnt in the best health to begin with (she has to wear an oxygen tank and is allergic to basically everything but water and sunlight), was recently admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. I'm worried she won't make it much longer.

I'm worried about my other grandparents because my spoiled rotten aunt is driving herself and my grandparents to bankruptcy.


I'm so depressed, somedays I can't make it to work which has caused me to use A LOT of the time I was going to use to travel this summer and to go to my cousin's wedding.



I feel so alone and unloved."
670,We Can Help The Mentally Well!...,"This is to anyone who has any type of condition that has made it difficult to go outside at some point. You can be very helpful right now! - 

I don't know about you, but after years of Depersonalization/Derealisation I kind of found myself socially isolating and avoiding busy bars. Now the UK state strongly advise it.

I feel like, in a way,  every human on earth has been brought to my level by a multiplying non-living entity so small we can't see it (and we have decided to name the virus after a beer, which is admittedly pretty cool), and that we, who may have felt forced indoors by this condition or way of being, in the past or present have, if you'll indulge a second of black humour, been dealt a good hand.

So... 

This means that you/we are also in a good position to offer some advice to the wider social community on how to get by indoors. Some people may have to face months of isolation now, maybe more.

I believe that we can help people very powerfully right now.
Maybe drop coping tips sometimes on social media, or send a guided meditation to a friend - hinting at how to get by alone, how to make make it productive, satisfying, fulfilling, beautiful. And it can be all those things.

Now might be a great time to open that book which your anxious to start reading for some mysterious reason, or educate the children with something useful that they're not taught in school, or learn a spiritual practice. 

I'm not underestimating the difficulties the virus will bring.

Most people don't and won't die from this virus, and some won't get it at all.

It will bring out the worst and best of homosapiens.

Peace and much love to you all,

Rob xx"
671,Appetite,Finally started taking my anti depressants at the same time everyday and now my appetite is god damn crazy but ik my ed is about to hit me like a truck haha fuck my life
672,Problems with motivation/concentration,"Hello,  
I need an advice about managing problems with concentration.  
It's difficult for me to concentrate few hours on something I have to do unless I really feel the drive. I usually start checking social networks, news, reddit, etc... I have a good job, I can say I am good in it and always can do what is required, I learn new stuff, but in last 3 years I haven't done any side projects. I even can't even force myself do required work for my existing hobby project which requires just a few hours of work. Same happens for some books, movies. It's just hard to enjoy them as easy as before and to find motivation to focus. In the same time I can be sort of addicted to some Netflix series or computer games. I don't do that often but when I do I just have to watch all series or win/finish the game. Same happens with tobacco, alcohol and porn. It's difficult(but doable) for me to limit usage of those if I have already started. I stopped smoking and watching porn about 4 months ago but haven't noticed any improvements. It's also difficult for me to develop good habits like meditation or running. I quit very fast.   
I began to think that I could have problem with mental health, maybe something with dopamine receptors. I haven't really tried any practice and haven't talked to therapist about it. I was tested by a therapist (questionnaires, associations, paintings and other standard tools). Was told I am normal.  
I need an advice how I can be more focused at work, enjoy books, movies and be less addictable. Maybe I should go to another therapist?  
ps. not a native speaker, sorry for the mistakes

Thank you!"
673,Helping Others- You can too,"Hello everyone. I am 16 and I have decided to make a special project to help people in my school, especially younger people. 
In my country, mental health is not talked about at all, and even when it is talked about, not a single time has my school offered something which truly would show students how it’s okay to not be okay and that people with mental health disorders don’t have to be treated different or judged since we’re all humans and we should all get treated without prejudice. 
I decided because of this to make a documentary as a school project where I’m going to interview people from my country, as well as all over the world that have mental disorders and just have a normal conversation with them and try to humanize the idea of having a disorder. This would then closely related to something I am looking to implement in my school which would help students feel more comfortable about reaching out for help when they need it. 
What I need is people from all over the world who are willing to be interviewed by me about their lives, their disorder, but mainly just about them. I truly believe that if students here see that a mental disorder isn’t something to be ashamed of or even struggling with mental health isn’t something that should stay hidden. I hope this project will help someone out there and I’d really appreciate all the help I could get. 

If you have any questions, which I’m sure I do since I feel I wasn’t very clear about some things, you can leave a comment and I’ll try to reply.

If you are interested in being a part of this, here’s the discord link. 
https://discord.gg/GRz5m6g 

I am not exactly sure when the interviews will start, but more information about all this will be on the discord server so if this peaks your interest please do join. 

Thank you to everyone who actually took the time to read this. 
Hope together we can make a difference!"
674,What does therapy actually do and what is a ~good~ therapist?,"I'm not sure if I actually need therapy. 
Number one I'm scared of and dont trust doctors as they have treated me poorly in the past (outing my depression to a toxic parent, telling me being depressed is normal because I'm a girl so I have pms).
 2 I've tried going to my school therapist before and they were super pushy on only appointment 2 and made me so uncomfortable i had a panic attack and then a second one right before I was suposed to go to apt 3 which I wound up not going to. Idk i was probably being a fucking weenie but shouldn't a THERAPIST know that not everyone is ok being vulnerable right away (especially when I marked I have trauma in my past on my intro sheet)? 
I get anxious sometimes, and I think I have trauma from sexual assault causing me some panic attacks (only during triggers like when I shower), but I'd say I'm overall functional as a person (like everyone has ups and downs and I'm not expecting to be happy all the time). 
I honestly dont really know what therapy could/would do for me. Even after researching ""types"" of therapy i still dont really understand what it does. 
My boyfriend who is studying to become a social worker has pushed me to go in the past but I dont really have a goal I would try to meet in therapy, ya know? Like what do I want out of it?
 If I'm being honest, I've gotten alot out of self help forms like this and that way I get to keep the control which is how I like it."
675,Requesting research on the effectiveness of certain self-care habits in mental health improvement.,"Hello everyone, I hope you are staying healthy. 

I am currently in progress of a new mobile app startup to gamify mental health improvement in young adults. 

Much like Calm, we will be guiding users through building healthy habits. 

I think many of us can subjectively say things like: 

\- Exercise  
\- Nutrition   
\- Meditation   
\- Journaling   
\- Socializing   
\- Organization   
\- Going outside   
\- Gratitude 

Can have a truly positive effect on our mental health. 

I am looking for published research papers that can show the measured results of these habits. 

Can anyone help? 

There is a subreddit rule about posting research papers, so if they also cannot be commented with, please send me a PM. 

Eternally thankful!"
676,"I have very strong suicidal tendencies, and I unintentionally scared my friends with it.","I really don't know why I do that... they've been nothing but helpful to me but I treat them like that. I want to stop. I love them but I know I'm getting super difficult to be with.

My last suicide attempt was a week ago."
677,Face-to-face therapy vs Online therapy?,"Hi, so I'm in a position where I would have to decide between traditional face-to-face therapy and online therapy (CBT). If I choose the former the wait will be quite a bit longer before I can actually go in.

I was just wondering of anyone has any advice or experience with online therapy that they would like to share, I'm having a bit of a hard time making a decision.

Thank you!"
678,Feeling unlucky and down,"This may not be as serious as some of the other stories here but i needed somewhere to vent.

I graduated univeristy 2 years ago and haven't been able to find work outside of summer work since then.  I had plans of going back to study (for masters) when i finished anyway but finding more than 2 references was difficult for me since I'm not the most talkative and out going person. The few universities I did apply to rejected me.
Fast forward to early last year i heard a scholarship opportunity for masters in Japan and after going through the entire process and thinking I wouldnt make it several times I got confirmed for it earlier this year to start in April. 
On another note i got braces in 2018 that were supposed to come off next week. I was so excited to  about to be rid of them since anyone who has had braces knows the amount of stress that comes with them.
So my schedule for the next couple weeks was prepare to leave -&gt;get braces off -&gt;leave the next week
My country yesterday reported its first two cases of Covid-19. This morning the orthodontist  cancelled my last appointment until further notice. 
Along with the various travel advisories I'm not sure if I'll be leave the country.

These last 2 years have been rough in my mental health. I felt like i was a waste of space that I'm only burdening my family. I though this year would be finally time to turn my life around. Then this happens. nothing of this scale happened for the 2 years i was doing nothing but now just weeks before, everything i have been looking foward to is gone.

It feels like this always happens to me. I'm not one to get excited about much but when i do it feels like something beyond my control ruins everything I'm looking forward to.

I guess a silver lining would be i may be able to postpone going to Japan till october and HOPE that everything calms down by then. But to endure so many more months feeling this.....

I'm probably just over reacting but I just dont know anymore...."
679,Tried to get help and feeling pretty discouraged,This is just a rant I guess (I live in NY in the US). Prior to the whole pandemic situation my depression was getting pretty bad and I made an appointment with my doctor to talk about changing meds. It was supposed to be yesterday but I got a call that they were cancelling it because my doctor determined my needs to be non-urgent. My dad called them and advocated for me and now the doctor is supposed to call me to consult over the phone but I just feel like she doesn’t respect my problems anymore since she can so easily deem that I don’t need urgent help without even talking to me. I guess I’m just sad that I tried to get help and failed and it seems like mental health is nobody’s priority right now so a lot of us are going to be having a tough time the next few months
680,Thoughts on Trauma Resulting from COVID-19?,"Has anyone else been thinking about the trauma that this pandemic may lead to for us, others, or everyone experiencing this? Does anyone have any thoughts or even expertise on this topic? 

I am thankful that, for some, things are still okay. There’s still water and electricity. But, i am in a constant state of anxiousness waiting for things to get worse. I get enraged when i see people still going out to bars and clubs. I feel panicked thinking about how long this will last. I think I am prepared in terms of food and basic needs but have lingering thoughts about one day not having what I need. And i feel a lot, a lot of sadness for those who are vulnerable, for this situation, for things getting cancelled, for people losing income, for others being sad, and so much more. I feel so sad, angry, and anxious but I am pushing these feelings deep down so I can do my work, finish school, and get through this. 

This makes me wonder, i’m sure a lot of other people are doing the same kind of thing. Could there be trauma from this afterwards or some behaviors as a result from the trauma from this experience? Unsure if that makes sense but I could see something happening to me or others like if things get really bad, then, when this ends, a behavior that could develop is like hoarding cause you’re afraid this will happen again or reliving the experience through dreams for a long time after."
681,:/,"Im really sad because i can't stop thinking about how truly alone I am, and how alone I'm going to be in the future. Not referring to romantic endeavors, eluding more to the notion that we all die alone. Stuck in our heads by ourselves with every moment leading up to it as well. Nobody will truly know how i feel and that terrifies me for some reason ah hugs make it better though I wish someone would hug me but I feel selfish asking for it, especially for a reason such as this :'(

I don't know what I'm getting at here; maybe it's the isolation talking. I just thought this was a way to attempt to cast these thoughts away and maybe someone will be able to magically translate these words into intelligible ones and giv advice :/  

Thanx for reading my Trainwreck 🤮"
682,I Think I Might Be Turning Into A Sociopath?!,"I've been finding myself lashing out at people more whenever they decide to treat me like shit online. I would never have done that in the past. 

Now, I'd love to rip into anyone who fucks with me and I don't care if I hurt their feelings. 

This is a little unnerving. Am I really a Sociopath? Can this be changed? Or am I just overreacting."
683,How do I power through this mental exhaustion,"I'm so tired. I got home and just started crying in the parking lot, still in my car.

I work with very self-centered people. I sometimes wish they were openly mean and rude, so I could just say they're terrible people. But they're the kinda people who just don't about others. When it comes to emotional support, you're kinda just on your own.

And then on top of that, the two main managers I work with are just...exhausting. Once again, not particularly cruel, but they play a lot of mental gymnastics or are verbose and confusing and I just feel so tired after a conversation with them.

But what makes me feel pathetic is that in the 10 hours I work with them, I feel a little grateful I have them to talk to, even if they dominate the conversation or confuse with the weird places the conversation goes to.

And what's worse is that in this case, all I feel is exhausted and unfulfilled. In case of the people who don't talk to me, I begin to feel rather left out on purpose. Like I'm the problem. I don't feel this way anywhere else. Just at work. And it's disheartening and hurtful.

But what do I peg them on? You didn't ask me about my day? You don't just come to my desk to have a chat? That sounds whiny.

I sometimes think if I make the effort myself, it could work. But in the past I've tried, and I've just gotten nervous. I don't feel like myself. And I'm so AWARE how I'm not myself. Like I'm watching myself outside of my body. I don't feel united with myself.

A new guy joined, and he was cute to boot. We had some nice conversations, some jokes. I figured we could be friends. I was a bit confident in the beginning, but still self-conscious. So if he did even the slightest thing unexpected, I would get nervous.

And now it's dissipated, whatever it was before. I blame myself, and then feel bad for blaming myself, because no one should make me want to be perfect ALL the time. But I also feel like it's my fault, because I just can't be OKAY. I want to be okay.

Today, I thought a million times of talking to him. But I kept thinking I need the perfect time. When he's not around people or when he's on a coffee break. But none of that happened. Or maybe it did and I chose to do something else instead so I wouldn't talk to him. And then finally it was 5 PM and I was miserable and unfulfilled. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so sad. Not all the time. I want people to stop affecting me like this."
684,I can only enjoy music in my head,"This is a really weird issue that I am having and it's making me extremely depressed. Whenever I think of my favorite songs, they sound perfectly good in my head, but if I turn up one of those songs, it sounds nothing like it did in my head, and I get nothing out of it. I feel as if I perceive real life differently than I do in my head and it's scary. I can pretty much think of a song that I love and get goosebumps thinking about it but when I put that song on, it gives me anxiety and makes me feel nothing. Feels as if I can't connect with anything anymore. What the hell is going on?"
685,I have never had dissociative episodes in my life (or any major mental issues) and I started having them yesterday,"Hey all,  


Just looking for camaraderie more than anything. This whole COVID-19 thing is crazy and I have a weakened immune system. I haven't left my property since Friday and I don't plan to for a very long time. Thankfully we have a decent house with a decent yard and access to delivery services for most things we need.  


But yesterday I realized I was zoning out, eyes wide open, losing large chunks of time, seeing things in 3rd person perspectives. My mind won't stop racing and I am terrified for my parents, my mother in law, and my three living grandparents. But there is not much I can do, because of my immune system.   


On top of it all, I work for a local non profit. I have been having 10-12 hour days virtually setting up help in my community. It is amazing what we are accomplishing, but it gives me little time to focus on myself at the moment, and it is seriously wearing me down. 

If anyone has any tips, advice, or just a comment of solidarity, it is all appreciated."
686,Partner has Paranoid Personality Disorder,"Hi all, 

I'll keep this simple, and try to keep it short, but maybe hard to do so. 

My partner of 2 years was in a traumatic car accident 3 years ago, that involved 2 of his closest friends. He was in a coma for 3 weeks, which left him with significant frontal brain damage. After he woke up from his coma, he started to believe that his friends had purposely set him up to get into an accident because they were jealous of him (he had a long standing and successful DJ career that they envied apparently). There were lawsuits filed back and forth between the 3 parties, which all ended up being tossed out due to lack of evidence. 

I started to notice ""odd"" or ""strange behavior"" in the spring of 2019. We were about a year into our relationship when I began to notice the little things he would say or do that were just ""off."" Instances such as going to Walmart or the mall became issues for him. He thought I was setting him up to be killed whenever we went to Walmart, or he thought I was taking him to the mall purposely to ""set him up."" Whenever I would change by the window in my bedroom, he thought I was ""purposely"" changing in front of it so other neighbors can see me change my clothes. At the time he was driving Uber, and thought that people in other cars were following him around. He claimed that it was mainly ""white commercial vans"" that were the ones following him. He also would tell me he felt that ""the Jews"" were out to get him and that the ""IRS"" was following him around because he owns businesses and they want to make sure he isn't ""lying on his tax return."" He randomly breaks up with me whenever he trips out badly and blames it on the fact that he thinks ""I'm holding him back in life"" and that ""because of me he isn't able to move ahead"". Then after talking with him reasonably for a few moments he relaxes. I had taken him to the psychiatrist in October of 2019, and the doctor told him he had ""PPD"", but he was not dangerous or harmful to society, but he would need therapy and perhaps medication...

These were just some of the stories..... there are more but let me get to the point....

Fast forward to last night. The gym in my apartment complex is closed due to the Coronavirus. We decided that we would go play basketball at a local park near my house to get some physical exercise in (we workout daily). We went to buy a basketball from Walmart, then headed to the park. It was around 6:30 p.m. EST.. (we live in Florida). the sun was still beaming and there were plenty of families and kids in the park (since most kids are out of school due to the virus, and parents are WFH). We had a good time for the first half hour. As more kids started to join the courts and families began to flock to the park he started acting strange. We left after about an hour, and in the car he kept asking me why ""there were so many kids there"" and why there were so many people there. I told him that kids are out of school due to the virus and parents need a place to take their kids to let them release their energy. Plus its a park, its meant for families and kids. He kept insisting that everyone was staring at him in the park and that he felt like he was a target there. He insisted to me that he never wanted to go back to that park. I pushed further and asked him why... he stated that he felt the ""Jews"" were plotting against him and that ""they"" knew he was dating a Muslim girl (I'm Muslim). And ""they"" were purposely trying to sabotage his career and life because they knew he was dating me. I asked him how ""they"" knew he was dating me and how would ""they"" know what religion I was. He said that they could be following me around and following me home and then in turn look up my address and find out I was Muslim. Yeah I know it sounds crazy right? Same. 

Last night, I was uneasy because I felt things were starting to derail again, however I thought by the morning he'd be acting normal again. He hasn't broken up with me randomly since January, and hasn't had such a bad trip out (that I know of) since then. 

However, this morning he woke up and asked me why I moved to Florida (I went to college here, and I'm originally form the midwest where my mother and sisters still reside- my father lives and works in California). He also told me that he thinks its ""strange"" that I live in Florida and my father lives in California and the rest of my family in the midwest. He then said it seems ""strange that my father is living on one coast and I am living on the other coast"". I pushed further.. I asked him why is that strange? Many families live apart and don't live in the same state due to various reasons. I explained to him that my father lives and works in California post his divorce from my mom, and I moved to Florida for undergrad. Simple right? Not for him. He went on to claim that my father and I were ""recruiting people."" Now...I wasn't sure how I should take this... what does this sound like, and what does that even really mean? I pushed further.. ""what do you mean recruiting people?"" recruiting people for what?"" And he said ""well you always talk about what it's like being a Muslim to me and....."" And immediately I flipped. Was he thinking my father and I were ""recruiting people"" for unfathomable things?/unquestionable actions? What kind of bullshit is this? I flipped, started shouting, yelling, crying. I just had enough. That truly triggered me and upset me to my core. How could someone I love and share my life with so intimately think so LOWLY about me and my family? When this is complete nonsense and utter bullshit. This is NOT the truth. We are a normal ordinary family. He then told me ""I've been thinking about this for the past one year, and I had to let it out.""  I stood there shook and shocked to my core... like ""what the...""

Honestly, I don't know what to make of this situation. I am completely lost and a loss for words and action. I just cried in the bathroom and having a hard time in general dealing with life. I have my own stresses of the world just like everyone else. Work stress (started a new job/now worried about being laid off), coronavirus stress, family stress, financial stress (I carry most of the financial burden for us). I just can't believe that someone I love would think so poorly of me and my family after all I've done to support and help him get through his issues.  I've given him absolutely no reason to think that way. I do understand the severity of PPD and how it can impact relationships, but it's hard... and I'm struggling. 

Sorry for the long post, had to get it off my chest. Any solid advice from spouses/partners/boyfriend/gf or others who have been in similar situations would be great. Im really struggling and need others who understand me, because I can't talk to my family or friends about this. I'm ashamed and embarrassed as they'd just tell me to leave the relationship. I truly love him and want to make it work, but whenever things like this happen I don't feel like I can stay in the relationship.... 

Thanks for reading."

688,My story,"I'm 16 and I'm diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and anxiety. It took me years to convince my mom that something was wrong, but to be fair, I wasn't telling her that I cried every day when I got home from school. I've felt symptoms of depression since I was 11, and anxiety and ADHD for as long as I can remember being alive. When my mom finally understood something was wrong, I was 15 and she started taking me to a therapist. After some therapy, and learning that it wasnt enough, they recommended medication. My mom and I had discussed that it was probably what I needed, so we were ready to make that change. I was started out on one medication for depression, and now I'm on 3 because of my diagnosis of ADHD. My mood is constantly low but it can change from happy to sad incredibly easy and for no reason, so I'm also on a mood stabilizer. I took the genesight test to see what would actually work for me and found that none of the medications I had tried were in the good section. So we changed up and the medicines I tried all helped a little bit but not enough. We flipped through the genesight packet to learn that my body doesnt react as well as others to serotonin based medications, which was all I had been given. We then found out that the only medications that worked a different way weren't paid for by insurance unless you're 18+. We are pretty poor, so we were about to give up. My mom researched prices to find that one of the medicines was only 30 dollars a bottle, so we called the psychiatrist to ask to make a change (we had to call because of the coronavirus being in the city where her office is.) She was happy to make the change and thought this would change my life. We called the pharmacy to get them to fill it and turns out that insurance actually does pay for it. I really feel this is a blessing, even though I'm not religious. I just started this medication yesterday, and I'm excited to potentially feel better. I wanted to share so I can tell you guys that its gonna get better. I never thought it would get better for me, but I have high hopes that it will."
689,Struggling to keep my head above water,"I'm just really damn tired, inside and out. I don't want to go in to it all, but I've recently been diagnosed with adult ADHD and I've lived with depression already more than half my life. I've had a very rough couple of months. We recently moved in with my wife's parents due to unavoidable circumstances. It's a lovely house in the country with loads of space. I can't complain, except for the loss of personal freedom. I don't drive and when we lived in the town I could just take myself off for a walk whenever I wanted.   


The adjustment has caused me to regress somewhat, from a position where my bad days were the exception (took me a long time to arrive there) to where I am now. Everyday is a struggle. My depression has deepend in the last few months. I feel worn down and burnt out. This coronavirus thing is hardly helping, of course. I also suffer from anxiety.   


Thing is, I'm relatively high functioning. I have to be; I'm a stay at home dad to our six year old daughter, who's going to be home for months now thanks to the inevitable lockdown. I get up, get dressed, make food, brush my teeth, I FUNCTION, you know? I don't cry, and I seldom lose my temper. There just aren't any outward signs I'm falling apart...but I am. I really, really am.   


I don't think I've ever felt so worn out in my life, which is ironic. I've just sent off a completed novel to an interested publisher. I should be ecstatic. They may not choose to publish it, of course, but still, it's an achievement. I just...can't take any pleasure in it. Instead I'm crippled by self-doubt. What if they reject it? I've been rejected by publishers before, but I've never gotten this far into the process.   


But it's not really about the book, or the cabin fever of being stuck around the house. Those are contributing factors, sure, but it's more about me, the way I feel about myself. In cognitive behavioural therapy they talk about 'Core Values', and how damaging it can be when those values, which inform so much of our thinking, are skewed. 

I don't have to dig terribly deep to find my defining core value, but I've recently come to realise just how all pervading it is in my life;  I don't like myself very much. In fact, sometimes I loathe myself.  Fundamentally I don't believe I deserve to be happy, or make a success of myself. Fundamentally I feel utterly worthless and unlovable.   


Trying to make myself feel differently is exhausting. The amount of effort just to get to baseline happiness or contentment is Herculean, and it's just...it feels like it's not worth it anymore. 

I am not contemplating suicide. But do I have suicidal ideation? Hell yes. I'm really fucking tired of feeling this way and can't see an end to it. I don't know what to do. Antidepressants, therapy...I've tried. I'm just so damn worn out and discouraged."

697,We don’t need drugs. I promise. Thats not the feeling we’re all chasing.,"I’ve spent about 2 years of my life know using. Mostly based around marijuana m. I dabbled a little here and there, but mostly marijuana. A lot of time I would use it just for fun. Just to get “high.” and Don’t get me wrong. It can really make you feel something. I actually think it can help people in certain cases. But i would try and use to it feel...something. I never really knew what. I just wanted that feeling. And i would chase it. and it would never stay. 
I was hospitalized over a year ago. A year and one day ago to be exact. I didn’t sleep for 4 days. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was experiencing what they like to call a manic episode. My brain was firing on all cylinders. all those happy chemicals starting going off. all at once. and they certainly weren’t supposed to. but hey did. No one believed me when i said i wasn’t on anything. It took a very long time to rule out the fact that it wasn’t drug related. I spent 3 months in AA after that. I really didn’t need to. 
But now, because that happened, because I had my little happy explosion, I know what that feeling was that I was chasing for so long. I have it. and i don’t need drugs to get there. And it wasn’t all good after the hospital, either. 
I was medicated. A lot. and at first I couldn’t really feel that much at all. Then I prevented myself from feeling. Because i didn’t want to go back. 
It was one of the roughest times of my life. And it was quite the change as just previously I was the happiest I had ever been. I thought all the happiness would last. That I would stay there and I never needed to feel anything again. But it didn’t. 
Now, a year later, I can confidently say that that “feeling” I experienced was all I needed. Now i know for a fact that whatever it was I was chasing isn’t caused by drugs. It’s caused by experience, by going out and looking at the world around you. And feeling it. Feeling the warmth in every person you talk to. Feeling the grass on your feet. Or the snow on your face. 
It’s in the little things we take for granted. 
Sometimes, I’ll walk downstairs and smell something cooking on the stove. And i close my eyes, and smell. What an amazing feeling. It’s something I can do all the time but probably never think about. 
We don’t need drugs. They can be fun. they may seem like the easiest way to feel something. Or maybe theyre even used to prevent yourself from feeling. 
We don’t need them. 
That’s not the feeling I think we’re all chasing. 
It’s right in front of us.
We just have to take the steps needed to see it. 
To feel it. 
It’s right there. I promise. It really is.

I’ve made a subreddit called LivingWide. It’s all about this. About feeling. and how we can maybe help one another to do so. If you think it may help you then i really think you should check it out. thanks"

702,I'm having difficulty trying to understand my mental composition and the behavior it causes,"23 year old male here, I've known since I was young that I'm just 'different' from other people, I can't quite put a finger on what or why. I'm currently on some shrooms (which has given me more introspective thinking than I'd normally have) which is why I'm writing this post alltogether. Here are some brief bullet points listed below on mental thought processes and behavior which I would probably categorize as not normal: 

* Absolutely obsessed with my looks and the looks of others, both on how I'm perceived and how others are. I get jealous incredibly easy and also believe others are jealous of me. At least half of the day I spend thinking about human faces and the ideal facial structure forming it in my own mind as if I were an autist forming geometric shapes all day (not using autist as an insult). To me, being good looking is the ULTIMATE pleasure in life
* I noticed the other day I was reading an article about two Chinese female nurses who were helping patients with COVID-19, and they themselves contracted it. The article was taking great care to go over the emotional and human side of having two women admitted to the hospital and only one surviving. None of it registered for me, I just remember skimming through and being glad the uglier one is the who indeed perished. I see less attractive people as being inherently less deserving of life 
* Bored all of the time. I mean ALL. OF. THE. TIME. I have to constantly weather away the boredom with weed, shrooms, and alcohol. I require constant stimulation and it's frustrating sometimes to look around at people who can just get by with living normal lives. I can't remember a time that I was fully sober in the last year. When I am sober, it feels like a fuzzy almost zombie-like state where I feel nothing. I don't feel like I actually enjoy hanging out with friends, and I only keep friends if they have some benefit for me 
* Sadistic behavior which has gotten progressively worse. It started online for over a decade with rampant trolling and cyberbullying. It has progressed into slashing car tires and shooting out car windows an air rifle. I will intentionally select 'poorer' looking cars because I fantasize about it causing even more financial burden and pain towards the victim

9 months ago: sex and masturbation started becoming less pleasurable. 

6 months ago: Started to get itching skin and muscle twitches, joint pains in fingers mainly.

3 months ago: Loss of pleasure from drugs namely mdma and ketamine (occasional use). Started having intrusive thoughts about physical harm coming to myself and unwanted sexual thoughts. Began to experience very negative thoughts about this all happening.

Been to the doctor and physically everything is fine. They think it's textbook depression and anxiety"

716,Freedom from temporal goods and the rat race vs. social validation,"Renunciation of temporal goods and living a simple life on the one hand and the pursuit of high status and wealth on the other. 

The former is often presented as a path to happiness and liberation, but in my opinion it leads to ostracism (to a certain extent, of course) because we are constantly being judged by an environment that mostly adheres to other values. 

I think that achieving social validation is also important for mental health so is renunciation worth the price? 

I would be happy to read your thoughts on this subject and could you please recommend some interesting publications (psychology, philosophy) on the subject?

I feel bad after eating food I consider ""bad,"" but I can't stop eating. As a result of this, I've gained lots and lots of weight since about 2012.

I did lose a lot of weight in 2015, but regained it all within these last 4 to 5 years.

Honestly, I don't want to be obese anymore, but I don't see if stopping anytime soon because I'm always fucking hungry. 

What's wrong with me?!"
720,My past self sexual events and anger issues are driving me crazy for the past two days,"Hey, guys, I've posted here about having repetitive negative thoughts a month ago and a person helped me overcome it but now I'm having the actual depression which is driving me crazy for past two days. 

*Past self sexual events*

I have done some unforgettable disgusting things for my self-pleasure in my past and now it's disturbing me. I've done sex chats with strangers and I've sent some of my pics without thinking for a second and now I'm regretting it and thinking why did I do that? What was I thinking at that moment?. Things like this I keep thinking them over and over again. The pics include one of the tables in my house, my clothes. I'm concerned about the strangers seeing my table, I'm concerned about them seeing my clothes. I feel like I shouldn't use or see the table or the clothes that I wore. 

*Anger*

After I had my mental break down my parents never forced me to do anything. They're just supporting and bearing with me. But I'm just disrespecting them. I easily get irritated and break their things in front of them. I use to break their things into pieces until my anger goes away. They're terrified of me but they're still supporting me. I'm their only kid. 

*Present* 

I've been worrying about my past and my anger issues for the past two days. I thought I could overcome this by myself but I just couldn't. I wanted some help. I never cry or take my feelings seriously but I couldn't control my tears yesterday. I never had suicidal thoughts, I never wanted to hurt myself but right now I'm thinking what's my purpose for living after doing all these things. I feel bad for my parents. I don't have answers to my feelings.

Any kind of advice will be helpful. Thanks for reading guys. Have a nice day and stay safe."
721,How can you explain or understand a 23 year old having a tantrum?,"I don't want to say 'tantrum' but just wrote it as that to make title consise. Also want to clarify that I cannot make this individual go to therapy as they do not want to and I'm simply trying to understand in fear of developing resentment towards them. 

Basically, they are a 23 year old student who for quite some time get into moods and everyone is afraid to say anything due to fear of them causing themselves harm or doing something drastic. 

In one of these moods, they all of a sudden started crying and almost hyperventilating. They started packing all their stuff and threatened to leave the house at that moment. It was over something minor, ovee a discussion about the whole household having to evacuate the premises for a week. Everyone was making accomadations and suggesting where and what everyone would do for a week while the home is inaccessible. They refused to compromise and go anywhere. We don't bring up anything if they refuse to do it once, bc we know that it is a trigger. So in this situation they werent being repeatedly asked to do something. It was only a discussion. They were also not dealing with the stress of planning, I was. 

Another time, while they were living with their aunt, they had an incident. This time it was over them not doing their part to clean the house. They were supposed to clean the bathroom and had not done so for several days, despite being asked multiple times. They started throwing their stuff around and started crying and their breathing again was extremely disregular. 

They may have other health concerns. A possible hormone misbalance, which they are being tested for. 

Does this sound like panic attacks or inbility to deal with stress? They also can get angry easily, but have a lot of patience and understanding with children. Maybe it is their parents and/or authority figures, bc they dont like being told what to do? They have once attempted what I think was suicide after one of these moments, but they said it was an accident bc they took the max amount of pills allowed in a day (was 6 a day, 1 every 4 hours)"

723,Mental effects of prolonged quarantine?," I'm a downright introvert usually, but two weeks of work from home so far has been driving me nuts!! I'm craving for human interaction! This is SO scary because half of my life decisions are based on how I could live a blissful single life. Makes me wonder, generally, how much mental trauma this isolation will bring in everyone's life!"
724,Please help me,"Hello everyone, I am sorry for taking your time but please help me. I don\`t suffer from a mental illness but i was so strssed for the last couple of weeks and I feel like i am about to break. I want to scream ""help me someone, please !"" but i can\`t. I never wanted this so much in my life before, i just want some words of support. I am sorry, I feel so selfish saying it like this but i don\`t know how to say it otherwise. I need some words of support from another human being. I am sorry for taking your time. Thank you for reading my plea."

727,10 Self care tips during current outbreak,https://kritikalpowers.com/10-self-care-tips-during-coronavirus-outbreak/
728,Why couldn’t I have been born as someone else instead?,"I hate the world. I hate humanity. Hate my family. Hate living. Hate everyone and everything.

Just want to die.

I can’t believe I had the misfortune of being born as the one person in this world I hate more than anyone, me. Whoever my real parents are they deserve to have their throats slit and their brains bashed in for conceiving me in the ultimate act of selfishness. Fuck them and fuck my current parents for adopting me.

I’m never gonna be happy as myself. My closest friends keep telling me to grow old with them once I graduate college, but that’s not happening. I’m killing myself when college ends. Why should I have to suffer for another 70 years?

I’m not being conned into living for however long this disgusting existence expects me to grow old as. I hate them all. I hate them for making me think I had something to live for. I’m glad I’ve come to this realization. 

I hate the way I am. It’s unfair. Why did I have to be the one person on this planet I hate more than anything...?

I hate life. I hate every aspect of living."

733,Wife is a Nurse in an ICU for Infectious Disease,"Hello everyone, I've had a lot of depression and anxiety recently due to the Covid 19 outbreak. My wife is currently a registered nurse in the only ICU at her hospital that takes care of infectious patients and this has been at the core of my anxiety.  She just turned 45 years old, a little overweight and slightly high blood pressure (which has been under control for a while now) so I'm hoping she isn't at particularly high risk.  I am preparing for the worst but am trying to find any shred of light in this bleak situation."
734,I think conflict terrifies me,"So I thought I had overcome my social anxiety, but I guess it just moved to the idea of conflict as opposed to being in a situation, so like I don't generally feel anxious talking to people in the moment, although I find it very hard to initiate conversations, although if someone else talks to me I don't mind talking back, and I don't really feel anxious talking, just kinda unsure, which is an improvement, but as I say conflict for sure scares me, so atm I go to this hobby thing and I wanna stop, but I was added onto a contract I didn't click, I haven't signed it, but the idea of conflict between me and the gym owner just gives me anxiety, also so I have Snapchat, and it seems like whenever I post I am overwhelmed by anxiety, I posted a piece and then went on a walk and I kinda dreaded it cause I was scared someone wasn't gonna like it, I guess I do still have anxiety, its just cause I am very good at avoiding conflict I never have to feel it. 
Also this might also be anxiety, but whenever I head into the city I tend to find myself feeling pretty warm and its kinda hard to think and I kinda need to chill out for a minute, idk why, all the people just kinda overwhelm me, even without me realising it. So my social life is pretty bad, and as is my social ability, tbh I couldn't tell you the last time I went out with a friend cause I honestly can't remember, although definitely not this year, maybe before September, or so, I amn't too sure, but basically social interaction isn't my forte, the only interaction I get is through my hobbies and family, although I amn't that social with either, so idk
Just wanted to write this down, I was thinking about the contract with the gym owner a lot and it was giving me a lotta anxiety, but writing it down here has calmed me down a good bit, so that's a plud"
735,"Doing my best to remain stable, but I can feel myself decompensating every breath I take","I have been through a lot over the past 7 years of my life and finally got to a point where I have my mental illness under control. Or at least I thought I did. All my battles, my self loathing, my hatred towards the world and those around me melted with the birth of my children. Both of them I credit for making me a better man and helping me find guidance through the darkness. But lately I have hit a rough patch again and I'm starting to feel like a failure. While I try to look at the faces of my amazing children and hold it together for them I also know that I'm not doing my part as a father like I should. I've had trouble with employment and I lost a job about a month and a half ago and recently I started new employment but of course here comes COVID-19 shutting down my work indefinitely and now I'm left jobless once again applying for unemployment and worrying about the future while feeling like a straight up scrub. I just went down on my medication not that long ago and I was proud to finally be dwindling but now I feel ashamed and almost disappointed with myself feeling like maybe I need to go back on my antidepressants and my mood stabilizers. But it kills me because I just got used to being a normal human being again and now I feel I'm doing to go back to a life where pills regulate my emotions instead of myself. And I understand that this is a normal part of life for so many, but you have to understand as a man I take pride and being able to manage myself for so long and I've made so many strides. I just feel like my world is crumbling. Maybe it's just today and I'm having an overflow of emotions that I've been holding in again and I apologize if this is the wrong place to rant I just needed to get it out. I guess I'm just looking for someone to tell me it's going to be okay"
736,Stress eating,"I realise there is advice for this on google but writing this and reading others advice or experiences is cathartic for me. I have just admitted to myself in the past day that I have a serious problem with stress eating.

Even when I feel sick, all I need to do is look at the trigger one more time and I’m ready to eat again. It is like a form of self harm because I know I am destroying my body with this but I continue to do it. I am starting to feel ready to stop but I just wonder what can take it’s place. I wish there was something to do to make me snap out of it. I think I have a lot of work to do on myself. Thanks for reading."
737,My dad went off his medication and is going crazy.,"I don’t live with my dad anymore. My parents are divorced and I use go over to his house every other week. He use to be remarried until he got another divorce. After that, he started to go sort of crazy. I still would go over to his house on most weekends. He was starting to get better and I thought I was going to be able to go to his house again like I use to. But then randomly he decided to go off his medicine. He is going crazy now. He threatens me. He yells at me through the phone and sometimes when I see him. So I don’t go to his house anymore. He now wants to go camping. That is ok, but he wants to bring his cats with him and let them outside sometimes when he goes camping. I tried arguing with him, but he just gets really angry and threatens me.

First of all, what should I do about the whole camping with his cats situation? Because I really don’t want him to lose those cats in the wilderness.

Secondly, even if the whole camping problem is solved, what should I do about everything else? He is off his medication and going crazy and not cleaning his house anymore. I just want things to be how they use to be. I don’t think I can do much, but what should I do?"
738,Psychologist wants me to go back to my meds.," First things first, my  psychiatrist said i might have schizophrenia in a initial stage.  

So, i was taking risperidal/risperidon whatever you wanna call it, some  months ago, i stopped because it was doping me, i was slow in everything  etc, but i was calmer, more open to other views on the world etc, but  sometime after i stopped it i've grown more angry than i was, more  bitter and spiteful, and having constant thoughts of hurting others, but i'm seeing things  clearly now, realizing i never had true friends, and people just make fun of me wherever  i go, to be honest i'm just tired of being a laughing stock at this point, and people dont care for your feelings in real life.  


So A i become a doped/pushover  bitch again.  
or B i continue to be angry at people and fantasizing to stab them(that to say the least)"

Only in some cases do I feel happiness. 

I honestly am having a lot of trouble feeling anything at all and I don’t know why. My life is going in the direction I would like it to. I’m honestly quite content with a majority of things. So why do I feel this way?"
742,A prescribed ADHD medication similar to Psuedoephrine's focus/mood lifting effects?,"# 

I take dexedrine and sometimes adderall but find them over stimulating and just not the right fit for me long term.

In the coming months, I would like to suggest to my doctor that I try something less stimulating but still helpful for focus and energy. What of these two would you suggest?  Modafinil and Vyvanse? 

I have to admit that I have had more success when feeling congested, and taking something with pseudoephrine in it than I have had on any ADD medication ie. adderall ie. dexedrine ie. wellbutrin"

Does anyone have any activities or ideas for this age group over the phone? Mainly I’ve been working on listening skills. Any ideas greatly appreciated!"
745,How are you keeping your head up and sober?,"Hey all.

I thought I was handling this well, but I literally just ran into the backyard and started scream crying so clearly I'm not. 

Background, I've got MDD and GAD, I'm an abuse survivor, and have flirted with binge drinking before. I live with my folks, fortunately only for 10 more days, and as an adult it's fucking rough. Two weeks ago my boyfriend dumped me (he had too many commitments between work and school and couldn't hold up his end anymore) and now with covid I'm stuck at home in the suburbs that I absolutely hate. 

How do I keep my head above water and sober for the next 10 days until I move into my own space?"
746,"Not sure if this is the proper sub to ask this, but why are my emotions stronger at night? In the morning I'm always so calm, even when thinking about the thing that made me so anxious the night before.","Not sure if this is a common problem, or if maybe it's related to me having a delayed circadian rhythm and naturally being a night owl. I appreciate your thoughts and input."
747,What if therapy is a big waste of time,"I've been seeing a therapist once a week for a few months. There are days when I feel really bad and need someone to talk to, and there are days when I'm feeling good and don't have anything to talk about. It seems like I'm wasting time (and money) by going to these sessions when I'm feeling good. Has this ever happened to you? What do you think I should do in these situations?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that therapists prefer that clients come in once a week, so my therapist would probably get annoyed if I canceled a lot. Also, it seems that if I don't visit the therapist for 2-3 weeks, then I start risking the therapist giving my weekly timeslot to someone else (and it took a while to get a spot with this therapist).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my therapist has a cancellation policy where I'm charged a fee if I cancel with less than 24 hours notice. There have been times when I've been feeling bad 24 hours before the session but I feel better on my own before the session (resulting in me having nothing to talk about). What should I do in these cases?"
748,Losing it.,"Hey people, 

the whole C.19 Pandemic hits me really hard, especially the feeling that everything in the cities is shutting down, everybody seems stressed out. And I am just a student, living from a small part-time job that wont give me money for the next 2(?) months, plus a stupid comment of a coworker of how *""You wouldnt even want to work even if you could, sorry.""* 

My anxiety got a bit better the last 2 days after crying (crying can help sometimes!) but now I´m all back in the downward spiral of thinking I will never find an alternative job, they will fire me from my old position, I will not have any money left in 2 months, that my life will go to hell and why I just wont end it right now. I even had the idea of going to the clinic, but I dont know, am I *""ill enough""*?

So my fear is not so much centered around the idea of dying by Covid-19. (I´m not in a riskgroup fortunately.) But the whole situation around it is grinding my gears...

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings, P."
749,I just got home from a week long stay at a psychiatric hospital.,"I got sent to a different psych hospital than usual. Honestly, I had a really good time while I was there. I had a routine, I got along very well with everyone and made quite a few friends, I got on medication I needed, and I was in a good mood essentially the whole time. 

Right when I got home, it was like reality slapped me in the face and I just feel shitty again. Almost immediately I got so stressed, my family tore apart my room and left it a mess, some of my stuff (purse, hoodies, sketch book) are gone, almost all of my friends from outside are mad and thinking I was ignoring them. 

I’m trying to stay positive and use some coping skills. It’s just hard because I didn’t expect stress and anxiety immediately, and I didn’t get to practice my coping skills while not in a situation where I need them...

I’m just having doubts that I can do this. In the hospital, I felt really hopeful. Now, I’m just scared again. Any tips on how to gain and somewhat maintain a better mindset? What coping skills work for you?"
750,I need help I think I have schizophrenia,"I just blowed up when I was talking to my friend, I was talking via the personalitys, one sad, on ABSOLUTELY neutral, One really aggressive and not loyal, I talked like neutral one had some time to talk to my friend about the personalitys and how much aggressive personality is a prick.... Now I'm neutral idk I'm breathing very heavily and my heart really hurts, I think These started because I just wanted to change how i live and generally change my lifestyle, because genes already gave me tall persons height, but no brain... I'm ok with height but I want to change brain and power of it but no results, I just wanted to be loyal, intellectual, and plus no good communication with parents or anyone, relationships too.

753,just rambling about my life,"i just need to vent a little bit because ive been crying about these issues a lot for the past 10 years and i seeked out therapy again but the process of getting there will take a long time and with corona and all i wont get it until a long ass time and im losing it

sorry about my english by the way

oh and i dont even know if these kinds of posts are allowed here im so sorry if im breaking any rules

to summarize my life in short

1) i spent my early years with my physically abusive mother (who later turned narcomaniac, but its fine because i havent seen her in years. the only issue is that she still stalks me and wont leave me alone despite me having told her numerous times to just give it up)

2)  then i spent some (genuinely good) time with my dad and his gf (who later turned out to be a gold digger and was with us only for the money, i lost about 10 family members when they separated)

3) moved to another country only for my dad to fall into depression and become an alcoholic 

4) i started blaming myself for my mothers abuse, and truly got myself believing that i deserved all she had done to me (she tried to kill me and herself at the same time on multiple occasions) and ended up developing severe depression  
since i was so young when i started having those thoughts, my self identity formed around being somebody who deserves to die and to have pain in her life (which led to years of self harm and multiple suicide attempts)

5) my brother developed a personality disorder and pretty much abandoned me to take care of my dad on my own

for the past three years i have been lying to myself about how im really feeling, ended up missing an entire year of school, and now for the past 6 months i have been feeling extremely suicidal and i have wanted on multiple occasions to hurt myself (i did relapse once, but i was drunk during that episode so i dont really think about it)

a lot of my energy goes into not doing anything to myself

tmi maybe but last week i got my nipples pierced because i have been aching to feel some kind of pain and honestly i dont know how long ill be able to lie to myself about being ok

the thought that no adult in my life wants to take responsibility for me is debilitating for me

i just cant understand whats so unlovable about me like im a genuinely good person at the core

and even though i have reached a state in my life where i have found friends that i love and love me back, and im in an extremely healthy relationship, since im only 19 years old theres no one that really understands me and im glad no one does but i just wish i could get help sooner

i need to get myself to believe that i deserve to live because most of the time i really cant understand what im still fighting for"
754,"During my struggles and hard times, NO ONE... NOT ONE single person was there for me.","Everyone else at least has one person to get them through - a friend, family member, therapist, etc. 

I had absolutely no one. 

NO ONE knows what I went through or how hard it was/is for me. 

I had to struggle for years all by myself, just bottling it up inside. 


It makes me angry that everyone else at least had someone. And I had absolutely no one, and no one knows."
755,I may not have covid but it is ruining my life,"Lost my job due to covid. I have no savings because I've been using it all to pay for bills and tuition. I haven't been jobless since i was a pre-teen and i am in my mid-twenties now.
My university moved all of our classes online, but all the profs are not uploading courses and/or uploaded late, which makes focussing hard enough. 
I am already on academic probation, i have been in university for 6 years already trying to attempt a 4 year degree and i have already failed on of the classes i am taking TWICE. I felt so good and on top of everything at the beginning of the semester and now everything is falling apart. If i fail this class again i view it as a death sentence. I am miserable and life seems hopeless"
756,Struggling and don’t know why. Comment below and I’ll try to find out.,Have you been in a toxic cycle and want to know how tot get out but don’t what causing it?
757,Disappointed over grades,"Now the U.K. has shut all schools and colleges due to the Coronavirus, exams aren’t taking place in May and June. I was partly relieved, but now the more I think about it the more disappointed I become. 

I feel like I’m capable of getting an A in one of my exams, especially given the three months we still had to go until the real thing. Instead, because of my past assessments, I’ll probably end up with a B. 

I’ve never had a B in my life. I’ve told myself my entire life I’ll never be happy with a B. I’m terrified that because of me not getting to sit the exam and therefore them not taking the improvement into consideration, that I’ll end up with a B and I fucking hate myself for it, even though it’s not my fault. I feel like a total failure and humiliation and like it’ll ruin any reputation I had. I’m not going to be that straight A student that I always wanted to be, that I always was. If I’m not the smart one that what the fuck am I? I feel like it’s a total embarrassment and I can’t bare the thought of having that on my CV for the rest of my life. 

(Of course i don’t mean anything bad to anyone else who got a B, I’m just talking about myself, my own expectations and targets, and how it’s extremely poor for what i know I’m capable of)"
758,No point left worth living,"First my situation: I'm 20 going to university and have 3 semester left to finish my bachelor. After that I just have to take up my fathers business to earn multiple hundred grand a year without much effort. So my life is smooth sailing and everything seems fine. I'm complimented quiet a bit on my looks and my family situation is stable. I might be arrogant enough to say that I'm quite rationally acting/thinking. So I always search for a reason behind my actions. ATM I'm mostly on autopilot and just act out the predefined life with some friends to be socially accepted and the university as it's the easiest way to get lots of money to open up future possibilities. But I just see no point in this life. What's the difference between dying now or dying in 60 years? The sole reason I'm still here is my brother. I could never let him behind with such a big mental scar. I find no permanent happiness in relationships, hobbies, friends or stuff like that. The only thing that might be fun in my life is working. (brings me unfound happiness but only for some limited time). I always try to find rational solutions to my questions but all I'm finding is the absolute pointless nature of life. There's no point in having children, continuing or race, making social contacts, building a family or to summarize the whole living. I can't find any starting point to finding a reason to live. Suicide is not an immediate thought I have but I can't really stand living my remaining life on autopilot. If anyone found a way to get some reason to remain here the rest of our remaining miserable life I'd be glad if you could share that with me... :)"
759,I feel so alone,"I recently have been diagnosed with depression and I don’t know what to do I’ve self referred for some counselling but everyone I have talked to have made me feel like my feelings aren’t validated and I’m feeling guilty about how I’m affecting people, it’s like I can’t put into words how bad it’s getting so everyone just assumes it’s a “teenager angst thing” (I’m 16) and I know it must sound like it but I’ve been crying every night and have been getting progressively stronger thoughts about suicide which are scaring me and I’ve tried talking to my bf about it but he cannot support me with anything and I feel so alone I can’t talk to anybody without feeling like what I’m experiencing isn’t as bad as I feel it is which is really frustrating but I feel selfish for feeling that way 

TL:DR: I got diagnosed with depression and can’t talk to anybody and I feel guilty for feeling like it and my bf isn’t being supportive or loving at all and I feel so alone"
760,A narrative on suicide and mental health (txt),"My Blue Monday

My blue Monday came early this year. The day where everyone quits their jobs or offs themselves (and not “how does it feel to treat me like you do…” ). I was one of them. Off-ing myself, not leaving a job as I’m immersed in student-hood once again at the ripe age of 34. I spent the day ejecting, self destructing, clearing the cobwebs of niceties from my mind, being a rude shit to my friends, slamming the proverbial door in their faces and doing all I could to shut out the light from the world. God knows, I am tired of the light.

All of my sins, my self hatred, my disgust, lay before me. No room on the table for anything good. Positivity, the coward in the gloom at the back of my mind, buried deep in the pain and the fire of depression.

About depression: it is a shadow. A shadow that is measured not in metres but in years, always following, always there, attached at my feet under every step. It waxes and wanes with the intensity of light cast upon it, and that depends on those complicated chemical reactions in my brain which control how far the shutter blinds open and how much light creeps into the room. Those reactions have been out of balance since I was born… and tonight, I wish more than ever that I hadn’t been.

My thoughts of those who love me are too far away to call to mind. Nothing feels real or tangible right now. I am watching this play out behind a glass screen like some petulant child glued to a TV. The medication I am on is successful in removing my crippling anxiety and has allowed that un-watched pot boiling on the gas stove to spit and bubble over. Sadly, the medication doesn’t touch the sides when it comes to my other “issues”. It’s like taking morphine for a broken leg, in that you no longer feel the pain but you can sure as hell run a marathon and do yourself ten-times the damage. You don’t notice until you’ve crossed the finish line and can see the bone sticking right through the flesh. These “issues” are an unchained guard dog roaming free in the yard, foaming at the mouth and baring teeth. But now the gate is open and it’s free to mingle with the hopes and dreams and intricate nuances of everyday life.

And so that pot boils over. The insurmountable weight of gravity sucks the water down the side of the pan into the gas flame and it vapourises instantly. I am raging now, I cannot see though my eyes are open. That proverbial TV is at the other side of the room, my life beyond it, and I am being dragged backward across the carpet. My hands are shaking and the skin on my chest is tighter than a tribal drum as if it will somehow burst wide open and the sheer might of my anger will spill out into the room, laying waste to all it touches.

So I drink to numb the pain. I drink to stay the demons, to feel anything else but me for just one tiny, little, second. I drink so I can breathe and have the feeling of air in my lungs overtake the wrenching ache. One. Two. Three beers, that half a bottle of whisky from the cupboard, the white wine on the side – I drink it room temperature. It all goes straight down. Sweet poison. All within an hour or so. But the solace it brings is short lived, the calm before the storm. The metabolism of the alcohol somehow, unsurprisingly, exacerbates the whirlwind in my brain. It’s the perfect storm and I am lost at sea.

MAKE.
IT.
STOP.

It’s been about 20 years since I last tied a noose, Google refreshes my memory and I laugh defiantly at the large banners on every instructional website that state “if you’re considering tying a noose because you’re having suicidal thoughts and need immediate help coping, please call emergency services such as 911 or 999 or a suicide hotline…”. Glossed over in my drunken stupor. I tie it anyway. The NHS Crisis Team hotline number saved in my phone is the friend I’ve lost touch with and feel weird about calling. So I don’t.

My flat has no stairs, the common hallway is secluded but it’s still public, same as the balcony. I need privacy, no one to stop and look on, to find me, to film it on their phones for their vacuous, self-absorbed Instagram or YouTube fiction. I want silence. Peace. Finally.

I go to the exercise tower in my bedroom. The tower that I’ve used to keep my body trim and my mind sharp, that I’ve used to fight through the darkness when times were hard. The tower that will be the last thing I cling to on this earth. I secure the rope to the top hand holds with a round turn and two half-hitches. My fingers baulk at the coldness of the metal holds. The noose now swings gently and settles against the stillness of the air. I am unhappy with the resting height so I readjust the top knot. A testing tug with my hand and the rope confides in me that it can do the job.

I turn, looking through the door to the living room, the “magnificent vista” gracing my eyes, and slip the noose over my head, the knot resting on the nape of my neck. It is as heavy as the endless night I find myself in, as heavy as my burden upon the world. No thoughts of my time and travels, my loves and achievements, those times that I have been a good person. Only this second exists, right now. Despair, loneliness. My legs slump and I feel the tightness around my neck. I give no time to thought any more, no poignant mindful farewell, no parting scribbles on a scrap of paper, no feeling anything at all other than the anger driving my body forward against the rope. I lean into it with such conviction that I fear the fibres might shred and snap as they creak like a shipyard junker tugging against the tide and the quay. But it holds firm. Each millimetre of my skin beneath the rope being crushed and chaffed and crumpled. It gives me as much slack, as much room for error, as much forgiveness as I have allowed myself in thirty-four years. My brain fizzles and static forms in the moments between what my eyes see and my brain processes. This heart in my chest accelerates its beating: I wish it had never begun to in the first place. Numbness creeps into my hands and face. I can feel my lips spitting parts of themselves out into the world as blood throbs around my body. My legs lose their will to hold my body from the floor, this burden now belongs solely to the noose. The static takes hold with a furtive permanence and I can no longer breath even the most simple molecules of air. I feel my mind flipping over to the dreamy softness of the dark, so gentle and calm against the whirring chaos of the light. Glass-like thick, black water. Moving soft and slow.

I’ve longed to still the waters all my life. And now I am finally here, beginning to drift in that blissful sea.

But. I stop.

My legs fight again for their right to hold me, the blood throbs through thighs and skin and bone. My heart smashing its fists against the walls of my chest from deep within my muscles. I stand and my arms lift instinctively to loosen the rope that is still burning into my neck. It takes considerable effort and concentration to ease the knot. I am dizzy. I breathe deep, for only a few seconds. Why? I do not know, there is no fear here. Not any more. I want this. Still the waters. Welcome the dark.

So, I try again. I lean into the rope as hard as I can until I am losing consciousness. More this time. Take me, please take me. But the instinct in my legs betrays me once again and I stand. Fuck it. I take the noose from my neck in annoyance and anger and frustration. The moment becomes too much. I feel the worn threads of the carpet come up to meet my face. The childish red wetness of my cheeks stinging against polyester fibres of the floor covering. A cheap grave this would’ve made indeed.

I am ashamed. This truly is the darkest of winters.

I don’t know what I was expecting. Some relief, some shining light. Some kind of cleansing. But all I am left with is me. Just me. The same me whom my friends and my family love, who wishes for only peace and love in the world. The same me who wishes to leave all that behind, to drop it where it lay and walk away, but I can’t. I am still not sure what ethereal tether holds me to this earth. Some invisible force which holds its hands up to death and says “No. No. Not today. Not right now”. Truthfully, life just then goes on. It feels the same as it’s always felt. I expected some emotional recovery period but there never is one. I took my car to the garage for repairs. I met my friend for a pub lunch. I did do something differently this time, though… I told my friends. I did not hide away from the light. I don’t tell my parents. I still haven’t. They are the most wonderful people and have supported me in so many ways for which I am enternally grateful, but they are not built for this. They are not equiped to deal with me in this way and that is ok. You cannot be something you’re not. I am at peace with that.

I used to wonder why no one listens until you’ve tried to kill yourself? Is it that we’re just empty threats until we’re too much to deal with? Too real and far removed from this nice comfy bubble. I’ve been told plenty of times that I’m not unwell enough for support – it’s easy to ignore the truth if you aren’t listening. But, in fairness, I am a liar. A very good one. I lie to myself and everyone around me. I lie so I do not have to face the truth, so I do not have to feel anything. Life for me is the pill that catches in the throat, most of the time I choke on it until I am blue in the face. But sometimes I cough it up along with the parts of myself I cannot bear to see, spilling myself, unwelcome, out into the world. We are supposed to keep quiet, hiding some kind of taboo but it’s a taboo that’s covered in sand, either sinking under its own weight or exposing itself to the sky like some fraud when the wind shifts. Where was my support? What do I have to do to get that? Why did I go through all of this feeling so alone? Surely the doctors’ attitude that teenagers often get mental health issues because they are traversing the “formative years” is, for the most part, complete crap. Yes, there are hormonal changes but if it’s that bad then isn’t it because the system is broken? Is this when the creativity gets beaten out of you for good, the last smoke tails curling upwards from the dying embers of the freedom youth allows us. The finishing touches of schooling hardening the clay before that brutal injection into the veins of the working world. Keep the poison coming. Hammer in the pieces until they fit. This time it’s different. I am no longer prepared to lie. Not to myself. Not to those whom I love. I am trying to be honest. I am trying not to be ashamed. Ashamed to be alive, to feel emotions, to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or a terminal disease, or ashamed to live with my mistakes and wrongdoings. I love my friends. I am grateful for them. They have unkowingly held the broken peices of me together for so long. I know now that I have discredited them by not being honest and not telling them of my struggles. I am learning. I am not afraid to do that anymore.

I am speaking now. Loud and clear. But the truth is I don’t think anyone is ever really listening. I am not looking for a mountain to move or an epiphany of the masses, rushing toward me with big open arms to sweep me up with a comforting hug. I am not weak or looking for attention or someone to hold me upright as my legs give way under the weight of the world. Just someone to listen to those nuances, those tiny disturbances from tiny butterfly wings beating against the air. But the silent signals of mental illnesses too easily go unnoticed in those countless 6-minute, overworked-doctors’ appointments: condescending, dismissive, playing it down so they don’t have to acknowledge the product of a broken society, so they don’t have to deal with the ugly condition of the human mind, so perpetually dragging us down. “You’re just a little sad, everybody gets sad sometimes”. I don’t blame them. Even the best workers in the world palm-off tasks they are not equipped to deal with, be it through exhaustion or uninterest or lack of time. So the difficulty of diagnosing something so complex in an appointment in which you only have sufficient time to sit down and remove your coat before putting it back on again and leaving with a prescription for a preferred SSRI or broad-spectrum antibiotic is not unbelievable. Quite normal, in fact. I’ve palmed-off many things in my working life which I haven’t been equipped or bothered to deal with. So, prescribing medication to make us conform somehow – amoxicillin, penicillin, Setraline, Prozac, coffee, alcohol, consumerism, sex, it’s all the same. It all allows us to function when we’re running on empty. Save those few amazing people, friends and professionals who CAN help, this is just brushed off like a passing fly. And why wouldn’t it be? We do the same to those with broken bones or cancer. Wish them well and carry on with our own lives. There is no fault there, we fill our lives with such business (“busy-ness”), such stress, we barely have time for ourselves, without making the time for others and their difficulties. Too much weight and you topple over. Something needs to change, somewhere. We need to stop putting sticking plasters over a gunshot wound, we need to stop the bullet being fired in the first place. Why can no one see this?

Afterwards, I had a call with the Point of Entry Team within the NHS mental health services. I had the sense to realise I was in a bad way over a month before and got the GP to refer me to them (finally, a successful appointment – the squeaky wheel gets the oil, it would seem). I was brutally honest for the first time in my life about my illness, no hiding bits of me away, no shame. It was a long call but it was worth it. The psychologist was excellent. What a difficult job she does every day. One of many whom I will meet on this journey that are on the receiving end of the ramblings of broken minds each day, whom I am eternally grateful toward and for whom I have unwavering respect. We talk like friends do. We talk like people with a common goal, in search of something better from the grit and the dirt we grew up in. She tells me I have strong bipolar traits. She tells me to call the crisis team if I decide to try to take my life again. I tell her I will but I know, and she knows, that when that plane is going down it crashes quickly and sometimes you just stare at the rocks in front of you, hurtling toward your face, and you just can’t think to find the parachute.

Strangely, this is my break in the traffic. Allowing me to cross to a better side where I can walk in the sunshine. It feels like a cold shower waking the senses. Nothing she tells me is new but it feels good for someone give me a hand toward a proper diagnosis. Turns out I’m more than “just a little bit sad”.

The condition: The mania I feel is like a gnat or a fly buzzing incessantly, crashing into the walls of my brain. Some days it’s like running through stinging nettles. It’s everywhere, every inch of skin tingling. Feverish. The elation is insuppressible. I am king in my own world. I am the mighty warrior, defeating all which stands in my path. I create, seemingly endlessly, a river of ideas flowing from my mind, words falling in great torrents from my mouth. Nothing can happen quick enough. I want to run free, to wherever, no matter how far, no consequence. I will go fast and strident into the breaking day and will not slow down or cease until night, when only the body stops but the mind races on. Sleep will not grace me and when it does it is as vivid and intense as the waking day rushing past me. Everything is at warp speed. I am so agitated that I cannot sit still and the slightest inconvenience makes me feel like bursting from my clothes, Hulk-like, and smashing through the world in front of my eyes. The drugs, the sex, the “rock and roll” just melts into one of many blurry gaps in my memory, sloshing from side to side in the stark, disconnected hangover of a manic episode. Over time, the flip-flop of emotions continues and I begin to find calm. And for a few days after about 6-8 weeks in I am clear-headed, conscious, alert, level, what you would call “NORMAL”, and then the fear creeps back in like those imminent thoughts of unwanted just-watched horror movie ghosts in the dead of night. In every corner of the room, the light fading fast around you, under the bed, in the wardrobe. No parent to comfort you and no duvet to wrap yourself tight in to protect you from the things that go bump in the night and make you feel like everything is going to be alright. What an exhausting life this is, to be continuously pulled apart by those horses. One called mania, one called depression.

Over the next few weeks I sink lower and lower. That emotional submarine seeking deeper, darker worlds where the weight of your own mind is too heavy for your body to lift from the bed and the thought of moving an inch is akin to climbing Everest. Exaggerating I am not. I turn the key over in the ignition but the engine doesn’t fire. I wear the darkness like a cloak around me, soft, comforting, and sickly. And so the cycle continues. Rinse and repeat… Rebuilding myself and those relationships that I have thrown against the wall in anger and broken each and every time. I am immensely guilty for my actions, for my words, for the consequences of my existence.

I visit the psychiatrist. She is a wonderful being with a keen ear and a calm demeanour. I feel much better, naturally, with some distance between this visit and the event. My cycles are changing and I have some energy to exist, now. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like I shouldn’t be here. And that every breath I take is stolen from someone else. Someone deserving. But I am here and I have been writing down how I feel each day so I no longer have the luxury of dishonesty, explaining it away and pretending it isn’t me, it isn’t real, it is just a warped memory. Not today, dear boy. Today is justified. We sit, she talks, I talk, we both listen. Not just to each other but to the ebb and flow of feelings and emotions that spill forth into the air. I feel better getting all this “off my chest”. She tells me I have either bipolar type 2 or cyclothymia (a milder form of bipolar), but she can’t give me a formal diagnosis without a review in 4-months’ time, after I have been “clean” for 6 months. I am very careful to say “have” and not “am”. This is an illness, it does not define me. You are not your stubbed toe or your broken arm, you are not your wheelchair or your skin colour or your job that you may love or despise. I explain I have spent many years “clean” but she wants to be certain, given the complexity of her craft, and I respect that. I now have a reason to stop abusing my mind and body. I am grateful for the carrot at the end of a stick.

In truth, we’re all ill. It’s just “by how much?”. I’ve just got a little less of what this broken society deems acceptable and controllable. And how ill must we be to stray so far from the symbiosis of nature and its processes. Creating our beliefs in fictitious things like money and security. We’re all completely fucking mental.

What truly matters is being in nature and not knowing names for everything but knowing what place and what role it has on this earth. To know this in our souls because it is in our genes, pulsing through our veins with every kick of the heart. Connected. Something we will never ever know. Not to the bone. We are not designed for bricks and mortar and office chairs and sitting in traffic swearing at the mostly-empty cars in front whilst slowly poisoning ourselves as we suck on the billowing, black exhaust pipe smoke. I want none of it, thank you. I have never felt consistently better than when I’ve been in touch with nature, out in the world and amongst the trees and calling birds. Isn’t it time to actually live a little bit? Isn’t it time to reject the ideals presented to us as statute?Isn’t it time to cut the fat from the world? Working your best, most able years just to retire in a big house with nothing to do,  nothing you are able to do, and have the brain fade away and die in front of the eyes of your family members so you can bequeath to them a larger portion of that fictitious belief system. What a joke this all is. I’m not ashamed to say that and I feel better and stronger and richer for it. I know now it does not, and will not bring me happiness, or peace.

My point is, I am becoming comfortable within myself and in living the life that I want to live. With that, the cycles will be more manageable, I will be able to function in my own way. I have hope. A hope I’ve never felt before. I will have bad days, and bad weeks, but these are just sticks floating by in that proverbial river. I am learning what I love and doing more of it. And doing less of what I despise. And in this hope that I am holding with fear and excitement like a father does with a newborn child, I know that you will see hope, too, for yourselves and your futures. Never be ashamed to be you. We’re all ill and we can’t all fit into the same mould. I hope that those without a mental illness will read this and gain a little insight into what it is like to have an illness as legitimate as a broken leg or cancer. So when you meet someone who is “just a little sad”, know that they may be at the end. And you might save their life by listening to them. Remember that everyone is different and your reality is not everyone else’s. Remember that those people who have broken bones, or wheelchairs, or cancers, or poor mental health are numerous. We’re not alone. You’re not alone. Educate. Speak. Listen. People are dying from poor mental health but we do not need to. It can be survived. Managed. Healed. Beaten. Remembered. And respected.

All I needed to do is talk about it honestly. I am so thankful for such wonderful friends and professionals to help me through. I trust in them.

761,Why can’t I trust anyone,"It runs my body everyday, people I talk to on a basis I can’t trust with basic things. I feel like lovers are talking to others when I have no proof or friends are talking behind my back when they are always friendly. These things were often true when I was younger but I should have changed, adapted. Why can’t I trust anyone because all it does it hurt me and make me cry, thinking I should distance myself from these people. I know it’s on me but why can’t I stop it?"
762,Atychiphobia,"Today, after feeling like I have been a void for the past week, I cried in front of my mother.  I am a 21 year old man attending university, and it's around this time that the depressive wave enters.  Every single semester I feel the suffocation grab me.  But during my inevitable crying session, my mom said something that gave me a revelation.  I have atychiphobia.  Along with depression and anxiety, I finally found that missing puzzle piece.  I have a fear of failure.  My entire life I've had a fear of never amounting to something and failing.  For godsake I cried in the seventh grade because I thought I was going to get a B in Algebra.  I tried to convince my therapist to hospitalize me so that I wouldn't have to present my senior project.  Every club or activity I participate in, I bail because I'm terrified I will never meet expectations.  I've only ever confessed to a girl 3 times, 2 of which were to the same girl.  I'm terrified of rejection and failiure and never amounting to anything.  Every time I take a test, I feel my heart rate increase and start to feel panicked.  Yet I can't be completely sure.  Sometimes I feel this calm when I take certain tests.  Sometimes I feel this lack of desire to try when I'm doing something.  Is that the atychiphobia or the depression.  Am I procrastinating, because I'm depressed, afraid, or lazy.  But now I know.  I know now.  I'm going to try therapy again.  I was never able to fully elaborate on my depression and anxiety, but now I can work on this.  This is something I can explain."
763,What does this mean?,"Almost every minute of my life I am daydreaming. I can’t stop thinking of fantasy worlds where life can go anyway I want. It happens to me a lot because I use it as an escape from reality. In these daydreams I vision myself to be perfect but in reality I’m the exact opposite. I don’t like who I am and don’t want to live anymore but I’m too afraid to die. This has started around the past week and My adrenaline has also been pretty high sometimes. I’m starting to strangely feel love, in a sense that I’m in love with someone but in reality I’m not which is the strange part and the feeling is killing me, I just want it to stop and another thing that is weird is that I keep thinking of beautiful nature and suicide and I am also feeling super calm sometimes, like I’m on some sort of strange drug. What does this mean? How do I stop thinking and feeling this way?"
764,"Why do we sometimes feel nothing? No excitement, no motivation, no goals",Going through a phase of feeling like the most motivated person in the world and then a phase of nothingness.

I want a good job a good secure life and a good family but I just get this feeling every so often. Also going through treatment for anxiety atm (on waiting list)
765,Anxious and it’s killing me,I’ve been overthinking everything lately. Even when things are going smoothly I need to think of every possible way things could go wrong and try to come up with solutions. And usually there are no solutions to these non-existent issues. But this thinking is affecting the way I deal with actual problems. I’m always on edge and can’t work properly. I make too many stupid mistakes at work. Every morning After coming into work I’d have to go straight to the toilets to gather myself/catch my breath before starting work. Sometimes even cry for no apparent reason. I get flustered when faced with actual problems. Which aren’t even big compared to what other people in the world go through. I’m a mess.
766,Post college workplace is a cycle of hatred.,"Life is a joke. All people care about is themselves. They never think about how their actions affect the lives of others. They go to work and pride themselves in making their bosses happy, instead of prioritizing their own sanity.

It’s seems that life is a continuous of bullshit that eventually leads to mental breakdown."

771,Abandonment issues,"I’m new to this sub, and I probably won’t lurk in it for long because of triggers, but I really need to vent a bit about my abandonment issues and I can’t do it to my friend because it’s about her, so I came here in hope of acceptance.

Obligatory long post and trigger warning!


So, I have had abandonment issues for the last couple of years, which stem from my best friend avoiding me and abruptly cutting ties with me around the same time my depression was at its worst, making me believe that everything bad around me was my fault which led me tomy most serious (and hopefully last) suicide attempt. After this I developed issues trusting people, and even worse issues with handling the few relationships I have/had.

Go forward two years two years and the situation is this: I only really have 1 friend, and she lives a couple hours away as she’s started uni (I’m still in my hometown as the suicide attempt ended up with me having to take a year off school). We rarely see each other, but this weekend she was visiting for a concert. I hadn’t seen her since bafore christmas, and she still hadn’t gotten the moving in gift that I intended to give her in september of last year as most of our few plans were cancelled by her. We talk about meeting up and she mentions that she might not have time as she has some big school stuff coming up and as she’s coming up with 2 uni friends. 

She agrees to text me regardles as soon as she knows so that I can at least give her the moving in gift 6 months late if we won’t have time to meet up (I’d just go to her place, give her the gift and then leave). She never texts back. I think fair enough, she was probably busy, so I text her the day before she’s going back asking about the concert (still nothing despite me texting her on saturday). I start to get worried that she doesn’t care about our friendship anymore, but I let it slide. Today I find pictures a common friend of ours posted about the two of them going out for coffee this last weekend, and it’s safe to say that my brain went on overdrive.

Here we have my only real friend, ignoring me and not at least telling me that she won’t have time to meet up (I would’ve been okay with a “I only have time to meet one person and ____ and I discussed this some time ago), not even answering my text to her 4 days after I sent it. I get flashbacks from my old best friend cutting me out of his life suddently, and now I cannot help but believe that she’s doing the samd thing.

I’m terrified of my only friend leaving me. My anxiety is so bad that I’ve had severe nightmares these last couple of nights, and I’m crying in the midst of an anxiety spike while writing this because I really don’t want to lose my closest (and only) friend again. I wish I could get my shit together."
772,Can you help somebody who is completely psychotic but not violent in any way?,"My friend is a flat earther,  and before you jump to the first thought about them that you get, let me explain more.

 He's one of those too smart for his own good types, graduated high school the top 6th in the class without ever bringing a backpack to school, it was a private catholic school. He has an unparalleled memory which probably allowed him to do so well in highschool.

 He is certainly done his share of drugs but has always been an anti-authority type believing that the government and people in power are inherently evil perhaps from his father leaving him at a young age, he used to be a staunch atheist, and suddenly the flat Earth helped him believe fully in God and since then he sees coincidences almost every day that tell him he is right.

A second question I have is how much are the experiemlnce of coincidences correlated to mental illness?

 He believes he has a daemon following him around telling him things or telling him hes on the right path, not a voice in his head that is evil but more of the ancient Greek idea of something that gives you signs.

 He seems to have a problem with accomplishing small short term goals and always has an idea of what he will do tomorrow but nothing has come to fruition.

 Whatever he is suffering from is not typical, his family hoped he would hit a rock bottom and ask for help but that was three years ago and he has no intention of going home. He calls himself the Jester and he has an idea that he is a messenger of God.

 He's tall handsome and can hold the attention of a Room is 35 and has never shown any signs of violence although he can be incredibly mean if you press him about his idea that science is all pseudoscience, that cosmology and the understanding of the universe is all fake.

He thinks 911 happened with a type of dustification weapon. That the freemasons run the world and false flags happen all the time (Boston bombing, Sandy hook)

 I don't know of anything that I could do to help him, And I just wonder how many people like him are out there that will never ever get help and will never be studied by scientists, so we won't know what is actually causing such behavior.

Edit: grammar"
773,I just want to be myself,"[Crossposting this to several different subreddits because I’m not entirely sure where this fits]

Even after 22 years of being alive, I really don’t know anything about myself. It’s becoming a major problem in my daily life and mental health.

For some context, I was homeschooled from 6th to 12th grade. I had friends from church during that time but did not have the typical “high school experience” that so many seem to have learned so much from. I am now a senior in college, soon to be a fifth year. Take one look at my post history and you’ll see that I’ve been addicted to porn for all of those 4 years. I like to think I’m a recovering addict, as I’ve put much more effort for the past year or so into purging my life of this addiction, with varying levels of success. I recently had a 42 day clean streak, but soon fell into another season of binging. I believe my addiction may be a cause, at least in part, of some of the issues I’m about to explain.

As with many mental health issues, mine are fairly difficult to put into words, but they can probably be summarized by this: I don’t know my personality. I really have no idea how to talk or act around other people— you might say I don’t know what my “default” is. A common tip I’ve heard for dealing with social anxiety is “Just be yourself!”, which is problematic if you have no idea who “yourself” is. I’ve spent so many years trying to win friends to compensate for my lack of friends in high school— basically being a people pleaser. I’ll usually adopt the personalities of people I’m around, even when I’m aware that I’m doing it. It’s just subconscious. I can’t turn it off without overthinking literally everything I say or do. That gets real old real quick. I’ve spent so long trying to be funny to get people to like me that I can’t have a genuine conversation now without it feeling forced, especially around people that I want to like me (e.g. I can talk to my mom naturally but not my brother). Honestly I think being in quarantine with just my family for weeks on end is making me realize how messed up I am.

I just want to be myself. I want to build genuine relationships with people. I want to be able to speak naturally without overthinking every word that comes out of my mouth. I’m just so crippled by insecurity that I really don’t know where to go from here.

Thanks for reading. Any advice is very appreciated."
774,Dealing with parent problems...,"A lot of my self esteem issues are caused by how my parents treat me, but I don’t know what to do about it. They treat me like I’m a failure who can’t do anything right, getting all mad and acting like I’m stupid when I’m anything less than perfect. I’ve tried talking to them about it and they just act like I’m being silly. Don’t know what to do at this point..."

777,Does anyone recognize this symptom,"I have been having episodes of deppression ,  5 episodes now. Each lasting around 3-5 months , I have no reason to be depressed and they usually end on their own , but these are episodes of actual clinical depression,  not sadness.

779,Maybe the last time I hugged my son.,"My 29-year-old son just walked out my door, maybe for the last time. He came to see me for the last time until this is over. My kids have all seen me cry many many times, I have suffered major depression my whole life and crying is just part of it for me. But I don't know if I've ever let them see me quite the way I was today, it was like all the horror and dread I have felt in the last few years, the loss of my mother, and our current situation just exploded. He broke the social distance we are trying to observe to hug me because I couldn't stop sobbing. So he left to go home and I have no doubt that if he gets sick, and we many of us are going to get sick, he will die. My kind, smart, funny, loving, dependable, hardworking, handsome, disliked by no one, loved by all, talented son with 5 serious respiratory conditions. He has siblings and nieces and nephews and we cannot survive losing him. All of these people making light of this situation, saying it's just a cold, I hope they don't experience the fear and anxiety that is flooring me right now."
780,What are my options for dealing with debilitating exacerbation of symptoms due to pandemic?,"I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, CPTSD, and anorexia. I work in the ""call center"" part of a specialty pharmacy. There are hundreds of people in close quarters there every day, and I am the only person I've spoken to who is taking COVID-19 nearly as seriously as is needed at this point. They recently announced that they are slow rolling out a work from home trial- I am a part of the final ""stage"" of the roll out, meaning it will be a minimum of 3 weeks before I am given work from home privileges.
My mental health, my job performance, and my social standing with my coworkers has deteriorated rapidly. Where a week ago I was getting along quite well, this week I have had to go home midday due to extreme panic attacks, and I contemplate suicide all day at my desk. I am barely eating, not only due to fear of food shortages but because my eating disorder is my nearest and dearest unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel weak and dizzy, I can hardly go an hour without crying or hyperventilating, and I'm growing more and more obsessed with the idea of just ending it to escape this nightmare. My managers are sending out emails telling us that performance levels are unacceptable and commenting on whether or not I can handle my job. I need this job for healthcare and to pay bills, it pays very unusually well for my field and before this week I was perfectly content with it.
What can I do in this situation? Can I provide documentation of my diagnoses of some sort to attempt to leverage myself into earlier work from home privileges? Or at the very least is there some sort of leave I can take that won't risk my position? (I recently returned from an unofficial leave for acute treatment of my anorexia, I have only been at this company for 4 months and do not qualify for FMLA yet)"
781,Send me your poems! Spoken word artist willing to give Feedback on Poems during Quarantine for those who Write To Stay Healthy,"Who am I : A spoken word artist who has been performing for the last 3 years from Toronto to Washington DC. 

What is this: I am offering to provide line by line feedback on poems to people who use poetry to stay mentally healthy.  Just DM me the poem; and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Why: I struggle with depression and anxiety and I write poems to be ok.  I often go to bars and poetry clubs to share my poems, and the connection I get from others hearing them is really meaningful.  I know that others feel this way too, and with bars and local shops being closed for a while, I have been reaching out to friends to feel heard and understood through my poems.  It occurred to me today that others might not have the support network I do, and at poetry gigs I normally go up to people after their poems and share a few words. I figured with us all quarantined and social distanced, this would be the next best thing."
782,Obsessive thoughts following years of grief????,"I'm worried that the title sounds a LOT worse than it actually is, I just don't know what else to say.

My (18F) mom died 5 years ago due to cancer when I was in 7th grade. It was the first major death in my life and happened over winter break. I consider myself very lucky- the family, friends, and school faculty that I saw every day were very compassionate and understanding towards my situation. This includes my homeroom teacher, who must've felt very badly about what I was going through, so she tried to do things for me throughout the school year to care for and comfort me. The problem is, some of these things breached the line of an appropriate student-teacher relationship, like giving me a family heirloom as a birthday gift (she also told me ""not to tell anyone else"" about it), slightly excessive physical contact (hugs that lasted a little too long), etc. At the time, I didn't really recognize that these things were not completely appropriate, and even unknowingly perpetuated them at times (I would describe myself as a pretty naive kid going into middle school).

The problem now lies in the way my brain thinks following that school year- it feels like this teacher is ""stuck"" with me in some way and I can't let go. In 8th grade, I would get worried about randomly running into her in the hallway or seeing her at other school events.  I thought these little worries would dissipate once I got into high school and was away from my middle school, but it seems the opposite has happened. From freshman to senior year (now), these thoughts concerning my teacher have only seemed to grow. Sometimes it's coupled with anxiety, other times I just imagine hypothetical situations where she is near me in some way. In my junior year, I happened to notice that she was visiting my high school for some reason, and I had a physical reaction to it- my heart started racing and my hands started shaking. Following this event, my friends and I decided to visit her after school one day, to get some kind of closure. When we walked in to see her, I had physical reactions (heart rate up, shaking hands) but they went away after spending some time in the building and catching up in conversation. It was great, actually. But it didn't help.

I still have periods of thought where she's just kind of... there in the front of my mind. I've had a couple of dreams where I am back in my middle school interacting with her in some way. I've created playlists and written stories in my google docs to try and help me process how and what is going on with this situation. I've also done EMDR with a therapist (that I've been seeing for a few reasons) that helped eliminate a lot of the fear, but these thoughts still remain. I still have that family heirloom, which I actually plan on giving back to my teacher at the end of this school year (corona permitting). I'm hoping that that might give some greater closure, and maybe even maintaining contact on social media after I graduate will help equalize the situation in some way and also rid me of uncertainty in some way.

I have a pretty good idea as to *why* she treated me this way in the first place: something about my situation resonated so deeply with her that she was compelled to give me some kind of motherly attention because that's what I was missing in my life at the time. And I don't fear or dislike or blame her too harshly for what she did- sure, some of it she knew wasn't fully right, but she was trying to help and had no ulterior motive. But my brain likes to tell me that maybe she DID! Did she want me to be like her daughter? Her friend? Something else? Is she watching me right now????? It's gotten to a point where *I* feel like a creep because I get so caught up in this part of my life. Why do I do this to myself? Is it a symptom of grief? Is it trauma? Is my brain sabotaging itself, or enjoying itself with these ideas? And most importantly, *how do I stop thinking this way?* I really don't like being in this state of mind. It doesn't impact my ability to do other activities, but it does follow me around wherever I go. What the fuck is going on in my brain?????????"
783,Need help with personal mental health,"Hey people of reddit,i am currently facing a huge wall in my life,and no one(family&amp;friends) could help me.So i decided to ask fellow gamers and humans for a solution.
      For the past 10 years i have been gaming a lot 6-8 hours a day and well,now i realise how much it has affected me as a person.I am 18,with social skills comparable to a cucumber,which is quite sad and i do blame everything on my addiction.While everyone was out playing,being friends etc,I was locked in my room,alone with no one but my trusty computer.This was enjoyable just because i am a huge introvert with no motivation to go outside and do anything every teenager does.Now i look back at it and see,how much i have wasted..

It is the uni entrance exam year(if corona doesnt mess it up) and i realised how different and regressive i truly am.I am bad with interacting with other humans,which has led me to be always alone, burried in books while everyone is outside in cafes,restaurants, you name it.Hell i cant even walk into Mcdonalds without getting anxiety.

To fix this, i decided to slowly drop gaming and start socializing.But i have realised how boring it is without my games.I just do my homework,play guitar and thats it,just stare at walls and just sit.Homework is the only thing that has me occupied and interested in.I do have many ""friends"" but its so hard to interact with them while having totally different interests.I feel like an old person that is 18 really.Things normal teenagers like, i hate.
I really dont want to seem like a snowflake who is different then others.I want to understand the joy of interacting and doing dumb stuff which will fill me with life.This fact has bothered me for so long and is so painful when i realise how lonly and uninteresting i am.I do even have a huge crush on a girl but i know if we even get together i will be so uninteresting that break up will be iminent.So i ask you,what would you do in my position?"
784,Mindfulness app that is completely free,"A few years ago my therapist told me about “smiling mind” you can get it on the App Store.

788,I am Sick Of Covid-19,"Title says it all really.... 

(This is basically one huge rant &amp; I’m sorry)

I am sick to the fucking back teeth of corona virus this, corona virus that.... idiots on Facebook saying shit like “if you use the loo, drop the seat and lid, flush then covered your face... then wash your hands with bleach” 

Putting your hands over your face, before fucking washing them.... are you for fucking real? 

But also the fact of I’m myself at high risk of if I contract it, I could die easier than most (I have Cerebral Palsey. The source for this was on the NHS website if anyone asks) literally it’s damaging my mental health.... 

Today though, I really lost my fucking shit.... 

I went out on my motorcycle this morning just to get out because it’s my therapy &amp; makes me happy. I rode my motorcycle into my town (2 minute drive) and went into a store to purchase tobacco, I am well known where I live &amp; the people who work in the store know me, know I have a motorcycle etc. So I went in, leaving my lid on because of all this shit, I don’t need some idiot coughing at me etc. I walked up to the counter &amp; the old lady behind the counter had PVC gloves on, but NO face mask or anything else of the sort, just PVC gloves... I asked for tobacco &amp; she tells me to remove my motorcycle helmet. 

So I said back “why do you have gloves on?” She asked me to remove my helmet, so again I asked “why are you wearing gloves?” She said “because of the virus”. So I said “why do you think I’m wearing my helmet then?” 

She refused to serve me till I removed my lid, so I took it off, dropped my balaclava down to my bottom lip &amp; she got the Bakki, by the time she turned back round to face me, I had put my lid back on. She just stared at me....

I said “what’s wrong now?” She didn’t say anything, so again I said “what?” But rather sternly, she said “ I asked you to remove your helmet” I said “I did, now you have seen my face, I put it back on” I took the Tobacco from her &amp; paid, upon leaving I said to her “what you’re doing is fucking pointless, you don’t even have face protection, what you’re doing is pointless, I’m glad you didn’t cough all over me” yeah maybe I shouldn’t have said it, but I was annoyed. 

Like just everything is fucking annoying me.... due to my health conditions, I was supposed to have a muscular skeletal appointment on the 17th of March, but was cancelled because it wasn’t essential.... well it fucking was I’m in constant pain due to my heath conditions....

Being completely honest here, I actually hope I catch the COVID-19 virus &amp; die soon or hopefully I have like undiagnosed cancer or something seriously wrong with me. I actually want to die, but I won’t commit suicide.....

The cancer thing, for the past 4 years I’ve had testicular lumps, I’ve kept being told they are just epididymal cysts, yet not once have I been offered an ultra sound test which will confirm what these testicular lumps are.....

Alongside that I get groin pain, lower back pain etc.... you can work out what dr.google suggests.... (Cancer)

I keep getting chest pains &amp; my left arm goes numb occasionally.... you can work out what dr.google suggests there too (Heart attack) 

I’m having constant headaches, my depression is at an all time high, so Is my anxiety.... even my miso phobia is going crazy at the moment....

I literally fucking hope I die soon, I have fucking had enough... I won’t commit suicide as that’s cowardly.... but if I caught the CoronaVirus, I’d more than happily let it kill me, no questions asked.... 

Sorry for this rant, this hasn’t accomplished anything obviously, but these past few weeks I’m having an absolute fuck full....

Anyone else feel like this????"
789,I sneezed and my brother berated me.,"Paranoid. Because I happen to interact with the public I’m an a probable coroavirus candidate.

And because I sneezed that means everyone in the house will drop and die and it will be my fault."
790,Is this a problem or am I normal???,"First off, I want to start this post by saying that I am an 18 year old girl, who has struggled with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, all of which were diagnosed but never really treated. On all those issues I am doing better, but recently I have been struck with a new possible problem... 

Well, actually it has been an ongoing problem that has been brought to my attention. I do not think that I feel most emotions. I have always had the inkling that my experience was not normal, but figured that I was being dramatic, however i cannot get it out of my head due to a conversation I had with my brother a few days ago(God I hope he does not find this) where he made a comment about how he thought it was funny that I just did not care. I asked him what he meant and he just explains that I just do not care: happy occasions, sad occasions, receiving gifts no matter how amazing, our grand parents death, etc. He commented how I was a good actor, but he could tell since there was no emotion in my eyes... 

That has always been how I felt. For as long as I can remember I have never felt excited, happy, sad, etc. It's always been this sort of numb feeling I guess, but I know I can feel anxiety and anger. Anger does not happen too often, but I know it can be explosive when it does, and anxiety comes and goes often with certain triggers. I know I feel them because I feel it in my chest, I guess and honestly I cannot control them. I control my laughter and my tears but like my brother said there is nothing behind my eyes... 

It does not really bother me honestly. I mean some times it does. I would like to feel happy, excited, sad... I am not trying to be some emo r/iamverybadass type person. This is honestly a cry for help, and maybe some insights on what is going on in other's hearts and minds, as I do not have someone in person to confine in."
791,HOCD making me think I turned myself gay once again,"So I was roleplaying with a girl sexually online... probably not the best idea... I did know her irl though and yeah... I don’t do that with people I don’t know in real life. So this all happened yesterday too

I do have a history of HOCD and shit so yeah.

Anyway, I suddenly started imaging myself as her character and I feel like I slowly started being attracted to mine. It took time but I feel like it was happening. It felt super weird. I didn’t know what was going on and it was the worst. I thought it would just pass so I kept roleplaying because I didn’t wanna stop it for her.

But afterwards I started really panicking about it and I felt like I was holding the being attracted to guys mindset there. It really sucks and I just hate this shit so much... I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m just scared so bad that I’ve turned myself gay and that it’s too late."
792,I need to be calmer,"I’m becoming extremely irratable and I don’t know what to do.  I get mad or annoyed so easily to the point where, when my parents yell at me, I start feeling extremely unstable.

I would find help but I don’t even know where to start."
793,My coworkers think I'm annoying.,"Today I was given a ""talking to"" by one of my supervisors. Apparently she has been getting complaints that I insert myself in what other people are doing and am trying to act like a more senior member of the team than I am. She said that ""they dont find it helpful, they find it annoying"". I've always had problems with social anxiety and one of my greatest insecurities is thinking people act like friends to my face but actually find me annoying. She literally just confirmed that. I know I can get a little over-enthusiastic at times, but I am honestly just trying to be helpful. She says I need to ""stay in my lane"". I understand where shes coming from, and clearly this is a problem for me...but it just really hurt to hear. I teared up because I was so angry at myself and embarrassed. Thankfully I'm on anxiety meds now so I didn't have a complete panic meltdown. But it just really sucked. I'm going to try to improve, but right now all the negative thoughts are just piling together and I just feel like curling into a ball and staying there forever. I guess there isn't really a point to this post, I just wanted to get it out I guess. Thanks for listening."
794,Drop me a line if the social distancing struggle is getting you down....,"Hi All--

So I've been practicing social distancing for almost three weeks now, with full isolation just kicking in this week. I have ADHD and anxiety/OCD, and it has been *rough*: remembering to take meds, keeping to any sort of schedule, dealing with the massive amount of negativity on the Internet. Every ""morning"" (which is now b/t 3 and 5 pm), I spend about an hour curled up, undergoing a wracking, overwhelming Panic Cry.

All this is to say: I don't want anyone else to feel this way. And I believe I don't have to get lost in these feelings either. We are stronger together. So I'm offering myself and my time to anyone who needs it. Hmu via reddit chat if you need to talk, if you need to feel a little bit less alone. I don't promise to have answers, but I promise to respond. To listen. To be there. Please, *please* don't hesitate to reach out.

I really hope all of you are doing what you can to take care of yourselves. And, if you aren't struggling, do what you can to take care of others.

795,I don't think i'm mentally stable,"I haven't told a doctor this, but sometimes I feel like two different people in one body. sometimes (rarely) the 'two people' will fight and the mental pane is insanely agonizing. when this happens, all I want is to stop it; slam my head against something, anything. just stop the pain at all costs, even if it means brain damage or suicide (luckily I haven't yet failed to hold myself back). usually though, the 'two people' are separate; one being the part of me that wants to commit suicide and self harm and hates life, the other being the part of me that loves live and wants to live and live a great life.

also, this only happens when I can't cope in some way, it never happens when I can cope using electronics because they're the only thing i'm good at using, but ever since my mom died, I my legal guardian limits my electronic usage way too much(1-2 hours a day). now the only way I can cope is self harm, and that doesn't usually last that long. I didn't self harm nearly as often as I do now when I could use electronics freely.

797,Has anyone ever stayed in an NHS inpatient facility for mental health?,"Hi, I live in England (North East) and i'm 22 years old. I've struggled with my mental health my whole life and i hit a crisis point a few days ago after something traumatic happened. Where I live, there is an NHS mental health facility which accepts self referrals for people who have hit a crisis point, and i'm going to go voluntarily tomorrow to as for help. They have an inpatient facility which i may end up having to stay in.

I'm wondering if anyone on here has stayed in an NHS inpatient facility? How was your experience? Would you recommend it? Which area was it in? Which NHS trust is the best? What sort of things would i need to take with me?

 I hate hospitals, so i feel very scared about going, but i think it would be for the best and it would one million percent be worth it if it works and i get some kind of help, whether it be medication, a diagnosis, therapy or a CMHT.

Or would it be better to go to a private healthcare provider? What would be the difference? My Dad has said he's willing to sell his car if it means that I get the best treatment for myself. (He can no longer drive due to disability, however, he kept his car because it is now considered a classic car and it is in very good condition. He's had it since he was 16 and he loves it a lot.) Therefore, if there is little to no difference, i'd rather go with the NHS so he doesn't have to sell his car. If anyone has any stories or advice i'd be very grateful :)"
798,Law of Attraction or just positive thinking?,"I remember 2020 coming around the corner and feeling energized/hopeful about a lot of things. I made a list of lessons I vowed to keep. I closed two deals in January and was leading my team in sales. I met a girl at a bar and we still talk to this day. I can remember smiling randomly on my walk to work and overall, feeling **great**.

I remember calling my dad and just being like ""dude, this is crazy. Every girl looks at me when I walk by. **Every one**. My friends make me feel like I'm the life of the party. I just feel really good right now and I'm trying to figure out why."" He offered no real helpful/valuable input but it was worth a shot.

It was nuts man. Literally every girl I'd walk past, I'd get a look. I can remember really hot girls just being around in me in public noticing me. And on top of that, I just felt fucking great in general.

I think a lot of this had to do with being excited about meeting a new girl, closing two good deals, and getting back in the gym. I think overall, these things compounded each other.

Until one day, I went on Reddit, and I posted a message very similar to this one, only my goal was to get feedback on ""why are all these good things happening to me"". I deleted that post 5 minutes later because I was scared that I jinxed the entire thing.

Well, the next morning, on my walk to work I just felt like no one noticed me anymore, and I saw maybe one decently attractive girl but she didn't even notice me.

I felt all around anxious again. My resting facial expression changed into something of confusion while walking/listening to music.

My posture got weaker, and I got weaker because I felt like whatever was going on, was out of my control.  


What was going on and what can I do to get back to that?

**TL:DR** \- with turn of 2020 was just feeling very positive. Girls were coming out of the woodwork in public all around me/noticing me, I met a new girl that I was crazy about, I got back in the gym, I had a good month in business, my friends made me feel like the life of the party. In general I just remember feeling fucking awesome. All of this was going great until one day I made a post on reddit saying all of the above only to ask what redditors thought was going on (in the universe, with my thoughts, how people perceived me, etc.) - basically any input on what I can do to keep the positive juices flowing. After that post, everything has gone back to ""normal""."
799,Do you think reddit is the best social media for mental health ? Ie the least depressing,
800,Feeling really stupid (literally),"I posted this in r/BPD already but I’m looking for inputs as to why I may feel this way. 

Feeling like you are just flat out stupid?

All my life I have felt like I’m just completely stupid. I’m a little air headed naturally, things go over my head and I miss the point of most conversations that go beyond what I know. I’ve always been horrible with numbers. Simple math stuff like that. I basically didn’t absorb anything after 4th grade as far as math classes go. I failed all my math classes every single semester, managed to become president of the engineering club ONLY because the club sponsor was attracted to me. I didn’t know what I was doing at all. I suck at almost every job I get. I don’t mean to do anything half-assed, but when I work on a task at work I almost always am made to redo it because I didn’t do it well enough. Once I was made to re-vacuum a hallway three times. It’s not that I’m lazy, I try my best, I just really can’t do simple tasks the way I’m expected to. I can’t do any kind of sports, I was laughed at in 7th grade during field day because I couldn’t throw a softball farther than 5feet in front of me. I’m not overweight or unhealthy, I just literally suck. I faked a migraine that day so I could go home. The bullying was so bad. My brain shuts off when someone is trying to explain something to me and I start to realize I don’t understand it. It makes it hard for me to learn anything. It took me forever to learn how to drive and I still am horrible at it. Every car I buy ends up with bumps and scrapes and dents all over it by the time I’m done with it. I don’t talk about it, but it hurts me a lot. It’s come to a point where I just know I can’t do certain things. I don’t even try anymore. I know I’ll be bad at it. I don’t know for sure if it’s all in my head but ive felt this way forever. I don’t know if it’s BPD related or just me, but it’s been this way my whole life ):"
801,How do I tell someone I can not handle them anymore,"I have a friend who never got over his high school girlfriend. She dumped him during college. He is one of my best friends but I can no longer support his bouts of depression. We are almost 30. Since then, he has been severely unstable and has literally been through every shrink and every drug the world could throw at him. I have been supportive of him this entire time. But I can no longer do it. How do I pull away."
802,Feeling depressed,"I sit at home all day laying around and I literally don’t do anything. I sometimes get such horrid brain fog that I stop for a second and I’m like “wait this is me this is actually happening” it’s like I’m half asleep. My anxiety is always present. I can’t relax and I always feel tense.always. I have no friends and I’m not really good at much. Please tell me if your experiencing my same feelings. The one friend I do have is mean to me a lot and snaps at me. I just am not in a very good state of mind right now. Again, if you are feeling the same way as I am I would like to know if not alone."
803,Crippled with fear by the coronavirus situation.,"I'm a 30-something professional in the USA (midwest). 

Once the first cases were confirmed in my state my motivation to come into work on time or get anything done once there was shot.

All I could do at the office was read every article, every FB post, all the comments, all the news briefings, memes, etc. about the outbreak locally and globally.

I now live isolated in my apartment (working remotely) in a state of fear with the same questions playing over and over in my mind:

I cough every now and again.  Do I have the virus?

I sneeze: Do I have the virus?

Did I give it to my parents unknowingly? 

Could I live with myself if I did and the unthinkable happened?

If I leave my apartment to walk down the halfway to get my mail, and I breathe, and then someone else comes in that hallway shortly afterward, could I have given them the virus?

And so on.

I ordered some food from a local restaurant (really want to support them) with no-contact delivery service. Not for me, but for the delivery person. I felt so strange as I watched the delivery person through my peephole checking my delivery instructions on his phone, feeling like opening the door to greet him and extend my hand to take the food was forbidden.  Because what I give him the virus?"
804,Please Help,"I'm hella suicidal. All my purpose and joy comes from teaching and quarantine is literally killing me. Yes, I'm on meds, the right ones, a therapist, and decent family. I've been suicidal my whole life, but working with kids and bringing a semblance of happiness to their lives is the reason I don't hurt myself or attempt again. What are you all doing to stay sane? Is there anyone else this fucked up?"
805,Something That Happened When I Was Young,"Hello everyone! I have a question. I had something happen when I was younger; can anyone help me figure out what happened? I'm sorry ahead of time; I'm bad at explaining.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was maybe eight or so I used to play Plants vs Zombies. A lot. I wasn't playing it 24/7 or anything, but I spent a good bit of time on it. One day as I was going to bed, I thought I saw something in the corner of my room. I focused on it a little and it looked like one of the zombies from the game. I would see it as if it was in a slow-motion walk towards me, but it would actually get smaller until it disappeared less than a meter from where it started. This would loop for me until I fell asleep. I told my dad and Grandmother, but they shrugged it off. This lasted for a few months until it stopped one day. I've never had anything similar happen since. 

I know I explained it poorly, but can anyone help me understand or explain to me what happened? Thanks!"
806,Losing touch with reality,"I'm a 21 yo female and I suffer from PTSD, depression and panic disorder. I feel absolutely crippled by mental illnesses and have since I was about 16 but even before that dealt with depression just not to the point of completely giving up on life. I had a traumatic event happen when I was 16 and feel like my mental health has only declined since. I use to at least have hope for my future but now I feel completely stuck and trapped. I live with my bf in my parents house and my parents are both very toxic people. We can't afford to move out though and my bf supports me financially in most areas and is a great partner but I've been dealing with extreme guilt for the fact I don't contribute to anything. I've only had 1 job and it was before the trauma and haven't been able to motivate myself to work again since. I am on antidepressants (Wellbutrin and Lexapro) and also use medical marijuana daily. I've applied for disability before because I also have physical issues but my mental health is the main reason I don't work. My application was denied bc I guess some of the info was incorrect and my anxiety was so extreme that I never called back to fix anything. I have really severe anxiety about phone calls for some reason and have probably lost some opportunities just because of refusing to answer the phone. I feel like I'm being so childish and pathetic and can't even make appointments for myself. My bf reassures me that he understands and it's okay that I'm unable to make money right now but I feel like a spoiled brat. Since I started dating him I've completely isolated myself from everyone else bc he makes me feel safe and comfortable and now all I want to do is stay home and be with him and even when he's not here I still have no motivation to keep up with friendships and talk to people. I don't even have my licence because of this crippling anxiety. I feel like a complete failure in every aspect of life. I have tried many different medications and unfortunately haven't been able to maintain therapist appointments (once again cuz of anxiety) and also can't afford the ones that you can just text and stuff. I do have coping outlets like art and writing etc but at the end of the day I still feel empty and lost and trapped. I've tried selling my art before without much luck, I've also tried making and selling my own eyeshadows on Etsy but didn't get much profit at all, I've done people's makeup and nails for money but honestly don't know enough people or have enough supplies to keep up with that and also my anxiety has caused me to say no to quite a few opportunuties. I feel like I'm very not normal and just can't understand why I don't seem to have the same motivation that everyone else does. I know all of this is my fault and people think I'm just being lazy but I'm just terrified and so sick of myself. I use to self harm and was hospitalized 3 times but haven't done that in 2 and a half years now and still don't intend to do it because I know it hurts people who care about me. I just feel pathetic. Because of me staying home and literally just sitting around all the time I've developed back issues and gained a lot of weight which in return causes even more self esteem issues and less motivation to do anything not only because I hate how I look but because of the pain it causes my back now. I want this to end and I really would love creative ideas on how I can maybe take some baby steps to living a more normal life. I appreciate any advice you're willing to give"
807,Starting therapy on friday after putting it off for years,[deleted]
808,Perfection and anxiety,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this because I've only read a few posts. I don't know how to correctly express what I've struggled with for essentially my whole life, but I'll do my best. For a long time I've been a self-dkagnosed perfectionist, and it started as somewhat of a prideful thing, where I would always have better work than everybody else because ""oh, I'm such a perfectionist, ooh look at me, I'm so great."" But lately it's turned into a roadblock. I'm only half-assing my work, and it's purely because of the fact that if I don't try, I dont have to be ashamed of bad work. All of this (which has been going on for almost 5 years now) has been giving me some serious problems with my anxiety. Somewhat recently I had a severe anxiety attack where I was sitting on the floor, shaking, and bawling. This isn't really a post asking for help, I guess I'm more just looking for confirmation and recognition. Should I just try to ""get my shit together"" as I've been told so many times? Or is this actually something that needs to be addressed?"
809,To drink or not ..?,How much more can you accomplish is alcohol was not a part of your life? Do you drink alcohol?
810,Is it possible to hallucinate muscle tension?,"I had a rough night last night. I was panicking and my legs felt like they were cramping up really really badly. I felt like my muscles were seizing and like my tendons were so tight that I couldn't even fully straighten my legs.
Well I turned a light on and checked and my legs were actually straight. I clenched my muscles as hard as I could and let them go and it was obvious that I could clench them tighter than they were, so they couldn't actually have been painfully clenched, right?? I thought my calf muscles were rock hard but they weren't actually much firmer than they usually are.
I'm really confused if this counts as a hallucination or a delusion or what! I can't tell if I'm being irrational by assuming it wasn't real and there's flaws in my tests... sorry I know this is weird.
Thanks!!"
811,Is it bad that I’m not emotionally effected by major tragedies?,"I feel like there must be something wrong with me or something because whenever a big tragedy happens it doesn’t bother me unless someone I know was involved or effected I just feel indifferent the rest of the time. 

Is this bad?"
812,I hate that cutting is not okay,I'm in so much fucking pain
813,Do you think my roommate is doing ok?,"So my roommate has cleaned the whole house everyday this week while I’ve been gone and it’s starting to worry me some. I come home to it spotless and seeing him clean the same areas for the past 3 days. I feel like he is losing his mind and cleaning cause he’s anxious, stressed and maybe depressed cause he is out of work due to covid19. Am I crazy or should I talk to him? Thoughts on what I should say to check on him?"
814,Do I have bdd (body dysmorphic disorder),"When I was 13-16 I had trouble even seeing myself in the mirror especially if I wasn’t at home I would go into like a panic mode worrying that I didn’t look normal because that was the way I saw myself. I’m 17 now and I’m a lot better at accepting it for what it is but it still affects me a lot I have trouble seeing my friends because I feel like the ugly one in the group I guess.
I don’t think they’d judge me for who I am but I can’t stop obsessing over the way I look. 

I look almost anorexic but I eat fine it’s just genetics, I have a small head and it makes it really difficult to pick a hairstyle especially because my hair cowlicks all over the place so I almost wanna go bald but what stops me is the fact that when I picture myself bald I’d look really weird. If I did I’d probably wear a beanie and it’s really hot at the moment so it’s kinda difficult. 

I’ve had supportive people give me the love yourself for who you are type speeches and stuff but I don’t think I could even if I tried. I don’t want to go on antidepressants because they fuck with me and there just yuck but if anyone has any advice I’d like to hear it"
815,How to protect your mental health in a public health emergency?,"I want to start one if one hasn't started yet.  I thought I'd share some resources. In hope others will share more resources to help those who need help.

I saw this article: [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51873799?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51873799?utm_source=pocket-newtab)"
816,Why do I feel different?,"My whole life I have felt very different. It’s caused a lot of trouble for me in dealing with situations and social interactions. I’m hoping if I can pinpoint what’s going on I can find a way to navigate life a little better. Please be kind because I have never told anyone all of this and it took a lot of courage to be open and honest about it. 

1) a lot of times I can’t put into words what I’m thinking even if it’s something really simple. I am actually pretty intelligent but come off unintelligent sometimes because I can’t get my words out. 

2) sometimes, because of this, I end up saying a more simple version of what I’m thinking and many times I end up not making sense or offending other people.

3) Sometimes, when I do say things that are well thought out, people don’t understand what I’m saying, even though it makes perfect sense. 

4) Sometimes I feel like I’m simulating a personality. I don’t know how to think or act a lot of the time. I’ve watched other people’s behaviors and picked up things that I find pleasant in other people. I change my laugh every few years when I found one that sounds more appropriate. 

5) I believe I have imposter syndrome 

6) I can’t tell when people don’t like me, unless they’re super vocal about it. I don’t know if it’s because people are being fake and simulating niceness or if I’m just not picking it up. 

7) it doesn’t seem like anyone understands my intentions. Sometimes when I try to connect with people I don’t know well, I feel that the conversation offends them. I feel like when I talk about things that I believe may help them feel similar or connected to me, I appear as though I am bragging, even if I am not.  

8) I have impulsive thoughts, like saying or doing something that might catch someone off guard. For example, there was an older bald guy speaking to me one day, and the thought of giving him a huge smooch on the lips popped in  my head. It was gross and really embarrassing and it was nothing from attraction at all whatsoever just a very impulsive thought. Other impulsive thoughts would be like telling someone they’re ugly or something terrible like that. I feel so bad because I’m a nice person and I literally would never ever say something to hurt someone like that. 

9) when people I don’t know well talk to me, I have to try really hard to figure out where to look while they’re talking. A lot of times I’ll just look away to think while they are speaking so I don’t focus on the movement of their mouth and can actually listen. 

10) I am diagnosed with ADD and anxiety

11) I learn that a behavior is inappropriate or annoying only when someone does it to me and I don’t like it. There have been a few times where my husband has had to kindly tell me in social situations that certain things Im saying or talking about are inappropriate. 

12) When I’m alone and thinking, I catch myself making faces that go alone with the conversation I’m thinking about. I remember getting made fun of for this when I was in middle school. As an adult, I’ve been able to catch when I do this and control it. 


Despite all of this, the older I get, the better I am able to blend in. I don’t think people have any idea that all of this goes on in my head. I am seemly normal, married, and I have friends. I’ve been afraid of coming out about this because I don’t want to be brushed off and give people the impression that I am overemotional, crazy, or just overthinking. I’ve tried to open up about my ADD symptoms before and of course it was shrugged off. So I felt like if I opened up about all of this other stuff, somehow people would invalidate my feelings and tell me they’re not real. 

If you got through all of this, thank you so much for reading and for any thoughts you share with me."
817,Shelter in Place,My county is I believe the most infected in CA. This is already worrisome. Then my doctor flat out told me to not leave my house until further notice because if I get infected I will die. I'm on the waiting list (1-2 months) for an eating disorders IOP and hope things are better by then. With my ED sometimes I hope I'll die. But with this virus I just want to live through it. Its overwhelming. The anxiety never ends. I feel like either way I have no future. The only positive thing in my life right now is that the cocktail of meds I'm on make me sleep without nightmares for 12hrs a night. Depakote geodon lunesta zyprexa gabapentin lamictal does it for me.
818,I don't know what in the fuck to do...,"Okay, so, it's been a while (it really hasn't.) I'm alive, and, not too well, unfortunately. 

I'm still stuck in this box that's slowly closing in around me, and I believe will one day crush my bones into dust and leave me unrecognizable. This guilt I feel, it doesn't seem to have a trigger, a time of day/month/year/etc., it just comes around whenever the hell it wants, and it's driving me crazy. I know I'll be able to go into therapy soon, (well, not as soon as it used to be because of Corona,) but I really can't take this. It feels like my bones are going to rip open my skin and flee. The goosebumps on my arms leave me with hairs that stick up like pins. I can't sleep it off, I can't eat it off, I can't think it off, I can't get rid of it. It's no use.

I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been, and I don't want to die. I actually have a rather irrational fear of death, but sometimes I just wish I could fall into a pit with no bottom, where my thoughts would just be quiet. But no matter how silent it is around me, my conscience is deafening. 

I feel like if I don't find help-- Therapy, meds, whatever that may be, (as much as I hate both of those things)-- then I'll lose my shit. And I very well could. At any moment, I feel like I could just say ""fuck it,"" and literally start wailing at the top of my lungs and ripping out my hair in clumps. I've never self-harmed, but this body doesn't belong to me, and I find myself wanting to cut it down the middle with a chainsaw. 

I don't talk to my mom or most friends about this, because I don't want to worry them or make them think I wanna hurt myself (because I don't,) or make them feel the way I'm feeling. 

The reason I'm feeling this guilt is because of things... said and done... by family members. One of these family members-- I know with 100% certainty-- would never mean to hurt me or put all this shit onto my shoulders, and so I don't want to tell them, because I'm afraid that I'll make them feel guilty for making me feel guilty.

It'd be a neverending shit cycle...!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm literally out of options, and  I'm ready to take advantage of this quarantine and curl up in my bedsheets and sob myself to sleep, where I'll inevitably wake up and have to deal with this shit all over again.

819,How does “manic anxiety” differ from other types of anxiety?,"A friend of mine just recently told me that they have manic anxiety. I’m trying to understand it cause it’s not something I’ve ever heard of. I suffer from anxiety disorder myself, so I kind of understand what they’re facing? (Even though anxiety isn’t the same for everyone). All I can find on google is about bipolar disorder. Is this what they mean? Or is it something else?"

822,COVID-19 + anxiety + quarantine in a virus hotspot....,"I am living in New York City, and have been struggling deeply with the circumstances surrounding this pandemic. Our city has not reacted quickly enough, we are all unprepared and many of us not practicing social distancing. 
I am only 21 years old and as of Saturday was smart enough to truly realize the weight of the situation and have not socialized since. Due to the virus’s insane incubation period(s) it is safe to say, that many of us, including myself may already be infected. 
Though the last couple weeks before schools closed here,  I practiced conscious hygiene, I wore surgical gloves on the subway and washed my hands and sanitized my phone, the virus had made its way to the city long before we caught on to its airborne-like nature. 
I am worried for my grandmother who is a life long smoker, and my mother who is very overweight, and my sister who is also very overweight and has a history of pneumonia and has asthma. I myself have asthma. I am fearful that if I am, or my family, are to fall ill our hospitals will have reached overcapacity and our situation would be severely compromised.  
I am suffering extreme anxiety attacks as I sit in our tiny apartment watching our doomsday situation unfold. How slow we are reacting, and how this virus acts as a slow burning, torturous, and sneaky little assassin. The number predictions for mortality rates continue to excel and we are seeing more and more healthy younger people become infected and becoming extremely ill. 
We have no means to run, flee, relocate. We are stuck in a hot spot as our government does nothing to contain this issue, people are forced to continuing working, and people are still socializing. I am terrified for my family’s life and mine. 
I have been experiencing a sore throat, light and dry cough, and occasional phlegm which does not help my anxiety. For all I know, my symptoms can become worse at any moment."

It was a rough one sided relationship and the break up was godawful because I had to be near him a lot due to school and certain school trips. I loved him and it was the relationship itself that hurt more than the break up. Feeling rejected and unloved and like you weren't doing enough and being told certain things were your fault when they weren't and anytime I brought up the issues, it was me asking too much, Etc etc. My point is, ever since then I cannot listen to the office theme song without starting to panic. It was my exs favorite show and he made a parody of it for the school band trip and I remember the uncontrollable feeling of doom I got that night. It's strange, I cannot listen to the theme song. I've been able to get through it because I wanna watch the show but it always sends me into a pre panic and I'm not sure why.

I live with a religious family,you probably know where this is going.So one day I was at my best friend’s house and then I saw her big sister walked in and at that moment I thought she was hot!and so I told her and we got into a secret relationship without my best friend knowing.I would sneak out to meet her and we’ll have fun till morning.But they all say “all good things must come to an end”we were cuddling and then her sister walked in on us and then she said in this cold blooded voice”I knew u guys had a thing”and she left.But this good thing is she didn’t tell my family but the bad thing is that I lost my girlfriend and my only best friend:(so I convinced my mom to move to the USA and she listened and she did.After a couple of months living in the us,I was telling my mom about this lesbian couple at school and she turned to me and said”listen,those little things are nasty!i don’t want you hanging around them!they are a disgusting!”After I heard that I just laughed it off and agreed with her:(after we got home I told my dad and he said “ew,I hate those little things!why are they even alive?”and the fact that he says that too crushed my heart.So I told my sister the Same thing and she was disgusted,I didn’t know what to do.I then realize if I tell my family then they wouldn’t talk to me anymore and disowned me...so I kept quiet for a long time until I got a boyfriend and I told him I like girls too and he said “that’s fine,I will always love you “two days after saying that he broke up with me.At this point I feel like no one loves me or cares about me so i started self harming..not a sense of cutting but starving myself that was my way out!i kept doing it every day and you know no one noticed for 2 years!so I decided to kill myself I wrote my suicidal note and left it on my bed and then I just got the bottle of pills and took all of them and sat there waiting for something to happen..then I felt the pain in my head,it felt like someone just hit me with a pan and then I felt sleepy,my belly hurts and I started vomiting!my sister heard me and drove me to the hospital and they stopped the pain:(they asked what happen?and I replied saying”I ate something while I was out with my friends “and they believed me.After two hours in the hospital I realize the suicidal is on my bed so I told my dad I was ready to leave and they brought me home and I ripped the paper in 24 pieces (I remember the pieces because that day I tried killing my self)and I have them in a box which is under my bed right now.After two months,I started to feel no emotions to nothing!I was numb and I don’t care...so kept being that way till today.Sadly there is no happy ending to my story and I am still depressed till this day and no one notices:("
827,Really been thinking about kms with this whole pandemic thing. Can I have some advice?,I really don’t want to live through seeing loved ones die and being on a virtually lockdown from life the next 1.5 years. I would rather just die knowing that is going to happen in the next few months to year and a half. I’m obsessively checking the news and updates. I have only left the house once in the past week. I am going insane inside. I spent most of my college years battling severe depression and struggling with financial issues and a broken family. I am almost debt free and ready to move out. Now that I have been finally getting back on my feet. I really don’t think I have it in me to live every day on edge for the next year worrying about my family and friends. I am thinking about selling my stuff and giving it my family. Am I being unreasonable?
828,How do I stop living in my head?,"I(20f) daydream constantly. Before classes were cancelled, id often miss what the professors said because I was fantasizing. Now, being stuck inside all day, its gotten quite bad. Its constant and I know I probably do it because Im unhappy with my life and current situation. It seems to be the only thing to help me from crying over my current life. I even look forward to it when i listen to music late at night when my boyfriend is asleep and im up by myself. I wake up only to wish i was back asleep with my dreams. I just want to be happy and have good friends and family, but I know overfantasizing about situations thatll never happen is onlu going to cause problems. How do I stop myself from daydreaming so much?  Ive been like this since I was a kid."
829,I don't really know.,"Hey reddit, I dont really know where to start this since I dont usually talk about my feelings to anyone because I feel like if I tell people how I really feel nobody will want to be around me. I feel like I dont have any friends anymore and I feel like nothing matters. I have a physical feeling in my chest most of the time that I can't describe, it just feels extremely empty. Like there's a void and nothing will ever fill it. I've never really had much of anything and lately it seems like everything I do have still is slowly being lost or destroyed or ruined or stolen. I honestly have a hard time looking myself in the mirror anymore. I havent felt this empty in a long time and this time I dont think I'm strong enough to pull myself out of this hole. I dont want to struggle anymore. I dont want to keep living just to keep losing or ruining everything I touch. I hate myself and I'm so fucking tired and I don't know what to do. I dont know if this is to vent or because I want help. I just want this pain and exhaustion to stop.."
830,"Everything feels dull, I don’t feel the need to do anything","I think this is a symptom of depression, but it doesn’t feel like depression. I’m not sad, I don’t want to die, I have aspirations and goals and such, it’s just that I don’t ever want to do anything. I’m going to try and describe it in a way that doesn’t make it sound like I’m just lazy: 

I literally have no motivation for anything. I know I have to do things, yet I don’t do them. I have to set alarms to eat meals or I forget, same with drinking water. I used to live reading and now it’s just something to do so I don’t feel like I’ve fully wasted my day, I don’t even really enjoy it anymore. Being on my phone bores me, watching TV bores me, working out bores me, it’s like I have no opinions on anything. I don’t feel like I hate anything, but I don’t feel like I like anything. Everything’s the same for me. The things I do, I do because someone tells me to. I painted the basement because my mom asked me. I walked the dog because my mom asked me. I feel like I’m not feeling any emotions. Even little things I used to enjoy, like crappy reality Tv shows, don’t interest me, I just zone out or sleep. Things I used to hate don’t make me mad anymore. 

Some past history: I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and anxiety-induced depression, which I haven’t felt for over 2 years. I think I might be bipolar (runs in the family), because I sometimes swing between these types of emotion where I feel like I’m the worlds most boring character in the worlds most boring book, and then doing a million things at once, adopting a million passions, waking up at 2am to workout or to clean my room. Sometimes I get super super angry at very small things (although I think this is more environmental than chemical since my mother has some anger issues due to a diagnosed bipolar disorder). 

I can’t really go to therapy right now. My mom (the parent I live with), works for the government and is super scared the gov is going to shut down and she won’t get paid, so she doesn’t want to waste money on unnecessary things. I went to therapy for a while for anxiety/family issues. 

So that’s my little rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I don’t really like feeling like this, I’d actually prefer to be super anxious than to not feel anything. I’ve tried meditation, working out, faking happiness/emotions until it actually happens, most of that type of thing, without success. But if you think maybe I’m just being lazy, please tell me, maybe that will snap me out of it more if I can see myself from another perspective."
831,I'm being pulled in two different ways.,"I (13f) am so stuck. I get pulled in so many ways, people in related to and close to tell me I'm pretty and beautiful while peope I don't know call me ugly. Everyone I know thinks I'm annoying. I grow unstable and ask for help so my friend tell me I'm crazy and my family and other people that don't know me tells me I'm fine. I've gotten so many mixed signals from people that I'm scared to do anything that involves what I think is ok. I feel like I'll be abandoned and hated if I make someone mad or upset.

I have gotten used to wearing a mask and only taking it off when I'm alone. But I used to cry a lot at night, I would go into hyperventilation and what i think is a depressive episode. But now I don't feel saddness. I don't get angry unless something really bad happens. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.  I just feel numb or happy. 

I smile at things people cry at, like the main character in the video committing suicide because the people that made them feel they had to felt sad and guilty. I smile at the thought of killing people I hate. I've lost my ability to recognise when I'm crossing a line. My friend was cyber bullied a while ago so I found the guys Instagram, which lead to his YouTube, tik tok, and phone number. I then tried tracking his address, name, ect. I didn't see it as wrong. I still don't but ive left it alone.

Things that used to make me break down and cry now make me smile. Heck normally I'd cry while typing this but I'm smiling. I've learned to put others before myself because I'm not as important as other people. No matter what it is its always ""be quiet this person's talking"" or no matter what I needed ""it'll have to wait a minute"". I feel like I'm being pushed away from my friend group because they all act as if I matter less and less. They do things to me that I would get yelled at for if I did to them.

I ask for counceling and I got it! But the school closed so no more counceling unless it's necessary. Anytime I talk people listen for a few seconds before ignoring me again then they yell at me for interupting them. Just today I tried helping someone who i think was suicidal and they just got mad at me, degraded me for not knowing what its like to have their problems, and overall said I couldn't help because of my age. They deleted their account though and for some reason I don't care.

No one will take me to a doctor to get diagnosed or see if its just depression. It's like they say they care but they refuse to show it. I'd probably be given medication and possibly therapy.. My mom can't afford therapy and she says that insurance would only cover it if a doctor said I needed it. She hasn't taken me to the doctor.

I wanted to develop a tulpa and I told my friend my choice. She basically said that i was making myself scitzophrenic to deal with loneliness. My mom and step dad both prioritize video games over me but not my sister. However I'm suppose to watch her 24/7. They get mad at me because i can't handle her and its my fault no one has told me how. It's always ""come get us"". I get yelled at almost every day because she wants to play and o can't play with her without her getting to excited which gets me yelled at. Then I get yelled at if I don't play with her cause she gets upset and I get angry. 

I just realized that without school I can hide things like cuts better. And that if my sister ever stops loving me I'll have nothing to live for. And to anyone still reading it probably sounds like I'm just an attention seeker. That's why I get downvote and almost no comments right? Or is it because I'm so far gone that no one knows how to help me? This probably won't be seen by a lot of people and I'm ready to accept that.

Congrats if you made it this far doubt many people did. Comment advice if you want, doubt anyone will. And if your gonna down vote then go right ahead I'm prepared for that to and i honestly don't care anymore. If you wanna send tips or advice on what i can do I live in Ohio. Further information will have to be disclosed privately."
832,"Why isn’t suicide looked at less harshly for those with a sound mind, who have lived their life to the fullest extent they wanted.","I just realized I have been chasing death for years. I have made choices everyday that will almost certainly lead to my death and I’m not trying to fix that. I have most likely given myself a nice amount of heart damage along with any other organs. I refuse to treat any medical conditions as I did it to myself and am not going to take the resources from someone who didn’t choose to self destruct. I am so detached from myself that sometimes I miss major things. I literally (and accidentally) burned a half dollar size wound onto my leg with a hot pipe and didn’t notice. I used to thrive in all areas of life. And now I just know that I wasn’t made to last long, I can feel it. My life wasn’t meant to be long term. I have lived my life and done everything I want. It’s been short and sweet and im okay with that. I just wish that mindset was more widely accepted."
833,I can’t bond with anyone and idk what’s wrong with me,"For some reason I just can’t love anyone. Every time I think I love someone I suddenly just get tired of them and idk why. I could leave someone and hurt them emotionally and not give a shit. I had a friend earlier this year and I enjoyed being around her and then suddenly at night, in a second, I just got tired of her. I thought that it was temporary because I was kinda tired and I thought in the morning I would go back to normal. But it never did, and now it’s been months and I’ve found new friends to hang around with.
    When I was little, before my parents became excessively abusive, they were actually pretty good parents. But I didn’t love them. As a little kid, it kind of bothered me but I didn’t think much of it because I was young and I didn’t really have complex thoughts yet. But I knew there was something wrong. I understood that when you loved someone you felt something almost warm in your heart. But I didn’t feel much towards my parents. I brushed away the thought, and as I got a bit older I believed that I truly loved my parents, mostly because I would say I love you and my mom would ask if I loved her and I’d say yes, and I guess that convinced me into into I really did care about my parents. 
    But as I became older, I started to sense gaps. I couldn’t care. 
    My morality compass isn’t broken, and I know right from wrong, but I don’t really care. Even if I know what I’m doing is wrong, I’ll do it without giving a fuck. I can emphasize with peoples emotions, but I can’t sympathize with them. So I understand what they’re feeling, but I don’t feel bad with them.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me :( but I want to figure out"
834,I feel so isolated,"I spent all of last month alone and away from work due to non-mental health issues. I do have a history of depression and anxiety. I had started to sink into a deep place despite therapy and medications. I started feeling better once I went back to work. But now thanks to covid, I’m forced to work from home and my depression is becoming worse. I feel so alone. I’ve already started pulling hair again."
835,Fantasizing about Disgusting Sexual Things and Killing,"I've been noticing that I've been searching things that are...inhumane every night, rape pornography is one of the most things I like watching as I find it interesting to watch, there are times that I even fantasies about such brutal things to a person, even if it's just strangers, like when I see a random passerby, I'd either fantasies about either killing or them getting raped as it fuels up my interest, though I am not sexually active"
836,I'm not sure what this is.,"This is a throw away because I genuinely dont want anyone to know how I feel. It just gets thrown in my face or gets people worried about me. This sub just seems like the place for this. I'm 25 with a wife, 2 boys, and a mortgage. I'm the sole ""breadwinner"" and recieve no support from gov assistance. That's stressful but we manage well. I'm currently part time at my job but I typically make enough to get the bills paid and still have some to put back. I'm happy with my job and I adore my kids and my wife. I dont understand why I have no energy towards cleaning my home. I dont know why I get so short with my wife and give her an attitude so often. She has anxiety and Is a for real a hypochondriac. I make her feel better and talk her down from her panic attacks. I'm supposed to be the strong one but I end up bottling it all up and joking around at work acting like everything is okay but I will break down in tears sometimes when I'm alone. I hate the state of my home I used to be so organized but my life is so disorganized that it puts me in moods. If I talk to my wife she gets incredibly defensive because she thinks I'm blaming her for the home. I'm not I want to work on this together but keeping it up everyday seems impossible. I get so short with my kids ages 2 and 9 months that I get mad at myself. I love them to death and dont want to feel like this towards my family. Spending money to me is like pulling teeth. I feel like if I spend 3 dollars on myself then i wont be able to pay for my home and my family's needs. I can't even answer questions like what do you want for Christmas or birthdays. I dont know what it is."
837,ADHD vs Bipolar mania. Diagnosed with both,"As a child I was diagnosed with ADHD and was given meds for it for some years. I started to refuse to take it around 11. As an adult in my 20s I was diagnosed with bipolar mania and told that I was mistaking my bipolar symptoms for ADHD symptoms. I also suffer from anxiety attacks if that helps. 

I looked up the symptoms and I seem to have a decent amount of symptoms from both diagnosis. 

I plan on going to my doctor after all this virus stuff slows down what kinds of questions should I ask my doctor or what should I tell them?

I want the right treatments and I feel like the past few times they just give me SSRIs and those don't help and make me irritable. This effects my life greatly."
838,I need advice on dealing with my friends,"(Just for context) I have Bipolar type 2 and I believe I’m entering a depressed episode.

One of my past love interests is also a friend of mine. I’ve been very open to all of my friends about what me and my ex went through in hopes that they might be a little sensitive or something. My friends ignore me all the time to pay attention to my ex. Not only is it insulting and hard to feel like the second choice/rebound friend, but it’s also hard to watch people flirt with my ex all the time cause I’m not completely over them.

Anyways my really question is if I should ask my friends to stop flirting with my ex in front of me, because they have every right to but it’s triggering when they do it in front of me. I also just generally hate how my friends treat me in general, would appreciate some advice"
839,remember places but not events,"i’ve noticed that i can vividly recollect places and settings from my life but not events that happened there. my poor memory of life events is something i’m completely aware of and regularly discuss in therapy &amp; with a psychiatrist but i’ve never mentioned how vividly i remember places. for context, i’m 22 currently and can remember the exact layout of places i stayed on vacation, places i lived, friends’ houses, etc from the age of ten (when my largest traumatic life events occurred) on. curious as to if anyone else  experiences this as a result of ptsd/any other diagnosis?"
840,my first post,"Hi, I’m (19M) new to reddit and I’m posting because I feel incredibly alone. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a majority of my life. I have a history of self harm but it’s been 3 months since i last cut myself. Last May I left a toxic relationship. My ex (i’m gay btw) was my best friend for the 3 years we were together. We were in the same friend group in high school and started dating when i was 16. While we were together he was the only person i talked to about my mental health, some other close friends had a vague idea of what I was going through but I told my ex everything. Now I’m a sophomore in college and have a great group of friends at school (2 of them are from that same group in high school but they aren’t close with my ex anymore) but I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to anyone for help. I think i’ve convinced myself that since it’s been so long since we broke up i should be over it by now. i’m 100% over my ex i was happy to dump him but i think i’m still affected by the trauma. I honestly feel paralyzed. My life revolved around my ex for so long that I’m not really sure how to be vulnerable with anyone else. I’m not really sure how to move on in life so i guess im looking for advice on how to deal with trauma from a toxic/mentally abusive relationship. Any advice on how to move on/feel comfortable opening up to people again is appreciated. I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make sense or doesn’t belong here. It’s 3am and i’m just looking for any support i can get.
thanks for reading"
841,Do I have mental health issues?,"Hi, English is not my first language and I'm mobile, so... Anyways, I think that maybe I have depression due to being so sensitive, crying on a stupid comment on facebook. A little about myself: I'm 24f and a college student. I used to be a smart kid. Not a genius or something but I can understand things quicker than normal kids. My parents took me to test my IQ and it's around 135 to 140. I don't remember exactly. Everything was fine, school was amazing until I got into an accident when I was in 10th grade. A drunk driver hit me when I was on my bicycle. I didn't have any serious injury, just a big bump on my head. My parents took me to the hospital and I was fine or that's what we thought. Soon I realized that I became more and more stupid. I couldn't understand Math or Physic anymore (they were my favorite subjects). Things got worse when I went to college. I constantly failed a tons of classes. That's when I started to think that I was a loser, a worthless person. I used to have the pride of be the smartest one, now I'm always the stupidest. When my friends went out to party or dating, I stayed home stick to my phone. My childhood friend went to the same college but one year later than me. I must dropped out long time ago without her support. Now she graduated and has a decent job now but I'm still stuck here. My parents pay for my college fee so I feel extremely guilty about the money they've been wasted on me. They're not rich nor poor. College is not just my dream but my father's too. Because my brother didn't go to college (he didn't want to, now he also has a great job), my father want me to do it for him. Although he doesn't say it but I can tell that he's disappointed in me. Due to corona epidemiologic situation, I started to take online classes lately. It took me four hours straight to do my homework yesterday, just some yes or no questions. This morning, I got into a stupid fight with some random person on internet. He ended up call me a ""stupid cow"" and it hurts me so bad that I busted into tears. Like all the thoughts about me being worthless kicked in. I cried for a while. Me, a stupid cow, have no talent, look or anything. I just feel lost. Am I have depression or just simply too sensitive?"
842,I hate myself.,"I'm sorry but this is gonna be quite long...

Ive always had a bad relationship with my mom growing up. My dad left us when i was about 10 since he came out as gay and found a new partner. I hardly have contact with him as we've grown distant despite always being a daddy's girl when i was younger. Prior to my dad leaving my parents would always fight. My dad started blaming me for their divorce/ separation. I live with my mom and she and I don't get along. There isnt a day where she hasnt called me fat, or her bringing me down. She despises me so much. I resemble my dad so much from face to personality that she always nitpicks on me for that. ""Oh you're just like your father"" or ""your father may have left but i feel like hes still here."" (she was talking about me) she doesn't like my dad. Growing up i dealt with alot of bullying which she didnt care much about. In highschool I also faced bullying which she didnt act on or care about either. She would just tell me how i was weak, too sensitive and too dramatic. I ended up feeling depressed when i was 12 and self harmed for a year before she wound out. She threatened to send me away to our home country and called me ""sick"" I did get child therapy but she never came with me to appointments. She always compared me to my younger sister, saying im not strong and independent unlike my little sister. How my little sister never asks for anything yet im so spoiled. Or how my sister was just better than me in general. While my mom was a single mom, I would cook, clean and tutor my sister while my mom was away and she knew that (this was from the ages of 10-15yrs old since when i turned 15 my sister didnt ask for much help anymore) I know she knows that because when shes in a good mood about me she talks to her friends and thats what she says. When we fighr, she always tells me hurtful things like i should just die, or im not a priority, she doesnt care about what happens to me Etc etc.. Then the next minute she's telling me how she loves me unconditionally, only for me to say something she doesnt agree with and the cycle starts again. Shes depended on me for so many things and sometimes it feels hard. I was the one sorting out the documents to send off to the lawyers when she was filing for her divorce, and when she applied for my stepdad's visa, she made me do it for her, and got mad when i couldnt understand anything, calling me dumb and stupid and ""how are you supposed to become a lawyer if you dont even know how to apply for a visa for your stepdad"" keeping in mind I was 15 at the time. My mom and I argue every single day, over small things, but they hurt. She was on a call eith my aunt and i came down to eat some cereal, then she started to call me fat over and over and laughing about it with my aunt. She knows my weight is my biggest insecurity, I tried to tell her later on but she just told me to ""stop being so dramatic"" and ""it was just a joke"" my mom and we don't usually joke to eachother at all. When I turned 18, the first thing she said to me is that ""yay i can finally kick you out!"" as a joke. I guess it is funny, but something inside me just feels sad. Im 18 now and we still argue. I had mock exams this week and yesterday, the teacher who was supervising the students with the exams told me to go home because I was sick. I told my mom and she said ""its probably just stress."" I ended up getting a fever when I got home but she didnt believe me and assumed i just didnt want to sit the exams. She said ""i dont care if you're sick. Deal with it."" ""your health is not my priority"" ""why are you stressed? You're too young to be stressed. Im the one who is stressed. I work day and night!"" She always compares me to her, and my sister. My stepdad, hes a kind person but he always sides with my mom. My mom is the more dominant one in their relationship and my dad just usually sides with her to stay out of trouble. The only support I have is my boyfriend, who i was with for 5 years, but we broke up due to circumstances, but we got back together secretly because my mom now hates him and doesnt want me to get back with him, but ironically she goes around and boasts how she's such a cool mother who gives her children freedom and be with whoever they want. I made my mom believe that I am no londer depressed, anxious, or feeling any sort of sadness or depression. I had to stop helf harming because she would always bring it up in a spiteful way and would call me sick and mentally disturbed.

I feel lonely, and that I have nobody to run to but my current boyfriend and my pet birds. They cant do much, but they've been there for me, my boyfriend and I have been going strong for a while and he's really been a massive help to all of this, but i still feel depressed, messed up and I dont think i can cope anymore... Theres so much more I wish to talk about but I cant remember from the top of my head. Ive tried for so many years to just forget whatever happens and its just all overflowing. Ive attempted suicide a few times in the past which failed. I feel like a failure, i feel useless and unloved by my own mom. I understand she must have insecurities and stress too but does she need to take it out on me? I always feel jealous when i see other kids happy with their parents, while im constantly locked up in my own room, crying and emotionally deteriorating. I dont think I can handle this anymore. I love my mother and i want to make her proud but for years, ive felt like nothing except a burden, a failure and a bad person. She's hardly ever been emotionally supportive and she has hit me in the past. She's one of those ""tiger moms"" the typical asian mom. I've cried to myself to sleep so many times.. i just cant handle it anymore...

I have grown to hate myself, every part of myself. My looks, my personality, traits and even my own feelings. I cant even look in a mirror without feeling disgust. I've tried so hard to stay normal and fine, but im finding it even more difficult as days go by. 

Anyone who read up this far, thank you so much for reading..."
843,Am I a sociopath or just depressed???,"Okay so I'm kinda worried and wondering if I'm a bit of a sociopath. I can feel things I guess idk I'm mostly numb all the time. But I'm also worried a manipulate people without knowing it and it's all subconscious to make me feel better about getting something out of it. 

My emotions feel so distant like they aren't even there and I cant really put a name to any feeling I really have. If i do feeling anything at all its sadness and demotivated. But I also think that I'd have no problem doing something others would think is hard, but I do have morals. And i know there are consequences but I'm scared consequences are the only thing keeping me from doing something wrong idk. Basically idk if I'm depressed or if I show some signs of an anti social disorder. 

Also are there any scientific ways to diagnose someone with an disorder like this? I heard the brain layout between a healthy person and a person with anti social disorders are different."
844,Pure AC Vent Right Here,"I was doing okay, not the best, but I think I was genuinely not feeling numb, but just plain I guess. Though I'm falling back down. I have been tracking my moods with Youper and I think it helps a bit. Idk. But recently its just back to back depression every day. I can't do anything. Now the only energy I have is just the urge to die. I feel like theres nails ripping my throat apart, theres a twist in my stomach, and I can't stop it. I'm just going down and down. I'm cutting again, and I'm not proud of it, I hate myself even more but I feel a  bit more relieved I guess. Though I promised I wouldn't to my girlfriend who's been supporting me for 4 years so she understands it. I'm kinda pushing her away to just keep going so I can get this out of my system, but part of me knows this won't help I guess. I can't see her because of Corona and it sucks. I just got back from college and its been forever. My weighted blanket feels like her but it doesn't and it makes me sad, relieved, mad, and everything. Theres just so many emotions going on I guess and I can't handle it. I've been being a therapist for everyone and I want to scream and be heard but I care for them first and I need them to be okay I feel like. Because if they aren't okay, how can they help me. I don't know. This thing is controlling me again and I want it to stop."
845,My mental health has declined so bad. I haven’t been wanting to look at myself for months. Here’s some venting,"I started having minor depressive episodes around October. Then something happened in my relationship 3 months ago that made me very insecure and hurt. And now I don’t have the energy to do anything. I haven’t been taking care of myself. I haven’t sent a photo of myself to my boyfriend in months. I don’t want to look at myself. It’s hard to take showers. 
Why did I get knocked down this hard? It’s so hard to do anything. Nights are so hard for me. I feel so sad and not good enough. It’s hard to shower. It’s hard to go brush my teeth. 
I’ve spent months in my home and now with covid 19 I’m here for longer. I worried I’ve wasted time I could’ve been out. I don’t feel okay. I’ve been disassociating a lot and feeling paranoid. Maybe venting all of this will help. I don’t know."
846,I really really love my ex,"I'm not sure why, but I really really long to text him or even hear his voice. I try to hold myself back but it's no hard. After 1 year, I'm still like this and it's crazy"
847,Friend tried to commit suicide after breakup,"Hi guys, my friend who lives abroad just attempted suicide after a breakup. Her sister found her luckily, I'm heartbroken over this and don't know what to say to her. I've tried my best to tell her that it isn't the end of the world and she will get better. Please please please everyone help me by writing positive messages or things that can help so I can show her that everything will be ok. I'm honestly begging you guys, help me help her.

Thank you X"
848,Why did I eat toast?,"I eat toast in front of my little sister and now I feel fat and guilty and worthless, I should have eat fruit"
849,A New Emotion,"I feel like I never experience anger, only ever sadness and I'm unsure if this new emotion is a sign of empowerment or regression. It's like everyone is trying to suck the beauty out of the world and everyday it gets dimmer and it makes me angry. Anger feels dangerous and I don't know what to do with it."
850,Where does it go," It’s like I don’t know where to put the pain, I mean there isn’t really anywhere it can go. I’ve tried so hard to make it leave and nothing ever works. It’s like I’m ok for a moment, if I’m lucky that moment lasts a while. Then it's there again, sometimes from nowhere. It sucks the enjoyment from what I’m doing and makes me want to drink until I sleep. It stops me in my tracks and there is nowhere for it to go. I think mental health is about prolonging the moments it's gone without being addicted to a substance. It’s far easier to drink a bottle of wine than to sit with the pain. Maybe it's about accepting the fact the pain doesn’t have a solution and it stays in you forever, and that is ok."
851,"This is possibly unconventional, but convention isn't working","I wanted to post this here because it regards mental illness. 

I need/want music recommendations. I have been trying to find new music to listen to (I'm a musician so it is kind of difficult). But for the past few months, music has just not satisfied me like it used to. I haven't played an instrument in weeks, I haven't enjoyed music for months, I haven't done any art projects in weeks, and all of that is just really throwing fuel on the fire. 

I've been living, for at least 15 years, with bipolar disorder, PTSD, gen anxiety disorder, and probably other things I haven't talked to my therapist about. As most of you are aware, any one of those can absolutely ruin interest and drive to enjoy things you love. Music and art are things that my soul absolutely has to have, and my mind is shutting those things out. So I figured maybe if I got some different points of view, and different musical interests, it would eventually spark something and I could get into an incline again. 

So, if you guys are interested, post your favorite music. I wanna explore everyone's faves and see if I can find something that clicks. Thanks in advance, even if it doesn't help me, I know someone will get something from this."
852,"Can thinking of being ill increase your heartbeat and the possibility of getting mentally ill, or is it just a natural reaction over an actual condition that one has?","It's been ever since 5 o clock I have this constant accelerated heartbeat that's keeping me from sleeping, and I feel like I have food stuck in my heart or something like that. While sometimes my way of thinking can infact cause me anxiety, it's usually not nearly as impulsive of a thought and I usually forget it after 5 minutes. As of now, I keep forgetting the thought but it immediately comes back, and my heart does infact beat stronger than usually

Side note: I actually increased my eating circle a lot in this last month."
853,"I'm not depressed, just tired.","I'm so tired of everything. I don't feel good about myself, I don't feel good about anything I do anymore. The things people say to me just feel like pressure on me to do what they want. I'm so tired. I just want to lie down on my bed and never get up again. I sleep for a good 8 hours a day, sometimes even more, but I still get through the day without any energy. I'm afraid that if I bring this up to my friends, they will think I'm doing it all for attention and hate me, so I turn to a community of people I have never met, and hope I don't get judged. 

It just doesn't feel like a good year for me. A group of ex-friends shoved e out of their group, coronavirus made me miss an opportunity for an oversea homestay programme, family pressure to pursue and keep up the family business, even though it's not what I want to do in life, academic failure, social issues in general.

I'm constantly surrounded by people who keep telling me to do this, do that, and my family has high expectations of me. Yet I'm a failure and I always feel alone.

I'm so tired. How should I pull myself out of this, any advice? I've got a student internship programme coming up soon, and I want to get out of this slump and do my best at that. Thanks."
854,I like a girl and it's messing with me,So I met this girl I really like she said she wants to cuddle and all that but she likes someone else she is waiting to come back to her and it's really messing with me but of course I won't tell her this because i just want to make her happy and for her to live her best life. It's just not helping my current mental state
855,Overwhelming Numbness,"Sometimes I just don’t feel anything. For example, when someone I care for is going through something hard and relatable, I’ll to to care for them or even be sad but I can’t. It’s like I don’t care about what happens to me or anyone else. I’m just existing. I have bad days and good ones, and on the good ones I’m inside my head a lot. On the good ones I like to cry. For some reason sadness is the main feeling I feel, but it’s nice to actually feel something. 
I analyze why I’m doing what I’m doing and the only answer I can can come up with is that I don’t truly feel anything. Where someone might feel a bit of compassion and even sadness at the loss of someone’s life, I feel nothing but a dull buzz. It wasn’t always like this. I remember in the past having genuine concern for my friends and family. I remember being able to relate to them. Please help me."
856,Help needed!!!!,"Hey all, I'm working on a bit of a project to improve crisis intervention, particularly out of hours ect. if anyone wants to contribute experience of any sort please message me, I'm looking for stuff that could help to explain some of the drivers behind behaviour /presentation or stories/poetry/ artwork tbh I have no firm idea atm, and obvs will all be anonymous, if anyone wants to help I thought it'd be a good pandemic project lol."
857,Question Regarding resolving the Oedipus complex.,"I have recently found out that i have some issues with my life and tracked it back to the Oedipus complex. i wanted to know if any of you have some articles or books that could help me get past this and become a better version of myself. i don’t want a step by step tutorial, i want to understand the situation more deeply and be able to get past it myself, not just follow instructions and patterns. i want to learn how to make myself better."
858,"I'm here, if you need someone.","Hello all. I know this sub seems more of people looking for help, but I'm going to post about being available as someone to talk to in the current times. 

A little about me, I am a 28 year old who is back in school studying Cognitive Neuroscience. I was in psych ward multiple times and am on a current proper dose of medication with regimenting of therapy and other things to keep my mental health in check. I am diagnosed Bipolar 1 with Psychosis, PTSD, Substance Abuse, Anxiety Disorder and Eating Disorders.

Now, I cannot cure you, that isn't my intent. What I can do is be there as someone to lend an ear and if you need some guidance for help.  I care about everyone, it's a curse. Every living creature has a purpose and I want every living thing to know how much they matter and that includes you. 

So, if you want to talk, I'm here and ready to listen. Stay safe and smart in this current trying time and always remember, no matter what that mind of yours is saying you are important and worthy."
859,Does any one else doesn’t this? I don’t sleep all day so the next day i am are tired to wake up at all?,"I do this thing were when I’m upset or feeling that “darkness” in my chest I don’t sleep for a whole 24 hours so the next day I can just sleep and not wake up in a all day. I don’t know why I do this, I’ve done this since I was 13. I don’t know what I means either"
860,when I feel happy people look at me like I’m insane,"all throughout the day I’ll feel mediocre and low, then someone will say something mildly funny or stupid and I’ll lose it. Mostly people don’t even have to say anything, I’ll just start laughing and laughing for no reason in the middle of the corridor and all my friends are looking at me but they’re laughing too because I’m laughing (that happened yesterday). 

ill talk happily about morbid topics like the death of my family members, funerals and typically unfunny topics. i feel like I’m on top of the world, and these happy insane feeling moments are what I live for. Coming back to reality is the worst part though."
861,What do you do to not isolate yourself and withdraw from friends when you are in a depressive/anxiety episode?,"I have been withdrawing from my best friend, because she triggers my insecurities in the times when i feel the worst. 
When I hate myself so much i start thinking she will never accept me for being like this, therefore she will leave, because this side of me is not fun to be around. So I isolate myself to prevent being hurt. But this only leads to more pain, because i feel like she thinks im ignoring her and being a bitch. And now i don't know what to do. I feel like i may ruin our friendship:("
862,I’m broken and don’t know what to do (29f),"To make it short...my fiancé of nearly 4 years (and a struggling alcoholic), has ghosted me. He has vanished. We both have quite profound mental health issues and without doubt were dependent on each other. Regardless of what’s happened or if the rumours of another woman are true: I am devastated and simply do not know how to make it through each day. We’ve gone from around the clock contact (we’ve been living apart for a while) to absolutely nothing. His phone is on so he’s alive but no amount of messages will get him to respond. I am not well enough mentally to go there and confront him so I am just left to sit and ponder and it’s killing me. I’m trying to eat, drinking water, taking my meds and attempting to get fresh air but truly inside, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. He won’t give me closure and I’m guessing his sudden change in recent character is because he knows he’s done something he can’t tell me or I won’t forgive but how on earth do I just pretend he never existed and move on? I love him and I know I have to fall out of love with him but without knowing what’s happened and why, that’s incredibly hard. And my over busy and very critical mind has turned against me. I have no family around and most of my friends jumped ship when they realised he had an alcohol problem. So here I am. Alone. With nothing and no one and no real purpose 💔

tl;dr will I ever feel like life is worth living again? 😔"
863,How to stop intrusive thoughts,"How can I stop intrusive thoughts? I don't know when they'll happen, but when they do, it hits hard. For example, I'll randomly picture my family/friends needing desperate help and no one there to help them. I also get upset for no reason and want to be a kid again, I picture 6 year old me watching TV and desperately want to go back in time when I had no worries. I'll also feel like I want to die while not being suicidal. I'll sometimes come up with fictional situations to make me feel even worse for no reasons. These are destroying me mentally and I can't stop them."
864,"I think I’m going to kill myself, I’ve wanted to for a while and I deserve to be able to, here’s why","My dad molested me when I was 3 and was extremely physically abusive to everyone in our family, my older brother I trusted molested my younger sisters from the ages of 3-7. We finally got away from those two and a good family friend married my mum and became my step dad, he was the greatest thing to happen to us. My brother died in 2015 at 10 years old I was 12 on my little sisters birthday. It fucked up my family and then my stepdad died in 2016, I’ve been the rock for my family for the past few years. It fucked up their lives so hard I haven’t been able to show any weakness and needed to be their support. I’m 17 and I’ve had the shortest fucking life ever, why can’t I just fucking end it now instead of suffering more. Anyone who calls me selfish can fuck off, try watching the man you call your father die in front of you, try being in the kitchen and hearing blood curdling screams that haunt your dreams as your mum finds your dead brother who was sleeping right in the bunk under you. Try living with the guilt that your sisters were being fucked by someone you trusted when they were only fucking 5 years old. Try learning that your older brother got away with a 200 dollar fine and six months good behaviour. I’ve lost 2 brothers, 2 fathers, my sisters are permanently scarred now and my mums a shell."
865,Feeling a funk. So hard to be motivated to do basically anything.,"Not sure why. I've gotten episodes like this from time to time in my life, but they usually subside quickly and I always assumed it was normal.

This has been going on since early February. I don't feel really compelled to do much of anything. I'll play a video game for like 20-30 minutes and then I'll put it down and just stop. I don't really feel excited or motivated to go to work either (though I'm sure plenty of people feel this way). Even when I get up and start cleaning the apartment or read a book or put on a TV show I like, I just unexplainably put it down and don't want to do it anymore. 

It's basically affecting my day-to-day. I've been in bed more. I don't know if it's because of lack of human communication (never really had people to generally socialize to begin with or if I did, they seldom wrote back or carried on a convo unless they needed something) or maybe just an accumulation of boring, frustrating, or mentally exhaustive tasks getting the best of me. The back of my head feels heavy sometimes too."
866,Self-quarantine and dissociation,"Anyone else having some serious dissociation/depersonalization due to quarantine? I live alone and haven’t seen another person in days (turns out the 2 days a week I went to class made a huge difference). I’ve made an effort to keep in touch with the few people I talk to, but I’m having a hard time being present. 
Nothing feels real and my meds aren’t making a difference anymore. Just curious if anyone else is experiencing similar feelings, I guess."
867,corona virus and mental health,"I've seen people talking about it before that this corona virus thing is messing with their mental health. And the response is often ""you're so selfish think about the people that are actually dying wth?!"" or a variation of that.

And I used to think it was whatever but now I totally get it because I once again feel depressed af.

I have less than 3 months to find a job or I'll become homeless, it has been an issue for a while, but good luck finding a job now. Especially considering all the people being let go from their jobs and also the lack of jobs available suddenly, most likely because they don't want to meet with lots of new people for interviews.

I'm sick of not being able to escape it. Getting emails daily for companies, news screens outside, on the radio, weekly texts from relatives telling me don't go outside. I was shamed for chosing to travel within the country and for going to one of the bigger cities for a job interview - basically that I could spread disease to those in the risk group. Got home today and I had a news-paper on my door mat with ""corona-virus"" in big letters on the front.

My friend is unwillingly locked out from her life, to not spread the virus. She does not have the virus but it's to prevent her from getting it and spreading it to someone in the risk group. It's close to illegal that entire thing but its an entire situation I won't discuss but what I'm saying is it's also hard to meet friends and family if you don't already live with them.

I hate being made feel guilty whenever I go outside ? and i hate whenever you show sympathy for anyone else except the people in the risk group risking being sick you're an awful person.

this will go on for months and it's just a hopeless situation and i doubt im the only unemployed person struggling right now. i also doubt im the only one struggling with not knowing when i'll see people that are important to me again.

i don't even have a solution i'm just complaining about a shitty situation. and idk if there's help to get for people struggling in these rough times because you don't even get let in through the door at the health care center unless you answer their questions so idk how much of this is the cause of me never getting an appointment for my mental health"
868,Is it okay to be this way? (How can I help myself),"My next therapy appointment isn't for a while and i'm hesitant to talk about this to my therapist. I'm posting here because it's easier to express myself on topics like this when there isn't someone looking back at me. Sometimes I get triggered by something and it feels like my mind regresses in age or I lose sanity in some way. What I mean by this is i'm unable to think straight and tend to rely on my friends a lot more to feel a sense of safety and my thoughts no longer have a filter on them which allows recurrent darker thoughts in. This normally doesn't last longer than an hour so I just accept it as part of who I am and something I can live with but last time it lasted for three days which is way longer than it has ever gone on. This has me really worried with the thought of it happening again but never ending. Thoughts during this mindset tend to revolve around being sexually abused. I tend to find an attraction to the idea of it happening to me and romantic partners that put me through it. A lot of my fantasies line up with what is called Stockholm Syndrome. At the worst parts of this feeling or mindset or whatever it is, I feel that the only useful part of me is my body and that i'd be better if I gave myself to some dark group to be used for sex as it'd be the only way I could be useful. I don't like thinking about any of this really, it gives me a lot of anxiety and sometimes I feel really guilty for some reason for having these thoughts. This is only something that started happening when I got my depression under control, me and my therapist found a lot of it was linked to gender dysphoria which is something I have been taking care of through transitioning. (Genderqueer, Biological Male, Identify as Gay going with any pronouns. I am on estrogen through HRT) I want to be clear that this isn't something caused by the HRT or medicines I have been taking as way before I was able to start this was already happening and is just as bad as it was. I stopped having major depressive symptoms after I stopped pretending to be masculine for my family and friends and started acting like myself, I quickly found out that because I had been actively playing a character for my family and friends that my real feelings and mind didn't have much time to develop. (this went on for 10 years starting at age 6, after my grandmother told me I was too much for her because of my gender problems that I could only express through frustration.) Back on the topic of the dark thoughts, the only ones that are exclusive to that broken mindset is the ones of selling myself as a slave. The attractions and fantasies stay the same outside of it but not as much or as severe.  


Background/potential cause:  
I used to put myself through mental abuse by getting boyfriends that I knew would hurt me, I am unsure why I would do this and can't think of any reasons for it but I always know when I do it.  
I am told I most likely have repressed memories of sexual assault and I feel like its true.  


I am terribly sorry if this is not the place to post this or if i'm doing something wrong, please tell me if I am. Most of what I want out of this is to know if it's okay to be like this or if i'm just a bit odd and tips for self help on this situation. I'd also like tips for how to express this to my therapist, I have been to a mental hospital once before because of the depressive symptoms I had. It was a positive thing to happen, I really was able to help myself and developed coping skills but I have severe PTSD to being sent there and often have nightmares about it. This is one of the reasons i'm scared to talk about all of this face to face with my therapist.  


Thank you for listening, any response is appreciated."
869,Therapy culture,"“Go talk to a therapist“ you read hear and see everywhere especially here on reddit.   
But i have been to 4-5 and i wasnt helped in a significant way. And usually that means that you did something wrong. It is rarely the therapists fault. Man i should become a therapist. Easiest job ever since you cant do it wrong."
870,Why do you lose all your rights when you go to a mental hospital?,"I recently was involuntarily held in a mental hospital last month, for trying to take my own life. Spent a week in there, and it was basically a jail experience. They take away everything, can't even use your phone, you have to follow strict rules, you have to take meds, talk to counselors, you are treated like you can't make your own decisions. If you try to assert your independence, they drag you into an isolation room to punish you. And I didn't even commit a crime. I was just in a bad mental state. I tried to assert my rights and it just blew up in my face. Why are mental hospitals like this?"
871,Question about U.K. psychiatric care and medications.,"So I’ve recently started going through the mental health system in the U.K. for suspected PTSD due to childhood trauma. I’ve been hospitalised 4 times in less than a year due to very extreme anxiety reactions (stroke-like symptoms, loss of speech, heavy ataxia, among more symptoms) the worst episode of which took me a month to start speaking normally again. 

My most recent visit resulted in me being given a short term Diazepam prescription (incredibly rare for the U.K. from what I have seen) and have been referred to the Psychiatric Nurse.

At my initial assessment we discussed if I was on any medication and explained my GP had taken me off all antidepressants due to them being ineffective and the side effects being too restricting on my life, also my GP wants to treat my mental health as trauma-induced anxiety rather than treating depression as the primary issue. Now when we discussed Diazepam, the nurse basically said he wants me to see the resident psychiatrist about being on some kind of medication as he doesn’t feel it safe for me to be completely unmedicated but iterated that diazepam, although extremely effective at controlling my symptoms and episodes, is not available for long term prescription. He did say however that the psychiatrist can prescribe “something that is similar but isn’t as addictive”.

I like to think my pharmaceutical knowledge is pretty decent, but I have been wracking my brain trying to work out what medication this could possibly be. Beta blockers, SSRI/SNRI, TCA and TeCAs have all been ruled out as ineffective, so has anyone else been through the U.K. psychiatric teams and may be able to shed light on what they’re likely to prescribe? I can’t think of any drug that works like benzodiazepines do in regards to anxiety. 

Sorry for the long post, I realise this probably won’t get read by many people so thank you if you got this far. Any input is appreciated."
872,What can I take to help with my anxiety/stress?,"I started a job at an endodontist as a dental assistant a few months ago. I was doing pretty great according to what everyone else was telling me... until they moved me to a different location. And at this location they're very up tight about how they want things done and it's been really overwhelming. I've had anxiety problems in the past and now they're back. I've kinda been threatened with being written up because I can't seem to do anything they ask of me right. My anxiety doesn't help because it makes me really panicky. I think once I can get that under control i'll feel more confident and it'll help me improve greatly. I'm also pretty quiet because of my anxiety issues so it probably doesn't help my case at all. I would hate to lose this job because it's already helped me out a lot financially. 

So is there anything over the counter I could take that really helps with anxiety/stress?"
873,I think I'm losing my mind again. I think I need to talk to someone for real,"I just can't help but think I don't really have a bright and meaningful future anyway. I'm not cut out for this world. Sometimes I like to hold on to hope but then again, in times like these, I see no point in it. It's all just too dark. I feel like I'll be stuck here forever because I'm stupid and a loser. I might as well just die and it's the only true way to get unstuck."
874,Truly,
875,"My behaviour will soon land me up in jail, need help ASAP!n","20M here and there are alot of things that aren't working out in my life, to keep this really short and simple; I have anger issues, like real bad one where I blackout and break things. This has being going on for a long time, since childhood I was a destructive kid with a bad temper.

I had a really nice and loving childhood but when I get upset or mad, I just loose it, I yell, I break stuff, punch the walls till my knuckles bleed etc.
When I get mad, I want to break something or someone, I don't get the satisfaction by meditation at all but instead it fuels me up even more.

Since I started dating this girl things have been going downhill, I've been someone I never thought I would become, I am ashamed of myself to say this but this is the only place where people would understand.
So the relationship was bad from the start,I loved her dearly but she cheated (long story) I forgave her but I was still pretty mad about it.

So I had her Instagram account without her knowing and saw that she was lying to me again, in a fit of rage I hit her twice but I regret that. I never wanted to hit a women but now I've crossed that line, I even threatened and blackmail her that I'll leak her nudes etc. 
  
(Ik this sounds really really bad but this is not me, I'm not in control when I'm mad, I blackout)

Today I was in an argument with her, I snapped and I broke my 10k piano and broke the baseball bat itself, my face was red like blood from the anger and to scare my girlfriend, I grabbed my dog and put a knife on it's throat and told my girlfriend to apologize otherwise I'll slit my dogs throat.

Then it suddenly hit me with what the fuck I am doing? What have I become in past few months, I threw the knife away and sat down and reflected about the things  I could've done. I love my dog to death but at that moment, it wasn't me. 

Idk what treatment I should get, it feels like a curse and I bet one day I'll end up killing somebody.

Ik I am a piece of shit and deserve to be behind bars and I'll readily do my time if I feel I've started to become dangerous. I wanna know the root cause of this? Why am I defective? Why cant I live a normal life? Why do I get this murderous rage?

Please I don't want torments from people saying mean things, I just want help. I don't wanna hurt anyone at all. I feel my personality changing too these days as I've become more short tempered ,irrational and aggressive."
876,Maybe i wasn'n meant for this life,"I don't know how to start,i don't know what to say. One thing is clear,somewhere God made a major mistake and send me down-here. All my life i was the ""stupid"" one, the guy that can't do something nice. Being this way made me feel uncomfortable about anything,from eye-contact to talking. 2 years ago i met a girl (i was 16) and i thought i saw an angel,she made me feel nice about myself,she help me a lot going thru family problems and,the most important,she made me forget about my ilness. But,unfortunately,after 7 months, she break-up with me and that shit made me feel like i was nobody. And here I am,2 years later,in the same family full of screams,with my arms wounded,nobody trusts me,i don't have enough courage to talk to someone. Every day seems so hard and my mind always is filling with negative thoughts about suicide,running away,going back to the place where i came from. I was never diagnosed,but i know something is not wrong. Being sad all the time has become a lifestyle. I don't know if im stupid,depressive or tired. I just wanna go,and i'd love to see if somebody cares."
877,Will never be able to break out of nativity and confusion in life,"I believe the short and sharp answer of addressing nativity is being a bit dumb in all honesty. 

I'm a 26 year old man that has struggled with very poor mental health issues my whole life and have witnessed more generational emotional and physical trauma than most people I've come across. Through adulthood I have heavily consumed alcohol and drugs to better my positive emotional state when it rarely comes across. This cycle usually leads to going too hard and end up in some of the worst mental states of my life. These cycles correlate closely with nativity because at times I have always questioned myself with decision making and feel at times I have lost connection with reality and almost always seek other opinions because I can't understand why close people around me would lie and want to see me hurt. At times I do the same and can identify the hypocrisy that is present and feel ashamed. Since the age of 18 I have always had issues with relationships and women because I witnessed regular domestic violence towards my Mother and feel the need over compensate and pledge myself to a partner. My understanding of women in relationships has grown into a truly murky perception and feel that extravagant efforts to be happy and keep the peace is dramatically artificial and delusional at times. I have a fear of getting hurt and can plot ridiculous thoughts of infidelity amongst friends and past partners. I have spent many times in my life blocking out volatile and truth based insults because I can't handle the ongoing pain in my life. At times I will literally pretend to turn off my hearing and zone out to try combat these certain situations. I am at stage where I am not entirely sure if I'm hearing what I want to hear, what I don't want to or having no idea how to operate. A lot of of my problems have been underlining since a child but definetly have to take blame for heightening these issues with the use of alcohol and drugs. Through ageing I have tried to cease nativity and try assess problems without focusing on the hurt involved. A large part of my confidence to combat difficult situations is pondered on whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs and eventually poorly acted on. I have improved my life slowly but tend to ruin any good work made by abusing substances because the feeling of happiness is illusive and I feel it needs to be bolstered. As I am writing this, I have been awake for 3 days drinking ridiculous amounts of alcohol and indulging in drugs. 

I commonly live a life of ruminating impulsive good and depressing thoughts and try persisting to be a good person but have always ended up lost. I have observed how my family and friends acknowledge me differently in certain situations and find it hard to accept but have to keep moving in a forward direction. I believe I am naive but sincerely don't know what to believe in at the best of times because I don't know how to make my own decisions in tricky situations."
878,"Every day is an emotional roller coaster, I'm trying to practice mindful habits and only focusing on what I can control but with every day, worse news comes, I don't know how to get through this","Hey all, I know that a lot of people are struggling right now, these are hard times.

For me I think the most difficult thing is that I'm away from my husband. I have been waiting for my spouse UK spouse visa from within the US for two months now. It's due to come back within the next two weeks but with every single day, the situation gets worse and worse.

When the outbreak became more of a reality for the rest of the world, I was calm. I'm staying with my parents and my mom was glued to the news from the beginning - which, we all know, even in this time of real crisis, *is sensationalized.* I took to finding my own news sources and searching around online to sort of triangulating my away to the appropriate level of concern for this problem. On a personal level, while I'm nervous, I'm not entirely concerned for myself... or.. wasn't... we'll get to that in a moment. I'm 24, healthy, and fit, with no compromising medical conditions so my fear isn't really for myself but more for my parents (who I still think will be ok) and others who are at higher risk. 

While I've already been away from my husband for a while I was initially thinking that it might be wise to postpone my visa and apply for a later date of entry and ride this out at my parents' house in the US. They live in the suburbs, we have space to ourselves, we have a yard and the woods, and cars... it's pretty ideal. Whereas my husband and I have an apartment together in London... not ideal during a pandemic. 

It was when the travel bans were first imposed that I started to get really nervous. When the US banned a large chunk of Europe from entry I began the conversation with my husband about having him come to the US. His office had already asked everyone to work from home so it was something that wouldn't be difficult to transfer here. My reasons were that the UK was definitely going to be banned next (which we see it now has been) and that even though they have a set number of days the situation is unfolding rapidly and we don't know what's going to happen next or if our options will be limited. I can't travel at this time as my passport is being sent back to me with my visa paperwork.

My husband wasn't as concerned as I was about the situation. I am probably overreacting, but he's under-reacting. His under-reaction causes me to overreact even more. His reasons for not wanting to come to the US were mainly based on personal comfort, not wanting to wake up several hours early for work, not wanting to leave the apartment, etc. He didn't even want to go to his parent's house in the country for some of these reasons. He really wasn't looking at the big picture.

When the UK was banned I lost it. I was upset that he didn't even believe that it was going to happen. In fact, from the beginning, he didn't believe that this would be as bad as it is and didn't even think his office would close. The situation continues to prove its self as being worse and worse, proving my speculations to be right again and again, and his lack of concern and unwillingness to trust my predictions is only stressing me out more. 

*\[it turns out there is an exemption for spouses to enter the US at this time, which I only just found the clause for... so this may still be a possibility... however.....\]*

We got past the initial concern over this and decided to wait it out and see what happens with my visa... but I feel like we're getting to the point where we really need to consider our options for what to do and what we *can* do if my visa is canceled or if I can't travel.

He doesn't want to speculate, but I'm trying to explain that these 'what-ifs' are very real and is not like saying ""what if one hundred African rhinos stampede and trample me in the suburbs of North America""...... it's on the level of ""what if I get in a car accident, maybe I should have medical and car insurance."" But right now, with him, with the world, and even with my parents it seems like to people, any speculation is just as unprobable or not worth thinking about as the worst and most unlikely speculations that can possibly be made. I think that's denial. I think that there *are* steps that we can take to reduce the risk to ourselves and ensure that we can get to each other before anything gets worse. But nobody wants to hear it and just wants to 'wait and see'.

My husband has been working from home for a week now. Generally taking things more seriously and when we've spoken he has been significantly more concerned than we was initially... even urging some of his friends who want to get together that this isn't the time and that they need to be more careful. He's expressed that he feels like work is so unimportant compared to what's happening and that it's hard to focus on his projects due to the chaos. However this is all pretty selective for him because today he somehow rationalized going to his co-worker's house to do work together for the day. 

London is being put on lockdown tomorrow. This is where I panicked. While they're saying they aren't imposing travel bans but I worry that they totally could, it's a real possibility, but that if they said so everyone would scatter and leave the city if they could, causing more spread of the virus the way we've seen with every other city and region that has imposed some sort of widespread lockdown.  

I told him that he needs to leave, and go to his parents ASAP. That even if I do get my visa and can travel, if he's locked down in London I won't be able to get to him for what could be months. While I adore his parents I couldn't leave mine, travel halfway around the world during this, and not be able to see him at all. While it hasn't happened yet, it is a *real* possibility. Even though we're young and healthy, if he did need medical care, London is going to be the absolute last place that you want to be during a global pandemic where people aren't going to be able to get the care they need. Either he wouldn't get care or he'd take the care away from someone elderly who needs it because he's young and has a future. He's already expressed that there isn't much food in our local shop - that is only going to get worse. Even if I can't make it to him at all through this, I want him to be safe and not alone during this. I want to have all of the chances that we can to get back to each other and being in a city will severely limit those options. Even the city that my parents live near is heading towards Shelter in Place measures... this strictness won't reach us because we're far enough into the country that such measures won't mean the same things for us, we can still go out to our yard. That's the difference. 

He was annoyed that I called him while he was 'working' and 'at his coworker's house', where he shouldn't have been anyway, and asked if we could talk later. NO. We cannot talk later because this is an *emergency.* He said so himself, this situation is so much bigger than work. He held on to all of these reasons to stay through this in London, in the flat, including not wanting our plants to die. I don't want him to get stuck in London alone just to keep the plants alive... like what on earth are you thinking.

I know that everyone is trying to cope in different ways and hold on to some semblance of normalcy and look for the things that affirm the illusion that daily life could still be going on but that isn't an option anymore. This mindset honestly makes me panic 20 times more. 

I think the biggest thing for me, and this is where personal physical health comes into this, is that the stress over this is going to deteriorate our health. His health. My health. Making us more subject to illness. Being apart and not having the comfort of your spouse during this time is probably some of the worst pain I've ever felt. With the addition of the worry of him being unsafe, alone, without food, in locked-down London. I honestly can't even live day to day worrying about that. 

I've been doing everything that I can to stay calm. The only place where I find some kind of peace is through doing yoga... but only while I'm doing it... I can't sleep. I have no desire to eat. 

My mother and I don't particularly get along so she has been spectacularly unhelpful throughout this whole thing. Instead of siding with me, or even just supporting me, she tries to play devil's advocate, vastly undermines my relationship and makes no effort to empathize with what I'm going through, and then tells me everything that *I'm* doing wrong. It's hard to understand quite what this feels like if you aren't dealing with it right now.

While I'm trying to stay calm, trying to practice self care, trying to stay strong for my husband and continuing to assure him and myself that we'll be ok... it's things like that that I feel can promote putting our heads in the sand and not taking action when action can and needs to be taken. Because this news has been unfolding over a course of several months I feel like it has gotten to a place that, while there's anxiety, it has also been normalized. Almost always the things that we fear happening are not as bad when we're actually in them, or the way that we imagine them to feel versus what they actually feel like are different. We have slowly eased into this. Because there as no sudden order for a global grinding halt, we haven't panicked. We're 'waiting and seeing' because largely, there isn't a lot we can do... but making moves like getting out of a city that's on the verge of lockdown and being overwhelmed medically... is the right thing to do.

So I'm going through this roller coaster of trying to stay calm, reaching a level of calm, learning a new piece of information and having my anxiety pitch through the roof, urging people that I love to take the actions that they *can,* while they can, having my concern invalidated or undermined, and then reaching a new peak of anxiety due to feeling utterly helpless, wondering who's right and who's wrong, what the appropriate level of concern is, if we can take personal actions, should we, and trying to convince people to do so rather than sticking their heads in the sand. 

My husband finally agreed to leave the city after I asked him why the hell he was hanging on to staying there when the list of potential risks were stacked so high against him versus the benefits of him staying with his parents... and that, sorry you're working right now but work can wait, there will always be other work, but family and safety is here and now and what I think is the number one priority, forgive me if I'm wrong.

This situation is torture. Especially with my mother who doesn't care and my father who is too overwhelmed to offer support or talk with me about it. I feel crazy but I also feel like if we don't do something, we might lose our options to. I'm torn between following all of the advice to stay calm and focus on myself and distractions versus my actual gut feeling and anxiety that this could be worse for us than we think if we let it go for too long (in terms of our personal lives and getting to the people that we need to). 

What do I even do? How do I get through something like this.."
879,Is it normal to be tired after work at twenty-two?,"I started working a new job in January and I thought I would be used to it by now but all I do is lay in bed exhausted after work. And today is my day off but my shoulders and back are still so tired so I'm still in bed. It's a more physically demanding job (working full time in a grocery store) than I'm used to and I'm coming off working around a hundred-twenty hours a week for four years (oh college). I figured it would take a while to feel well-rested again but it's been a really long time so I'm nervous perhaps my mental health is in a worse place than I thought. Any input would be most appreciated, thank you!"
880,I need help,"I'm 22F living in the UK. I've been suffering from anxiety, PTSD and depression from I was in a sexual abusive relationship a few years back. I've been waiting from August to see a counselor and with everything going on at the minute I'm not going to get to see one any time soon. I've also been having some health problems lately. I was in hospital with Pneumonia in February and I got my appendix out last week. I'm also self isolating with everything going on as the doctors think I might have an autoimmune disease called Goodpastures syndrome but I won't find out for definite until I can see my consultant when they start running hospital appointments again. All of this has caused my anxiety to go through the roof. So much so that I'm not able to sleep and I'm having panic attacks a lot more than I usually do. I was wondering if anyone knew of any services I could avail of that might help me. If there were any charities that I could talk to over text or email. I really don't know what I can do to get through all of this anymore. So I thought I'd turn to Reddit."
881,Something I've been thinking about.,"This is gonna be long winded and all over the place, it's just some place I can gather my thoughts for now. I don't really expect anyone to reply to this. I'm 20M and in Canada if that helps any. 

So while I was eating lunch today, I had a feeling of hatred towards myself - a feeling of disgust and remorse that I'm actually eating. I felt worthless. And I don't know why. Yes, I deal with mental health issues, but I've never had to deal with eating disorders. I'll bring it up the next time I see my therapist. 

It's just, really scary, y'know? Yeah, sure, I've felt worthless before, but not to this extent, and I'm not sure how I can feel about this. Yea, sometimes when I eat I get nauseous and feel like throwing up right after, but I thought that was just me over-eating again and being stupid, not an eating disorder.

Idk, I'm probably getting too far ahead of myself, but if this is an eating disorder, then idk. 

if it isn't then totally disregard that upper paragraph, please, i dont mean to make fun of anyone who actually has it, im just expressing how I've been reacting to it. 

Idk. Again, I'll talk to my therapist once I get the chance to (it's in my book so I won't forget), but hopefully it's just a one-time thing.. hopefully."
882,Anyone interested in making a subreddit focused on mental health support during social distancing?,"I have no clue how to do it, so I’m seeing if anyone else would be interested in the idea and moderating? I’ve just found that personally a lot of my depression and anxiety that I’ve been pretty recovered from and coping with healthily is very quickly regressing through this and I’m sure many others are experiencing worsening or new mental health problems like this. Maybe a community focused on talking about activities that we still can do during this time and just overall support so that maybe less people lose their minds stuck alone at home, with toxic family when back from college, stuck taking care of children and feeling inferior for not being able to entertain them, etc.?"
883,Wanting to try Zoloft,"Hello, I have very bad obsessive thoughts and social anxiety. I have been taking Atomoxetine for 3 months and this medication doesn’t seem to be helping me. I was looking into trying Zoloft, does anyone have success stories with Zoloft?"
884,I think I am a sociopath.,"I think I am a sociopath.

I’ve never been diagnosed, no. To begin I consider myself a very like-able person, very charismatic and attractive. I’d never say that to you in person because that feels like I’m just bragging, but this is anonymous so I don’t care. I’ve never had problems getting along with people, and can talk to essentially anyone very well. I’m well spoken, usually judging by someone’s appearance I’ll even throw on a different persona if they’re a stranger and speak in terms that seem relevant to them, or about things that appeal to them. Every relationship I’ve ever had I’ve broken the woman. I’ve caused them to lose all of their friends, lose bonds with family, and worse. Unintentionally of course, but I can’t say I don’t find pleasure in being able to control things like that. When I can’t control things in their life, I get furious. I lash out a lot and say many hurtful things in fits of rage, which are usually short lived. Afterwards, I can see that I’ve hurt the person, but I don’t feel any remorse usually. It sounds bad, but I don’t realize it until I think back on it. I’ve never been broken up with, I think if I had I’d lose my mind, I’ve never said I love you first, and I’m not sure if I ever will. Every time a woman has told me they love me, it’s been within the first month of talking, usually within the first week. I always say it back of course, even if I don’t feel it because I want to keep their interests and make them feel special. The list goes on, and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

Can anyone confirm my suspicions? I think I could be a sociopath."
885,Quarantine and getting help. What are alternative options for in person therapy?,"Hey all! I live in America, and have been struggling to find a therapist. I have a super weird work schedule, insurance that basically nobody takes (as is wildly too expensive), and now I’m stuck in my house on quarantine. I have severe anxiety, which comes with some DPDR and depression. And with my work being cancelled and me being stuck in the house, everything is worse!

I’ve tried a multitude of pills, and I’m actually on Duloxetine right now. It doesn’t seem to help much, and I’ll be seeing my psychologist soon about alternatives. I have my medical marijuana card, which works wonders for me, but is more of a bandaid. I think the one thing that’s really going to help me, is a therapist. 

But with everything going on, what should I do with therapy? I know about online therapy, but what’s the effectiveness of it? What about books and other self help aspects? Is it worth it to brave social contact to do in person? What’s the best way to get help with everything going on? What’s worked for you?"
886,This Corona isolation is really getting to me. Can you guys tell me some things you've done in spite of loneliness?,"I haven't been alone for very long, I only hopped on the social distancing bandwagon this week. And I think 2 days ago we had our first confirmed case in my county.(yes, county, not country) Anyway, it's really hard for me to do anything, I finally got up, made some eggs, and showered (it's 12:30 here). I have things I could do, probably things that would be beneficial for me, like cleaning off my desk, and writing a letter to my friend who is in boot camp. I have laundry I need to fold, I have more I need to wash. I could read a book I suppose. Any ideas for tiny reward chemicals I can give myself? Lol. I work part time, so most of the time right now I'm just alone. 
Also I'd like to hear what others have done despite the loneliness they might be feeling. It helps to know that I'm in this together with other people."
887,Weight loss and body image issues’ effect on mental health,"I used to be somewhat overweight up until three years ago when I was able to go back to a healthy BMI. Growing up I was always told how important it is to not be overweight in order to be well accepted into society. This made me feel very self conscious and that ‘I am not worth people’s time’.  My boyfriend recently told me that I am ‘the limit to what he would date in terms of body size’ which has kind of brought back old insecurities. He tells me he loves me but I have this irrational fear that he will find someone who is ‘prettier’ than me and that he would never want to marry someone like me who’s not ‘perfect’. I know this is total nonsense but I am always having those irrational thoughts. I also feel inferior to anyone who is skinnier than me. For people who have gone through weight loss or struggle with body image issues, how do you overcome the constant striving for perfection?"
888,How often can I take xanax without getting addicted?,"So even before the pandemic I've been in a really bad place mentally. When things would start to get really bad in my head, I would take 0.5 to 1 mg of xanax. I have strived to have at least 2 days between using it. 

But with the pandemic happening, the fact that my country will most likely face an economic collapse and the possibility of my mother dying to the virus ( the only person I still try to live for) is putting me in a state of a continuous low profile mental breakdown.

I'm tempted to take xanax every day ( at least 0.5mg) to cope with this, but the last thing I need is to get addicted to a potentially dangerous drug in times like this. What is your experience with it?"
889,"My psychiatrist appointment was moved to be over the phone, my therapists can’t see me, and my autism analysis was pushed back. There have been so many changes all at once and I’m going crazy.","I don’t know what to do, I’ve been feeling extremely anxious and depressed and my usual resources aren’t available to me because of Covid-19. I’m supposed to graduate high school this year but with everything going on I’m not sure what will happen to my class. And with this autism analysis being pushed back indefinitely I may not even have it done before I start college. I can’t stand everything that is going on right now. I just want it to end."
890,Isolation during covid-19 tanking my mental health and friendships,"Loneliness is my biggest trigger for my depression and PTSD. So the shelter in place that went into effect in my county is really causing my mental health to go down the drain.  I’ve been trying to talk to my friends, but for one reason or another (usually valid reasons) the FaceTimes and phone calls end up not working. I feel so alone and lost and I don’t know what to do.

Note: I am keeping myself busy playing music/playing video games/playing with my dog/reading/writing but I can’t seem to find anything to equal that people time I would usually have."
891,"Student,15 years old,Separated parents (10 years),Depressed,1 friend that is losing interest,Controlling Mother and Brother,Grandmother shames me everyday and tips to battle this other than suicide (do not mention religion)","I'm in desperate need of help, 3rd year with Depression and i'm 15 15!!"
892,Am I too far gone?,"I hate who I've become. I hate feeling this way. I hate thinking this way. I'm sick of doubting myself and everything I say or do. I'm sick of thinking I'm not good enough. I'm sick of thinking I'm too ugly for this or too stupid for that. I literally think I'm too ugly and dumb to live a normal happy life. 

Some thoughts of mine:
""You're too ugly to ever find love""
""You're too ugly to ever be loved""
""You're too stupid to ever find love""
""You're too stupid for life""
""You're too stupid to help yourself""
""You're too stupid to do this. Or to do that""
""You're too ugly for this. Or for that""
""You're not good enough for this or that""
""You're not worthy of love""
""You're not worthy of good things others take for granted.""
""You're stupid""
""You're ugly""
""You're unworthy""
""You're not good enough""
""You're 19 and have never been in a relationship. Its because you're ugly, stupid, worthless, and a failure.""
""You're 19 and haven't even finished high school. It's because how fucking stupid you are. You don't have any mental health issues or depression. Stop blaming your poor choices and your lack of happiness on them. Your life sucks because you're ugly and stupid.""
""You're too fucked up to ever recover""
""You're too stupid to change""

I'm sick of these negative thoughts. All day every day just escaping from these thoughts and feelings. Then beating myself up because I didn't do anything productive. Smoking weed and playing video games only to have an iota of happiness. Superficial happiness. Then hating myself for it afterwards and continuing this downward spiral. 

Crying over how fucked I've become and nothing I do will ever fix it. Crying over how it's all my fault and how I could have turned out so much differently. Crying over how much I've missed out on in my life. Over how many opportunities I've squandered. Over how I wasted my potential. Over how I can't break this cycle. And even if I do I cry over my past mistakes and regrets. 

I feel developmentally stunted beyond repair and I just want all this to end. I wish that memory wiper gizmo from MIB was real haha. But then who knows how fucked I'd be without the awareness of it all.

Even if I could change all this I'd regret wasting so much time in my life. All of my teen years gone. I would then be filled with so much regret.

Regretting:

Failing the 7th grade

Dropping out of high school

Isolating self from everyone and never developing social skills.

Not knowing who my friends and family actually are.

Never developing relationship skills or ever being in a relationship with someone.

Never living my life. Just existing.

Never realizing my potential.

Letting life happen to me.

Never developing myself.

Never exploring what life has to offer.

Letting fear, insecurity, and anxiety live my life for me.

Being a coward and not taking action and working for what I want.

Fuck I wish I had a reset button.

Not having an idea of WHO I AM. I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know my values. I don't know what I want from life truly. I don't have opinions of my own. I have no drive. No ambition. No skills. No talents. I'm like a robot that just woke up finally from a 19 year coma and became a human. But the tragic comedy of it is that I have to move forward and live with the fact that I wasted all this time and I'll be playing catch up for the rest of my life. I wish I could just forget my past and move forward, but it's my past who made me who I am today. I feel fucked beyond repair. I wish I could just change all this but it seems so unrealistic. Like me? Yeah fucking right. You'll never live a happy life. A life you dream of. No no you're just too fucking stupid. 

I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. Is there something wrong with my brain? All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY?

I'm 19 and it feels like my life is slipping away from me. It feels someone else is living my life for me and I'm just observing it. I'm existing and not living at all. I want to stop wasting my life and do something with it but how can I change all this if I don't even know myself or what I want or where to start?

This has been going on for over 6 years now.

All in all I feel like I could change. Through help of a professional or any other options for someone like me. But I feel like I still wouldn't be who I could have been if that makes sense. I have to live with the fact that first 19 years of my life were completely wasted. How I'd have to work so fucking hard to even possibly become who I could have been. And if I chose that path it might be more time wasted. I'd be so busy working on myself and improving myself so I can live my life that I ironically would be missing out on it.

I hate myself so much. I'm so lost and confused I need help"
893,Im so fking mad and irritated without reason,"arghhhh! I am mad at everything and everyone. I blame everyone around me for things that arent even that bad. I dont tell them i blame them but in my mind/head i blame them. Even when simple things happen like when i drop something i get so mad. Even now.. nothing has happened and yet im so angry!  Im frustrated and sad at the same time. It feels like when you havent slept for a long time, you get irritated and sad quickly (atleast for me).

I dont have sleeping issues, on the contruary i sleep great.

Right now my brother watching tv and im so annoyed by the sound. Cant he fking turn the volume down to 0?! Why does he have to be so noisy. The volume isnt high but i just dont want to hear it. Even his presence bothers me. Why cant he just go play outside or something?!

Im irritated by everything. I am 17 years old  and sometimes i wonder why am i even alive. Idc that i dont have reasons to feel this way. I dont care if people miss me if i kill myself. After all its just a world i was placed in which i should be able to leave just as easily. I just hate it all. Everything. Then there are other times when i think, ""how could i ever wondered why im alive? I am going show everyone around me whos boss. I will write my own story and make so many people smile!""

But right now i hate it all. Im angry and i keep brushing my parents and friends off, and my parents they get mad at me. Earlier, i wouldve just gotten into a fight with them simply because i get irritated so badly I CANT STAND IT. Right now i dont even care. So what if theyre angry at me. I dont care anymore. So i just say ""ok"" and they have the last word and then the fight is over.

Sometimes when i walk in a hallway in school, towards my class, the people that walk in front of me annoy me so badly. On that moment it makes me want to choke them. I then imagine me choking them. I know i shouldnt think this badly and i would never really choke them to death, because i do not lack common sense. But i cant help wanting to choke them out of anger.
 On other days on school its the complete opposite. Whenever i see my friends i just have to smile sponatiously because im so happy to see them. 

I think that there might be something wrong with me. Maybe its in my brains or maybe im a psychopath. Somoene else told me that im just ""too spoiled"". Well, i dont get treated very bad but i wouldnt call myself spoiled. 

Please help i dont know what to do anymore. Im so scared to tell anyone. I tried telling my parents but they told me that i was trying to avoid the real problem/ that it wasnt the problem at all. The ""real problem"" was that im just in puberty and that i just lack respect towards others. But theyve been telling me that for 5 years now. Its getting worse. 
Please help me."
894,When I was 15 I was raped by two of my friends...,"It has left a lasting impact that still causes me problems almost 10 years later. I’ve never been able to tell anyone because I feel so much shame. I’m a male too and i woke up and couldn’t move i was in so much pain. They held me down. I don’t know what to do because it’s to the point where I can’t live with the guilt. This isn’t how things were supposed to be. Most days i just feel hopeless and idk if this has contributed to it in addition to a history of mental illness. I’ve had numerous head traumas. I abused drugs for about a year or so very heavily to suppress all of my feelings before i decided to clean up a little and act like things were fine. I just don’t know what to do and struggle to keep going. I see no value in life. A typical four year degree has taken me nearly 8 years due too all my time off and medical withdrawal. Even if I did graduate it’s not like people are looking to hire right now. I have a gf but we’re constantly fighting because of my decisions. I’m just fucking miserable and i don’t know what to do.

TL,dr: I’m extremely depressed from things that have happened. I hate my life and love the chaos in the world going on right now. I wish i could press a redo button."
895,Why am I obsessed with dark things,"I dont know where to post this so I'll do it here

I partly know the answer to this, but theres something I don't understand.
First of all, I tend to seek out dark things whenever I am in a bad state (which is quite often since my life feels like hell) I think this might be a way of coping or expressing my feelings. Dark things make me feel more numb to all those negative thoughts, sometimes a bit happy and relieved, like dark humour.
Theres stuff like murder, which gives me thrill and a sense of excitement, I like stuff like dark music and art and stories sometimes because I like analysing things too.
But then there are things or stories  which just make me feel like shit and ruin me, for example, certain stories of abuse (it's vague because it seems to be and feels kinda random, I can't remember what specifically, just that it happens and the feeling of it). It makes me scared and paranoid yet I cant stop, there are no positives, it destroys me. There are other topics too which have the same result. 
Often times there's things much, much worse that I can watch without batting an eye, but then I can't handle other things.
It's just so much confusion. I feel so close yet so far, My life seems normal outside and no big changes have happend, I think. There are a lot of things I cant remember (how and when it started, what makes me feel this way) so I'm sorry for that, I just want answers, I cant do anything so I just want to know answers.
I dont think I'm squeamish or anything because, as I mentioned before, I'm fine with things much worse, sometimes they make me feel less worse

Sorry if this is all over the place and unstructured, btw"
896,Is it crazy that I wish my mind would just break?,"I recently posted about the mind's response to stress. Sometimes if it gets too bad, your mind steps in to protect itself. It just seems like I'm going through so much and my mind won't step in to protect itself? I should be happy that it isn't too much, right? The thing is, I feel like I'm at my breaking point. It's too much and my mind just won't step in. Does that mean that it's not as bad as it feels for me? Or that my mind is strong, which is something I should celebrate? 

It's just so much. I think about how regular people don't have to have plans A-Z just to get through the day without breaking down. And I wasn't always like this. I used to be a happy kid. I'm 17 and I'm already tired of living. What do I do? I get treated: therapy, prescriptions, etc. I've been hospitalized multiple times. I am starting to feel like I'm beyond healing."
897,Am I too far gone?,"I hate who I've become. I hate feeling this way. I hate thinking this way. I'm sick of doubting myself and everything I say or do. I'm sick of thinking I'm not good enough.

I wish I could just forget my past and move forward, but it's my past who made me who I am today. I feel fucked beyond repair. I wish I could just change all this but it seems so unrealistic. Like me? Yeah fucking right. You'll never live a happy life. A life you dream of. No no you're just too fucking stupid. 

I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. Is there something wrong with my brain? All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY?

I'm 19 and it feels like my life is slipping away from me. It feels someone else is living my life for me and I'm just observing it. I'm existing and not living at all. I want to stop wasting my life and do something with it but how can I change all this if I don't even know myself or what I want or where to start?

This has been going on for over 6 years now.

All in all I feel like I could change. Through help of a professional or any other options for someone like me. But I feel like I still wouldn't be who I could have been if that makes sense. I have to live with the fact that first 19 years of my life were completely wasted. How I'd have to work so fucking hard to even possibly become who I could have been. And if I chose that path it might be more time wasted. I'd be so busy working on myself and improving myself so I can live my life that I ironically would be missing out on it.

I hate myself so much. I'm so lost and confused I need help"

904,My body image.,"Honestly, I don't know how to start this. And to just spill it out on the internet for people I don't know. But there is nobody else to tell these things to. And the last time I posted on this sub during a bad day, it made it easier, so maybe it'll help again. For context, I'm living at home as I'm just 16. 

I was sitting in the dinner table with my family, which in itself is rare.  But I realized, that I was the only one who is at a healthy weight. My father is only slightly overweight, but my mother is obese. 200 pounds, minimum. At just 5'2. My brothers are both overweight. Nobody in my family exercises or eats healthy. 

I am the skinny one. And by skinny I mean I'm normal. (5'8, 145 lbs). But still I feel like shit. I'm all skin, bones and fat. There's no muscle, I can't even do a single push up. Less than 15 sit ups. Only thing I can do well is squats. I walk my dog at least three times a day, so during the day I walk about 10 000 steps. But I'm not happy. My body is still disgusting. I have gained 15 pounds in less than a year. I have no control over what I eat or how much. It's the idea of ""Be thankful that you even have food. There are people starving.""  I'm not ungrateful for it. But I eat way too much. No fruits or vegetables at all. Food my parents cook is always quick, full of carbs and fat. Not nearly enough protein, way too much sugar. And a daily multivitamin won't do it.

All this has made me so disgusted of my own body. I don't want to see myself in the mirror. It's way too fat, jiggly and disgusting. I have scars from multiple eczemas from when I was a kid. I'm always finding new bruises, and not even remembering where or why I got them. My skin is covered in acne, that has spread from my face to my back, chest and upper arms. I can't change my body. If I was to start working out, I would immediately be suspected for having an eating disorder. I understand their worry, as few years back I avoided food at all costs, and worked out to be perfect. But now I just want to be healthy and pretty. I absolutely hate my body, it's just a sign of unhealthy habits. 

I get so many mixed signals from my mom. Either I get ""Why are you eating that"", ""do you really need that"", ""Oh wow somebody is hungry"" or ""That's alot of food, you know?"", ""When I was your age, I was so much lighter than you, but also had bigger boobs"", followed by ""Why are you eating so little?"", ""Eat a bit more!"", ""Omg your wrist is so small, I can put my fingers around it!"" . In a few weeks. It really messes with my head, I don't know what she wants me to be. My body is never good enough, my acne is always ""so bad"" and ""she feels sorry for me"".  Has been for years. I remember getting those comments ever since I was five. I remember being 7, looking in the mirror and just looking at my body, thinking how chubby I was. How bad I looked. I still do. I'm waiting for the day I move out. I could finally have a good body. I can change what I eat and how I work out. 

But at the moment, I just want to rip my body. I want to have a strong, healthy body. But now I'm just so disgustingly fat and unhealthy, with nothing I can do. I just eat what I'm given. If I try to resist and only eat when I'm hungry, my mother forces me to binge with her. I want to break myself into perfection, I want to break every mirror in the house. The way my body looks disgusts me. I can't find a single thing I like about it. I don't want to see myself in the mirror, but still I look at myself everyday, all day. I look at all my flaws that I could change. I want to have a perfect body, maybe then I could get somebody to love me.  It sounds so pathetic, and because I'm young this will just be put on hormones. It might be, but I can't find where the line goes. I truly believe that I could get someone to love me and have a relationship with if my body was more fit. I'd be so pretty, and so much happier. I want to be happy and perfect."
905,"Indoor ""Social"" Activity Idea: Silent Disco Video Chat Party","While living in NY, there were these silent disco things that I'd witness a lot. What are they?

A **silent disco** is an event where you put on a special pair of noise-canceling headphones and gather with others who have done the same. Then, as individuals, you can tune into one or multiple channels of sound, while simultaneously and indirectly combining energies with those around you.

People need to move a little bit and feel good while still have a sense of belonging. Syncing music is tough with connection and everything. Maybe groups of friends can log on and have a Google Hangout or something where everyone can mute their microphones but can still watch friends totally having the time of their lives and just sharing energy. Families, friends, couples, whatever. Go do it. No need to worry about being in the same beat or whatever. Just have fun.

Try to do activities over video chat that's a little more engaging. Having a meal, making art, making music, playing games, etc.

909,Heartbroken,"My grandma raised me for three years (between the ages of 3-6) in Taiwan when my parents couldn't care for me, and in early 2018, my entire family save for my grandmother disowned me. She is basically my only family now. My grandma is in Taiwan and I'm a 21 year old college student in the US. 8 months ago, my grandma was given 6 more months to live due to her medical conditions. Initially the plan was that once she began to decline, I would drop everything (work, school, etc) and immediately fly to her to be with her until the end. Obviously, that isn't going to happen now. I am a Taiwanese citizen, but I can't go to Taiwan because she won't be there anymore at the end of the mandatory 14 day quarantine.

913,"Anybody else actually thriving mentally, during this pandemic?","First, this post isn’t meant to be insensitive, or shame anybody. Second, everybody’s circumstances are different, this is just my situation. 

I’ve been working through depression, anxiety, and a sense of hopelessness for many years.  I saw a therapist on a weekly basis, for a while.

However, since the pandemic crisis started in the US and I started telecommuting last week, I’ve actually been feeling much better mentally.  

Since the stress of my work commute and dealing with a toxic office culture (and toxic colleagues) has been eliminated, I’ve been getting a solid eight hours of sleep every night, I’ve quit smoking, I’ve started jogging and/or exercising everyday, I’m spending quality time with my spouse and dog, and I’m still finding time to get all my work done.  

Oddly enough, I’ve found a certain life balance this last week that I’m liking a lot, despite the fact that the outside world seems to be in free fall. Anybody else feel this way? 

Granted, unlike many other people right now, I have job security, a steady income, and a generally reliable means of getting supplies for the long haul. In that regard I feel very blessed.  If anything, the only things worrying me are the physical and mental health of my extended family, friends, and spouse - but thankfully, they all seem to be doing well too.

Maybe my depression and anxiety stem from a certain kind of agoraphobia or social anxiety I didn’t even realize I had, and this new situation, where I’m actually required to stay home or otherwise be alone, is the sort of “medicine” I needed.

Thoughts?"

917,"Molested by my father as a teen and childhood traumas a killing me from inside, extremely suicidal too","Today I opened my first reddit account only for the sole purpose of sharing my sorrow and how things are killing me from inside. I am a 22 year old female. I have had an extremely rough childhood with a lot of alcohol and violence. Our house smelled like alcohol all the time and it was putrid and atrocious. I have always been an average student in school because I used to emotionally and physically drained by all the chaos at home. Everyday. However, I had my mother's support and she was aware of my condition and she was infact proud of me that I could make it up to this much. But that didn't stop me from getting bullied and insulted by teachers and relatives.
I grew up, overweight and not so pleasant to look at. As a teen, I faced a lot of bullying by my cousins and classmates made fun of me all the time about my appearence and for how socially inept and abnormally quiet I was.

As if these were not enough for a 13 year old girl to bear, that one night I got wrongly touched by my drunk father as I was trying to fall asleep on my bed. I was frozen and could move a muscle as he kept going on with his disgusting activities. Out of embarrassment and out of the fear, I pretended to be asleep. Before this incident took place, there had been other instances where his hands would go on my chest and waist on several occassions but I neglected them and thought they were ""mistakes"". Ofcourse I was young and foolish. Sure my father is alcoholic and throw tantrums at my mother but the idea of a father molesting her very own child was beyond me at that age.

Nothing much is left to say after this. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, manic depression, acute misophonia and misokinesia. Regarding misophonia and misokinesia, I particularly get furious at certain sounds and movements that my father make because my trauma is rooted from him and then it spiked towards my brother as well. My case is acute and I get extremely violent by those triggers. So anyway, as I am growing older, these horrors are getting more embedded with me and I am afraid that it will drive me insane one day. I get nervous breakdowns out of nowhere. My sex life with my boyfriend is at stake because everytime I let him touch my body, I get traumatic flashbacks and then I am unable to continue with it. I can't explain him why. I am sensitive about this past of my and fear that he wouldn't understand. My mental condition is aggravating and it is affecting my daily activities. I have also attempted suicide 2 years back and now I don't even have the courage to do that. I just feel trapped inside an unwanted body and emotionally drained. Moreover, I love my mother so much. She has sacrificed a lot for me and I dread to inflict such torture on her. I am in so much pain right now and I don't know what to do. Will I ever be able to pursue my career or anything at all? Will I ever be healed? I don't know."
918,Anxiety and COVID-19: What to Do,"Once again, I have felt compelled to write about mental health, basing what I write on my own experiences in dealing with OCD and anxiety. This topic is especially prevalent now that the COVID-19 pandemic has reached America, causing Americans to feel more anxious on a day-to-day basis. This means that those who have preexisting issues with anxiety are now in double trouble, and that those who do not have preexisting issues are now facing a new monster in anxiety. So, what should people do?

1.  Face it:

When it comes to dealing with anxiety, one of the worst things a person can do is deny that it is an issue. Anxiety, like many other mental issues, feeds off of one’s denial. Denial allows anxiety to sneak into the psyche and nest there without a person even realizing it. This is why it is so imperative to face the beast that is anxiety. If one spends their time denying its existence or worrying about when their next panic attack is going to come, the affect will be much worse than if one confronts it. Confronting anxiety can take many forms, and since I am not a doctor I will not even attempt to prescribe a specific solution, especially since there seems to be no universal fix. However, by confronting it one can learn how to draw on the energy of anxiety. Anxiety is not an inherently bad thing. It can drive people to study, start projects, or do many other necessary activities. By facing your anxiety and learning how to draw on its energy, you may not only rid yourself of the issues that result from an anxiety disorder, but also make yourself a more active person. Confront your anxiety and find your solution.

2.  Fight:

Have you ever read the Hobbit? In this book the main character, Bilbo, travels across his world in order to find an ancient treasure. When he comes to the cave where the treasure is hidden, there is an evil dragon that is guarding the treasure and Bilbo and his companions must face and fight the dragon in order to get the treasure. Why is this relevant to the topic of anxiety? Just like the dragon, anxiety can be a monster. However, beneath it is the treasure of peace. But you can never get the treasure without fighting the monster. Often times people think that dealing with their anxiety will be a matter of simply relaxing or going to counseling or getting medicated. This is incorrect. You have to literally fight it. As with all good things in life, you must struggle to attain them, just like Bilbo had to struggle against the dragon. Once you face it and fight it you will discover that it is not a great beast, but merely a hallow reflection of one. You must fight the monster in order to get the treasure.

3.  Socialize:

Although we are being told to socially isolate ourselves, it is extremely important to keep in touch with friends and family. Just like when one avoids anxiety, isolating oneself causes the effects of anxiety to feel much worse. Going back to the analogy of the Hobbit, Bilbo did not face and fight the dragon alone. He had help from friends, and a magic ring, and although this sounds silly it is immensely important. No one can fight a monster alone. Everyone needs help and no one should feel ashamed of needing help. In fact, the shame that stems from feeling like you need help is actually a by-product of anxiety because it knows that once you get help, its days are numbered. It will try to tell you that you are weak or that people will think you are strange. It is lying. Socialize with people so that you do not have to face the monster yourself.

4.  Find an anchor:

As I am sure everyone knows, ships have anchors so that they can maintain their position when waves are attempting to move it. Anxiety is much like these waves. It will try to move you out of reality and into its delusional and chaotic world. This is why one suffering from anxiety must find some kind of anchor in reality. For me, it was my parents. When I dealt with anxiety I knew that if I was ever straying too far from reality that I could be brought back down to earth by calling my parents who would remind me of exactly what it was the anxiety was trying to do, which was take away my sense and create chaos. One must find their own anchor, but whatever it is make sure that it is steady and strong and truthful. 

 In closing, I would like to say that in no way, shape, or form am I an expert on this topic. Everything I have written today is based on my own experience or on books and articles I have read (most of which have been written by Jordan Petersen, Robert Moore, or Carl Jung). Everyone must do their own research on this topic. There is no universal fix to anxiety, and people must find what works for them as at the end of the day they are the ones who must ultimately face it. But remember, while it may seem like anxiety is a great big beast, it is actually a hallow reflection of one, and you as well as your support system are much stronger than anxiety could ever be. Good luck!"
919,Snapchat Accelerates Debut Of Mental Health Initiative,
920,What mental illness does this sound like?,"Disclaimer - I understand that the only person who can diagnose you with a mental illness is a mental health care professional. I’m purely wondering what illnesses to look into to help narrow out wildly inaccurate ones. 

I am a 17 year old female. My family life is fine, in fact, I cause most of the trouble. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, but it doesn’t quite explain everything. I also have an anxiety disorder and depression.

Im prone to extreme bouts of anger. As in, threatening murder, throwing things, screaming. It’s basically a toddler tantrum but more violent. It’s triggered by the smallest things. (ex. my sister dried out my makeup wipes and i broke down for hours.) I initially got upset over the makeup wipes, leading to wildly irrational thoughts and contemplating my life as a whole. 

I suffer from a lot of intrusive thoughts. These can go anywhere from “you could just start making monkey noises in the middle of the grocery store, what can anyone do about it?” to “your entire family could die in an accident leaving you helpless.” They effect the quality of my life tremendously. 

Im extremely codependent, as well as having an intense fear of abandonment. Anyone who has ever “left me” I have become obsessed with mentally. Sometimes I try to emulate them, other times I just social media stalk them a little too extensively. I don’t ever try to contact these people, just that. 

I often dissociate , or have moments of derealization. Sometimes it happens at the same time and I genuinely feel like nothing is real. 

I have an extremely unorganized headspace, and I feel like I have too many thoughts. I can often be going on 3 rants simultaneously that can last HOURS, trying to think my concious thoughts, while also having intrusive thoughts, while also thinking about the future and past at the exact same time. Its complete cacophony inside my head, almost constantly. All of the “voices” are my own. 

I also have trouble empathizing, but its not impossible. Just hard. 

Ive written a novel here, so hopefully this gives some insight, but I would be so appreciative if anyone could point me in the right direction."

5. Materials which will produce the signs and symptoms of recognized diseases in a reversible way so that they may be used for malingering, etc.

6. Materials which will render the induction of hypnosis easier or otherwise enhance its usefulness.

7. Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion during interrogation and so-called “brain-washing”.

12. Substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tendency of the recipient to become dependent upon another person is enhanced.

13. A material which will cause mental confusion of such a type that the individual under its influence will find it difficult to maintain a fabrication under questioning.

Don't these sound like some of the ""side affects"" of the drugs your psychiatrist might give you?

The majority of the population has been brainwashed into thinking that psychiatrists are trying to help, and that anyone who finds out the truth is mentally ill.

If I was admitted into a mental hospital for knowing the truth I'm sure they'd either kill me or essentially give me a chemical lobotomy to keep me from spreading this important information.

929,My grandmother passed a few days ago and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel or react..,"A few days ago my grandmother was taken to the hospital, sadly she passed away the next day.
I love her, I miss her, she was like a mother to me for a huge part of my life, and I regret never finding the words or actions to show her how thankful I am.

My problem is.. that i don't feel like I can cry, I have she'd a couple tears here and there but I feel unable to allow myself to feel anything. I want to believe I'm sad, I keep telling myself maybe I'm just in shock. But idk.. why is it that everyone else who comes and gives us their condolences can just flood a room in tears yet I'm beating myself up because I'm not even sure what I'm feeling.

Honestly the past two years have been very traumatic to me, I have alot of pent up emotions, mostly sadness. The past two years when I feel the emotions escaping and tears building up, I've been telling myself man up, suck it up, stay strong, you can't break down now.. and now that I'm allowed to cry I can't, and Instead of crying about my grandmother I'm more interested in myself.."
930,How do you grant yourself permission to be happy in spite of tragedy?,"I feel affected by recent events mentally via feeling like the world is suffering from social distancing, gym closures, and death thus impacting the potential greatness of what each and everyone of us could be.

I’ve determined an issue I’m experiencing mentally is allowing myself to be happy when I feel other people may be suffering, or I may be judged for living a vibrant and happy life during this time.

If you have had similar feelings how do you move past these or “defuse from them” (as in ACT therapy, meaning tune them out and only selectively tune in what’s helpful), regardless of people being happy or not; and without use of distractions like gaming or work which are only temporary scenarios of engagement for refocus. Do I need to view greater happiness of others doing this time to help change my brain, and then steer more clear of the news? I think I need to somehow move past feelings like the govts that be don’t want us to be happy and want us to live in fear to help contain this incident.

931,I don't know how to talk to people.,"I find it so hard being around people, I just constantly feel like they're judging me. In school, I'll walk around the halls 3 or 4 times until I know some of my friends will be out of lesson so that I don't look like a loner.
I never know what to say or how to talk to people without looking like an idiot.


And then there's that specific person, because of course there is. And he's amazing, and I'd do anything in the world for him to realise how much I care about him. Yet, I don't know how to start conversations with him, or carry them on. He called me today and I just didn't say anything until he told me to hang up, I wanted to say something I really did I just didn't know how or even what to say. It just hurts because I care about him so so much and I don't want to ruin things with him again because I don't know how to function. Its happened before, we dated for about a week and I couldn't bring myself to talk to him until he ended it. It's sometimes like I can't physically bring myself to talk to him or text him because I'm so scared he'll think I'm an idiot or hate me but I know not talking is going to make that worse. I just don't know what to do."

I feel like I am failing my family by following a dream that is practically unattainable. A music career. I’ve made music for 13 years and still had no real financial stability. I’ve worked in jobs I’ve hated most of my life apart from the last job I did. That came to a sudden end. I’m really struggling now and don’t know what to do.

934,Toxic side of myself I NEED to get in control of,"Don’t have access to a therapist rn because of COVID-19 so I’m gonna give reddit a try because there’s actually some really smart and nice ppl on here, and I rly need help! 

Ok so I’m a 17 year old bisexual male and I dated a guy in the summer, who I was really in love with. He showed me A LOT of attention which was rly new to me considering my past girlfriends haven’t rly cared for me in the same way. 

I feel like that attention all kind of went to my head because I began to crave it. I craved the adrenaline that came out of being needed by someone. I started to lose feelings near the end of the summer, and I had no idea why, but looking back on it now, I feel like it’s because I started getting less attention and eventually got bored. 

I KNOW that sounds really bad, but I had no idea what was causing me to feel that way at the time, and now that I do, I don’t feel good abt it. I broke up with him, not only because of this though! This wasn’t rly a normal relationship because after I ended it, he texted me like three weeks later and tried to get me back, and though I was kind of into it, I played hard to get because of the rush that came out of being needed by someone that I don’t necessarily need. We’ve been on and off like 5 times in the past year and now we’re just friends but time to time he flirts w me and I play hard to get again, except this time I’m not actually into it. We always talk and I find myself always talking down on him to make myself feel better. 

I don’t want to keep doing this, I ONLY do this with him. I’m not a bad person, but I lose all control of my judgement and feelings when I talk to him. And I’m sitting here ashamed, I rly don’t want to be this person, but I’ve started resenting him, he bothers me when he doesn’t even do anything. And one minute I rly want to talk to him, and the next I’m mad for no reason. This is the first this has ever happened to me. Plz give me some advice. I know I sound toxic and like a bad person. I kept convincing myself that I’m better off without him, but the reality is, I’m the only one with a problem and I’m clueless... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO MAN! It’s bringing me into constant anxiety and depression."

936,Proud mother,"I need some advice with my proud mother. She has a tendency to be inconsiderate of my feelings and boundaries even though I tell her repeatedly that it hurts my feels. She interrupts me whether we're with family or alone if I make a grammatical mistake while telling a story and goes on to give me a lesson on why I'm wrong and what I do is wrong, even in front of family (we have a rocky relationship). I have anxiety so this causes my to shake, feel nauseous, lose appetite and have a tiny panic attack. When she does this it embarrasses me and hurts my self esteem as well as my own pride. She has done this for as long as I can remember and when I tell her to stop in a polite manner she seems to forget it the next time it happens (I only started correcting her after I became about 20, now 22). Also whenever this happens in front of family no one says a thing and the room becomes filled with an uncomfortable silence. Even my father won't take my side. I once had a mental breakdown because of it. It is so frustrating and I feel like I'm running out of options and energy to the point where I'm considering moving out ASAP. I hate to be in this position, and I'm not in the financial place to move because my mother tells me to not get a job because of my studies therefore leaving me only with my parents financial support, which they like to remind me of...

940,Depression,"Let me start by saying, I know I sound like the everyday teenager who thinks they have depression.
Although for me I think it's real. I have lived in an abusive household (physical on many occasions but also constant verbal abuse and emotional abuse) for my entire life and I despise my father to the point where I never want to see him again in my life. I have no friends. My brother is just amazing at everything, he has loads of friends, he is extremely clever, he is happy, has a girlfriend and just enjoys life. He always goes to parties and is talking to his friends on discord calls at home. And then there's me, no friends, good grades but not as good as his, depressed, angry and unhappy all the time. I hate my life at home because of my dad and I hate school. My brother hardly any speaks to me and doesn't really want much to do with me at all. I have no enjoyment in life anymore. My happiness has just degraded over the years. My mum says how I used to be a lovely, happy child when I was very young. Then my happiness turned to anger as I grew up and then after counselling at age 12-13 I was less angry, but still quite angry. The only positive aspect of my life right now is my mum as she is always there for me. I have contemplated suicide several times but I have never come close to doing it. The only thing which is stopping me from suicide is my mum; I would never commit suicide as I wouldn't abandon her, she is always here for me. I tried going to the gym and it improved my happiness a tiny bit, and only for a brief period after exercising. I hate sports so they are out of the question. I just spend all my time playing video games on my own and feeling depressed and angry.

There wasn't really much point in this, I just wanted to express my feelings"

943,not sure if this exists,"is there some sort of medication that would essentially dilute over-thinking? or dilute most senses of feeling? 

i'm (20s) struggling with life and i feel that most of it stems from over thinking. 

example: what if i never find someone who will love me? what if i do end up finding them, we get married, and have kids, then they decide that they want a divorce and want to take the kids. how will i continue to live knowing that the person i married stopped loving me? did they ever care to begin with? was i just a convenient option?

after every relationship i have ends and i essentially think like this. 

i know i shouldn't be thinking ahead like this, but i truly don't know how to turn it off. how can i stop it from affecting me. it always gets me into thinking about suicide and each time it get worse and worse. i just want it all to stop

I haven’t test positive for covid19 yet , I had synthoms that according to the medical staff was just “rino laringitis” (sorry I don’t know the exact word on English for the diagnosis ) and im feeling overwhealming for what’s happening right know, I’m in fear to get sick (I’m 27m with no pre medical condition) and affect my mom and my grandma, I’m working on a callcenter right know for a well know airline and the fact that the streets are becoming alone and that I’m working on a night shift made me think too much. today I started to cry because im getting fear about everything collapses or everyone I love would die for something that looks that came out from a sci fi movie. I know both my mom and grandma needs me and the people that is trying to return homes on a plane need me to but I’m feeling really bad with no hope. What’s your advice."
948,Is it messed to think that I’m possibly autistic?,"I don’t want to sound like a self-diagnoser here, but after years of denial I think there might be a slight possibility of me being on the spectrum. 

I never talk about it because I feel like it would be embarrassing to constantly self-diagnose and not actually have anything. My sister keeps claiming that she’s on the spectrum and that it makes her special and an advancement in the gene pool, even though her therapist says she isn’t. I don’t think she has it, but everyone in my family thinks that my dad does. 

I can’t even manage to coherently list all of my symptoms into one post, but I’ll just knock out the major issues I’ve been dealing with:

- Hypersensitive hearing: I’ve always dealt with tinnitus-like symptoms my whole life, where I would hear a hum in my ears without there being any actual sound. I thought it was normal growing up, but it turns out you’re not supposed to hear anything in complete silence. Even though I’m a bad musician, I have perfect pitch and can identify notes/chords without a reference (sorry if that sounds snobby). 

- Very poor social skills/behavior: I was very annoying as a kid and wouldn’t speak with a filter or stop talking. If someone asked me a question I would completely ignore the question and start talking about something completely random like Star Wars. I’m silent nowadays, but I have to fight myself to not say anything cringy or stupid, because sometimes I’ll just blurt it out. 

- Weird obsessions/hyperfixation: I have a lot of weird obsessions that I don’t talk about with anyone. I have an obsession with memorizing dates. I can remember my whole childhood based on the exact dates of when I saw a YouTube video that was published that day. I can remember what I did that day, what I ate, etc. There are a lot more weird obsessions that I have, but they’re a little too embarrassing to share. 

- Random tics: I have very strange tics that occur at random times. My neck will twitch every 20 seconds when I’m stressed out. When I’m alone and remember something embarrassing/bad, I find myself uncontrollably blurting out very offensive slurs and hitting myself or something near me. I’ve never done anything in public, but I’m afraid that if I’m rubbed the wrong way it will slip out. 

I’ve stained a lot of my past social encounters by acting weird. Everyone would make fun of me because of it. The only time I mentioned the possibility of having autism was with my friends back in high school. When I asked them, they all said that they’re definitely sure that I have it. 

I don’t know how to feel. I don’t have any access to get help. My sister had to pay for her own therapist. Even if I did, I’d look like a huge asshat if I walked into a therapy session expecting a certain diagnosis. 

Is it messed up to think that I’m autistic? What do I do?"
949,Trapped and addicted,"I feel so alone in this place. I’m sure no one will see or care but if by any small chance you do, thank you. quite frankly I have no one else. I’m all alone. I feel so trapped. I’m so trapped. I can’t leave this place as much as I want to. I don’t have anyone to feed my cat and I don’t want to make anything else suffer because of my mistakes and inability to get better. 


Shit never gets better. It doesn’t ever feel like it will. I’m alone and I’m sure that’s how it will stay for a long time. The world doesn’t need me I know this I’m not anymore special then the person next to me. I’m not even sure how many people would miss me. I have so much I want to say but I just can’t i don’t know why. No one gives a shit about me. They never did. 

I don’t wanna die, i don’t wanna die. I just wanna feel better."
950,Does anyone know of any mental illnesses that match the things I’m feeling?,"Heya there. I’m a 13 year old girl, and recently I’ve been having some problems.

My mom is very mentally ill, and an alcoholic. I watched her physically abuse and emotionally abuse my dad for about 5 years, before she ended up in jail and my dad finally filed for divorce.

I have pretty severe trichotillomania, and about 3 months ago, I started self harming.

In the past month or two, I’ve been feeling pretty bad. I feel guilty, sad, and sometimes I even have suicidal thoughts and have the urge to hurt myself. The thing is, it’s off and on. Sometimes in the middle of the day something will just cause me to feel like this, and I’ll feel like that for an hour or two, and then go back to my normal smiling and laughing self.

I’ve asked some of my online friends about mental illnesses that maybe would fit these characteristics, because what I’ve been told, it’s not necessarily normal.

Here are some more things that I noticed;

•My jaw suddenly will start chattering when I’m anxious or stressed

•My body will start to feel sickly

•I commonly think about how people would react to my suicide, and come up with whole scenarios in my head

•I have lost a lot of motivation (to draw, to play video games, etc)

•Occasionally I will get very strong urges to hurt myself

•I feel useless, worthless, like a waste of space, and things along that line

•My mood can change pretty quickly

•I feel like the people around me would do just the same, if not better if I was gone/dead

I’m not asking for a diagnosis, just please tell me if you know anything that would fit those characteristics.
Thanks!"
951,What do I do,[removed]
952,Im Evil,I purposely do things to destroy relationships or friendships. I purposely hurt people who are my friends cause Ive created this villain persona that is me which helps me deal with my anxiety and depression. When I drink I attack others.  I dont want to admit I have a drinking problem cause that would make me weak. Sometimes online I attack people I don't know cause i find that its easier to get negative responses then positive ones. Im almost 30 now and this is something ive done for all of my 20s. Now I have nothing and nobody left. Ive pushed everyone away. This villian persona  is all I know and I dont know how to change.
953,I was depressed with the same monotonous days I had. Now I’m scared. Watching the news as this storm unfolds.,
954,Spanking 2 Cope?,"This is my first post on reddit ever so bare with me.
I suffer from mood disorder, depression, and anxiety.
I take meds to help deal with my conditions.
I got pregnant with my daughter last February and weaned off the meds for my baby girl in the womb
Let me tell you I suffered immensely mentally and emotionally. My doctor retired and I have been off my meds till I can find a new doctor. ( I have an upcoming appointment in a few weeks)
During this time my husband decided it will be a good time to cheat. [A whole different story]
We are working on our marriage and it's hard but hes literally doing everything he can to make it right.
As a result of his cheating our sex life has changed.
[Readers, I am going somewhere with this so stay with me...]
I take care of everything in our house hold including our kids. It's a huge burden. I make sure we always have food, clean clothes, and a roof over my head. I am the head of the home, my husband, not so much. 
But in bed my husband takes over. It's the only time I can give in and have my needs taken care of. It's the only time my husband feels in control, like a provider.
I am a submissive, my husband a dominant.
It works for us. I find spanking sexually pleasurable UNTIL I found out he spanked his other woman too. He called her his sub. 
So naturally that died and I no longer found it sexually pleasing...
Instead, I found myself hurting extra mentally and emotionally one night and asked him to revert back to our old ways to see if it will make me feel better, he did and instead I found myself wanting more pain, and felt no pleasure. 
I didnt tell him right away, but I asked for it harder and more pain. I needed pain. I wanted to hurt outside as much as I hurt inside. I needed it. 
When I told my husband he said doesnt want to anymore cause he doesnt to hurt me but I need the pain.

Also, should mention I'm a cutter. Have been for over 16 years. I try to stop and do good, but sometimes I fall off the wagon and cut so idk if it's because I'm coping and using spanking cause I dont wanna cut?

I tried to google using spanking as a coping mechanism but all I get is how spanking affects kids.

Any input will be appreciated."

956,Struggling with psychosomatic symptoms,"Heya, I'm 16, and imma start w a lil synopsis. Raped by stepbro, his friend, his friends dad, numerous strangers, and my grandfather. Beaten bloody and literally tortured by stepmom, dad, and grandmother. All this abuse stopped at age 10-11, only people still in my life is my dad and grandmother (kinda). I'm diagnosed with PTSD, MDD, GAD, insomnia, and bulimia. I have reasonable suspicion I have a personality disorder due to how I interact with people, especially those close to me. I also have reasonable suspicion that I have POTS, the fucky nervous system thing, because if I stand too long my legs turn purple and cold, I have horrendous circulation, and showering or even light jogging raises my hr to 180+, it usually rests at 110. 

My life took a big turn, my dad works in a nursing home on the covid floor and my mother is definitely immunocompromised. Shes my third mom but the only one who treats me like a person. Plus, she lost her health benefits bc she wasnt able to turn paperwork in on time, which is shitty. My grandmother lost her job, which means she is staying with us for a month or two. Now, my father has changed quite a lot in the past 5-6 years, and seeing him every day and working on getting over my fear of him brought me to the point I am now, where I'm not afraid. But my grandmother has not changed, she isnt allowed to beat us but prolly would if she could. She lifted her dog off the ground by the scruff of his neck, genuinely threw him into the dog cage, and slapped him hard numerous times. He's 14 months old. She is very unpredictable and is homophobic (literally half of my house is bi but she doesnt know, she only knows I am). Anyway!

So my physical symptoms are lethargy and fatigue, muscle weakness, cold sweats, twitches, and complete inability to sleep. I mean I took 2 doses of tylenol PM (benadryl+tylenol) and only got 3 hours, without it or with one dose I get none. I cant walk up or down steps without feeling out of breath, and walking up my muscles protest as if I had just ran a half marathon. My chest kind of feels like its caving in, not like the bones or whatever but idk how to describe it. 

I'm on 225mg Effexor and a starter dose of Welbutrin. Effexor really helps my anxiety and PTSD but even that isnt cutting it lately. Is there some way I can treat this, or anything? I dont see my psychiatrist till May."
957,I’m so scared I will never be able to get back to my life (RANT),"So I’m gonna start with I have been mentally unwell for a while, but things had started to get worse when I moved from home about a year and a half ago. Suicidal ideation almost everyday, sleeping all the time, wasn’t taking care of myself. It was bad. But then I started seeing a therapist and got on meds, and things really started to turn around ! I was being more active, had a good job, didn’t even think about hurting myself, things were going good! 

Well then September 13th happened. That was the day I found out I had a brain tumor and needed surgery that week. I had to uproot this life I had worked so hard for and go back home to live with my parents. Surgery and recovery went and are going fairly well, but life is still so weird. My dad is constantly stressed and over bearing to me when I’m at his house, which just stresses me out more. And it’s only been getting worse recently, and I know it’s out of love but geez it’s suffocating. My mom is better but it’s still weird when I’m over there , because she lives in a motel and has been having a lot of financial problems, as well as she is a recently recovering alcoholic. Which has caused some stressful situations since I’ve been home. But even all this was okay, my treatments are getting close to being done and I was on track to move back to the city by August. 

And then the damn corona virus happened. My dad has gotten even more over bearing since I’m high risk, my moms not allowed back to her job since she coughed, and I just feel hopeless. It’s starting to feel like I’m never going to get my life back. Like things got better just to get so much worse. The only thing that makes this better is I’m happy that I get to be with my mom , because the thought of her alone, stuck in a motel in the middle of this makes my heart break because she deserves so much. And I know my dad is happy I’m home so he can make sure I’m alright. But I just miss being normal. I’m only 22 and I don’t get to go out and see friends, I don’t get to work, I don’t get to do so many small things I took for granted and I just want my life back. I’m just so scared things will never be normal again. I don’t know, I just needed to rant because I’m quite frankly scared and just don’t know what to do.

Mods please feel free to remove if this post is out of line for this sub. I am posting this as I feel I need some answers as her PTSD behaviours leave me feeling very anxious myself when I can’t solve them..

My girlfriend is amazing! She’s lived through many sexual and physical, mental traumas and is a beaming ray of sunshine and mine and many others’ lives. 

However, she’s fainted most of her life - since she was a little kid. She recently got checked out and doctors sort of shrugged their shoulders and said try to avoid things that make you faint and put your legs up if you feel it coming - this doesn’t really help us rather than manage it. You cannot always avoid situations and you can’t always put your legs up!!

Some words I’ve heard she relayed to me are vasovagal syncope and vagus nerve. Unsure if these will help - she was hooked up to a heart monitor for a few days but nothing conclusive came back based on results. 

Fellow Redditors who have experienced traumas and/or live with anxiety; have you faced fainting due to anxiety or stress? What do you to manage it? How have you gotten medical professionals to acknowledge this and treat it properly? Note we are within the Canadian healthcare system."
959,Coronavirus sadness,I’m super sad because of all this. My university went online for the rest of the semester and I feel kinda lonely and sad. Anyone else feel like this? Im also sad because it feels like the world is ending and this doesn’t help my depression
960,I can't do this,Sometimes the silence is too much for me. I can't take it. It's so loud. Someone help me.
961,Is it bad that I'm indifferent towards people dying?,"Ever since I was a kid, I've never cared much when humans die. I cry if one of my pets dies, but when my baby nephew died when I was a kid I just didn't care. Now today, my grandma died, and I am once again indifferent. I don't know why I dont care, but I just don't. Is that bad?"
962,Vent from tonight,"# I just almost had a meltdown and prevented the crying by venting in my notes app. If you read/comment, thank you. I really appreciate any attention this gets. I just needed to put my feelings out there. If you feel the same things I do, don't be afraid to reach out. I'd love to talk about it and hear that I'm not alone in this. 

# So here it is: 

I feel another episode coming on but I'm back home so I have to keep it under control.

I don't feel like I can let out my emotions here. I can't cry and scream like I can in my own place. It doesn't feel safe here. I'm not sure why and I'm hoping continued therapy can help me figure out why.

Right now I just started thinking again and it just feels like another episode like the other night is coming on.

I started by thinking about my transition. I was working through a situation in my head where I confront my parents about their support once I'm 6 months on hormones whichis coming up soon, I think. Should be April 29th I'm pretty sure. Yeah, April 29th is 6 months on. BUt anyways I was thinking about that and got overcome with emotion because transitioning is hard enough with a supportive family and I know we still have a ways to go before we get to 'supportive'.

Anyway then I went to brush my teeth and get ready for bed so I could focus on not crying.

I came back to my room and started thinking about it again and then the self doubt came in. Maybe I'm just a lesbian - except that I don't date women, so maybe I'm just a tomboy but I've always been feminine. 

And then I started thinking about the most upsetting thing which is a lack of continuity that I feel with everything that's happened to me in my life. It's like I know that I'm the same person, or I think I am, but I'm never sure and it doesn't feel like I'm the same. Then I get to panicking because I start questioning reality and I have no sense of self and it's really disturbing and scary to think about. It's like my entire life I've felt like a secondhand observer of what's going on but then the more I think about it the more layers and observers there are and it it starts getting scary and not making sense. I've pretty much deeply convinced myself since I was a small child that nothing is real and therefore it doesn't matter. Now I'm still alive and still not quite all there and it's getting more and more scary and disturbing to realize that. It's almost an existential crisis but in a way it's kind of opposite because I'm not contemplating the vastness of the outside universe but rather contemplating the intricacies of my 'self', whatever that means, and whether or not it or I even exist, not to mention the wierd confusing body aspect. I'm just a bundle of confusion and the more I think, the fewer actual convictions I have. I used to try to figure out things about myself by making statements in my head or out loud and guaging how truthful I felt when saying them, until I discovered I didn't feel any different when I was lying. I then got scared that I was a psychopath, but reasoned that if I were, I wouldn't be scared of being one. 

I have so much more going on than I can ever really get to in one go. And I'm sure theres more to add to this but now I'm just tired. It's a good thing I can type nearly as fast as I think otherwise this would not be a good way to record whats troubling me. Writing this by hand would be hell. Video is best, provided I'm not crying too much to understand, but in this house I don't feel comfortable doing that.

I don't want my parent's to talk to me about any of this. I just want to be left alone and not questioned but I can't tell them that because then I'm going to get a lecture on how they either deserve to know or I need to tell them or some bull like that. If I get into family problems now though I'll never stop writing so I'm going to stop now, maybe post this somewhere, I don't know. 

Anyway, this is me signing off for now even though I haven't let everything out. 

Good night."
963,"Always agitated, stressed, and anxious","I more often than not have this horrible stressed feeling in my body, like just permeating through my skin

It's my default state of existence and it's terrible. I never really enjoy things in this state or feel like doing anything cause it's just this horrible feeling that's like suffering incarnated. It doesn't even feel like there's a reason other than the world sucks and I got the short end of everything

Help?"
964,life falling apart,"I'm really struggling right now. it feels like nothing is going right in my life and every time I try and leave my job my new job falls through or something happens and I end up stuck there and I hate it. this has happened three times now and I'm begining to think there's no hope.

I'm in a long distance relationship and I just feel jealous and anxious all the time, even though I'm doing my best to cover up these feelings. it makes me really sad when she chooses to play games over spend time with me, and I wouldn't expect her to chose me even though I would chose her over anything and it hurts sometimes knowing I don't have the same value. I live her so much and I know she loves me and we have big plans for the future and everything but I just feel so mentally unstable and jealous and it's really stupid. 

at this moment in time I can barely go a few days without having a complete breakdown and I don't know if my antidepressants are working or not because sometimes it feels like they are, but then other days I'm rapidly crashing and my world is falling apartm

I finally stopped self harming in January, but so many things are screaming at me to start again and it's he only thing that keeps me grounded and clear minded.

I'm lost and I don't know what to do. do I tell a doctor???? I'm so fucked 

I'm in antidepressants and waiting for therapy but I've been waiting over a year for help and still.nothing. I've tried other stuff to try and fix me but nothing works"
965,Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner,"﻿If you’re a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for “asking for it.” I recall reading a book called “Can’t Buy My Love” that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria’s Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too “uneducated” to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I’m sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn’t how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a “love bombing” or “golden period” that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I’ve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they’ve been through it themselves."
966,A year since my last suicide attempt! 3 months since I last cut!,I've been through a lot of abuse and after killing my dad my mental health went downhill a lot... After going to my first choice college and getting my GED and a wonderful girlfriend I am self hard sober!!!
967,Bipolar Rage,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and one thing I'm really struggling with is rage/seeing red. Once it starts, I can't calm down. When it's bad enough, I black out. I'm scared it'll progress to violence...What do I do when I get angry? I don't want to be like this."
968,question for anyone that's admitted themselves to a psychiatric hospital,"so am I just like able to call/walk in like ""hey im fucked up and need immediate help before I do something really stupid""??? their website says the place ""provides crisis screening and assessment services as well as Crisis Residential Services (Crisis Stabilization) and Mobile Crisis Services (Crisis Intervention Services). Generally, a health plan’s access/service authorization department makes a referral to our local office"".  does that mean I need a referral? im confused and not okay and might have to go some time soon but idk how any of this works"
969,I don’t know what’s going on with me,"This is my first post so please understand. I have been feeling incredibly depressed, angry, and suicidal. I haven’t thought about how I’d do it or anything like that but I think every day how I wish my life was different or how it would be if I wasn’t alive anymore. I’ve become numb and can’t focus on my passions which is music making. That makes me feel even worse and I feel worthless. Nothing in life is worth living for at this point. I feel so trapped in my situation, disappointed in myself and my life, and disappointed in my parents who I live with. They were very verbally and emotionally abusive growing up, as they are both narcissistic. I moved back with them a couple of months ago due to hardship and I’ve been getting triggered by them since. I clearly have a lot of pain and trauma, as well as resentment left inside of me even though I’ve seen two therapists. I feel hopeless that I will feel better. Can someone please shine a light into my life? I am bawling my eyes out because I don’t understand how to make myself feel better."
970,My graduation ceremony is cancelled,"I’ve had a long road of trying to complete my masters degree while dealing with mental health issues. I’m years late, but I finally was approached to graduate this semester. I’ll be the first person in my family to ever get a masters degree. Today I found out that my graduation ceremony/ convocation was cancelled because of COVID19. The school says we can join fall convocation which is good of them and that everyone will still graduate this semester (get their piece of paper). Yet I can’t help feeling sad and disappointed. It just doesn’t feel the same and I’m heartbroken."
971,Statewide Lockdown..,If youre not crying because you cant work and get money. Youre nit human. If you feel something for them who work youre partial human. We are going ri find out who is a real human and who is just there
972,I’m obsolete,"Life and time have passed me by. I’m going to be 21 next Thursday and all I’ve been thinking is that I’m obsolete. Eventually everyone will realize that and throw me away. I’m not even scared anymore. I just wish it would happen soon, so I could not feel guilty about wanting to hurt myself to an extreme degree. I’m useless in modern times. I wish I just faded away years ago, so it would have happened when I had worth. But it will happen soon enough, and I can’t wait until everyone forgets about me so I can finally get rid of myself without fear of disappointment and failure."
973,Learning about history is affecting me greatly,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to talk about something like this, but I figured mental health is a really broad term, so I might as well. My question today is, how do I stop letting history (as in human history, wars etc) stop emotionally affecting me so much? Whenever I read about history, and the horrible things people have done to each other, I feel physically sick, and it’s hard to function at that point. I’m a history major (not really my choice), so I have to read up these fascinating but sometimes awful events that’s happened in the past. And it’s not like I have a choice to read it or not, I have to for my classes. How do I get over my feelings? Thank you for reading. Any advice or even relation is very much appreciated! ♡"
974,"I'm feeling really guilty, and have been for the past week.","I work in a grocery store, so I can't work remotely, and I have to be there. I'm so worried that I could be unknowingly transferring it to my older customers. I'm feeling healthy, and well, but I'm a young person with no health problems, so I could have it, and I could just be giving it to everyone in my store. 


And I've had to get mean with my customers, too. I've had to raise my voice to make sure everyone isn't crowding stock, because one person will try to buy too much so that not everyone has a chance to get things like toilet paper and bread. I've been exhausting myself trying to fill empty shelves, and while doing so, I've been getting in people's way and making them wait, because staple foods like rice and beans really needed to go out, because it kills me knowing folks might go hungry if I don't work hard enough. 


I know this is all very minor stuff, especially because there's people working on the front lines dealing with medical care, but the whole thing is fucking me up. I feel like there's just no winning here."
975,Recent trauma memories have resurfaced,"So, when I was younger ( about 8 or 9) I was molested repeatedly by my cousin, who was only a year older than me. And for awhile, I just pretended it was a dream (as I don't remember most of my childhood so it all feels like a dream) and most of my family acts like it didn't happen. I understand now that it did in fact happen even if my family pretends that it didn't.
Im just not yet ready to fully accept that it happened as I'm not fully equipped to process this information and haven't been able to see a therapist for quite sometime and it could possibly mess up the whole system i have with dealing with my mental illnesses (severe social anxiety and depression).
But, my aunt had to move in with us about 2 or 3 weeks ago because of certain circumstances, along with 3 of her 4 children. Now, no of them are the one that did things to me but, one of my cousins (one year younger than me) has recently tried to talk to me about it and told me that he remembers it as well.
I honestly don't know how to feel about the situation. On one hand, it feels good to be validated and know that I'm not crazy but, on the other hand, it DID happen. Right now, I'm in a state of shock and it hasn't fully set in so, I'm attempting to figure out how to cope before it does."
976,How to radically accept chronic pain?,"I have the essure coil implants. They are failing and causing horrific chronic pain. I am supposed to be getting removal surgery but I am having trouble scheduling it due to Coronavirus.

I have heard of radical acceptance being used to cope during times like these. I'm not sure how to implement it though. Trying to radically accept this pain is extremely distressing."
977,"I’m here to offer the support many of you may need - I know this is a forum for those struggling, especially during this time. PM me if you need support or just conversation!",
978,I can’t do this anymore,"I can’t do this anymore. I have too many problems to the point where one of my best friends had to block me on everything because I’m too sad sometimes. I need to much help and I always need him to comfort me. I’m a bad person and I’m always sad. Without his support I’ve gone back to cutting myself and suffocating myself. I’ve tried so hard to stop doing it but it actually feels so good i just can’t. I have so many problems. I want to die so bad I need to it’s an obsession I just want to die. I’m so lonely in quarantine I have no one anymore. No one to talk to. I’m stuck I need to die. I’ve tried calling lifeline but no one can help me feel anything. Nothing is helping me, not even therapy. I can’t do this."
979,Sadness vs. Depression,"Hey everyone, I’ve had this question for a really long time and I discovered this sub today and felt like it would be a good place to ask it. I hope it’s an appropriate question here. 

I’ve always wondered how to tell the difference between just being sad and actually having mental health problems. I mean I know that everyone has good days and bad days, that people get sad. I just seem to be sad a lot. It seems pretty consistent too, like I’ll have 3 or 4 good days when I’m confident, social, positive, happy, and then for no apparent reason I’ll go through 1, 2, maybe 3 days where I’m the exact opposite, where I feel like I’m a pathetic loser, that no one wants me around, like I’m bothering everyone in my life. 

I’ve been searching for a trigger for a while now. For a time I thought it was triggered by a negative social interaction, like when I had an awkward conversation with someone or if I sent a text message to someone and they didn’t respond. I also thought for a while it was caused by porn, like it was affecting my mood in that way. But the more I looked at those things the more I saw them as effects, like my mood started shifting and so I started to become more sensitive to these kind of negative social interactions or I sought out porn to try and cope. 

I don’t know, I guess I just need to know if I’m normal or if I have a problem. I’ve never told anyone this before because I sometimes feel like I’m just making it up for attention, like if I had a mental health problem then people would feel sympathy for me and would like me more. Sometimes when I have this conversation in my head I feel like I’m just saying things that don’t accurately represent my situation in order to align my situation with the symptoms of a disorder. 

Anyways, sorry for making this so long. I’m sure not a lot of people will read it but if you do, I appreciate your time and would love to hear thoughts and feedback and if anyone has felt the same way."
980,Why can't this be over?!,I can't take it anymore! This virus stuff i can't take it! Who knows how long it will be before we can go back to our normal lives! More and more people are getting sick! There won't be a cure until next year! People are trying to tell me to calm down but i can't! I want this all to go away! I'm worried about my family! I'm scared to go to work! I feel so alone stuck at home when I'm not at work! I can't deal with this anymore!
981,how can i find help?,"TRIGGER WARNING!! EATING DISORDER(?)
-
i’m highschool aged (sophomore) and i think i have a problem with food. i’ve never been a chubby kid i was actually rail thin until jan 2018 when i sunk into a depression (had to go to court a lot to talk about what my moms bf did to me and my sisters) and i just couldn’t handle the stress i guess and i left school for the second half of the school year. i didn’t leave bed for 8 months and i would rarely shower. i would just eat and eat and eat and i gained 65 pounds (i was at 120, you do the math) and i’ve recently got blood drawn to test if i’m pre diabetic. this has to stop now and as i’ve never had problems with food growing up i have no idea how to get help for binge eating. i’m trying to eat better and exercise but i cant shake my horrible food habits. any advice on how someone my age can get help for this sort of thing?"
982,When can lying be characterised as compulsive or pathological?,What is a normal amount of lying?
983,I can't cope with my BPD,"So, I'm diagnosed with BPD but sadly I'm underage and my parents don't believe that there's anything wrong with me so I can't go to therapy without them paying, and even though they supported me we're in a rough economic situation, they wouldn't be able to afford any therapy. That's why I want to hear any advice from any of you so I can cope with it better until I'm able to afford therapy"
984,sometimes i can’t remember what it’s like to not feel lonely,"loneliness is something that has weighed on me deeply for my whole life. i often feel like i am an alien, like i don’t even belong here. i feel pathetic because i actually really wish that i had friends. i get the sense that people just don’t like me. i’m always left out of things. i feel like people are annoyed with me all of the time. every time i’ve tried to foster a friendship and reach out to people, they just stop responding to my messages or ignore me entirely. i have no idea what i’m doing wrong but it makes me so sad. the few people who have tried to be my friend only wanted something out of me, like consistent emotional support for their problems or whatever else. the second i set boundaries and take some time for myself, these people get angry or they stop considering me a friend. no one has even noticed that i’ve fallen into one of the worst depressive episodes i’ve ever experienced. i go onto social media and see everyone posting pictures hanging out and it depresses me so much. i honestly feel like something’s wrong with me. mostly all of the friendships i had in the past were pretty toxic and one sided, which is why i’m no longer friends with any of those people. i feel like only people who want to take advantage of me want to spend time with me and that makes me feel so bad about myself that i don’t even know how to process it. i hate that i don’t even know what it is about me that people dislike so much. i try to be a good friend and a genuine person. and yet people who are otherwise quite self absorbed or mean or manipulative seem to have tons of friends. i don’t know. i just find it so confusing and depressing. does anyone else struggle with this and if so, how do you deal with it?"
985,Meds making me tired,I started taking fluoxetine almost 3 weeks ago and I have been SO tired and it’s frustrating because I thought this would help me to stop sleeping all the time due to depression. I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this and if it went away or not or why this may be happening. I don’t have an appointment for another 2 weeks and who knows if that will actually happen because of the virus. Thanks for any insight in advance!
986,Can someone please let me know what the fk I’m supposed to do for these next 3+ months being stuck inside my house,"I’ve been back from school for 5 days now, and while I wouldn’t say I was the happiest at school, being home is definitely 10x worse.

I have those “friends” where if I don’t text anyone no one will text me and I fucking can’t take it anymore. 

I text others because I’m that person who puts all of the effort into the 90-10% friendship but every time I’m like, “oh let’s see who really cares” and try to not text anyone, the harsh reality is no one would text me.

I just am so done with people and I can’t even meet new people because I’m fking stuck in my goddamn house"
987,“Beautiful women” challenge on instagram,"“so there’s the “beautiful women” challenge going around on instagram and its where u post a picture of yourself and nominate 10 people to do the challenge and then they post a picture saying who they were nominated by and who they nominated and it’s supposed to make people feel good about themselves but it’s literally just the popular girls calling each other pretty and a way for pretty girls to show themselves off while ugly bitch like me just have to watch” so i sent that too a group of my friends. Most are asleep right now but two are awake (one boy one girl) and one of them (the boy) responded “Well boys aren’t supportive of each other so that would never happen for us” and told him it makes a few people who already have confidence feels even better but then the rest of people who aren’t nominated feel so much worse. The three of us talked about it for a little and then the boy eventually said “And these girls be like,”girls have such harder lives than boys.” At least their being uplifted by some sort of positivity” and like no that’s the whole thing this is only positivity for a few people and negativity for the rest of us ugly/not pretty people. I cried for so long about this because i know i’m ugly and my friends won’t care enough to nominate me even if they had instagram. And what hurt the most is there was one girl who i actually thought might nominate me but i guess i did cross her mind. I’m really upset and i wish i had someone to talk to."
988,im a loser,"i know no one will read this and i am completely okay with that.
im almost 16 and i have no real friends and i've been alone all my life. i've never felt cared for at all considering the fact that everyone i've ever met has either made me feel horrible, worthless, pathetic, annoying, or all. the little friends i did have in the past abandoned me or didn't even bother to talk to me when i was isolating.
i'm not allowed to text or call people or even hangout with them and it's always been like this. it used to make me upset, but then i realized it doesn't even matter because i'm alone and i'll always be alone until i die.
i keep imagining a different life that's better where i feel loved, cared for, and i actually have friends and someone to talk to. i know it will never happen, but it's okay. i'm just tired of being alone. i wanna finally be happy."
989,My worst fear is becoming like my mother,"She just sits and watches the news and talks shit about trump, shes a horder and her only friends are like 20 pet cats she lives with, shes really neglectful of lots of things in her life. Even when I think that I look like her, have similar mannerisms, or have the same genetic health problems I start to freak out. I dont want to be like that and I'm so terrified I'd rather kill myself then have it happen. The environment of living in the same house as her though makes me feel like I'll never escape though, I'm destined to be like that and I cant escape no matter how hard I struggle so I should probably kill myself."
990,Self esteem...,"I’ve been having massive self esteem issues lately. I’ve had a history of mental problems that I sometimes have a hard time looking past, and this is...this is ridiculous. No matter how much I tell myself otherwise, make lists whatever I feel horrible when I do anything less than perfect. Like I have impossible standards that refuse to be lowered. It’s so bad that I’ve had suicidal episodes. I just want to get this shit out of my head and live a normal life. It doesn’t help that my parents treat me like I’m an idiot who can’t do anything right..."
991,My mom believes she's talking to celebrities.,"Something has happened to my mom in the last 4-5 months. Honestly shes always been super naggy and delusional, she would have us sit for hours listening to her go on and on about herself. One day out of the blue she stopped, I admit its a little better because she would nag allday long and start fights for no reason. 

Shes completely withdrawn from us now, i understand her needing her space but she sits out on the porch all day smokes cigarettes back to back (she stopped smoking years ago btw), and her new thing is talking to random men on FB claiming they're secretly celebs that are in love with her. The celebrities send her love songs and she listens to them allday everyday. And tries to find hidden messages of them confessing their love to her. She doesnt clean up after herself anymore, barely eats somedays because shes constantly outside on the phone. The hallway leading to her room is filled with boxes of random junk. Also i help the best i can but she destroys everything i do. It makes me not want to help anymore because shes set in the messy ways. She also spends money like crazy on things she might not even use. It just collects up and theyre like outdated brand new items computers, cameras, wigs she'll end being nice and giving them to people eventually.

My dad has gotten very weak and sick, hes always spoiled her rotten so i feel like this is a big part of the reason shes become the way she has. Shes really hurting and trying to fill the void by convincing herself some celebrity is going to come make everything alright for her. In reality shes losing real time she could be actually spending with real people lost in a dream world

How do i deal with this anymore ? I feel like im the only adult and responsible one in the house anymore. Im tired of everything falling on me and enabling her to continue this behavior."
992,I hate sharing,"I have a weird awkward step brother who is a complete bum. I’m 14 I’ve known him since I was 4. He does nothing with his life and he would rather do whatever he wants. He eats unhealthy, he is lazy, never wants to do activities with me, and too pussy to say shit to me and keep it real. He’d rather tell his mom. He sits on his ass all day and relies on others to do things for him. All he does is play video games and eat and shit all day. Thats not even all.

Today I had a sleepover with my cousins cause I haven’t seen them in a while. They asked if he wanted to come and he thought about it. We always play video games that brought us together like Minecraft, GTA, call I duty and we would have a LAN party. But we didn’t have enough TV’s so he had to get the 16 inch one. He deadass didn’t want to come just for that reason. So I finally got him to come over and I feel super awkward. I feel like his ungrateful and unthankful ass don’t deserve to eat out food. Sleep on my couch. Make a mess. Let alone breathe the fucking air I do. I was never raised around lazy bums that get what they want when they want. I was raised around a family where we were broke we needed money. Do what you can to survive. The hustle don’t stop type shit. I just want to know why I feel so mad and also why I feel all this animosity. If I can do something to change it."
993,What is it if it’s not acute psychosis?,"Hey everyone. I was hospitalised earlier this year for a month for what they’re calling a brief psychotic episode/acute psychosis. It was my first hospitalisation but not my first episode. I’ve had them on and off since I was 16 but this is the only one where I experienced amnesia and dangerous behaviour. I’m just wondering if this is normal? Does that sound like acute psychosis or brief psychotic episode? Everything I’ve seen seems to say it’s what they call it when it’s just a one time thing, but it hasn’t been for me."
994,I’m not sure what’s happening anymore,"I’ve recently started seeing a counselor and he’s really helped me a lot with all sorts of things. I’ve been pretty anxious about this whole corona virus thing as I’m sure many of you reading this are. The thing is... I’m not really anxious about it anymore. I’m home for the rest of the month so I’m fine now. I’ve tried to just stay home and pretend everything is normal. I usually stay home on my own anyway so this quarantine isn’t really anything new.

The thing is, four months ago, my family moved to a new house. The thing about my old house is that it held a lot of good memories. Even bad memories that were made there were happy to some extent. My childhood dog died there and we buried her in the backyard. She was one of my best friends and she died being surrounded by family. I met some of my best friends while living there. It was really strange to just leave it behind. Even four months later, it feels strange to not be there anymore. I find this strange, I’ve moved about 7 times in my life and I’ve never had this disconnection before. Ever since we moved, I feel like I should still be at that old house. I feel like I still live there. And I feel like my mental health has plummeted since moving here while also having it sky rocket and making me happier... I don’t know how to describe it exactly. I guess maybe my brain is associating this new house with everything that’s happened. The virus, the world war 3 threats (was that even a real thing?), and just a few other things I’ve been going through. I just think about living at the old house and I start to cry and yearn to be back there.

Ever since we moved, I’ve been stuck in a dream-state. I feel like nothing is real as if I’m still sleeping. I’ve always felt like life was a little surreal, but now I just feel like everything is meaningless because of it. I wake up every morning knowing at the end of the day I’ll be back in bed sleeping and away from reality. I wake up knowing everything is meaningless because in the end I’ll just go back to sleep. Sometimes I want to sleep for a week. I can’t focus on the particular objects because I know everything will be gone before I know it. I can’t have fun because I know it will end.

I just feel out of control. I feel like my mind has lost its grip on reality. It wants to pretend nothing is wrong and that everything is fine. Everything is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I can’t tell if it’s succeeding or not. Things feel fine and normal but at the same time it feels like I’m dreaming. It’s just day after day after day of nonstop dreaming and surreal feelings.

I wrote in my diary about it and I just broke down. I just want everything to go back to how they were when I lived in my old house. I want to go back. Why can’t things go back to the way they used to be? Why can’t I just feel normal again? Why can’t I just thinking normally again? I hate this feeling. I hate being here. I hate living here.



Just let me go back."
995,I genuinely feel like I might actually be going mad,"i just searched for this reddit because i dont know what else to do. i've been in isolation since the beginning of feburary after having something extremely traumatic happen to me that i dont know how to talk about to anybody. which actually isnt true, the truth is that i just don't have anyone to talk to about it, or in general really. i moved/drove across the country, alone, and literally my first day in my new city is when shit started coming out about covid19. i've been alone in a new house (which i am renting from a person who lives there but not full time, so theyve been gone since ive been here, two weeks) in a new city where i know virtually nobody. 

im so emotionally exhausted, my fucking soul is exhausted. usually im a good writer. usually im zesty. i cant really muster much from me lately. i drove to the ocean today though and that was extremely pleasant but also terrifying for obvious reasons. or obvious to anyone with constant gnawing-on-you anxiety anyway. mostly i just can't believe how much has happened to me in the past 2 months and then continuing to be strong and make the right choices, like drive for 5 days straight alone, in a city where i will be alone, in a car with two very unhappy kitty cats and also with me very unhappy and yowling and nearly killing myself in a hotel room on day 3. but i fucking didn't, because im strong, so i kept driving, and i made it, and then \~\*coronavirus\*\~. i don't need to spell out how it's affected me because i know i am not the only one. but, i am the only one in my own head right now and i have been for longer than i ever have been in my whole life. that is a completely grammatically correct sentence. 

so anyway i feel like im drowning in my mourning and drowning in unclichéd utter despair, drowning in fuCKING ANXIETYYY, and, most of what, what i am truly dying from right now, is loneliness. like i think a cat can die from loneliness, i think i might be slowly dying from loneliness. i can't eat anything in a way that i've never experienced before. i used to have a pretty severe eating disorder, but that's more or less managed in my life, and this is different. it fucking sucks, and it doesnt help that i am afraid to go outside now, even to get food. it makes me panic. i feel like the world's end isnt that far off and im terrified im going to go quicker than it. my desire to live and die is so fucking fluid, mercurial, it waxes and wanes. and ""i feel like im going to die"" is how i feel multiple times a day. moribund. 

idk hi my name is silas if youve read this far i bless you with the magical lint dust in my pocket"
996,Loneliness,I’ve been dealing with loneliness for a lot of my life I’ve always felt being pushed onto other people because the other person doesn’t want me around and if I’m around for too long they seem to get agitated with me and push me onto the next person I feel like I have no friends or people that care for me I was an only child for a lot of my life so I never got to experience a brotherly or sisterly bond and when I did get siblings I was 12 so was already dealing with problems and they were young I’ve been feeling so lonely and now I’m realizing people aren’t busy with lives since quarantining it’s just people don’t want me around
997,Need someone to calm me down right now please,"Hey, it's 3 AM where i Love, everyone is asleep um the house except for my dad. I watched a horror movie earlier oday and it really fucked me up and i was sorta fine but now i'm freaked out. I need my anxiety meds so i called my dad (he usually doesn't carry his phone around but i had hope). I didn't hear it ring so i figured it was on silent but then someone picked up. It wasn't him. The line was silent and i heard him cough from my room but not from the phone, so it couldn't have been him. I know i'm being kinda irrational but i'm fucking terrified right now. If anyone can help calm me down it would be great. I have a lot of anxious thoughts sometimes, i've even left the house once with a knife while on the phone with my friend because i felt i wasn't safe even though i knew i was alone and no one was there. Please help me."
998,I don’t know how to cope with the fact that I might inherit a disease from my family.,"I have a family history of autoimmune diseases and muscular dystrophies. My grandfather died of ALS. And my mother has Lupus, Myasthenia Gravis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. And these diseases can be carried on from parents. Therefore, I will probably end up with one of these diseases. And suffer for the rest of my life. I just don’t think I can cope with that. And if I’m ever diagnosed, I will honestly just kill myself. I don’t want to live a life of suffering."
999,Is their anything i can do to process my trauma without a professional?,"I was sexually abused as a child and its basicaly the root of all my issues lmao. With this whole Corona virus mandatory self quarantine  i figure now is a good time to try and adress my trauma.
Hella free time. Sounds stupid but whatever. I cant access any professionals. Is their anything i can do on my own to try and heal from this a little bit? Im 19 and i dont want to be one of those bitches who just carries they trauma around forever."
1000,How do you handle being tethered to a weak mortal,"So maybe my title is melodramatic, but its quarantine time and I'm afraid of getting weak. 
I mean, I've always been weak, I used to go to the gym 4 days a week but now I can't since we're in quarantine and I've got some equipment here. I'm going to make it work if it kills me. 
I've always had to work hard for any muscle I get. I've been lifting weights for 3 years and I can only bench 110 lbs. It's painfully annoying. I'm not strong by any measure, and it upsets me because it means I get pushed around. 
I keep wanting to blame myself for not going to the gym right now. But what can I do? I want to blame Covid on myself. Its my fault Covid is spreading and if I could stop it, I could continue going to the gym (what a selfish reason to stop a pandemic right?). I have a hard time making habits but I WILL NOT break them. It makes me go crazy. I don't like it.
I'm scared I'll lose the habit of going to the gym, I don't want to be weak again I don't want to get softer. I will hurt myself I will not be weak again. I don't want to lose the muscle I have worked so hard on.  
I'm afraid."
1001,Help for someone i really care about,"Hello everyone,

Im a new user to reddit, but ive always found that some of the best answers and solutions to alot of my questions ive googled of all aspects have came from common people like you and I on reddit, which leads me here. 
Long story short, Ive been talking to this girl for a while, and recently she has been struggling with depression. More specifically, she feels a sort of unexplained emptiness that doesn’t feel fixable. Like its a void within her wellbeing. 
I have not personally experienced this to the extent that she seems to have, but i truly wish to understand this as much as i can as well as know what I can do to help. She says she does not want to directly talk about it in the short term, which i sort of understand, so what are some things I can do with her in the meantime to take her mind off of everything until she is comfortable to talk about things with me? 

I really care about this girl and would appreciate yalls help!"
1002,Struggling,"Hi, Reddit. I’ve never posted here before, but today seemed like a good day for it. 
I’m fucking struggling. I lost my job (wrongfully, but it was a toxic environment) before all this COVID-19 stuff hit, then I went to an interview (very promising) last week. 
The thing is, my field is mental health and community support. The day I interviewed, the company enforced a strict work-from-home policy for an indefinite time period. So now I’m worried I won’t get the job. 

I don’t have much in the way of savings, my partner only makes minimum wage, and I just feel all around useless. I’ve struggled with anxiety/depression/suicidal ideation my whole life but this is the first time in my adult life that I really feel like I have a reason to be down, which makes it harder to pull myself back up. My partner and I have been living independently for a year or so now and it’s tanking my self worth to know I might not be able to keep it up. I just feel so fucking dumb and worthless and panicky and just....pending existential dread 24/7. 

I’m so scared and gloomy. I don’t even know what to do. 

Guess I just wanted to rant."

1005,Please help me help someone,"Hey everyone,

I’m from New Zealand. I’m not very sure of where to begin for finding help or whether this even is the right subreddit, but this is for a close relative. I don’t want to assume anything, but we have evidence to suggest that he is getting more and more unstable.

I’m writing this because we (my family and I) have previously tried to get him help, but the mental well-being firm we approached said they would not take action if he himself did not want any help. It’s a fair response, but he has a history of drug abuse and behaviour that has landed him in trouble with the police. 

He has recently had a baby with his wife, who has no idea about this past, and more than anything I just want her not to be caught up in all this. He has sold her car and wants to know her location at all times. He recently got arrested for threatening violence to a debt collector of some sort. I had to take care of their kid while they sorted out bail. 

I just want a direction to head in for some help. I feel like I’ve exhausted all I can, or maybe I haven’t, but it feels like I’m shooting in the dark right now. Can you guys help me out here?"
1006,need a hug,"*just a small rant because I feel like I can’t talk about this stuff to anyone* 

Everything in my life has been getting too much for me. I just want to feel like I can talk to someone. I dont want to feel like a burden anymore. I just want to talk to someone that can make me feel safe for a moment. I want to be held, and I want to be told it’s okay to cry. I just need a break. I just need to feel like there is someone out there that wants to be there for me. I don’t think I’ve had that. Getting up everyday is getting harder. Smiling everyday is getting harder."
1007,"Please help, terrified of developing psychosis/schizophrenia","Hello! I've been dealing with this problem since the beginning of this year and I got desperate about it.
I've always been a worrier and ever since high school I've been having health anxiety over different kinds of diseases. 

I graduated from art college last year and moved back to my hometown and ever since then I started to be more scared of going out. I'd be pretty social on facebook, because most of my friends currently live in other cities. I am still a social person and I crave socialization almost every single day but because of my health anxiety I've been having a derealisation/depersonalisation symptom for a pretty long time until present moment. Everytime I go out it intensifies and I try my best to stay present.
Basically to me it feels like this:
- my surroundings seem distant, different, foreign.
- i feel my life as if i'm living in a dream
- i don't feel present and grounded to present
- i'm 24/7 living inside my head, focusing on my worries of why i'm feeling like this.
- i can't focus on my surroundings, i can't focus on my words, it's like when i'm talking to my mom or brother or anyone else i feel hyperaware of my voice and what and how i'm saying anything.
- i began feeling forgetful, i'd forget certain words or struggle to remember their name, because of that sometimes i stutter.
All of these didn't use to happen until these past 2 years. Because of this I began googling my symptoms and found out that derealisation can be a symptom of early signs or psychosis and schizophrenia and my anxiety went downhill from there.

I began researching everything about schizophrenia and read stories of people developing it. I began paying attention to my thought process even more, question my thoughts, doubt them or my senses. Basically if something spontaneous happens i'd get this thought of ""what if i'm hallucinating this? what if it's not real?"" Deep down I know it sounds completely ridiculous but it's like this whole anxiety is messing with my cognition and perception of life. Lately even my house feel strange and distant. I'm scared to death about developing this disease.
Another big concern is the fact that i'm 23 years old, with no family history of psychosis or schizophrenia in my family (excepting for my grandpa who developed dementia very late in life, he was 91 when he developed it). I read that the early onset usually happens in late teens, early 20s and I can't stop thinking about it since i'm in the exact age period. 
I took my concerns to a psychiatrist in late december and he reassured me that i'm not showing any signs of schizophrenia and that it would had happened in my teens when my personality started developing. He however diagnosed me with severe anxiety, panic attack disorder and PTSD (since I have some childhood trauma as well). He prescribbed me some SSRIS and an antidepressant but I couldn't take them cuz they accentuated my anxiety.
I somehow got reassured by him after the appointment but not long after I found myself googling again about it and found out online that the age onset is, as mentioned, late teens or early 20s. I got freaked out because it contradicts what he said and I don't know what to trust anymore.
I'm honestly very scared of losing control over my mind. I'm not having any hallucinations or delusions, only if the schizophrenia fear would be considered a delusion, ironically. I'm just so hyperfocused with my mind and symptoms that I can't focus on my life anymore. I feel like a zombie.
Does all of these sound to you like early signs of psychosis/schizo?"
1008,I finally took the time to get the mental health help I needed,"I have a brain doctor.

That is easier for a crusty old guy like me to say than “therapist.”

Jesus, that was a hard call to make.  I've made it before and given up.  The transfers, the *bureaucracy*.  Folks think it is an easy call.  It took more than I thought.

To be fair, I’d given up before.  I thought asking for help meant that I had to admit I couldn’t deal with my own problems and needed to make them someone else’s.  Getting passed around reinforced these feelings.  My insurance wants to pass me to the VA, and the VA wanted my insurance to handle it.

This time, however, I kept at it.  It took what was in reality an embarrassingly small amount of time, and the VA picked me up.  A woman called me and said she would try and help.  I took a chance and explained where I was.

I talk to her two times a week now.  Well, I feel like I talk AT her twice a week.  Honestly, it feels good to just let it out.  Folks always are willing to talk with me, but I guess I just need to let this stuff out.  I don’t want commiseration.  I don’t need understanding.  I just need to say things out loud, I need someone to listen to it all.  Then, when I am done, tell me how to look at it with fresh eyes.

Most folks don’t wait long enough.  I guess that is what makes brain doctors special.

I’ve known for a while that I’m a mess.  I tell people that I am the sum of my broken parts.  Still, it feels good to let things out.

My brain doctor started using phrases to help me understand where things came from.

PTSD. TBI. Survivor disorder.  Atlas syndrome.  

My problem wasn’t what I was feeling, it is how I deal with and interperate it.

Things happened, and they weren’t my fault. 

I don’t need to shoulder this burden alone.  

If I work hard for people, I shouldn’t feel unappreciated.  I should look at how they thrive when I help, not how I think they should respond.

I still feel like I need to do more, even when I can’t.

I hope she can help with that."
1009,is it normal to grow emotionally attached to something as soon as you see it?,"Context: I’ve recently started playing a video game and I’ve grown so attracted to the story and characters. Literally almost everything in my life right now is about this game. It’s honestly kinda scary.

I’ve had some (and am currently having) some other issues with mental health and I’m afraid this could be a symptom of something.

I’m just asking if I should be worried or if this is normal. This happens a lot for me but never to this extent. This is the first time I’ve ever felt so attached to something."
1010,I really don’t want to be sad anymore,I’ve been aware of my sadness for a little over a year at this point. Looking back before when I was back in high school I think I really was sad the whole time actually. After high school graduation I had the loneliest summer of my life. And then college starts and I move to another city and fail to make a reliable group of friends. I have no one to talk to. I suck at socializing. I don’t have a support system. I’m so lonely. And the root cause is the fact that I just hate myself and I have no confidence and I feel like I’m not good enough and I feel like I’m treated like I’m not good enough by people. And I can’t stop replaying all the perceived bad shit that’s happened to me in my head.
1011,Opposite of dissociation?,"Husband has a history of dissociative fugue and amnesia and now something kind of opposite will happen.  He swears he did something, remembers doing it, but didn’t.  What’s that?  He has also been hallucinating."
1012,Do you have any tips for staying hopeful during the pandemic?,I’m not going to lie. I’m freaking out over this pandemic. I feel like I’m about to lose loved ones. I feel like I may die myself. Are there any tips you have to staying positive and not letting this get to you? Are there any places where I can find positive news on the issue?
1013,Nightmare segments,"Should i be considered to have nightmare segments when you're **half** asleep (between awake and sleep) even if nothing particularly scary happened that day?  I dont get nearly as many full on nightmares as these, and each only last a few seconds before i become full awake again from fear.  
E.g.  Ill imagine a person turning around and scaring me by widening their eyes menacingly at me or they are a monster of sort, or even just ill  im playing a game and small scary parts from the relatively peaceful game will be more scary because now im actually in the game, with the thing tryong to blow me up?
I asked a freind if she also had these and she said they weren't normal so idk"
1014,I really need help.,"I just can’t find a reason to keep on going, and I’m having a bit of nihilist thought in my head. In the greater scheme of things, what is the reason for life? It has no meaning, it’s all going to end with a death of the universe anyway, and I’m going to be forgotten, all my life’s deeds and art. I feel... that there is no reason to live, and I should kill myself. I feel that no matter the effort I put into things, it’ll all be for nought. I don’t really care about that though, I just feel like this life of just walking forward because I’m told to is useless. I don’t feel like there’s a point to keep going and I should just get it over with in the first place. This is truly, a cry for help. I need someone, or something to give me reason in life of which I have none."

I'm beginning to look at things and see reasons why I cannot trust people and seeing it everywhere.  From work to friends.

It starts out as venting or gossip and then goes into disrespect, judgement and probably even personal attacks.   There's hints or things being said as jokes or blanket statements with heavy aspects that can lead certain ways.  Or things not said but implied through looks, body language, or how they talk about things or other people that display thought patterns.

I search my room, every corner every inch and there’s nothing but the feeling  is still there. The feeling it’s never consistent. It’s like two different people, the paranoid me and the laidback me. The feeling can last for weeks or months and then just go away. How can o go from having to write in my own blood to reassure I’m still in control to being normal the next day. How can I think I’m the center, the focus is the whole world for moths in months just to wake up one day feeling like I some matter in the world, that no one would notice if I died. Why am I like this. I found a notebook of mine a while ago where I had bloody handprints all over it, it was covered in my blood. But the next week I was completely normal just like everybody else. I went from covering my notebook in blood because I needed to know I was in control of my life to normal so fucking quick. What is wrk f with me, what happens if it doesn’t go back. I could get stuck thinking I’m the only one who mattered or thinking everybody was being controlled by something and having to cut myself to make sure I wasn’t being controlled. What is wrong with me? Help me."
1018,Cant stand myself," 

I cant stand myself. I've been going through a cycle for a while now... Its annoying and honestly horrible. Sometimes I'm happy, but most of the time, I'm not. I'm sorry in advance if I sound like I'm whining or anything like that, and also the fact that I am dumping stuff (not in any peticular order) out because I have so much wrong with me. But I need help, I dont want professional help, I just need someone anonymous to talk to...

I have a problem with communicating my thoughts with people, because they start dissapearing as I am telling people or writing it out, leading to the fact that my problem is never really resolved. Even now, I cant seem to put what I have been thinking for the last day into words.

Ive just going through a cycle of hating myself and being ignorant about myself. Whenever Im with anyone, I become super self consious. And I start analysing everything, my actions, my speech, what I say, how people react, how people respond. Then from this analysis, I start hating the conversation, I start seeing the wrongs I've done, the horrible things I've said, and how the things I say might effect how others think about me. This hits me with my already low self-esteem and makes me feel extremely worthless. Then after a while of this cycle, I start questioning the purpose of my existance, diving into a dark whole that I don't want to get out of, because I am so used to it.

I've always just felt that I am worthless, and that no one really cared about me. No one ever texts me, no one ever starts a conversation with me, no one ever truly cared about me. I've celebrated 18 birthdays alone (give or take, if youre nit picky its less, but for the last 9ish years, ive been alone) with my parents because no one ever remembers, no one ever cared. It just feels like that if I died one day, no one would know until I have to move out of my dorm and someone finds my dangling body after a month. I am an extroverted introvert, I love being around small groups of people, but also enjoy my silence, but hate being alone (its hard to describe with words, because I dont even know how to describe it to myself).

I literally cannot remember what I was going to say, thats how bad my problem with communicating my thoughts are. I hate myself so much

I also feel like I am not worth anything, with my always setting expectations so goddamn high, and that for the entirety of my life, my parents have always compared me with other people (my brother included) And that my classmates have always told me how fucking bad I am at something. Everyone seems to undermine my efforts 24/7, now to the point to where I get depressed after getting a half decent grade. And to the point that I just really wanna give up, and not care anymore, I just dont have any worth. No one ever cared, why should I? Ive tried picking up my shit for years, to the point where theres so much shit on me, I jsut want to drop it all and just die. I cant stand myself, I cant stop thinking, I cant get music out of my head. I just dont want to care about anything anymore, the people, the nature... nothing. The only reason why I havent died yet is because of fucking guilt, of the guilt of how my parents will react, the guilt of never getting the chance to explain why I died, the guilt of being never able to see my crush again, the guilt of never feeling loved by anyone ever. I wish this guilt would just go away..."

1020,Maybe there's a problem,"I might have mental illness, but it's not possible.

Even if I do, everyone (family, friends) said I don't.

They even brought me to a doctor to prove I was wrong.
I panicked and forgot why I thought I might have had a problem or something, and the doctor said I'm fine. My parents treated me like ""told you so"".

I have realized today that whenever I start thinking seriously about whether or not I have problems I get angry at myself: ""stop trying to attract attention!""
But...
I thought this, but are those words mine?
After all, it's what my best friend always tells me when I'm ""acting up"".

I don't know what's the point of this post, I hope it didn't annoy you (reader).

P.S.: this will probably sound ridiculous and just made up but I often catch myself thinking about whether I might have depression, or adhd, or ptsd, or whatever in thinking in that particular moment, and I tell myself ""shut up, there's no problem, it's all in your head"" then I remember that those problems I'm thinking about are in the head and I start losing myself in long circles of tangents"

I'v let my friend's know about it yet they still do it, either they forgot or aren't taking me seriously. When they do it, it feels like they're telling me the full truth, that they're just constructs in my brain telling me to finally wake up and be in the real world again.

I'm exhausted, I'm tired of living with this fucking puzzle in my brain. Every time I think I make a revelation towards it, I'm thrown back in another loop. I'm not properly diagnosed, but I don't know what else this could be.

When people talk, it feels like it's about me, like, directly about me. Music, tv, radio, all that shit feels like it's talking to me sometimes. 

I'm just tired..."
1027,I’m alone,"I (21m) have always been alone. 
I was abandoned by my blood parents and was put into an orphanage before I was even 1. I got adopted at age 4 but the parents who adopted me used me solely for labor and eventually left me when I was 12. During the time they took care of me, I never once got emotional support and they have never shown any love towards me. I was sent back to an orphanage and then transferred to a foster home with foster parents who treated me like dirt and only provided the basic necessities. When I turned 18 I was released from them and had to live on my own. Overall, my home life never taught me anything and my “parents” showed no “parental affection” and I’m not even sure what it means to be loved. 
As for school, I was born with a cleft lip and my facial proportions are all out of wack, so I had no true friends. Everyone who hung out with me during grade school did it because they felt bad that I was deformed or that I was adopted and then abandoned again. I could never socially fit in, and everywhere I go I’m always the one who is left out. I have no online friends because I was unable to access internet except on school devices until I could afford my own phone. 

So my question is: How do I live my life with no one at all to support me or love me? Is my life even worth living if no one loves me?"
1028,Ever since I was young Ive always thought people were watching me,"It usually was people id seen recently like in movies, but as I grew older it became random and i even began creating random, strange characters I even felt like I knew where they were and Id look at them. Im 16 now and a few years ago I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I take lexapro for the anxiety but still feel as if im being watched 
Never told anyone this. Am I a schizophrenic or is my anxiety just insanely powerful?"
1029,How to stay happy with yourself? Without needing anyone else?,"I have many friends. Or atleast so I think. And I'm there for them whenever they need me. Because that's how I like to treat my friends. 


Not all of them treat me the same way tbh. I find myself getting angry when I'm not included in certain activities or anything where I think I should be. 
Guess u can say I'm looking for validation or whatever.

 For example I have a friend who I helped a lot, emotionally and what not in many situations. And I thought of her as my best friend. There's a trend on insta where u draw something and you tag 10 friends and then they draw it. Its stupid but inclusive. Literally like many of my friends including this girl who I'm talking about also did, but none of them tagged me. Call me petty but I like having these small interactions and now I'm just…sad. That my own friends don't give me what I give them… idk what to do so now I wanna know how people who can be happy with themselves do it. 


Not every friend will be the same but like, I just. It hurts… I just wanna know how to stay happy with yourself, without the need of anyone else. Because it's not just friends who do this, right? I just wanna know how to become that person that doesn't get affected by all this because it hurts and it takes a toll on my mental health too... 😭

It hurts a lot you know 😭"
1030,Need advice,"So... i hold a weeky dnd session online. I have 4 strangers and a friend that ive played online with for about a year now. A few days ago we had a bonding meeting and alcohol was involved. It went well for a while but as it was the last 3 (me, the  Most talkative in out group (F)and one other person.(M) ) after a little bit the female of the group started doing reading with  tarot  cards. She pulled a card that (as far as i understand it) not a good card and one "" Associated with depression"" because of that she didnt want to continue. The other male in the group push and demanded that she continued even tho she was close to tears. She did finsh the reading but was clearly upset about the matter. After a bit she vlamed to be ok about it. And he forcefully demanded that she didnt lie to him. To the point where i had to step in as owner of the server and dm. I was planing to have a talk with both of them and give a warning. While both parties have alot of mental health issues. The male is going through alot. Both would stay up till 3 in the morning talking. I am just worried that he is showing alot of self destructive habits. Even tho the female is trying to help i do feel that it is doong more harm then good. 

Side note: we are also part of 2 other groups of friends and most of them who speak to him regularly day his attitude has become more hostile and distant. (He would leave the group chat and never. Come back just to talk to this player) would say he would come back and never dose.

My main worry is that hes gonna do something like this to one of the other players and make them quit. (They seem to be a bot more sensitive to this.) Or worse yet he would continue hurting him self. 

Other side notes. At one point during the night he says he cpuldnt feel his toes-&gt;his legs-&gt; to his face because of the alcohol. But didnt stop drinking. Even sent pics of the bottle of what he was drinking.has also said he would push him self over the limit just because he can and if he dies from it ""oh well. ""
He seems not to like when im talking to her. And would try to hint on me leaving them alone. Kinda aggressively.  

I am unsure how to proceed with this i am planning to talk to the other player to see her take on it. And ask to refram from alcohol or atleat drinking with him. From there have a talk with him and make sure all is alright/ give a warning."
1031,Small survey,"On a scale of 1 to 10, How far do you want to go away from people?

1. No way at all!! prefer to be in the center of the city with crowd.. You love the hustle bustle.

2. City area but not in the center, too much crowd is kinda claustrophobic.

3. Further away from the city, you like a little bit of peace while not sacrificing the crowd too much.

4. Prefer to be in a large town, rather stay a few miles/kms away from the city makes you feel better, lesser chaos, gives you more privacy and cheaper property rates makes the sweet deal.

5. A nice small town seems more appealing to you. Lesser population and small roads with cute shops makes you happy?

6. The country side is more of your taste? you like to have a big house far away from the city, maybe a few friendly neighbours is all you need. 

7. Further deep in the countryside, maybe you love your privacy a bit more than others. Or you need more space for your German Shepard to run. 

8. Farmlands - Hmm you like farming and a lot of space with no one around for miles. You love horses and like to do some physical hardwork. 

9. Isolating yourself from the civilisation, maybe a little bit near the heavy forest or a secluded beach but like to keep your essentials and the internet close to you and the small village is just a few miles of drive. 

10. Complete freak like me, you want an island far off from the mainland with not a single human soul around for a few 100 miles. Possibly give up internet and cut yourself off from the world. Go complete off grid and make your own house and do farming so you're self sufficient, perhaps visit the nearest human civilization only when it's needed for maybe buying essentials or for healthcare or maybe you just wanna see other humans sometimes."
1032,A poem I wrote,"An introvert with countless scars,
I recharge in the light of stars,

Memories red from darkest nights,

I wonder, who still waits for me?

Cyclone mind then palms will quake,
Absent aid provokes my break,

I see now, no one waits for me."

1035,Just a heads up regarding perscriptions,"In these uncirtian times some clinics are going into lock down. You may be in a different area than usual and have difficulty visiting your usual doctors. In regards to prescriptions, give your regular clinic a call and see if you can get them prescribed to a more axcessable pharmacy. Stay safe everyone"
1036,I’m not a saint I can’t forgive it anymore,"My bf is my world we are in a ddlg relationship and being able to age regress helps me cope with my anxiety when it gets bad. But we keep having the same fight, it’s always that I feel neglected when he gets into a game.

We set down ground rules to deal with this- the games are turned off at supper time so that we are together, he won’t take calls at night from me because  he’s on mic with his friends but he’ll respond to texts between rounds, the big one was ‘I’ll ask you before I get on mic’ or as far as ‘I won’t get on mic when you are over’. Between those and us making dinner together each night so that we are spending time actually interacting with each other it’s smooth(ish) sailing.

Yesterday he put me in littlespace (he cooed at me and encouraged me until I regressed) while we were at the store. after we got home he threw a burrito in the microwave and got on his game, I went upstairs to take a bath. I come out he’s on mic, no big he’ll jump back to me after this round.... I was wrong

Littles are a lot more sensitive and it was already a sensitive subject, he goes sets the oven to preheat the water to boil and says ‘I’m going to play quick match while I’m cooking’ I looked dejected and he responded by telling his friends he was getting into single player games he’ll catch them later. Then stayed on mic all night anyway, I felt lied to because all these safeguards and he knowingly put me in LS already that day. Foods done he puts his headset on to watch YouTube but ‘I’m not getting on mic’ which is great but it meant supper time we were in our individual devices and I was still feeling ignored. 

I ate and went upstairs, I was feeling lied to, but even more I didn’t want to say to him that I felt manipulated because he’d said he’d do something to protect my feelings and didn’t follow through. He followed me up a bit later to ask what was going on, asked me if it was him on mic acknowledged the issue and when we went back downstairs we continued to not interact.

End of night rolls around I go home and had gotten an upsetting call on the drive I text him “I’m about to cry can you take a call” which he admitted he saw he’d gotten a text but got caught up in the game and never replied to. I pointed out he was ignoring my texts he said he’d do better then didn’t. Finally I call him crying and telling him I’m sorry I’m a shitty little, I won’t regress at night anymore because clearly he can’t handle it he apologized reassured me and told me to sleep after this game he’ll go to bed too. 

I woke up to a text ‘sorry got caught up in a game’ 2 hours later

I’m depressed because of yesterday and don’t think I even want to see him today. I want to go back to work. fuck this plague.

He says he’s not a video game addict cuz it doesn’t hinder his relationships but I’m legitimately considering distancing myself from him because of it, the only one who doesn’t see that the gaming is a problem is him and it’s because he’s so stuck in his headset he can’t listen."
1037,Struggles,"School here have been canceled till may.I was suppose to go to uni to pick at classes for when I start in fall.I check their Facebook facebook and no face to face to may 16th.I was suppose to pick out on may 6th...I had everything planned out...I don't get upset with routines been changed up but plans I do
Is anyone else like that?
That's how my autism has affect this ik selfish"
1038,Irritability,"Why I get irritated easily when I spent too much time with people? I usually expriencing this when I spent more than a week, socialising, interacting and talking to people. 

But when I isolate myself for a long time, I found myself to more patience, calm, rational. The best version of me."
1039,"Shortness of breath, my hypocondria again? Or covid?","The thing is I have never expirienced shortness of  breath in my anxiety attacks before but then again I thought I was going to die of spinal cord, brain and testicle cáncer before with symptoms that went away after I was Very VERY reassured I was not

Soooo is my hypocondria or not who knows, but at this point no one takes me seriously"
1040,Really just need a place to vent,"I was treated for anxiety in college and have since graduated and removed myself from many of the things in my life that were not good for me. With all the panic currently going on across the world I find a lot of my hold habits returning. I haven’t been sleeping, I catch myself chewing on my lip or the inside of my cheek constantly to the point it’s becoming uncomfortable. Work has had talks of going to a smaller crew and those able to work from home have been encouraged to do so. My job is not one where I can work from home so I’ve been able to continue working as normal. I’m worried that if I do have to change my routine this will be too overwhelming. I’m trying to cope and really just needed a place to write out all of my feelings. I know I can’t control everything going on around me and need to refocus on the things I can control."

Here is my YouTube channel  (Mind Strength) that I created, I was extremely depressed and in a dark place and I was able to pull myself out of it. So my channel is me giving tips and stories about how if you are experiencing any mental health issues these are some of my tips and lessons that I learned. I want to use the channel to help out people because I know I would have loved the help when I was in that situation"
1043,I anyone else had this experience on Prozac?,"I’ve been on antidepressants (Prozac) for a few months now. Started at 20mg, and he prescribed 20mg vyvanse because he suspected I also had ADHD innatentive type. well the Prozac didn’t do anything and the vyvanse made me feel so euphoric it was insane. I was talking super fast, mind racing, happy and laughing asking questions. BUT it did take care of my anxiety. that was gone. 8 was happy and racing around and numbing into things literally dancing. my boss literally told me that I was freaking her out. so I stopped taking the vyvanse and Prozac was upped to 40. that didn’t do anything so I went to 60. this is when things starting getting bad. I felt like my depression was worse. I’ve been suffering from intrusive thoughts/suicidal ideation since my junior year of high school (in 21 now) but this time it was really bad. the thought of suicide wouldn’t get out of my head. I could barely get out of bed, I couldn’t stop feriously tapping or shaking and it was driving the people around me insane. The paranoia also got worse on the meds: sometimes when I go outside I get paranoid people are following me. there was even one time I saw a man on the roof of the building next to mine and I was terrified he was CIA and because I saw him, he was going to send a sniper. that’s the worst of paranoia. then came the feelings of buzzing and whirring (I don’t really know how to explain it) in my head. it was like a bunch of energy and it made me want to scream. these were my lowest points. the only thing that helped was sitting down in the shower for an hour or two. some days I could barely get out of bed and others I was painting my dining room table and reorganizing my closets. I’ve also been battling anxiety since I can remember. so I told my doc that my depression was worse, my anxiety was worse so he upped me to 80mg and .5mg klonopin twice a day. two days after I impulsively decided to get two tattoos (didn’t have any before), my ears pierced again, and I cut off all of my hair. I feel better sometimes but other times I still feel that suicidal ideation. there’s also this sense of apathy and “I don’t care”. I am calmer (probably due to the klonopin). I’m all of a sudden wanting to go out (which I NEVER do because of my anxiety) drink more (never drank in high school) and am craving sex all of the time (I haven’t been intimate with someone in years and didn’t miss it all). now, a few days ago, I think I started hearing voices but I’m not sure. it’s either an incomprehensible voice or laughter (usually when I’m alone). I know they aren’t real, I know they are in my head but (and I don’t know how to really explain it) but I know they aren’t coming from me. I mean I’m going from happy in the mornings to severely depressed to excessive talking throughout one day, dancing and jumping, my little brother asking if I’m drunk and my mom asking if I’m on drugs (which has happened in the past before the drugs, where Id be incessantly talking jumping from one thing to another and not letting my mother get a word in edgewise. But now by mom wants me off the meds, cause she says that I have been WAY moodier on them. Any advice?"
1044,I made a video with a list full of questions for therapists,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSQVWNfpvPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSQVWNfpvPE)
1045,Mentally exhausted - How do I recover? I've given myself a couple days of relaxing but feel like I need more. I felt like I had no reason to be tired until I typed out this post.,
1046,Is it really helpful to see a therapist ?,"I always thought it wasn’t, or that it would be useless for me personally. But as time passes, I really start to question whether seeing one would help me or not. 
I feel like I have a lot of issues that need to be diagnosed so that I can move forward with it, but at the same time I still hesitate and I don’t know what to expect. 

I’ve never seen any therapist before, and I’m scared of opening up to someone I don’t know. I’m also not sure it will really help and I don’t want to pay a lot of money to see someone who doesn’t help at all. I’ve rarely heard great things about therapists, so I was wondering if any of you would share your opinion on this, and possibly your experience, if that helped or not, and you think this is a good thing to do or if it’s not really necessary."
1047,I tend to hate my brother because of my mom,"Ever since my brother finished high school, moved out and got a (pretty good) job, my mother is like really close to him. But like extremely close. It’s even annoying him. He visits is every weekend, and whenever he comes home my mom is like always near him. She never argues with him. She argue with me a lot, but whenever he says something he’s complete silent. She never talks back. She tries everything to not get him mad. Whenever I get mad about my mom and speak a little louder and more serious (without shouting) she’s always like “don’t talk to me like that, I’m your mom”. If HE talks to her like that she’s like it’s alright, I’m sorry, don’t get mad at me. And I’m like why? It kinda feels like a 1950s house wife who tries everything to keep her husband happy. Whenever I use the kitchen and it’s a little messy she’s always like “awesome, now I can clean the whole kitchen because of you, well done”. Today HE created a mess, a huge mess, and she’s like “it’s alright, we can clean it later”. Because of her I started hating it when my brother comes home. I love my brother but her behavior is too annoying, too hurtful. I need help. No matter what I do, no matter what I say, she never believes me anything. As soon as my brother says something she’s all quite and believes it. I kept telling myself that it’s alright, but it’s not. I don’t want to fool myself anymore"
1048,I'm not sure if jaded even begins to describe anything about me..,"Essentially I just find everything disappointing or complete shit.. Even when I do mange to go outside, I no longer see the good in anyone. I don't see the good in the outdoors anymore.. Even if I go for a walk or something the first thing I notice is just garbage everywhere and then just see essentially garbage people as well throughout my day.."
1049,Waking up with anxiety,I've had a rough week at work (got a write up) and this morning I had just woken up after some super disturbing dreams when my boss called. She wanted to know where I'd put a mechanical cat one of my residents likes. When I told her she told me we can't do that and sounded super disappointed in me. I told her I'd forgotten to find new batteries for it and had moved it to a cupboard because the resident was upset because it wasn't moving (no/low batteries). She still was understandably not happy with me forgetting. That doesn't change the fact that now I'm nauseated and tense and can't stop the worst case scenarios from running through my head on a loop.
1050,Does anyone have advice for dealing with my family's anxiety?,"I am the older brother in my house. My dad is short-tempered, my Mom is quick to be anxious and my younger brother is quick to be nervous. Everyday it feels like a daily battle to maintain my own positivity. I often dread coming home, and I picked up extra hours at work and stayed longer at school so I can avoid my family for the sake of not having to deal with their anxiety that they put on me. My mom worries about the worst of the worst and she tells me every time. I told her I was considering join the military and she says she doesn't want me to join because she doesn't want to die. Why is the first thing that come to her mind? She also told me not to bike to work because she doesn't want me to be hit by a car. My dad told me to never leave my laptop in my car, and if I do, he acts like it is a 100% guarantee that someone will break in and steal it. One summer I went away from for a month on a archaeological dig in Europe, and I flourished. My confidence was greater than ever, and I felt more alive. When I would tell people at one-month trip that I was going to do this or that, they would say: ""Go for it"", they wouldn't list off all the what-ifs that could happen. I came home back to my anxiety-filled house and my confidence shrunk. My confidence recently has increased, I'm eating healthier, I'm exercising more, but I am still fighting as hard as ever to maintain a positive and confident attitude around my family. 

Has anyone ever gone through something like this? I don't know if I should confront them on this issue or not. It gets exhausting and infuriating to listen to their anxiety and negative talk every day. All I know is that they aren't changing in there ways, and unless I do something about it, this will continue as it has the past 20 years of my life. Its hard to stop them from getting under my skin because they are the people closest to me."
1051,Need to help my brother in another state.,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have an older brother (38) in another state that I believe needs mental health intervention. Our oldest brother died 10 years ago and the brother I'm concerned about has never really dealt with it. I think the covid pandemic has triggered PTSD (he's never been diagnosed and I don't think he's ever really been to therapy. He has been posting, deleting, and reposting conspiracy theories on Facebook. It is not political; it is paranoid. I don't think he will immediately harm himself but he also has an issue with alcohol and I think it is exacerbating whatever he is experiencing mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOW DO I HELP HIM WITHOUT CALLING 911? FROM ANOTHER STATE?

&amp;#x200B;

He lives with his girlfriend but I think she's in denial along with my parents. I don't want this to be a stress and burden on my parents. I thought I got them to understand the severity of the issue yesterday but today they are content to just talk to him everyday even though they admit they think he needs the help of a mental health professional even though he says he does not. Please help me understand how I can help him."
1052,Where can I get checked for Borderline Personality Disorder?,"The title is self explanatory, i have been battling with some of these symptoms my entire life. Now 31M i am ready to give it some further understanding.

Thank you"
1053,?????,So lately due to the events that are going on now both my depression and anxiety are on both badly triggered at the moment i have been to do things to calm me and distract me from things that are triggering me and its kinda helping a bit but being in the house with a person who keeps reminding you that you were dumb on not saving  and wasting your money on dumb things . Like i know i dont have any money saved and yea i probably did spent my money on dumb stuff but how i was i supposed to know that i was going to be let off my job. any advise on how to deal with this because honestly i cant take it anymore.
1054,Titrating off a low dose of Zoloft,"I am sitting at 50mg of Zoloft and can no longer afford to go to a doctor. I don't think it does anything and never has but it's one of those things where I just took it anyhow (anxiety). My doctor won't fill it anymore as he has been telling me that I have to come in to see him and I haven't several times now. The problem is with insurance deductibles I have to pay a lot of $$$ and considering I think this med is a waste I can't justify it. 

Anyhow I am on 50mg as mentioned, I can break them in half obviously. Has anyone gone from 50mg to 25mg and avoided massive withdrawals? I have missed the entire dose several days before when I ran out and felt shitty. But that was due to issues with refills. I was curious if titrating down to 25mg maybe for a week or so then stopping would make it not so horrible.

I don't have much choice but was curious if its fairly doable for most."
1055,There's a Rage Inside - But it's Optimistic," 

Not sure if it's from the quarantine, the crypto loss, or the job uncertainty or simply just my relationship. I don't feel calm anymore. I am reacting to every small change around me with fear. It's hard to breathe much. There are simple innocent activities around. People are delivering goods, people are walking their dogs, the police are writing tickets. But it all feels so significant. Nothing is taken for granted. With the right mindset, this would be utopia. To be so aware of your surroundings... But in the current situation, it's torture.

I can't sit still. Now is the perfect time to try. Stop stuffing your face nervously. Stop snapping at your girlfriend who is suffering her own internal battle. Stop putting off work when you can be making your client's site better. 

You can even work on your own websites. You have 4!  The beautiful mentalhealthnomad.com! You have all the skills to make them useful and generate interest. But you are never focused. You are never calm. You are always reacting to the tension and discomfort arising from the stimulation around you. It's a choice. You don't have to react. You can let it just pass by you without pain. 

What else can you do really? This isolation and deteriorating economic situation require you to be adaptive. You absolutely have the intellectual skills. But what is required now is grit. Grit to endure mentally not just physically. You never really toughed it out enough to WIN in competition. Well, that's not entirely true. You were good. You could find a way to win sometimes. You just didn't enjoy the relentless pull of victory like others seemed to cling on to.

This feels raw. I feel sober. Very clear-headed. But I'm not. I'm on a brownie with L-Thenanine. Perhaps this combination is effective for concentration and pain reduction. Maybe this is what Matt gets from his weed smoking and coding setup that powers him through his well-paid gigs. He made an app. He's been working on it since this summer. Single app. single purpose. To create a functional app. 

What single-purpose task have you been focused on recently? Not much. You could. Mentalhealthnomad.com is pretty good. It has potential. But it needs this sober and raw tone of voice you are capable of. Every time you say one tiny thing and jump over to chat to share with your partner, it's a form of weakness. Fear of completing a task. Of creating something fo depth and value.

I am optimistic though. I know that I can improve the world around me. I can propel my future in the right trajectory. I don't have to be avoidant. I don't have to work at half effort. I don't have to be negative in the face of circumstance. I can make this my time. I have to channel the rage."

1058,Artistic mentally ill people,"Some days (to some of us) we feel a bit better, even if it's tiny. In those days, I feel like I want to do so many things (I am a very crafty person, and I like drawing, writing, planning, embroidering, and more) and I have new ideas for art and ways to make art but it overwhelms me. I start feeling bad because it paralyse me, I just have those ideas in my head, all the time but when I feel an impulse of energy, I want to take them out but I don't know where to start and frustrates me. And I research and look for materials but my energy time goes away before I can put my mind in only one thing.
Have you feel the same? How do you cope with it?"
1059,what is wrong with me?,"i had a complete meltdown last night on my
boyfriend. i feel horrible. he was being rude to me and wouldn’t own up to it. we started arguing. at this point it felt like someone else was controlling me and i was just watching as if i was in the background not being able to control myself much except to go even more crazy. i was screaming bloody murder at him. as if i was seriously insane. screaming telling him to stop “abusing” me because it felt like emotional abuse at the time. i cut myself for the first time. when he tried to talk to me i would start to calm down and then he was get a sarcastic tone or say something sarcastic and it would throw me in a fit of rage all over again. i would scream bloody murder “STOP DISRESPECTING ME, YOURE SO FUCKING RUDE!!” and then just scream bloody murder over and over until my voice was gone and i was also crying. then i finally started to “come back to reality” almost. i suddenly feel bad for everything. and i apologize and start crying and he forgives me. this has happened several times. i don’t know what is wrong with me.. things just set me off. especially if he doesn’t take my feelings into consideration. but he finally apologized for hurting my feelings last night but denied that he emotionally abuses me which i agree cause i was just being crazy. when i get into this fit of rage... it happens so fast. i started throwing stuff and freaking out if he got an attitude and stuff. he said he thinks i enter a state psychosis. but idk cause that says it has hallucinations and stuff and i don’t have those. 
i am truly a nice girl, and i love him so much and i’d give him the world.. i don’t want to put him through this.. so i want to figure out what the fucj is wrong with me ..."
1060,A moment of silence please....,For the user known as corsac370  he made a post saying he was gonna commit suicide this Saturday I chose not to comment on his thread instead I chose to direct message him we talked for awhile I tried to get him to stop it’s not worth it theirs so much you can live for I even told him this morning I realized  he defeated his account if anybody is suffering from mentle issues please see a psychiatrist or talk to a trusted froend or loved one commuting suicide is not the way take care of yourselves and each other
1061,Instant Natural Mood Booster I discovered by Accident!,"Smells really affect my mood.  i have been struggling for a few days because the Air BnB Guests upstairs keep cooking curry, and the smell permeates EVERYTHING in my house, and opening the doors &amp; windows is only so effective.

This morning, it had me pretty hateful, I just got the house cleared out, and then they cooked lunch.  Anyway, the smell had me about to downward spiral, so I took action.  I do not own air fresheners, so went to my cupboard.

I am now simmering a simple pot of water that I put dried rosemary &amp; some lemon juice in.  Now, not only does my house smell amazingly fresh like a spa, but it also considerably boosted my mood.  Very uplifting.  I am going to do this the next time I am in a funk!  I encourage all to try it ;0"
1062,Looking for the correct terminology of what I experienced,"Yesterday my boyfriend of ~2 years and I broke up. Right after we hung up, I experienced an [emotional breakdown?], and I would love to know what it is commonly refered to as so that I can do proper research on the topic. Here’s the timeline:

1. Hung up
2. Broke down crying/hyperventilating on the floor in foetal position
3. Layed in my bed still crying
4. Abruptly stopped crying. Became fully numb
5. I couldn’t think of him anymore
6. Realisation of absolute nihilism; his absence removed my sole purpose in life.
7. Consequently, any action leads right back to the realisation of its lack of fundation, thus rendering its very thought pointless
8. Lack of desires. I need to pee and yet I’d rather piss the bed than go to the bathroom, because of #7
9. Fully immobile, any thoughts annihilates themselves instantly, again because of their lack of existential foundation.
10. Dissociation. My body lays there as I’m on a whole other plane of existence
10. I don’t want to sleep, or drink, or smoke. I want to cease to exist. 

The only thing that kept me from ending it all was the thought of a goal of mine, a secondary purpose, that is to move abroad. It defeated the cyclic nature of nihilism as it lays outside of it’s realm. This goal lies on an illogical attribution of value; nihilism being a fatal yet rational philosophy, it couldn’t touch this irrationality.

I somehow got up to go to the bathroom. My movements were extremly slow, I’m talking 15 seconds to turn a door handle. Went back to my room and I managed to fade into falling asleep. Woke up and got out of bed, took a shower and shared this experience with my mom. She says it sounds like a psychosis, although I feel like that’s not the correct term for it. Does anyone know what this would be refered to as? (Dissociation, numbness, absolute nihilism). I’m doing a lot better today, I still feel sadness when I think about him, but it’s nothing compared to yesterday. I feel like my body completely shutdown to protect myself. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything, even if someone’s life depended on it. 

Some general info, in case it can help: 19, male, gay, never experienced mental illnesses, first break up.

Thank you! :)"

1064,anxiety and frustration,Ok I have always had a battle with my mental health and I feel like since it never was diagnosed as quickly as it should of it has gotten worse. I suffer from GAD and I feel like it doesn’t get as much attention as I want it to. I’m suffering and but I am able to present myself well enough to family and friends. I want to try a new hobby but I get easily frustrated and is a perfectionist. I’m not sure what else is wrong with me?
1065,Frustrations,"It kind of really gets on my nerves when people use my mental illness as ammo to try and hurt me in arguments. Whenever the conversation turns south for the other person, they call you crazy, or psycho, and use the mental illness you have as the reason they choose to call you those things. It also is frustrating that it is usually those people who ""advocate"" for mental illness. The hypocrisy is so ignorant to me. 

Does anyone else experience that? Or have experienced that?"
1066,"I have no motivation and feel so helpless, please help me","Hello, I (22F) experienced depression some years back. After seeing a therapist, sorting out my life and meeting new people, I can proudly say that since 2 years I'm not suicidal anymore, I haven't self harmed, and I stopped self loathing.
However, I never got to regain my motivation and energy. I have a ton of hobby that I love but never do, I chalked it up to being tired after work and that's it's normal to want to chill without doing anything.
I'm now quarantined and I have to face it, I just have zero motivation for doing anything. It really frustrate me because I want to do those things, I'm genuinely interested in them ! What can I do to change that, I feel so sad and helpless..."

I don’t want to get super into it, but she’s very emotionally manipulative and emotionally abusive. If she gets angry, and won’t leave me alone, and will follow me around if pissed off enough. I can’t even escape to my room without her freaking out on me. How do I cope with it? I don’t want to go outside and I want to practice social distancing, but if she get’s to be too much, I will have to leave and go somewhere. Please help"
1069,seeking validation,"I constantly seek validation/approval from others. I will admit my self-esteem is a tad bit low and I do try to cover it up by acting like I don’t care what people think but I do. I wanna be liked.

SN: I do suffer from depression and anxiety and used to go to therapy for it. 

TLDR: I seek approval from others, how do I stop?"
1070,"I don't know how to help my depressed, defeated brother."," 

As the title states, I (23M)really don't know how to help my brother(21M). He is depressed, defeated, I hardly even recognize him. He is a shadow of himself. He honestly reflects Reek from Game of Thrones and it is killing me.

So some backstory, after he graduated high school he decided it was best for him not to go to school because of his grades, attitude and really wasn't ""adult"" enough to take on college whereas I went to college. He was athletic, was the cool kid, had tons of friends. I was the awkward chubby one who had trouble talking to girls and fitting in. Granted, I had an awesome group of close knit friends and he had friends who wanted to party and do stupid shit and didn't prioritize the genuine ones. Throughout school I developed into a person who has confidence, physically fit, and got a great job out of college. I am not saying I am successful or bragging but just giving insight. My brother over the last 4 years has bounced around jobs that haven't given him actual skills and sat around smoking too much pot and other things that he shouldn't be doing in his current situation. Over the last couple months he spent a couple weeks in a voluntary mental rehab hospital, after coming out he has a stable job but just doesn't even resemble the person he used to be.

Currently, I live about an 2 hours away on my own and he still lives with my parents. I don't know how to help him, I have taken him to the gym, tried to talk to him but he doesn't give me anything back. I have invited him to come visit over the weekend but he still doesn't come over.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks"

1072,Stay Connected to a Support System During Covid-19,https://tinaantonstrengthinwords.com/2020/03/18/staying-connected-to-a-support-system-during-covid-19/
1073,Seeking advice on my mental health,"Hey everyone, I’ve recently become more interested in mental health and have been questioning whether or not the issues I (16F) have been dealing with are normal or not (I’m a teenager and know for a fact that we can be pretty moody). I don’t want to jump the gun and see a doctor yet. I’ve talked to my mom about this but she more or less shot it down. Any advice is welcomed.

1: Trouble concentrating- I always find myself unintentionally letting my mind wander during conversations and lectures and am almost constantly fidgeting. I’ve always struggled with this and I almost always have to ask a friend to repeat themselves when we are talking. More so, I always find myself losing my train of thought—sometimes even in the middle of conversations. I have to literally retrace my steps through the conversation to remind myself what I was going to talk about. I also have a bad habit of trying to finish others sentences during conversations. It happens a lot and it really annoys me.

2: Constantly overthinking- God, where do I begin. I guess with an example. Imagine if you get a 17/20 on a quiz, and one of your friends gets a 19/20. If this happens to me, it puts a total damper on my mood. I always end up beating myself up about that 2 point difference for the rest of the day and start doubting myself. If something like this happens at the start of the day, I’m likely thinking about it until I fall asleep. There was one time that I had to go upstage to get an award but turned the wrong way to get off stage. I felt as though everyone was laughing at me or judging me and immediately texted my mom complaining and seeking moral support. I hate when these situations occur, because it ends up screwing up my mood for the rest of the day.

3: Intense mood swings/shyness- Most of the time I feel kind of numb. I struggle to join into conversations and laugh at jokes my friends make. Some days I cant even bring myself to talk to others—even if there is something I really want to share with them. This has made it extremely difficult to form close relationships with others, and, for lack of a better word, it just makes me feel shitty. This mood can last anywhere from one or two days to entire weeks, and I’m not really sure how to fix it. Occasionally, I have moments of happiness that are accompanied by huge bursts of confidence. This often happens when I’m having a good day and alone with someone I feel comfortable around. I feel like I’m bouncing off the walls. My thoughts are always racing and I laugh a lot. It’s nice, but it always makes me feel pretty awkward afterwards. These moods don’t last that long. The majority of the time I crash at noon and go back to my “normal” “reclusive” mood. I think the longest one I’ve had is about 3 days, I think they happen weekly? I don’t feel like I’ve been able to find a happy medium and just want to start feeling happier and more comfortable around others.

4: Loneliness- I moved to the U.K. a little less than a year ago. This meant leaving my best friend of 8 years and several other close friends. I was able to find a group of friends at my new school fairly quickly, but I feel detached from all of them. I don’t feel like I’m truly close to any of them. The one girl I thought I was really close to (let’s call her Elle) ended up being a bit of a floater and people-pleaser. I got into an argument with another close friend (she started spreading rumors about me, yay), and Elle didn’t even bother asking for my side of the story. She automatically stuck with the side with the larger number of people and assumed I was in the wrong. Another friend I had also decided it was okay to share personal things I told her about myself with others without my consent. I really don’t know what else to say about that one, it just really hurt. All in all, I just feel very lonely. These instances have made me extremely distrustful of everyone in my friend group and truly just make me feel very isolated.

5: Indecisiveness- I am always second guessing myself. Always. Any time I want to buy something, I always have to ask another person for their opinion on it and debate whether or not I deserve it. I tend to become pretty dependent on others because of this. Even for small things like what I should wear to an event, what color shirt I should buy, what color paint I should use on a particular drawing. It has gotten to a point where I asked my parents whether or not I should make the line-art for someone’s eyebrows thick or thin. I struggle to make little decisions like these and it’s really frustrating.

6: No incentive to do anything- As I mentioned earlier, I moved to the U.K. a little less than a year ago now. I jumped straight into year 11, the year before GCSEs, with no knowledge of last years work. For a little context, I am from the U.S. and have always been at the top of my class. Now that I am here, I find myself struggling to complete tasks because the deadline is so far away. I’ve always been used to having to do unit tests and pop quizzes, so I was always studying. Now that I am here, nothing really seems to matter. Tests, quizzes, and homework don’t effect your overall grade (I suppose that they do now lol– thanks COVID-19) so I don’t feel any real need to study. I still get good grades, it’s just that nothing seems to interest me enough to study intensively. 

Thanks for reading if you stuck this far. Truly. I hope you all stay safe during these times."

1080,Going back o work,"for the last 2 years i have been out of work, thanks to a nasty break-off from my previous job, that i thought would be my forever job, about my mental health. im living at home with my parents and i know money is tough. but im constantly being harrassed about going back to work. i understand they think im lazy and yes i am, but i have a severe fear of going back to work. ive had 5 jobs altogether and all have ended bad. the first i was bullied and had to leave, the second went into liquidation, the third i was embarrassed and shamed infront of customers, the fourth was the one i thought would last forever but was unfairly dissmissed and the last was temporary and i was treated like i knew nothing. im not sure what to do. ive tried going into a workplacement centre where they help people find jobs, but havent heard anything in months. everytime ive tried to hand in a resume i got the shakes and started sweating as well as feeling sick and light headed. am i just avoiding work because im lazy as my parents say, or what? sorry dont know where else to ask. TIA"
1081,Seeking advice,"(I'm not a native english speaker so i appologize in advance)

Hi, I'm a 17 year old guy, who was normally really happy and confident. I enjoy many hobbys like riding motorcycles and listening to rock n roll / metal music. I am especially passionate about playing the guitar and really want to persue it as a career because I have quite a gift for it (accordiing to other guitar players I know). I am not the best looking guy but I'm also not the worst. I attend a type of middle school that is known for being very hard and intese. I have good grades and don't have a hard time fitting in with my peers. Everybody in my family is okay and have no problems...  
What I'm trying to say is that my life's going pretty well and that I have no need to worry or be stressed, but for a while now I've been feeling really unmotivated, bored and suicidal at times. I'm starting to lose interests in the things I once loved. I hardly, if ever, feel the the urge and motivation to play guitar which is strange bc I love music, guitar and everything inbetween.  


I have no idea what is happening to me. I feel empty, like nothing brings me happiness anymore and would really like some advice because I just feel lost and alone.  
I would really like to persue my dream of making the guitar my job and the fact that I'm losing interest in my own dream makes me feel really scared and worried.  


If any of this makes any sense please give me a good advice, because I clearly can't deal with this on my own..."
1082,How to Manage Own and Others' Depression When Trapped Together?,"In short, due to this virus scare, I am confined to working from home with multiple people, and all of us have some form of diagnosed depression, anxiety, or both. Depression has been the main problem so far. And as you can imagine, a household of folk that can turn withdrawn, dismissive, moody, non-caring, and unbudging at a drop of a dime and all influence each other is not great.

I care deeply about these people, and while I can't really speak to their experiences, this is part of why this is so difficult. I want to help them (one person, especially), but my multiple attempts at both directly asking how I can help and trying to suggest/implement ways to support have fallen flat. And, on my part, because I have this attachment, my own mental state gets worse, which I know cannot be helpful to them, either.

As it seems as though this person tends to be more responsive when interacting with another member of the household and not me, it almost seems as though the best way to help is to say I am available when they want it and keep myself in my room in the meantime. We all affect each other negatively, and isolation hurts me, too, but it feels like this painful attempts to help hurt more for both of us. I both want to be reached out to but also left alone in hopes that it would help us both more. And yet hearing them close their doors hurts, too. 

No matter what, this is bad and I don't know what to do. I know a typical response would be that I need to care for myself first, but when we are this close physically and our mental states are this tied together, I have no idea how that would look like.

Any suggestions?"
1083,How do I find what I'm passionate about after being depressed,I'm trying to make a positive change in my life and part of that is trying to set some career goals doing what I think I would be happy doing. The thing is that I've been depressed for so long that I think that I've forgotten or I don't know what I was ever passionate about. What are some things I could do to maybe help me.
1084,Getting Diagnosed? Getting Medication? (US),"  

So I received a bit of a talking-to at work today.

Two of my managers said they’ve noticed my work ethic basically going to shit. One manager lamented that I’ve taken no ownership of anything, that I push things off onto my coworkers. The other manager said he’s caught me staring at my screen for long minutes even when my phone rings. And that simple things they know I’m capable of doing I treat like an impossible task.

One manager said “I saw you give something to someone else that I know you’re perfectly capable of doing. You said you knew you’d mess it up. Why do you think that?”

I told him I think that about everything… and they suggested I talk to someone about how I’ve been feeling because it’s affecting the business but they refuse to give up on me.

Well, I’ve been thinking that I might have anxiety-depression. I’ve had this worry for a long time. I really do panic about little things. I’m constantly afraid my husband is angry with me, and then feel like I can do nothing about it. I just wallow in the feelings. I’m almost used to them at this point, but that doesn’t mean I enjoy them. I’ve gone to my PCP about it, who said I need to change my diet and exercise more.

Honestly though, I don’t know if me saying “I think I have anxiety-depression” means I actually have it. Someone once said that a person with a mental illness can’t actually recognize it, because that would make them mentally healthy. (I’m making it more PC… the actual quote was “a crazy person doesn’t know they’re crazy”…)

I fear that I ramble, and I do ramble. I’m in a constant state of fear that everyone thinks I’m a liar, a drama queen, that even this post is stupid and a waste of peoples’ time. I feel sorry for myself and then hate myself for feeling that way. I’m even sorry I’m posting this because it seems like the answer is probably right in my face and I just can’t figure it out.

Also, I’ve spoken to a doctor about it. My primary care doctor, I went to her about 2 years ago and told her that I’m worried I have anxiety, and that I am depressed. She asked if I had suicidal thoughts. I said no. She advised me to change up my diet, eat better food – and to exercise more.

Well, I’m at this point where I actually have changed my eating habits and I do exercise. I’m healthier than I’ve ever been… but the feelings are *worse*. I drive my husband crazy with my constant fear. I published a book last year and I can’t finish the sequel because I just stare at the screen for a bit then go and lie down. I’ve described feelings that people tell me are symptoms of an anxiety attack. I force myself through these attacks.

I don’t want to feel this way anymore, though. I want to feel better. I want to be confident so I can do my job. I want to write. I want medication! I want medication because diet, exercise, and taking deep breaths &amp; counting to ten/meditation hasn’t done anything. And now other people are taking notice and it’s affecting my work and relationships. I have a friend who said he'd felt like I do and his doctor gave him medication and it's helped immensely.

I’m asking for two pieces of advice – 1, does it actually sound like I might have a mental illness? And 2 – how do I tell a doctor “I don’t need to lose weight, I need medication”? Is there a specific route I have to take to before I can get diagnosed and get prescription?"
1085,My dad randomly stopped using lexapro,"So my dad has been on a medication called lexapro. He had been doing pretty well lately while being on it. About a month ago, he decided to stop using it. He never consulted a doctor or therapist about this and never told me that he was going this until he already stopped using it. Ever since then, he has been going crazy. He has been getting extremely mad at trivial things, he has stopped cleaning his house, and hasn’t been working since this occurred.

I don’t necessarily live with him, because he is divorced and I am at my moms house 3/4ths of the time. What should be done about this? Should I do anything to fix this? Because I feel like he is ruining all of his relationships including his relationship with me. I just want things to be normal again."
1086,Anxiety due to being conscious?,"Every day I think to myself, ""Is this it? This is what consciousness is like?""

I cannot help but think to myself that I am a collection of atoms and that everything is made of atoms and that the only difference between me and the computer I am typing on is what atoms it is made of and how they are arranged. 

I do not like this. 

You know how when you play a video game and after a while it gets boring? That is my life right now. I am playing that same video game over and over again, trying to play it a different way just to make it more fun, but it is already boring and I am sick of playing it. 

My life is like listening to the same song over and over again. It was OK to hear it for the third time, but after listening to it for hundreds of times, it is getting annoying and it is driving me insane. I need to find the stop button but it is not there. 

""What is stopped me from doing X?"" 

That question haunts me every day. I get pleasure from eating junk food. If I like eating junk food and it makes me feel good, why not eat junk food forever? I should just keep on eating junk food over and over again. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that eating junk food is bad. This is a ""fire extinguisher"" reaction that activates, telling me it is bad to eat junk food. Then I get anxiety and make myself stop. 

""What is stopping me from drinking bleach?"" That is because it will be a horrible and painful death! But pain is simply an input going into the brain. These inputs can be manipulated or even turned off. ""But why would I want to do this in the first place?"" Because I could die. ""But I will die anyway!"" Yes but not without living your life first. ""What is the purpose of being alive, to just experience it? Is it pleasure? So why not do everything you can to maximize pleasure?"" The meaning of our lives is subjective and varies between each individual. One can infer that biologically, the meaning of life is procreation and preservation of the species. ""So my purpose in life is to procreate?"" If that is what you want then sure. 

Some people panic when they are high or drunk. I am one of those people. I stopped drinking because I will panic. There is something about being in an altered state of mind that triggers this response. Why I cannot enjoy being drunk, I do not know. The fact that I cannot make the drunk feeling stop right away is one reason, but also the fear that I will be in that state indefinitely.  

But now I panic because I am conscious."
1087,Multiple Personality Disorder?,"Is it possible to have a multiple personality disorder without acctually having different characters inside you?

I think i might have this.
My ""Personality"" can be extremely different from time to time.
From being angry, frustrated and maybe even manic.
To having a breakdown and being really sad for almost no fucking reason at all.
(Not sure if its bipolar, but its definitly more than deppresed vs happy episodes) 

Anyone recognizes this or knows anything about it?
Any comments would be highly appreciated."
1088,I'm unstable and alone,"Sorry for long rant.
Literally the only person I have is my boyfriend. But I'm so crazy at times and can tell he's been ready to leave. For the most part I try my hardest to make him happy. I always help him whenever I can. We play around a lot, cuddle, and we have a pretty good sex life. The only problem is that at times I can be really unstable and I can't control my emotions.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and I've been on medication for a month now. I thought I was doing better until yesterday. We got in an argument and he wanted to take me home, but my parents had kicked me out. That's when I realized I have no one else. Some of my friends read my messages, but didn't reply.
My parents hate me pretty much, my friends don't seem interested in me, and my boyfriend is ready to leave me (don't blame him)

I just feel alone. I feel like if I died no one would really care. Sorry for the rant, I have no one to talk about it with."
1089,Conflicted,"So this is hard to explain but i have this thing that i sometimes wanna kill everyone in a gruesome way, its a very strong urge and i also see the images in front of me. But i also sometimes turn really good and selfless and wanna help others. These mindsets are very random and conflict eachother alot. I used to violently beat myself in the face with my fist when i got overwelmed. And this happened multiple Times a day, whenever something happens that i disliked. The headaches where pretty bad, but anyway. I have this pure evil and pure goodness in me and its really turnjng me insane. I sometimes feel like shoving a knife in my head to cool my brain off. Who has the same thing?"
1090,I hate my body because I'm fat,"Ironically I'm not that overweight either, and I logically know this (5'9, 175lb) but I hate how fat my thighs are and I hate how large my breasts are. If I could I would take a knife and carve away at my skin. It gets way worse when I'm near my period because my body swells because of hormones. It's literally to the point where I have tried committing suicide over it before and I regularly self harm during that time of the month because I hate myself that much. I wish I was a muscular man who was toned and shit but I know that's impossible so I'll just kill myself honestly
I tried going to my doctor about the fact that I might have pre menstrual disorder but I got ""hunny that's normal"". I'm seriously considering becoming a man just so people will actually take me seriously and not talk to me like I'm 12 when I'm 20 fucking years old. Whatever, jokes on my doctor when I kill myself and they could have prevented it by just listening to me"
1091,"I think I've had ADD for years, but I never followed up on it. Any advice on how to deal with things before I get proper help?","Hi,

I'm an adult male, 27, and I think I may have had ADD since high school. I used to be a straight A student and around the end of 10th grade, I almost failed my Advanced English Class. I had an A-streak in that class and something happened and towards the end I got an F, but the teacher bumped the average up for the whole class to save my ass.

After that, I noticed other things here and there and I found myself trying to Google what the hell was wrong with me. I found some sites talking about ADD or ADHD and I was almost in tears because I thought that all the bs that I was thinking and doing (mostly not doing, really) was because I was just a lazy ass and I hated myself for it. At that time I brought this up to my mom (sweet woman, but horribly misunderstood mental health) and she said to me ""no you don't have ADD, you're just so lazy"". So definitive. What really pounded the nail into that coffin was that I was pushing this and I was showing her all the facts and how it lined up with what I felt and how I act, and she ended the convo by yelling ""YOU DON'T HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS WHO ARE CRAZY, OKAY?!"".

I think that messed me up more than I realized, because I never got this checked even when I was living on my own. I never bothered to follow up on this, and whatever effects of ADD I (possibly) go through, I would blame on myself.

I notice small things like my room being so unorganized before and my motivation in my classes during college was just not there. Even in dire situations I just wouldn't do certain projects. Once I completely blew off my Marketing final presentation, which we had all semester to do, and I didn't do it until the night before I had to present.

There are also many points recently where I was learning through online resources and I would have a drive like I've never had before. I found out about an opportunity to go to Japan, so I was teaching myself Japanese from the ground up. I would also find tutorials for other things from different websites and I would actually teach myself things and get pretty damn good. After about a month of each I would just completely drop whatever it was.

There were also certain times when I would be my most forgetful. They would be simple things, too. This forgetfulness bit me in the ass in the workplace quite a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

BOTTOM LINE --   
There are many examples I could think of that line up with other peoples' stories. For years I just brush these off as me being lazy or forgetful. I don't know which excuse is more frustrating. I moved back in with my mom and family for now, and I dropped everything for the time being to take care of her. So I'm with her again, and I don't think I'll be able to get myself checked for now, but when I move back out I'll try to find help for this.

Part of me wants to brush this under the rug as I always have, but I think I've been doing that for too long. Sometimes I think about the things I start but never finish. I think about the people who put me down for being 'forgetful' or 'lazy'. I accepted those before and it brings down my confidence and mood like there's something wrong with me. I want to maybe get tested and see if I do, in fact, have ADD or something else that might be holding me back.

As soon as I can get myself checked, how and where would I do this? What proper doctor do you go to with concerns about mental health?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. If there's another more fitting sub, please just send me that way. Part of me doesn't want to even post this because I'm thinking of how silly it all sounds. But lately, the person I usually vent to is preoccupied, and sometimes I don't feel like I can talk to my family. So, strangers on the internet, if there's any advice or help you can give my way then I'd appreciate that a whole lot.

**TL;DR -- I think I may have had ADD for a while and it's been affecting me in many aspects of my life. I've been brushing it under the rug but blaming myself and ignoring the real issue may have made it worse. I needed to vent some of this out one way or another and I'll take any advice I can get. Thanks, people.**

Also, is there any open chat room for people who want to vent things out? Does something like that exist?"
1092,I’ve relapsed.,"After nearly a year of staving off my urges I’ve relapsed and self- harmed again. Thoughts were relentless and overwhelming, and the guilt in the aftermath even more so. The shame makes me want to do it again. It’s a fucking cycle. I’m down on my knees fighting the pull so bad. It’s taking every ounce of my being to have the strength to resist. I tried to wait it out for hours last night. I’ve tried doing something else but ugly thoughts came so fast it was like swimming through a waterfall. The methods I’ve used previously failed. 

I don’t how else to continue."
1093,Do you find having a S/O with mental health issues exhausting? #vent,"My S/O is currently going through a particular bad time in regards to his mental health. I’m finding it mentally exhausting. I love him and I want to support him. However, one day
he shouts at me, pushes me away (not physically) and emotionally shuts me out. Then the next he’s telling me he can’t live without me and needs me and cries on my shoulder. 
I want to do the right thing by him but I never know what person he’ll be that day and I’m finding it really difficult. 
Has anyone got any advice?"
1094,need some advice,"does anyone have any advice for how i can learn to not stop isolating myself from my friends and people who care about me? but in a way that isn’t just “force urself to hang out” because i want to want to hang out too and i feel very emotionally already so just the thought of forcing myself to interact with ppl is making me want to die 
(also i mean this like in general i’m self isolating rn because of the virus dw but i just don’t call or talk to friends and its been a problem for a long time and i wasnt hanging out with ppl even before the outbreak)"
1095,Depersonalising,"I have been depersonalising for three weeks after I smoked weed. I had one of the most terrifying panic attack driven highs of my life and ended up waking up completely depersonalised. I have read up a small bit where I was told not to research anyhing and continue with my life as normal, but I feel I have reached a breaking point. I get moments of terrifying anxiety randomly throughout the day while I try to cope. I cannot see a therapist since it is hard to get an appointment now due to the Coronavirus pandemic. I can't even talk to anyone since I feel they don't understand my situation. I'll explain my symptoms and they will continue to say ""oh I feel that all the time"". I felt a little like this before but never at this scale. I do not feel in my body at all and my conscious is constantly cloudy. I just wish things were back to normal."
1096,People think if you have poor mental you shouldn’t marry. I disagree,"Someone in a former post of mine said that you should only marry if you have fixed mental health issues before marrying bc otherwise it would “lower their quality of life” you would be “inflicting yourself” on them and they “deserve better than you”

This would all be very inappropriate to say about a person with a physical illness that wants to marry, why is it ok to someone with a mental illness?"
1097,Am I too far gone? Is it too late to be who I could have been?,"I hate who I've become. I hate feeling this way. I hate thinking this way. I'm sick of doubting myself and everything I say or do. I'm sick of thinking I'm not good enough. I'm sick of thinking I'm too ugly for this or too stupid for that. I literally think I'm too ugly and dumb to live a normal happy life. 

Some thoughts of mine:
""You're too ugly to ever find love""
""You're too ugly to ever be loved""
""You're too stupid to ever find love""
""You're too stupid for life""
""You're too stupid to help yourself""
""You're too stupid to do this. Or to do that""
""You're too ugly for this. Or for that""
""You're not good enough for this or that""
""You're not worthy of love""
""You're not worthy of good things others take for granted.""
""You're stupid""
""You're ugly""
""You're unworthy""
""You're not good enough""
""You're 19 and have never been in a relationship. Its because you're ugly, stupid, worthless, and a failure.""
""You're 19 and haven't even finished high school. It's because how fucking stupid you are. You don't have any mental health issues or depression. Stop blaming your poor choices and your lack of happiness on them. Your life sucks because you're ugly and stupid.""
""You're too fucked up to ever recover""
""You're too stupid to change""

I'm sick of these negative thoughts. All day every day just escaping from these thoughts and feelings. Then beating myself up because I didn't do anything productive. Smoking weed and playing video games only to have an iota of happiness. Superficial happiness. Then hating myself for it afterwards and continuing this downward spiral. 

Crying over how fucked I've become and nothing I do will ever fix it. Crying over how it's all my fault and how I could have turned out so much differently. Crying over how much I've missed out on in my life. Over how many opportunities I've squandered. Over how I wasted my potential. Over how I can't break this cycle. And even if I do I cry over my past mistakes and regrets. 

I feel developmentally stunted beyond repair and I just want all this to end. I wish that memory wiper gizmo from MIB was real haha. But then who knows how fucked I'd be without the awareness of it all.

Even if I could change all this I'd regret wasting so much time in my life. All of my teen years gone. I would then be filled with so much regret.

Regretting:

Dropping out of high school

Isolating self from everyone and never developing social skills.

Not knowing who my friends and family actually are.

Never developing relationship skills or ever being in a relationship with someone.

Never living my life. Just existing.

Never realizing my potential.

Letting life happen to me.

Never developing myself.

Never exploring what life has to offer.

Letting fear, insecurity, and anxiety live my life for me.

Being a coward and not taking action and working for what I want.

Fuck I wish I had a reset button.

Not having an idea of WHO I AM. I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know my values. I don't know what I want from life truly. I don't have opinions of my own. I have no drive. No ambition. No skills. No talents. I'm like a robot that just woke up finally from a 19 year coma and became a human. But the tragic comedy of it is that I have to move forward and live with the fact that I wasted all this time and I'll be playing catch up for the rest of my life. I wish I could just forget my past and move forward, but it's my past who made me who I am today. I feel fucked beyond repair. I wish I could just change all this but it seems so unrealistic. Like me? Yeah fucking right. You'll never live a happy life. A life you dream of. No no you're just too fucking stupid. 

I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. Is there something wrong with my brain? All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY?

I'm 19 and it feels like my life is slipping away from me. It feels someone else is living my life for me and I'm just observing it. I'm existing and not living at all. I want to stop wasting my life and do something with it but how can I change all this if I don't even know myself or what I want or where to start?

This has been going on for over 6 years now.

All in all I feel like I could change. Through help of a professional or any other options for someone like me. But I feel like I still wouldn't be who I could have been if that makes sense. I have to live with the fact that first 19 years of my life were completely wasted. How I'd have to work so fucking hard to even possibly become who I could have been. And if I chose that path it might be more time wasted. I'd be so busy working on myself and improving myself so I can live my life that I ironically would be missing out on it.

I hate myself so much. I'm so lost and confused I need help"
1098,I feel like Britney Spears mental health 2007,"I’m very worried. I tend to listen a lot of Britney Spears music and I start to feel like my mental health is on same level like her. I have a rocky partner and I’m living with him. We don’t take drugs but I drink a lot... I’m always playing video games which increases sometimes my depression. 
Corona virus is affecting me like hell. I am panicked by that. I feel like my life is really wasted at some point. I’m a very loved person but I don’t know how to keep it well for others. I have to stop doing the same and same things, (which it’s contradicting cause I hate routines)

She have rituals for everything, it effects her and our lifes, yet my parents don't want her to go to psychiatrist. My dad think he can fix this by himself when I'm 99% sure he can't... I need help, I don't know what to do at this point, personally I can't handle what she's doing anymore. And if someone says anything about rituals she become agreesive or start crying."

1101,Emotional health," 

So I am part of this youth foundation group and we are big on mental health. Learning about yourself/emotional intelligence is something I personally think should be more available. Singer songwriter Jewel is actually hosting a quarantine concert Saturday at 5pm PT / 8pm ET through her facebook live and instagram. It will have to do a lot with not only mental health but staying calm in times of panic (such as now). This will benefit a lot of families whose parents are losing their jobs to the corona crisis as well. [https://www.facebook.com/jeweljk/](https://www.facebook.com/jeweljk/)"

1105,Do I have diabetes?,"So it's been two days since I'm asking myself this. I am 17, weight 70kg, 6'1 and practice no sport. I've been going from a pshycopogist to manage my CD(conduct disorder or sociopathy condition), and ever since my girlfriend left me, I started eating a lot and by a lot I mean an increase in foot not to underestimate. I eat at least one whole package ofnpopcorns per day, at least three kinder chocolate snacks per day and some biscuits, and it's been ever since 2 days ago I have a huge anxiety, accelerated heartbeat, blurry vision and major depressive thoughts alongside an already increased OCD. Was it the pill, or was it actually my bad chorestelor? I personally think the latter, considering a medicine's effect would've already passed by now."

I snap at my amazing boyfriend all the time even though he never deserves it, and I’m rude to the rest of my family. I don’t even mean to do it, when my family asks me anything, without thinking I respond super nasty to them even though I don’t mean to. If they keep me on a longer conversation, within seconds of talking I’m already irritated and pissed off that I have to talk to them. Even simple little things that never would’ve gotten a negative or rude response from me before, like being asked to do simple chores, brings out this super nasty and rude version of myself within seconds. It happens so fast I can’t even control it. This has been happening every single day for a while now and I really don’t know why. Any ideas on what might be happening?"

1111,how to be happy w out depending on someone,"I haven’t truly been happy since like 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I turn 21 in a few days. I was too young to realize what was going on around me and then life started falling apart in 2015: family got evicted and we were homeless, I was dealing with bulimia and anorexia and never got help or attention from family/friends, entered my first relationship with a narcissist and/or sociopath that did a lot of damage, several family members died within that time and I lost my first childhood friend to a car crash, also I got in two serious car wrecks my first two years of driving which put a lot of stress on my family and me.




For background I’ve always had a rocky relationship with my family, even now I’ve always felt alienated and lonely in my own house. I had a lot of friends growing up but once all that happened I pushed everyone away. So I graduated hs and went onto college with depression and anxiety for the first time, and I’m about to be a senior in college and I can’t say I’ve made any real friendships that lasted longer than a semester except one and college itself has been full of depression anxiety and loneliness. I’m grateful for my one friend but she’s got her own life.



So I compensate by dating guys who I center my life and actions around. As mentioned before my first relationship gave me a very poor outlook on how healthy relationships should work and my parents are beyond unhealthy (dad is autistic and a damaged person overall my mom is pretty judgmental, neither feel any happiness and pretty much just live beside each other). I think I’m a fantastic girlfriend and I get soooo hurt when they break up with me and don’t want to work things out. A week ago I was broken up with after my longest relationship to date with my absolute best friend (2yrs) and I’m so heartbroken and broken in general. We tried to be friends during this quarantine thing but he’s already moving on and I told him I can’t be there to watch so I can’t speak to him or see him anymore.



Anyways it’s shown me that I haven’t been happy for however long and always depend on others to be happy. Maybe it’s not healthy to be alone as much as I am without a boyfriend or any friends or family to count on but this quarantine thing is hell for me and is throwing me back into suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to do that at all I just want to feel okay and hopefully happy one day. I know it won’t come easily or quickly but I’m willing to put in the work I just need direction. Much thanks to anyone who can read this and help me out."
1112,Struggling to feel awake,"Hey you guys. I've (26f) been off. For a long while now..

I aways, daily, constantly, have a feeling like I'm dreaming or.... Like, I can't really see every thing. Or experience my life....

I have been depressed for over a decade... I know how to fight those serious lows and survive.

This feels different. It's been almost 6 months since I've really been started noticing this feeling of missing something very important.

I get the feeling a lot when I'm driving for work... I moved to Norway 8 years ago and still feel surprised by the sudden beauty and foreignness of this land.
Especially when it's the rare sunny day here like today.

As I said, I always have this nagging feeling like I am constantly dreaming or not capable of experiencing life.

But sometimes, for a few moments every day, the feeling becomes so extremely overwhelming that I feel like screaming and running into the cold waters, just to try to wake up. It's really suffocating, these moments. 

I recently started a new job (and meeting new people) and I find myself doing stupid things for just the thrills. It's not self sabotaging... Errr maybe it is.

Today though, I've been working a lot the last few weeks... I.. Well, I made a bit of a fool out of myself. And it boil down to me trying to feel alive again.

I'm feeling worse than ever now and wonder how cringe worthy I am in the eyes of a coworker who I wanted to befriend. 

It wasn't that bad really.... But I'm still really angry with myself and embarrassed. 

Anyway, I'm sure this is a common feeling people suffer with since I'm sure the hell super fucking basic. 

Can anyone help shed some light on this issue for me? Thanks in advance.

1113,"Worth starting to look for a therapist, with just 6-7 months left of being able to see them?","First off, I'm not actively suicidal. There's no immediate danger here for me, so don't worry about anything like that.

I do however dislike living much more than I like it, so I'm not *averse* to the idea of getting rid of myself somewhere down the line if I still feel that way. Years, probably decades away, that is.

I constantly hear people saying that folks in mental situations like that should see a therapist. I've got good insurance, so I'd be willing to try, but...

The problem is, my ""good insurance"" is completely because of my parents. I've waited an unfortunately long time before actually seriously considering this, so I'm turning 26 in about half a year. After that, insurance goes poof, and then as far as I'm aware, there's no way I can afford any therapist who doesn't work in a sweatshop-callcenter.

So my question is not *if* a therapist can be helpful, but *how* helpful they can be in that short a timeframe? Is it something that if you start and then stop so quickly, you run the risk of having some negative amount of benefit due to needing to stop? Or is it something that ""even a little bit is better than nothing""?"
1114,Will people notice the difference?," Well... I don't know where to start but... ok. In the past I have done  some things which I am really not proud of. One day I realized that  those things aren't going to work. So I made a plan, I went to see a  therapist but I have to wait a whole year cuz' our heath system is  fucked up, but anyways I have changed my attitude, my behavior  apologized to people and things got a little better... at least I  thought so. As it turned out I did change, but I have a feeling that  people don't care. No one ever calls me, I know a lot of people but I  don't really have no one to turn to when the times are hard and I think I  am a bit to old to find friends who I can really call friends and who  will stay with me for at least a good period of time (23)... Literally I  think I am fucked. The problem is also with meeting people, since I  live in a little town where everybody knows everybody, I don't think  things are gonna change. Do you think people will notice the difference after some time or have I already fucked everything up to his level that  there is no going back?  I am kind of weird, trying to do my best to be somehow ""normal"", to fit  in just a little but looks like this is not going to work. Any  suggestions?"

But now I feel like I have zero friends. I have a couple good friends but they don’t really like to go out or hang out. So I barely see them.

It’s really hard to make friends in my job. You work with someone once and never again. I feel like I don’t have much to look forward to. I sleep a lot during the day and am not too motivated to do much especially during this time with the virus. I got laid off and now I got to apply for unemployment. 

I’m wondering if this is a sign to pick another job. I like the benefits and the pay but I like social connections. Maybe I should give it more time? I’m not sure. But I’m not very happy lately and I feel like I need to do something before it gets worse. I feel very lonely."

Or do I do a job that pays well with all the perks and benefits? But when I think I've decided on something I panic, then I change my mind and repeat. I won't take any kind of step to do anything. I need to finish highschool and every time I think about it I get sick. I'm 22. I feel absolutely stupid for not being further in life by now. And my partner is disappointed in me because I don't have that drive in life. I can't just get out of bed to start the day. I don't just walk into that school office. Instead I sit and wallow over all the things I should have done. I feel like ever step I try and take I'm ten behind."
1122,Expectations were bringing me down and I didn't even realize how bad it was,"I want to preface this by saying that expectations are incredibly sneaky and if we don't reflect regularly they can get it our way in so many different ways. Here's my experience and some of the expectations that had snuck up on me.....
&amp;nbsp;

So recently I was feeling very down about ""not having enough time"" and ""being behind in life"". As a young female I always kind of felt that there is some timeline in which I have to become a *success*, because after that I'm having kids and that's that. Until very recently I didn't even realize there was a choice not to do so.. I just never thought rationally. Another thing was finding a job I love. I always thought I would have done so by now. This crushed me inside.
&amp;nbsp;

So I watched a video about giving your projects at least a years time before you start objectively judging your progress, since things need the time to mature. I always wanted to make videos talking about things and I finally started doing it last year which was both scary and awesome. So I decided to give this 3 years, no pressure, no expectation, just love. I subsequently realized that this made me enjoy myself and let go of my fear. I searched inside myself and found that same pressure and fear in terms of kids or a job and so many other things.
&amp;nbsp;

I decided that it also takes time and that's fine and I don't have to expect anything, just get things that I want and be patient about them.
&amp;nbsp;

What else?
&amp;nbsp;

- Expectations were barring my relationships. I never knew how much I was ""allowed"" to expect from a man. As if anyone could define this for me.. I should have just listened to what I needed and not asked what I should expect.
&amp;nbsp;
- University.. not only did I choose IT because my art teacher said I would be a poor designer for years, but I also went there to get ""real"" life skills. Well, I love IT and it's super interesting, but now I have a whole life ahead of me to do something that I don't love. That's fine, I don't need to hold on to it forever
&amp;nbsp;
- Expecting things from friends
&amp;nbsp;
- Family expectations (you should love them! Get along!all that stuff)
&amp;nbsp;
- Expecting that if I do X I will get Y.. for example if I clean the house my boyfriend will be thankful. No, if I clean the house, the house will be clean, that's alll I can realistically expect.
&amp;nbsp;
-  Expecting to get things in return in general
&amp;nbsp;
- I also don't want to raise people's expectations by giving unrealistic compliments and advice. And I don't like receiving it anymore if it isn't honest. I love critique, because it actually means the person cares and wants to help me grow. A bunch of 🔥🔥🔥 on Instagram any person that doesn't give a cent about you can write.
&amp;nbsp;

So these are some of the ways I realized expectations were burdening me and probably still are. I'm trying to be more mindful of them, because they really creep up so easy.
&amp;nbsp;

Maybe this helps you think about yours and you have some that I didn't talk about that we can also have a look at? Please share?
&amp;nbsp;
I wrote a lot on this topic and put my thoughts into one of my recent videoa that I make (the passion) it's about where expectations come from and what they do to our mental health if you are interested: https://youtu.be/r-40Xdo9NTA would love it if you stop by...
&amp;nbsp;

Other than that I'm looking forward to your input and talking about this.
 &amp;nbsp;

Stay healthy!"
1123,What am I supposed to do?,"My life is a mess. At school, I have either too much energy so that one of my friends gets annoyed or I'm too quiet. Sometimes I feel like talking and goofing around is a way to hide the fact that I'm not really doing well. Nobody seems to notice at all... Before when I was feeling down I was quieter, but that didn't really work since people saw that I was unwell. So now when I'm more talkative and stuff I don't think they have a clue. I really don't know how to act around them anymore.

That's my way of hiding my emotions and now with the possibility of school closing and all that stuff, everything has gotten worse... I wouldn't be able to stand to be home all-day. I may not like school but at least I get away from home. My mom can really be a lot sometimes. So if we did online school she would be annoyed and tell me to do it all the time.

I really feel like I'm ready to talk to someone about what's going on but I don't know who.... Like my friends are nice, but they won't really listen. Also, that one friend who gets annoyed by me most of the time is often on to me about doing my school work... She doesn't understand how hard it is for me to actually get myself to do it. Nobody actually understands not even me. I don't want to die but sometimes I don't want to live either. What should I do? I don't know who I could talk too... 

I could talk to someone at school but I pretty recently got a new mentor and I don't know him. I miss my previous one I could easily have talked to her. She would've probably helped me find someone to talk too. 

Last term at school I had a really hard time eating lunch. It sucked, and now I feel like that's coming back. I feel so tired and exhausted at school. We also have a new school nurse now... she seems nice I guess. The one before said that she could've eaten lunch with me and then I said no. I kinda regret that because right now I think that it would really help. Anyhow, it is what it is. I just have to try to keep it together.  Sometimes I just wish someone would notice my pain.

Before I enjoyed going to school a little at least because I got to see my friends. But now that is just one more thing making me want to stay at home. In some classes, I get a lot of help to keep up, I'm behind everywhere else. 

I'm sick of my friend telling me to do work at school while at the same time my mom is onto me all the time at home. All of our conflicts are basically only about school. Not even my mentor is telling me to do better at school on a daily basis. He just kinda leaves it up to me and the student care manager. 

I am really sorry for writing this long but I just had to get it out. When I get mad I really want to hit something to get my energy out and feel the pain... Is it just me? and Its that considered self-harm?"
1124,Social distancing got me paranoid,"I had to go out today for a post baby check up and groceries. I'm paranoid. I've always socially distanced myself in the past. But being made hyper aware as a bunch of college kids are loud and all over the place had my nerves so bad my husband asked if I wanted to go to the car. I get the virus is worst for older people. But I have issues that put me in the risk group I have a daughter whose 7 weeks old and I'm watching cases in kids popping up more and more each day.

I dont care if these people all infected each other but please respect my space. I'm anxious and tapping my heels together still nothing has happened. Covid 19 still here no matter how much I wish it away"
1125,Question about depression,"I've been thinking about it for a pretty high amount of time. I know, self-diagnosis is extremely inaccurate and false at the most occasions and I feel stupid for asking something like this. I have all symptoms of depression (according to the Internet) but I can't say if I actually have depression or I'm just a dull piece of shit. I'm apathetic, I have huge problems with self-esteem, sleeping, I thought about roping myself. But still, I can laugh my ass off when playing online with my friends, for example. So, how does actually depression looks like? I'm really confused about it."
1126,How do I know the difference between processing trauma and just stirring the rage pot?,"Right now I'm 2 months out of an abusive relationship and making my way through ""Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and abusive men"". Hearing the different kinds of abusive men feels familiar and is bringing up lots of  scenarios and various ""well I should have said THAT!"" feelings, and urges to send him random shit without context to make him see his own abusive behaviors. I feel rage when I think of him, and what I think he and his family think of me. 

I know I need to get through this book in order to prevent falling into yet another abusive relationship. I also just recently got into therapy and am trying to make progress on my trauma so I can move on with my life and be successful and happy despite him. 

I know that if you try to run away from your feelings and never work through them you never get better. I am trying to process them, but not sure if I am doing that or just mixing them up and making it worse. 

I watched the xoxo talk on working your body through the complete stress cycle, and am trying to complete each stress cycle when it comes up and calming myself down with meditation, visualization, coping skills, cuddling, or exercise. 

But I'm wondering if this is healthy for me?? I can feel my body tense up, my heart beat raises and my blood flows to my head and I am upset... am I just making myself angrier and going further into damage, or am I working through it and moving closer to the light at the end of the tunnel?? How can I tell the difference? 

I want to make sure I am not moving backwards, I guess. Am I processing or just stirring?"

1128,Anxiety over coronavirus,"Hey. I went outside (Brooklyn, NY) a few minutes ago with my partner to quickly get milk and I started to have a panic attack. I couldn't believe the amount of people outside. And what got to me most is that it's young adults walking with their most fashionable outfits, constantly checking out their own reflections on shop glasses. I just feel very overwhelmed by the superficiality and selfishness of people, especially attractive young adults. Social media has encouraged them to look their best, to show off what you have, and to be basically self-centered. This isn't the time of that but it's not getting through to them. I had to quickly walk back home and I couldn't bring the words to talk to my partner on our way home. I can't help but think I can't leave my home (unless it's nighttime because less people) or visit my parents. I'm so angry at people of my own age. We have created a culture centered around looks and sex and partying and the planet is fucking mad at us. Why can't we valued intelligence and common sense. You could still have fun indoors. But many people need validation from other people and that is so unnecessary and selfish. I'm venting right now but I am also asking for advice on how to cope with this reality. My partner listened but I don't think he really understood how social media and superficiality is harmful for us not just mentally but now physically too. Please stay safe and conscious of your actions everyone. We might not get the worst outcome but someone we love could and, at the end of the day, we should care about our loved ones' well-being more than external validation."

1130,I hate myself,"I really hate myself and it’s ruining my life. I’ve suffered with mental health issues since I was 11 but I’m feeling really terrible about myself just lately. I gained a lot of weight after I had a breakdown and went onto antipsychotic medication. I’ve lost over 30 pounds since then but I still feel the same as I did before. I have stretch marks all over my body, keratosis pilaris all over my arms and acne on my face, back and chest. I feel ugly and disgusting. I have OCD and intrusive thoughts aren’t helping me. I’m not sure what to do, I try and tell family members and they just brush it off like I’m having another bad day. These thoughts are constant and they’re really impacting my life. I can’t talk to my psychiatrist until March 30th. Has anyone ever felt similar about themselves and have any advice on what I can do to feel better?"
1131,I have no one,"I'm down, crying, I have no one to talk to. I have so many people I want to talk to but I've barely ever talked to them in the past so loading them with all this doesn't feel right. I'm afraid I'd get laughed at. I really want to though, it's just not appropriate. I have no friends, no one who loves me, nothing. I just wanna be held and told everything is going to be okay, that it'll all work out. Also I feel like my tinnitus is getting worse so that's just another constant stressor on me. I just don't know how long I can keep going like this. I have nothing."
1132,Intimacy Anxiety,"Hello everyone, I have been single for six years now and I met someone who seems to be interested in me and I am interested in him. The trouble is my ex really did a number on my self-esteem and I consider myself utterly repulsive. It has gotten to a point when I shower with the light turned off.   


This guy tried to as much as kiss me last time and I just couldn't do it - I was overwhelmed by anxiety. I find it really troublesome because I liked him and I also longed to be touched. I really miss physical closeness but my body issues prevent me from it. Also, what freaks me out even more is the prospect of me developing feelings for him (he made it clear he wasn't looking for anything serious - and I am find with that. At this point I will just take what I can get).   


Has anyone here struggled with the same problem? What helped you?"
1133,why am i like this?,"why do i like being emotionally hurt? like everyday i listen to sad music that brings back awful memories so i can feel the pain of heartbreak again, the pain in my chest from all the sadness and i start crying to let all the emotion out. 

i could go on forever on how i emotionally hurt myself everyday but i wouldn’t think that’s necessary since i already sound messed up. 

but why might i enjoy feeling emotionally hurt? and should i even bother telling my parents because i’ve told them i want to die before but they just told me to be happy instead so they wouldn’t do anything anyways"
1134,Is there an option for online anxiety prescriptions?,"I have GAD, and have been unmedicated yet somehow managing it for about a year now. It was fine, until all of the virus information came out, and now I find myself having large often panic attacks, and severe anxiety throughout the day. It’s making a huge impact on my life. I know I need to be medicated again, but I can’t get myself to go out in public right now. I don’t have a doctor I see where I live, as my old doc was in my college town. Am I able to get a prescription somehow online? I don’t have insurance &amp; money is tight, but I’m kind of desperate."
1135,Meaning of being a psychopath,"I [19M] noticed that I have a lot of psychopathic traits. I wondered how this affects me or people around me. I also figured, it wouldn't be too smart to tell anyone irl because people would take distance from me.
Any thoughts?"
1136,Questions about Texas mental healthcare,"TL:DR - Is Texas really that bad for mental healthcare?

My fiancé is in negotiations with a company in Austin for a position. My mother moved to Houston about a month ago, and has been unable to get psychiatrists the controlled substances she has taken for 40 years. Also, my friend’s boyfriend’s mom recently starved to death in a mental health facility in Texas, near Midland. She never saw a physical doctor (they Skyped in a dr for her to visit with when she was in a catatonic state). I heard Texas is rated one of the lowest scores in the US in regard to mental health care. I take controlled substances and have been hospitalized twice in the last two years. Would moving to Texas be as risky as it sounds? Because from all I’ve heard, it sounds VERY risky."

This is difficult because lately I’ve become very attached to my roommates and I really don’t want to leave. 
Of course I want to go home and see other friends and my family but the whole process is making me really upset and I would really appreciate it if someone could send me some yt videos or something similar that can help take my mind off it until I leave in the morning :)"
1140,i feel like there’s something wrong with me,"hey, just wanna know if someone can relate. for years now i have the feeling that there’s something wrong with me, i have so many symptoms but there’s just no mental illness that fits a 100%. it’s weird because i have many symptoms from various disorders (social anxiety, borderline disorder, compulsive thoughts and behavior, hypersensitivity etc.), it’s like i have a bit of everything but nothing fits a 100%. i’m not self-diagnosing btw but..and this sounds very weird..i just want to have a name/term for what i’m going through, i can’t believe that this is normal what i experience and it’s sad but it would make me feel relieved to know i have a mental illness, bcus this would mean i’d have a valid reason to see a therapist and i’d know there’d be chances to change my life. and  i know people go see a therapist for this exact reason but i’m too anxious to look for one and i actually really don’t think i feel bad enough. i just wouldn’t now what to tell him (probably the same thing i’m telling here right now but u get me)"
1141,Struggling with obsession guilt over mistakes I made as a teenager,"As a teenager I was never the most social with the opposite sex due to social anxiety amongst other things. From the ages of 16 to 18 I took to online chat rooms to sext with a variety of different men. I loved the attention I received. At the time and still to this day I have had issues with pornography and masturbation. 

During this time online I would act out a number of taboo situations for sick men online. They believed I was a real person who did these things in real life. I had used pictures of celbritys in these chats and they ussualy last less than an hour.

It's been over 5 years now and due to my ocd I can't stop thinking and obsession over what I have done. I'm terrified me acting like this for these guys online and going online with their sick fantasy motivated them to hurt somone in real life.

I'm am so guilty I cry myself to self every night thinking about somone getting hurt becuase of what I did. I feel my family and friends would hate me if I knew. I just feel so upset and anxiety ridden over this and no matter what I do I can't feel any better."
1142,I'm genuinely considering ending it,"So today my driving test was cancelled (20 years in the making) and even though I've been a slacker most of my life, the last 2 years of my life I've professionally thrived. I had a driving test booked for next Friday and I was regarded as already passed I was such a good driver. 

So Corona virus hits, driving test is officially suspended for 3 months. 

I've never been bothered about work before - depending on what job I'm doing, I do it and don't care about the next day. I'm a slacker by nature. 

I start where I am 6 months ago and love it. Pass my probationary, get told if I want to get by in my work in my field they'll pay my course to be a professional in my field. Get told in March if I stay past April in the new financial year I'll get a payrise (my first one ever)

So last week happens with Covid-19, and we get told payrises are suspended, no bonuses and we will likely get put on short time working or Laid off. I've got about 7k savings - which would only last about 6 months. Driving is suspended until July. If we get so desperate, I'll get laid off. 

My daughter doesn't know me. My partner has more money than me saved. If I get laid off, I'll likely have to start working in a dead end job or burn up my savings. 

I'm thinking of ending it now while I've got savings. So they can get by and move on."
1143,What do you guys recommend? I'm not sure how to seek professional help,"So I'm starting to get the feeling that maybe I'm a bit unstable. For the longest I've been depressed and neurotic. I had bad anxiety and was pretty unsociable. I would get some pretty strange obsessions and I guess you can say delusions. But after I moved states I've been going in and out of this happy energetic state, but it usually calms down. I've been really social and sometimes I feel so good I almost lose track of who I used to be. It feels like depression is foreign. I want to paint go sky diving buy a bmw I just want to go and live and love and have fun. But I'm aware this isn't normal. Nothing happened to warrant this and the last time I felt such an influx of emotion it didn't go so well. Only last time it was constant anger and irritation. But you know it's so hard to explain the extent of how I feel maybe I should just let it pass. Okay sorry for the rant.  But do you guys know how I can find a therapist where do I go?"
1144,What is psychological testing like?,"Today I had my first exposure to a psychologist because I’ve been suffering for a bit too long without ever seeking professional help. Anyway, this morning I had a one hour interview of my behavior, past, basically personal things you don’t ever tell a stranger. This was actually over a Skype call because everything going on right now. But the psychological testing for particular things is in person later on. Should I prepare in any way? I’ve never open up to anyone about my difficult past and my interview turned into 3 hrs..I maybe brushed the surface and am pretty nervous about that. Any advice appreciated"

Someone please just tell me everything is going to be okay. Please."
1152,"I've had it, I can't continue anymore.","When I was in 12th grade, I got a 'D' on one of my exams because I completely blanked out; all the elite universities I had applied to rescinded my admission, and I thought I'd hit a dead-end. Started community college, worked really hard, sacrificed my social life, and transferred into a top-tier school. Here also I worked really hard, and now I am one quarter away from graduating. I am a psyc major, interested in cogsci, so I took a lot of math courses; this quarter I took three and I am sure I'm going to flunk each one of them. My gpa is going to plunge, and my grad school plans are thwarted. Moreover,  I couldn't get into the one class I need to graduate -- so now if I don't somehow get off the waitlist, I will have to stay back and pay full out-of-state tuition for a single course. Moreover, I am on an immigrant visa, and if I don't complete certain paperwork, I won't be able to stay or work here. I don't have any home or family in my ""home"" country; in fact, I haven't gone back in 12 years. In the past few years, I've had a single-minded focus on my education -- spend 16+ hours studying in the library, have no friends, no moments that I have enjoyed -- turned into a bitter and lonely person.  And yet, I have nothing to show for it - no internships, no job offers, no stellar academic achievements -- I don't even know if I'll get a degree. The only silver lining was a research project with a professor in a field that I deeply passionate about but with the current circumstances, I don't think that will continue. Even if it does, nothing really changes. My family has invested so much financially, and I have achieved nothing. I can't even be with them anymore, in spite of their best efforts. I really thought I had finally overcome my 12th grade debacle but I failed again - this time even more miserably. All my peers have graduated, are working, in steady relationships, and I feel spent, burnt out, worthless, and lonely. I have nothing. What was the point of all this? Of coming so close to my dream, only to see that I don't have it in me to pursue it? Or that in spite of all the sacrifice, I will never make it. The only few moments that I think I've enjoyed in the past few years was when I might've had a little wine (very lightweight) and felt like I had no care in the world! Other than that, I have nothing. I wish I had gone to parties, hooked up, developed friendships --  there's nothing joyful in my life anymore. The only constant is anxiety, inadequacy, paranoia, and self-hate. I'M SICK OF THIS. Nothing changes, nothing gets better. I just want this to end."
1153,Am I depressed?,"For the past 3 months I have been dealing with cascading health issues in my life that have seriously affected my mood and well-being. First there was a panic attack, then there was residual anxiety for two months after the attack, then I got severe sciatica pain out of nowhere and it has been constant for 2+ weeks, and since then, I’ve been stuck in a fog of anxiety, sadness, rumination, and negative thoughts. Worst of all, I’ve started experiencing significant cognitive issues which scares the crap out of me and causes more anxiety (short term memory issues, trouble putting sentences and words together in my head, and trouble concentrating), all at 30 years old.   

It’s all taken a massive toll on my mental health and I feel completely trapped and miserable. I spend all day sitting around trying to figure out how I can feel better and nothing comes to me. I’ve even cried a few times which is something I never do. I’ve never been depressed in my life, and besides for the past three months of health issues, I have a pretty great life.   

I saw my GP who didn’t do much for me except tell me my sciatica can take months to resolve. He also said if the anxiety continues he can give me an SSRI to help, which is something I don’t want to do unless absolutely necessary. I am just so lost, stuck, and sad. Any advice or encouragement is highly appreciated."

1157,How do I tell a friend the friendship has become toxic for me?,"One, I’m really glad this is a subreddit. 💛
Two, onto my question and a little background. I have two friends that I have declared for myself as toxic friendships. I haven’t told them and am not quite sure how. I have stepped back from talking to them and seeing them. One of them is giving me space and the other is hounding my fiancé about me and came to see me at my work since I haven’t been hanging out with her. I am trying to tell myself to give them credit and they can handle me telling them I need to step back from our friendship because it’s causing me a lot of stress (for various reasons that I won’t go into too much detail to keep the post short), but the one who asks my fiancé about me also relies on me for a lot emotionally and tells me how sad she’s been if I don’t talk to her about things going on with her. I have a counseling appointment next week (finally recently got affordable health care) and plan to talk with him about it, but had a panic attack in my shower over it yesterday, so reaching out earlier to some of you who have maybe had to break off a toxic friendship before. I just don’t have the energy in me to really be anyone’s person but my own right now... Thoughts, feelings, ideas on help with wording, etc.?"
1158,I hate people and I'm incredibly angry,"Not for any particular reason, i just think everyone's an idiot. 
Thanks for your time."
1159,I don’t know how to deal with this quarantine I have really bad anxiety,"I’m a freshman and college and we all got kicked out of the dorms. I am so anxious and sad because my household situation is toxic. I was only prepared to come home for a month during the summer before I moved into my apartment for sophomore year. I had to say goodbye to all my friends that are genuinely the best people I have ever met. I feel like the quarantine is going to make it so hard to visit those that live within a reasonable distance from me (3-5 hour drive) 

I was thinking today about how I’m going to have to be home tomorrow and I wanted to throw up. I cannot imagine having to back there I know my mental health is going to decline so quickly. My main concern is having to see my dad. He’s just awful and all he does is drink and yell. Another thing is when I left my sisters swapped beds around so I no longer have a bed to sleep in. It’s also just generally chaotic just being there. I’ve told myself that I’ll run, workout, and keep busy with school, but I’m worried that will only last a month or so. 

I also worry that this quarantine will only get worse and I’m stressed about being stuck in my house for five months straight. 

I also recently broke up with my girlfriend (on and off for 5 years, but I finally called it quits and have been so happy) and she reached out into right before I spring break started. I really am worried she will try to contact me during this whole mess because we will both be back home. I don’t want to feel guilted into talking to her and I have no desire to talk to her. It’s making me so anxious. 

I was getting to a place where I felt good and happy with where I was at. I don’t want to lose progress."
1160,Could I have PPD? Need a second opinion before going to someone about it.,"I've had this problem because something happened in my life a time ago.

I can never trust people, like never. I can't message members of my family due to being scared of *something?* I don't know what it is. I just can't speak to new people or tell people about my interests or what I do, it's fucking annoying. If I do accidentally say something and then I realise I say it (this could be anything) I would immediately be crying inside (eh) and then have tension headaches. I say something funny to someone and then I think they'll do something. 

Any pictures of me is a no go, someone could take one and do *something* with it; even family members.

Sometimes when I go outside I always think someone is spying on me, speaking about me, taking pictures of me. I always think someone is going through my stuff or is going to plan something against me. 

If someone does something (literally anything) I just can't respond as I think my answers could make them want to do something, but I also think me not responding can lead them to do something, causing more tension headaches.

If I say something slightly offensive to someone and they laughed (like a banter insult) I would immediately get worried, and they would do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Something is something, I don't know what it is, but they might do it."
1161,How do you know if you have mental health issues?,"I have been feeling very sad over the past 5 months for no apparent reason, I have been distancing myself from friends and family and I find it a lot harder to talk to people. I have been very stressed lately although nothing major has happened. Could I be experiencing som mild form of some sort of mental illness/issue?"
1162,Help a suicidal friend,"Hey. I don't know how exactly to help someone I care about who's implying suicide within the next few days or maybe even tonight. They say that they are unimportant, dead inside, and have no meaning other than to serve others. I care about them and obviously don't want them to hurt themselves. How can I help them"
1163,I’m convinced that this girl is dumb?,"She ignored my messages, I unfriend her on social media, see her in person, she adds me, I add her.

“Hey did you delete me? What did I do to deserve that?”

Then now she does the exact same thing, and ignores me.

Next she’ll probably wonder why I unfriended her again."
1164,I have to choose between my happiness and my dream job,"I'm gonna start this off by saying I'm not that good at reddit, I don't know formatting or much and my acc was made recently.  


I'm a 14 year old working as a game designer for an anonymous roblox game. I want to be a 3D modeler and a game designer and this just fits everything I want to be when I grow up. Roblox would prob be the best place for me to get this kind of job at my age. My parents don't want me to get this kind of job and think I ""should get a real job"". This game has 6 game modes, Hostage, Search and Destroy, King of the Hill, Gun Game, FFA, and TDM. It's kind of like a mash up of all game modes. This game has managers who manage a lot of stuff like the reddit, twitter, discord, and talks. The owner does talk a lot in general and is very active.   


Despite this, he doesn't seem to like me. The game has a small esports following so there are a lot of competitive elements to think of as well. He didn't think of this and the only thing that could add strategy that other roblox games don't have are ""specials"" which are guns that can't be achieved in the game normally. This wouldn't be that well for comp and this game has no eco despite basically being a csgo with more gamemodes, and because of that unless specials were AK's and AWP's, it wouldn't be useful. I have thought of MANY ideas to try to help this as there are other games with a comp scene (kind of a shocker really) and it won't work at all with his ideas. Despite this he has ignored everything and lied to my face to ignore all my ideas. One time he said he was doing an essay and he would look at my ideas later, despite we were both playing the game at the same time, and he kept playing for an hour. He blatantly lies to me and acts like I'm an idiot.  


He also completely ignores me and doesn't answer any of my questions for the TWO maps I am making. He also has given worse builders permanent jobs as developers and even manager jobs, and yet he avoids to even give me any permanent spot, and I don't know how long I will be till I am fired. He makes me feel unappreciated and awful and I am currently depressed. I can't tell my parents as if I do I can never become a game designer in the future. I can't tell any of the staff, as if he finds out I would probably get fired (despite him never giving me a permanent spot). If I tell nobody I will be sad till I quit or get an actual job for a game design team, but I will be able to peruse my dream job. I've hit a real low point right now, and I don't know what I should do."
1165,My social anxiety has gotten so bad that it feels like I'm never at peace or alone,"I over analyse to the point of redundancy when I feel like I have something to prove (which is most of the time). And the same parts of me that are telling me things i've said to someone over texts need to be worked on to become :more easily understandable, relevant to context, and funny) are also telling me that the mistakes I'm making are the result of a warped mind and now I think as dramatic as it sounds I'm either deranged or retarded the fact im either obsessing but its an obsession. I can have days of going over the same self refining rituals where i put myself under scrutiny to become my idea of perfection and i convince myself of things and then start acting in accordance with those ideas to seem as natural and unstifled... so nobody suspects anything"
1166,Is it normal," for, on a rare occasion, your eyes to start dilating uncontrollably for a few seconds at any time from 7-8 pm."

1168,Bipolar and Social Distancing,
1169,What do I include in suicide notes?,Future prep
1170,Caffeine anxiety,"In the past few months, I have grown obsessed with checking my drinks caffeine content and focusing on only that. I cant enjoy drinks anymore after 3, and whenever I do drink something with even small caffeine contents, I freak out, and my mind plays games on me, whereas if I never knew about the caffeine I would have been completely fine. I don't know what to do, and I always fall back into the same routine, searching for the drink, and freaking out. What do I do?"
1171,I don’t enjoy anything anymore,Idk how to explain it but I just feel like nothing makes me happy anymore for example I used to love video games would spend almost all my time on them and put hours in them now I just don’t enjoy them I used to skateboard a lot but then I just lost interest I feel like I don’t have fun with anything anymore any suggestions ?
1172,COVID-19,"This whole situation has made my mental health worse. I'm an an anxious and stressed out mess who  has begun to self-medicate with alcohol once again and I've completely withdrawn from family life especially with how dynamics are at the moment. I know I want to break down in order to let it all out but I am just unable to due to being a thinking personality type and how numb I am with the medication I'm currently prescribed. 

I haven't told my family much, if anything, at all apart from being worried because I don't want to burden them and/or let them know how things really are with me. I deep down just want somebody to hold me tight, tell me things will eventually return back to normality and help me."
1173,I think I have schizophrenia. Maybe I’m just stressed?,"So when I was younger my mom told me I use to hear voices all the time, kind of stopped around the end of middle school/beginning of high school. Never really paid attention to it much, but recently it’s been really bad. 
I hear a voice or voices that will like whisper to me. I can never make out what they sound like, but I can hear them if that makes sense? They tell me to crazy shit like beat up my boss for literally no reason or destroy a car that I’m walking by. I was always pretty good with suppressing them, but a little more recently it’s been so bad it makes me want to tear the hair out of my head. 
I did just move maybe a month ago, maybe it’s just stress? I don’t have insurance so I don’t want to make an unnecessary trip and spend thousands of dollars."
1174,This quarantine is bringing back flashbacks of when I was in a psychiatric unit.,"It’s so strange to feel trapped in your own home/community. I felt this way when I was in the psychiatric wing of a hospital. It’s not a good feeling. I feel like I’m suffocating. 

The best thing to do is break up your day and stick to a schedule. Any other tips?"
1175,Building Confidence?,"I have this problem where if I do something even slightly wrong I beat myself up over it to an extensive amount and I can't get over it and immediately go to the worst-case scenario. Like at work I'm considered a good worker but one minor fuck up with timing and stuff like that I immediately think upper management will chew me out. Or that I will get fired. 

I don't know how to work on this or fix it because it's like ingrained in my head. Help?"
1176,Another caffeine induced manic state for y'all,"I've come to a realization, one which I've come to and forgotten too many times. That is that no one around here has any patience left for me. The smallest misdemeanor and every mistake I've ever made come back to me. I can't be here for much longer, with these people who loathe and despise me. It makes me loathe and despise myself. I can never forget how much of a POS I am. But I need to at least go somewhere I'm not reminded of it every day. 

I'm not suicidal but I sure as hell have been and will be again in the future. My mind is shattered fragments. Fragments that refuse to believe in reality. Fragments that play over and over again all the bad things I've ever done. And the fragments that still spin up irrational phobias. They all swirl like a tornado. I'm caught in the middle. 

If I could do it all over again. I would give up all the fun days all the good times just to get rid of those few stupid mistakes. I would be the most boring person just to feel good about myself. 

I don't remember what life was like before I took all this poison that I called ""Trips"" Just to forget for a few days. Or maybe it was just to feel a bit lighter on my feet. I can't remember what I was feeling anymore. Caffeine seems to always put it all together for me. Oh if only it didn't give me vertigo suddenly and randomly I would be this way all the time.

I have no way of going back in time, maybe if I go far enough away. That I will never see anyone I ever knew ever again, that I could create an actual personality for myself. I could actually live being myself and not something a substance makes me. It would just be more lies though, hiding the truth. Hiding how garbage I really am.

Whatever. I wrote a lot more than this. But ya'll don't need to know the story of my life."
1177,Did you ever just know there was a problem with you but nobody believed you?,"I have been to two mental health therapists one when I was 15 -16 and one when I was 17-19 and I kept saying I want to know what I have and each time they dismissed it I kept trying to explain that I know I’m not like a normal person that things are harder for me that my thoughts aren’t normal and that I’m just not normal I ;

1) Explode with anger and black out and can’t remember what I’ve done let alone control it 

2) After I explode I feel so ashamed I’ve attempted to take my own life because I’ve done some really bad things

3) I’m not social I can’t interact or make friends I haven’t had friends for the last 4 years

4) I constantly forget that life isn’t a tv show and that I’m not playing a part and things do work out ( not metaphorically I literally think it’s a tv show sometimes)

5) My head always feels like it’s swirling and running about and I can’t stop it

6) I have this need for attention, I really try not to but I find myself doing it without me realising 

7) I hate myself so much for all of the above and have this thing where I have to say this out loud when nobody is around 

And a whole lot of other things...

THIS IS NOT NORMAL!!! But when I try to explain they just said that It isn’t a good idea to send me to a psychiatrist and that I should try anti depressants 

I just know that I have something and it makes me really upset because if I knew what it was I could join groups and try to figure out why I am like this and the best way to change...

How can I go around therapy and get a diagnosis"
1178,Slowly coming to terms with the fact my mum has BPD.,"



As I get older I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact my mum has BPD - specifically the paranoid subtype. 
Don't get me wrong, I had an objectively great childhood. I've come out of it as a well rounded person in a happy relationship, good career, no mental health issues ect. 
However, as time has gone on certain aspects of my childhood have come to the forefront. 
Firstly throughout my childhood we've had numerous fallings out with my Dad's sides relatives, my mums relatives, my family friends ect. to the point where my parents have NO friends at all and I am estranged from my entire family both sides of my family. Throughout this time my mum has made it out like she is the victim in all of this and I believed her. As I’ve grown older I’ve learnt that there’s a lot more nuiance to it and I’ve also heard incredibly bias versions of the stories so I don’t know what to believe anymore. 
Secondly, I was definitely over mothered. She literally did everything for my sister and I. Which was good at the time but probably wasn’t a healthy thing for me I had no life skills after I moved out of home. Since I’ve gotten older she has never really moved on from the baby phase… she wishes I was a kid again and still talks to me like I’m a child. Using old names she used to call me as a child ect. 
What has come to the forefront of this whole issue about her is that I thought she would be different with my fiancee and her family. But she hasn’t been. 
She’s never been ‘warm’ to my fiancée despite her being anything but an angel to her. She gets jealous of my relationship with her and her family. She has this ‘us’ vs ‘them’ mentality. 
This has gotten worse when organising my wedding. She has made every step along the way a massive deal. Blowing everything out of proportion. This came to a head when she went off at my mother in law for asking her for a photo of what her outfit looked liked! 
I have a lot of cognitive dissonance with the whole siuation. I love my mother and everything she has done for me. I am also acutely aware that she is I’m sorry to say a very toxic person that estranges herself from every relationship. It has now got o the point where its encroaching into my personal life. 
I’m so fortunate that my fiancée is an angel and would never tell me to cut her off or anything but I really don’t know what to do. Apart from vent here. 
TLDR:
Slowly discovered that my mum is a toxic person despite having a good upbringing and childhood."
1179,When will it get over?,Does anyone ever come out of their childhood PTSD? or does it grow on you while you continue your life believing it might end one day just to feel the sun kissed breeze on your skin? When will anyone ever completely come of trauma? Is there a beautiful life at any point? If so when ? Is therapy really helpful to move on with that pain while the abuser still dominates your life? ...... I've lost all hopes on holding on to life.... Am I supposed to let go? Is this all my life is about ? Pain.. Frustration.. Fear.. Confusion.. Is death the break I need?
1180,How Do I Cope With Addictive Thought Patterns/Behaviors?,"Hi all, 

I don’t know if this is the place for this, but I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve been experiencing a lot of addictive behaviors under stressful times, such as now. 

Since before this quarantine began, I was already isolating in an attempt to self-reflect. I am going through a break-up and have also been dealing with emotional turmoil regarding my parents because one of them is very sick but also emotionally and verbally abusive, so it’s been an overwhelming and confusing time for me. This sudden pandemic occurring also raises major symptoms of anxiety and depression in me. This snowball effect of bad news has gotten to me and I’ve resorted to addictive behaviors such as binge-eating, zoning-out on shows, and just generally breaking promises to myself. I’ve been doing unhealthy things that “comfort” me, but it only feels that way because I’m distracted from reality. I’m mostly overwhelmed and am not used to healthy ways of dealing with issues because of how I grew up, but I’m beginning to connect more dots and am working on moving forward to becoming a better version of myself. 

Realizing my addictive behavior is one step closer to that version of myself. However, my coping skills have gone completely down the drain recently, and I’ve been over-eating junk food and haven’t gone to the gym in over a month (I had already stopped going two weeks before the virus hit my city). 

Does anyone have any suggestions or contributions on how to ease out of this addictive ritual? I do it because I get to veg out after work while watching something fun, but it makes me feel unmotivated and uninspired, guilty and ashamed. There’s obviously a lot of deeper issues that are the undercurrents of my addiction, but if you can help a sista out with all this, I’d really appreciate it. 

Thanks."
1181,hear me out,"hey everyone, we are all going through hard times more than usual. reach out if you need help, call friends, family, etc 
If you need food, go online for food banks with your zip
Don’t panic. Try your best to stay calm. Yoga. Workouts at home. Paints. Singing. Learn something new. Listen to the sounds with the windows open. 
Use coping skills, 5 finger grounding exercise is my personal favorite.

3 years ago I decided I wanted to live, after several suicide attempts. With recent events I’ve gone downhill really fast, then I got the news my friend killed himself. 

This wasn’t just a friend or an average human being. He was energy beyond understanding, with such talent and individuality it hurts. He took his life. The amount of people who are hurting because he’s gone, because we all loved him so fucking much. So fucking much. Maybe we could have talked to him more. Done something. Said something. Anything....


On that note, I’m asking dont leave us. You are loved. You have energy this earth needs, it’s love and you’re loved back. No matter what. Don’t give up. We will hurt together, we are all in it together, we can strive and get through this shit....please when you’re in that dark place and you think no one will care, I will. I will care. I will hurt. Because you are so worthy of so much. 

Much love."
1182,"Feel like an idiot who sucks, with accomplishments that are all flukes","I've got a STEM degree I did well in, some related accomplishments, and am doing well on the whole in living stability.

I feel like a fucking idiot who sucks at everything. I sucked as a classmate, I sucked in my career job, I sucked in my entry-level job, I sucked in my non-career jobs, I sucked as a friend, I sucked as a coworker, I sucked as someone in charge of my own life.

I feel like I can't quite get my shit together. I was working two jobs for over a year, got rehired with a good incentive after quitting my first career job, got promotions at my second job, in the middle of several legal, family, and I-picked-the-wrong-year-to-quit-drinking fiascos. I had to be doing something right?

I'm not sure if I can't get an accurate gauge on where I rank at anything, or if I can't mentally integrate clashing perspectives of myself, or if I'm just a very unevenly developed person, or all of the above.

My opinion that I suck at skills and as a person never really changes, but how productively I wield that feeling flim-flams."
1183,I don’t know what’s going on,"For several years I’ve been hearing voices especially at night, way before I go to bed and while I’m in bed. It’s been happening more lately. It always happens when I’m alone. I don’t know what they say because it’s just an indistinct shout or some mumbling. I freak out thinking someone’s after me and I run outside to see if it’s real. I see what look like flashlights in the corner of my eye and I hear footsteps on the roof and in the walls. What is happening"
1184,I don't know how long I can work from home without going insane,Before the pandemic I have zero friends.  The only interactions I had were those with my coworkers.  Now I'm not seeing them anymore and I'm completely isolated.
1185,Therapy sessions cancelled indefinitely due to coronavirus. Is this common?,"I go to a mental health center (in central North Carolina, fwiw) that has both psychiatry and CBT services in the same building. The receptionist called today and said they were suspending my sessions with my therapist until the pandemic is over. I've been going on a weekly basis for a short while now and do not feel ready to just quit going altogether. Are most services like this shutting down or would it be worth trying to find someone else?"
1186,Quarantine is bringing my depression back.,"I just recently had to return home early from my vacation back in my hometown because of the virus. I’ve been at home for the past few days doing small workouts and being on my phone. Because I shipping out to the military this April, I have canceled my internet so I can’t distract myself with video games while I wait to go. The days are starting to feel extremely long. I sleep more than I eat. I feel anxious and frustrated. I want to go out to eat at a restaurant or at least go to the mall but obviously I can’t do that. I can feel my depression gnawing it’s way back into my mind. I hate being alone for too long."

1188,Am I justified in not liking my dad,"My dad has always tried to be good, but he has his shortcomings and I find it really difficult to be comfortable around him. He’s very temperamental and since I was really young I’ve had to experience his anger and yelling and I think it has made it impossible for me to like him. When I was in high school I got really depressed and stopped getting out of bed. One day I woke up to my dad throwing a beer bottle and shattering it on my room. It was my beer bottle that I had discarded in the back yard and he was really mad at me for littering. He kept yelling at me for it and I just stopped listening because it’s impossible to talk to somebody when they’re yelling like that. Then, because I was ignoring him, he took my phone and threw it at a painting in my room, breaking the painting and the phone. He threw it so hard that glass shattered everywhere and the phone and the phone case were dented pretty bad. I jumped out of bed to get my phone and told my dad he needed to calm down but that only made him more angry. I was in a very calm state at this point because I was emotionally blunted from depression so I was not in the mood to fight my dad at all but when I told him to calm down he put his finger on my chest and basically told me to fuck off. He just held his finger on my chest waiting for me to make a move. I told him not to touch me and he said “what’re you gonna do about it” like he was just waiting for an excuse to kick my ass. I told him I wouldn’t fight him and he called me a pussy.Of course I wasn’t gonna fight him because that’s insane but I could see in his eyes that he really wanted me to. This was during a time when I was the most depressed I’d ever been and he was completely aware of that. He never apologized and when I told my mom what happened, she took his side. After my mom took his side, I never told anyone about it again. That was the worse incident with him and overall he’s had that kind of attitude my entire life. I realize that a lot of people have way worse parents so I dont feel justified in not liking my dad. I felt this way before this specific incident because I grew up with him yelling and cussing at me; this is the most extreme example. Another example I just remembered is when I was 11 and my dog tore a tiny quarter inch hole  in the carpet and my dad lost it and threatened to kill my dog and then he said he would take my dog to the pound. He never hurt my dog but he made those very serious threats and he never apologized or gave me any sort of resolution. I feel bad for not liking my dad because  he tries to be nice and I can tell he wishes I liked him more but the simple truth is that his presence has always made me uncomfortable. Is normal for me to feel this way about my dad or am I just too sensitive?"
1189,Hello!,"Hello! I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask but here goes..I was wondering if I Misophonia, a mental illness that makes you have a strong reaction to ‘trigger sounds’. To clarify when I hear certain things, people chewing, loud breathing, my sister laughing really loud, when my mum has news/music on loud, etc.. I just get super annoyed and frustrated and I can’t really focus on anything and I almost feel like crying. I try to subtly cover my ears or block it out. I usually roll my neck or bend to the side when these noises happen."
1190,Tips for combatting dissociation and depression during social isolation?,"Ever since the coronavirus got serious, I’ve had terrible, long periods of dissociation. It genuinely feels like I’m not even here, or that this is all a fake reality I’m in, and I have trouble remembering anything while it’s happening. I’ve always gotten dissociative “episodes” but lately its been so intense. 

My depression has also gotten a lot worse. I had to move out of my college campus and head home. My whole family is practicing social isolation because we believe we should, but being at home all day, everyday is very reminiscent of the times where I was so depressed I couldn’t get out of bed. The feeling is coming back as well, as I depended on daily social interaction from my college life as a distraction from depression. Trying to force myself to be productive or do anything at all, even things I enjoy, is becoming harder and harder again. 

Any tips or advice welcome."
1191,Should i check myself in to a clinic?,"My depression has gotten to the point where i literally couldnt force myself to go in on my last workday. I literally feel like i'm going crazy. My job is easy. Pays great. Great benefits. Its the white picket fence. But i just cant. Everyday is harder than the last. I only have so many hours to burn to take off and... Idk. I cant even think of the words to decribe it.

So seriously. Is willing to risk my financial security (aka job) a sign that i may need to check myself in? I fantasize about suicide but it really is more of a fantasy than a plan. It just sounds so nice for it all to end. I feel my eyelids getting heavy just thinking about it. The peace. The rest. So... Soothing? Idk. I'm just tired."
1192,I'm not sure what to do and I need advice,"In attempts to explain my predicament, I'm going to grossly oversimplify my past 3-4 years of attempting to get a grip on my PTSD symptoms. I was diagnosed with the disorder after an assault event, but this has been compounded with an underlying generalized anxiety disorder that has also spun me into a really bad depression that I've yet to escape from (my mother has also suspected that I have some high functioning autism spectrum disorder, but this has yet to be diagnosed and has only been concluded by my mother and her friend with autistic children of her own. So take that as you will, but it may be important for my situation? Idk I've only ever thought that I exhibited some similar symptoms that are unrelated). I went through a really rough time where I couldn't go outside cause I feared the potential for my assaulter to come back, and still have problems where I am constantly imagining the worst case scenario for a potential assault and fervently working my way through these made up scenarios that seem completely plausible until I actually ask myself why I'm even thinking about it. I used to do this as a child where I would imagine myself in arguments to prepare myself for bullies, but not to the current extent of violence where I'm now imagining what reaction I should have if a man came in and threatened my co-workers and I with a gun, despite this never once occurring in my life.


This is further perpetuated by my parents who are some of the most verbally and, in a few cases, physically abusive people I've ever had the displeasure of knowing. There's the common stuff where they are extremely Christian (I'm not) and anti-gay/LGBT (I'm bi and currently in a relationship of the same sex), which puts me in the shitty situstion of having to appease these guys constantly while my dad rants about ""the gay agenda"" and trans people somehow being worse than literal Nazis. All I'm allowed to do is bite my tongue as I try to hold myself back from punching him through the teeth. To say my dad is more of the aggressor than my mom is would be an understatement, as he's been the main source of strife throughout the entire family and not just myself. He's gotten my brother to move out of the house and my sister to call the police on him, both of which were incited by me having a panic attack or finally having enough of their bullshit and standing up for myself. As you can imagine, both times involved than verbally berating me or even getting physical with me to an unreasonable degree, hence why I fought back against them. But I can vividly remember this always being the case, one such instance being when I was literally yelled into a corner, crying, and was told that I'm only bawling my eyes out to get him to stop as a form of emotional manipulation. I'm currently 18, and that was, at minimum, 7 years ago. Let that sink in for a second. An 11 year old, is crying, to get you to stop hurting them emotionally/physically. K then. There's the constant me kissing up to them or apologizing when I really didn't need to do so, only so that I can scrape by and not live in fear of them (mainly my dad). But as of late I haven't let it be that way, because in my dumbass mind, I'm sick of being treated like a piece of shit by my dad and I've gone to challenge him on several occasions. It's very difficult to express just how awful he is to this family, but imagine that scenario I mentioned earlier occurring several times each month across all 4 of those weeks, and then you essentially get what I have going on in terms of emotional severity. A more recent example that I can bring up was actually in January of this year, where he slapped me several times and incited my PTSD to come flooding back, yet when I told him to stop he kept going as though he gets to do whatever the hell he wants. What caused said argument? Which side of the fucking sink the dishes go in. I got slapped across the face twice, shoved into the stove with my head slamming into the cabinets as he twists my arm behind me back, told I can't leave with my belongings and had my backpack ripped open to get said stuff away from me, over, fucking, dishes. I'll guide them Credence where it is due, I did say inflammatory things to them, specifically after my own father assaulted me again and had to have a stupid pissing match with those shit heads for three hours. Even typing about it now it's frankly difficult as my entire body is trembling, but it's all excused by ""oh he felt bad about it that he didn't get out of bed"". Which is quite fucking hilarious as that's the night my sister called the police and they told me that they're ""not here to resolve our problems and hear about the abuse"". So, yeah, police didn't fucking help so I ran away that night, I ended up coming back but I have had it with them. But the issue is that I'm still here, and I'm living in a war zone of negativity essentially.


And here's the main part of my problem, the negativity is spewing over into my relationship and I need help trying to fix myself. In short, negative shit is occurring every day in this household, my dad calling my mom a bitch, my mom screaming and waking me up with anxiety coursing through my veins, and it just seems to be an endless stream of shit with these assholes. My only solace has been playing video games, working, listening to music, and ranting to my boyfriend about the shitty scenarios. But to be frank I rant far too often, and I've had to come to admit that I'm not doing enough to bring positivity to the relationship. Often times I either just want to be left alone in my own sorrow or don't have much positive to say. I have been on anti depressants and anti-ptsd medication, both trial runs with the medicines have shown little results, and I don't feel like I'm getting much of anywhere in terms of progress with therapy. Not to say that I haven't been going to therapy, I go every week, but I still struggle a lot with this onslaught of shit. I don't feel that I've done enough to fix myself and my mindset, and that's been confirmed by my boyfriend telling me so as well. The issue they I find it that he's told me ""then do it"" literally and figuratively in response to me saying that I want to progress and be better for him. There was a lot more said than just that and it's put me in the right direction (I'm going to try to discuss ways to progress forward with my own therapist for my own health), however I still feel the need for additional information on what the hell do to from here. I feel that I've become abusive and that I'm letting my dad ruin me in a sense, and I just don't know what to do to move forward and progress. My first inclination is to move out, but the problem is that I live in California and plan to go to college here, and rent is notoriously high. I had plans that fell through where I would share an apartment with some friends, but none of them have stable jobs to do so. I'm just thoroughly stumped and I feel caged, I want to be better but I don't know what the first step to recovery should be, I thought I tried everything but I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start. If any of you have advice on what to do, I'm more than willing to take it, be as blunt with me as you feel is necessary to get your point across, part of me feels like that's what I need right now, even if it hurts."
1193,How Your Relationships Can Help With Mental Health Treatment,https://tinaantonstrengthinwords.com/2020/03/21/how-your-relationships-can-help-with-mental-health-treatment/
1194,Violent thoughts (vent),"TW self harm, reference to violence

For my whole life I’ve had violent thoughts. I think we all have them sometimes. But as I get older sometimes I go into such a rage that I think I may act on them. 

And sometimes when I think that if I did act on them, that I would go to jail, I feel *bad.*

It’s mainly against my mom. I resent her. I hate her. She is not even abusive but she’s certainly unstable and incompetent. When I get extremely mad at her, sometimes I get so angry that I literally have to hurt myself to avoid attacking her. This has manifested several times by me smashing my head against the wall. Sometimes I also cut myself. The head smashing is mainly when she won’t leave me alone. Often when we fight she won’t walk away. I will try to make her leave but she will have me basically in a corner screaming at her to go, but she won’t, and will act like I’m the one who refuses to walk away. 

There are also times after one of us has walked away that I am still absolutely livid and have so much pent up anger that I need to let it out. I often try to let it out by cutting myself or hurting myself, but sometimes I want to direct the anger outwards. I normally restrain myself from breaking things even though I find it extremely difficult to. But I always find myself wanting to destroy my mom’s things or do something worse. Not necessarily go and hurt her but do something less directly. I have wanted to poison her at times or other less severe things. I came close to rubbing her toothbrush in the toilet once. But I didn’t.

It’s strange though, because I am not a violent person. At least I don’t think. I just get so angry and the only way to let it out is through violence. It’s also doubly weird that I never get this angry at other people. Yeah, I do get angry at people, but never to this extent. And when I am, I act like a normal angry person. I even tend to avoid confrontation. But to my mom, I’m a fucking monster. And honestly I am ashamed to say it, but I don’t even feel bad about how I treat her. She deserves it in my eyes. She is a terrible person and the reason I’m so fucked up. She passed down all of her mental illnesses to me. I’ve mentioned in other posts that I hate her because our negative traits are so similar. But I think she’s worse than me because she is in a position of power as my parent and it builds her ego. 

Now that I think about it I think I have anger issues. Not necessarily that I get angry easily, but that when I am angry, I cannot control myself. 

I want to say that I’m not a threat to her. I’m not gonna kill her. I just wanted to vent about my concerning thoughts and violent urges.

I need to talk to my therapist, but good ol’ quarantine. I don’t think I’ll be able to go to my next appointment. I kinda hope I can. But also this virus is making my anxiety worse.


I am exhausted and I’m going to sleep now. I won’t reply to most comments until morning."
1195,Thanks.,This is just an off my chest. But thank you to the so called friends of mine who are always posting and preaching about the significance of mental health but when I told them I’m going through it they distance themselves or downplay my problems. Honestly fuck all of you.
1196,I can't sleep because I'm worried my friends hate me,"I don't really know how to describe this, but I just have this gross feeling that my friends just dont like me. That they think I'm petty or annoying and I dont know how to bring this up without possibly seeming more annoying, and I just don't want to stay up at night because I can't stop thinking about everything I'm doing wrong."
1197,I was born toxic,"Yesterday I washed up, hoovered my room, worked out for 2 hours, and cut my own hair. Tonight I’m laying in bed unable to sleep because I can’t stop thinking about how toxic I’ve been since birth. 

When I was 7 my best friend called me a control freak cause I wouldn’t let him join choir. I can’t stop thinking about that. That’s not the only thing I did. I literally tried to control every inch of my mother’s life as a child. I refused to go to the toilet unless she took me. I refused to dress like a girl, only boys clothes. I refused to wear laces, only Velcro. I wouldn’t let her sleep until I fell asleep. I’d scream every shop down. t’s seems small but god did I wear my mother down. I was toxic. Like what the hell was wrong me? 

I don’t think I had any empathy for people. That’s probably normal right? not to have empathy at that age? Like I just saw people as existing for my benefit, to do what I wanted. Do you develop empathy? Am I a sociopath? Surely if I was I wouldn’t be feeling guilty about all of this. Maybe I was just spoilt. 

Much to think about. Had to vent it out cause if it lingers in my mind any longer I’ll have a break down. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but the guilt is making me hate myself and now I can’t sleep. 

Maybe seeing a therapist is due."
1198,I can’t sleep,I’ve been having extreme anxiety lately. The last couple of night I’ve been waking up feeling fearful of absolutely nothing but my stomach will be in knots. Its 2am and I’m currently worrying about things that shouldn’t matter but instead it makes me want to cry and rip my hair out. I can’t eat. I don’t know what’s wrong with me
1199,I'm disappointing and need help.,"I cant help but feel like I'm a disappointment. I love my parents, but deep down I know I'm disappointing them, I'm a loser with no friends, I'm shit at everything I do, and I am struggling with some serious mental health issues, but I'm too afraid to get help, and figure out what the hell is wrong with me."
1200,I have a near obsessive need for certainty.,"For the past couple months or so I have had the horrible urge to find certainty in something. So for instance, when I find out about something, I try to be certain about it. So for instance, just as an example, if I were to find out that a person I respect is an arrogant asshole, then I want to be certain about it. I will try and find a source. I can look for hearsay, but when I find the majority of people agree on one notion, I tell myself I can’t know if they’re right. Then I look for another source that claims another things about that person, how can I know if they’re not lying? That’s the question that pops into my head.

Nothing short of seeing it with my own eyes will satisfy me. And even when I do find a reliable source, and my logic and reasoning says that one conclusion is right I’ll always question myself. So I can’t know if I’m right or wrong about that person.

It’s not about being right either, because I’ll always question myself. It’s always about being certain. And I always question my own logic. I have this need for certainty which can never be fulfilled as I’ll endlessly question myself.

Is there a way to help with this a little?"
1201,Don't know whats going on,"I have found myself going into a bit of a depressive state which flicks in and out during winter for the past 3 years (I'm now 18), but this year feels a bit different.

I have lost my apetite, but if I get myself food I eat it faster then I ever have. I know I'm not eating as much as i should at the moment but I just have a slight disgust for food and I don't know why.

I have waves of anxiety, and flick between being very sad/irritable to VERY high energy/ elated moods. I've looked up manic symptoms and I don't feel like i'm suddenly going to quit my job or spend heaps of money which leads me to believe this isn't something to worry about. An example of an elated mood for me is spontaneously sticking pictures all over my wall without a lot of consciousness (it feels like my body is doing it for me and it HAS to be perfect). I'm very shaky and can't stop my face from twitching sometimes.

Sometimes I feel like I'm drunk or really high on something, and often forget things that I have done in the past minute.

I often feel like I'm not quite in my body and it's just going  through the motions without me having much control at all.

I have depression and bipolar disorder in my family, so I'm wondering if this might have anything to do with it?

Is this something I should be concerned about? Or should I just ride it out; it's been going on for a couple weeks. Any advice would be helpful."
1202,"Due To This Stupid Pandemic, I Won't Be Able To See My Therapist For Months...Someone Please Help Me...","Hell, I may not see her *ever again.*

She is a free therapist provided to me by my university and, because of that, she can only practice her services in state. I'm an out of state student.

She was the first therapist I've gone to willingly. I've had about half a dozen child psychiatrists throughout the years tell me and my parents I was probably going to be fucked up but hey, at least I wasn't having a psychotic break at six years old!

Just when I was feeling...alive. Vulnerable. And exposed. And...*extremely uncomfortable.* But alive.

I've been dissocating my entire life, feeling nothing, as a protective mechanism. She began to tap at that wall, in our five weeks talking. She just began to peek under the surface, but not in an intrusive manner. I wanted her to. I *trusted* her to. And trust is *a rarity.* I trust one person in this world, and that's my mother. I don't trust myself. And I thought, I *truly* thought, that I could trust her.

And now she is gone.

Maybe forever. Maybe for only a few months until the quarantine is over and I'm back for the fall semester.

But still...I'm left raw and exposed and vulnerable, completely unsure of how to handle these new emotions I'm feeling. I've always been numb, felt like a corpse, and that was fine. It was my normal. But recently I was *actually suicidal,* and I realized that my lovely therapist had torn open a chasm and shit is just spewing out and I don't know how to deal with it, but I also can't close it and just be a zombie like I was before.

I'm...*stuck.* I'm a work in progress, a half-cooked cake and the oven just fucking broke. I don't know what to do.

I have no idea what to do.

I can't afford a therapist. I *have* to talk to the free university ones. But I won't be back in state for months. And I...Do I have to find a way to be okay with just being *exposed* like this? With a fucking cavity ripped open with no needle and thread *nor* something to cauterize it with for the time being? I'm bleeding out! What the fuck do I do? Sure, this may sound like small potatoes for some of you but you're hearing from a guy who hasn't felt emotions outside of number anxiety and rage for the past *entirety of his life* so..."
1203,Coronavirus stress,"This Coronavirus is really stressing me out. School is canceled till May, and I don’t know if I can handle it. I see so many other people happy to be in isolation while I’m freaking out and it just makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. Why can’t I just relax? Besides, school gives me really bad anxiety, I don’t understand why I can’t just be happy. But I think it’s because I can’t stand my home (or homes). My parents are divorced. My dad gets drunk almost every night and my relationship to him seems nonexistent and my mom is always working and has little time for me. I’ve always felt like I was never a priority to them and I often question if they really love me. Im always shut in my room at both of my parents houses and it makes me feel so isolated and alone. I know I could just go out and try to socialize, but my dad scares me, and my mom and siblings are always in their rooms, too. I hate it at home. School is my escape, even if my heart is always racing there. I have my friends there, and the guy I like, and the school work. They all distract me from my problems, but now that’s gone. I’m trapped in what feels like a jail cell and I don’t know how or if I can escape. I feel so lost and overwhelmed and always stressed. I just feel like I’m going to snap and do something that I’ll regret."
1204,I never bring joy to anyone in the world,"I always cause problems to the members of my family. I don't do anything special for my friends either. I've lived my life till now wanting to become an artist to bring joy to people's lives but I've not been able to do it in my own family.
They see me as a problem more than a person. I wish to leave but I'm only 16 and in India you have to be 18 to leave/get a job. I try explaining it to them but the only thing they do is tell me I'm acting like a problem. I know I do bad things sometimes but I've started to feel less like a person and more like a problem."
1205,Vivid nightmares during antidepressant withdrawal.,"It’s about 2:30, middle of the night, and I was rudely awakened by a serious nightmare. In the past few weeks I was (pretty much) forced to go cold turkey from my Zoloft. 150mg of the stuff. Recently I’ve been having extremely powerful dreams/nightmares, and they almost seem like they’re showing me something that I’ve been missing while taking the Zoloft. 

When I was on Zoloft, I felt emotionally detached from almost everything. Any stress, trauma, or even slight inconvenience wouldn’t phase me at all. As heavenly as that sounds, the same rules applied to the good things that we’re happening in my life. I wouldn’t care. 

Now it seems like everything is hitting me, all at once. It’s overwhelming, it’s extremely scary, and I’m afraid. I don’t want to feel alone in this. Not a lot of people understand the dragon that is discontinuation syndrome. 

Has anybody experienced anything like this? Stories and examples are very much welcomed. 

p.s. this is my first ever post on any subreddit, so, cut me some slack if this is all over the place."

1214,I need advice,"I'm rather closed off about this and it's taking alot out of me to post this, but here it goes. During my early grades, I was a very sociable, but due to cruel bullying I faced when I transferred schools, I became extremely socially aware and have since been more Cautious  and withdrawn. I now hate my body, I hate the fact that I'm skinny and tall and wish I had a better figure, and deeply resent my voice due to it sounding very high pitch and feminine (I was frequently called ""gay"" and homosexual for the way I sounded by said bullies). What's worse is that I feel I can't express myself now and I can't form a romantic bond with girls because of these shamings and imposed values that have been put on me by others, and I am now frightened to even talk to members of the opposite sex I am interested in. This, amongst many other factors, has contributed to my depression in the past (I once felt depressed for two years straight and even suicidal at one point). I hate my body so much and want to 'leave it' (best way I can describe the feeling) still to this day. How can I escape these things of which feel like I have no control over and get out of this hellhole to live the life I always wanted?"

1222,Anyone wanna vent?,Kinda of feel crazy and want to share it
1223,Dad tried to commit suicide while on the phone with me,I never post on reddit but I just need somewhere to vent and advice so bad I’m so desperate. Today my dad called me and told me he was going to slit his throat with a knife he had in his hand the phone call lasted probably like 45 minutes of him just going into detail about how he was going to kill him self after the phone call and him drinking so drunk. It was so traumatizing to sit there and try to talk my dad down and nothing was working I was begging for him to not do it and how I love him and I had to have my boyfriend call the cops on him while I stayed on the phone... he kept drinking and slamming the drink down and everytime I was terrified it was his body slamming on the floor screaming “dad are you there!? Dad!!! Dad!!! Please!” And him just saying he can’t live and trying to give me information of his life insurance. He’s now in the hospital and I’m waiting till the morning to go talk to him because honestly I was so traumatized by everything I couldn’t go right away and see him like that drunk saying he wants to die.. I want to talk to him sober he’s an alcoholic and depressed and I just feel so bad for not going right away but I’ve had suicidal and depression problems in the past and he was so drunk I don’t think he’d remember me coming so I just wanted to mentally recharge so I can sit him down and talk to him about getting help because I feel like I have to be so mentally strong and be there for him it’s just going to be so hard to see him and have this talk I feel so awful and guilty and scared to say the wrong thing I don’t know how I’m going to find the strength I’m only 22 and he has no one else being that he’s driven many friends away with his alcoholism and all our family lives out the country I’m so desperate for any advice my heart is breaking and I don’t know how I’m going to do it
1224,Is this weird?,"I've seen so much about people wishing someone cares about them, they feel alone, etc. . . 
I'm the opposite. I know I should be grateful for the people in my life that say they appreciate me, but I can't help wishing that no one cared about me because then I wouldn't have anyone to disappoint or leave behind. (I don't think I'm actively suicidal) I've been self harm free for over a year now, and the only thing that stops me from relapsing is getting caught. I don't want anyone to care about this. I just want to do my own thing, cope my own way. I want to be left alone. Is this a teenage angst thing or something more?"

We try to put boundaries to help us regulate our relationship and keep us accountable for not being dependent on each other. I know she loves me, too.

1228,Loneliness after breakup plus Coronavirus social isolation,"Hi all,

I’ll try to be brief: I recently split from my long-term partner who’d I’d been living with for 6 years. I’m living on my own. This in itself has been very emotionally hard.

I don’t have a great support network around me, and only a few friends, who aren’t super close anymore (struggles with social anxiety and a resultant drink issue for a good few years - working through these things now though, on a positive note).

My only respite was trying to get out there and do things in my spare time (meet-ups, existing friends, football, etc.) and the fact I’d got a promotion and moved to an office (previously home-worked for 6 months, which I hated due to isolation).

But then COVID hits, and looks like I’ll be isolated for months, with very little social interaction with others and working from home. On my own constantly. Dealing with loneliness already.

The prospect is very scary to me, for my mental health. It was difficult enough, but then this on-top for the foreseeable. Sometimes I just cry.

But I want to be proactive. I’m the only person who can do something to help me. What can I do to try to help my social isolation in particular? Are there online groups you could suggest? Any ideas?

I also want to say though that I’m grateful for my health. I know COVID is a serious thing which can actually take people’s lives. So I always keep that in perspective. And I always try to remember that my situation is temporary, which helps a bit.

Appreciate any advice :)"
1229,I'm so exhausted from trying,"I just want to give up, not on life exactly (maybe a little, but not a risk) 

I'm just tired of trying new medications and going through the symptoms. The hassles of the US healthcare system and learning every in and out of my medical plan. Keeping up with prescriptions, and the hoops pharmacies have put me through. Reading books on mental illness, practicing everything I can. I'm tired of focusing on this part of me, and my interest is dying out.

I trust my psychiatrist and glad she goes above and beyond to help. But I just want to give up on this very long chapter in my life. It's like I've accepted I have no interest in being a millionaire and am okay as long as I can support myself financially. Can't I accept that I just will have a lower quality of life, and move on. As long as I'm able to function and keep a job, and I'm not harming myself nor abusing or hurting others, is it fine just to stop my mental health journey here?"
1230,Growing up with abusive people made me more susceptible to other bullies and unhealthy habits.,
1231,I get extremely uncomfortable when someone has feelings for me. Is this normal?,"I have been emotionally and mentally abused and lied to constantly in two previous relationships two years  ago and  one 7 months ago it really fucked me up ( I met my first boyfriend thru high school from my former bestfriend, second boyfriend through Instagram and we live in the same town.This month I deleted Instagram) . I don't date  because one I have major trust issues and having a hard time believing words they tell me and two I I'm in college  they moved us to online due to Covid-19. Guys tend fall for me right away and tell me I'm cute and want to take me out on a date for a potential relationship and I get extremely comfortable and I cringe every time  they call me ""cute"" I don't know why. Is this normal to feel this way?"
1232,What causes people to withdraw from society?,"Hello,

I am trying to write a story about a guy with a mental health disorder withdrawing from society and become very bitter, only to realize, rue, and regret where he went wrong as he laid on his deathbed in solitude. 

However, I am no mental health expert. Does anyone know what kind of mental disorder might fit into this category, even if it's not a 100% match? I intend for my story to spread awareness of this type of mental struggle, and thus, I want it to be as accurate as possible.

Thank you."
1233,Whats wrong with me,"Im using a throwaway because i might mention somethings i dont want people knowing..

Latley i dont know what been wrong with me, i feel like i dont have energy or motivation sometimes to do what i wanna do, i start thinking about things and i get anxious and it gets me in a really bad headspace and i get depressed.

 I also feel like my mind is foggy, i smoke weed and i thought that was it but even when im not high i still feel like my mind is foggy, sometimes i cant remember things like i forget stuff right after it iust happened, i freeze in social situations, like not anxiety per say but i just think about stuff and i forget im even there. I feel like my mind isnt clear and the more i think about it the more anxious i get. 

i dont know why i feel like i dont have no energy or motivation because everything in my life currenty is going well (other than coronavirus) i have straight A's in school (sophmore in highschool), my family is well, i have good freinds that i trust and i can go to if i need anything, theres nothing in my life that puts me down but i dont know why feel like this. 

This has only been happening for a few weeks and its not been going really well for me. Mentally i feel like im losing my fucking mind i dont know why this is happening to me. Please help."
1234,I just need to vent a little...,"Warning: this may be triggering for some. Please proceed with caution.

Some backstory. Last year around mid february I went to a large party a group chat on telegram I was in was throwing. Typically this kind of thing isnt really advised, but I personally knew one of the guys who lived with the host so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. After I got there however, there was this one guy who immediately took a liking to me. I had already stated in earlier conversation that I was straight and catholic, so while I didnt have an issue with how they wanted to live their lives (the majority of the group was LGBT), I wasnt interested in being in a homosexual relationship (or ""messing around and finding out"" either). Somewhat unbeknownst to me, the guy that had been flirty and crushing on me took this as a challenge. For the rest of the time I was interacting with people he would be nearby and as i got more drunk and stumble he began helping me to the liquor cabinet and even helping me pour. Once i was quite plastered and starting to slip in and out of reality, he got super physical with me and coaxed me to a quiet room. He was alone with me and started having sex with me. I wasnt okay with this, but I was far too drunk to really say or do anything about it. 

The next day was kind of a blur for me as I was still processing what had just happened to me, but over the rest of the week at work it began to weigh on me. I had just been raped. I knew nothing about this guy. Everyone at the party used pseudonyms, myself included, so there was no way for me to even identify him. But what was I supposed to do once i had a name, report him and lose my job for drinking so heavily i was still drunk the next morning when I'm in the navy? It's a serious offense and since I was still in training at a command that treats it like you just murdered someone, I couldnt take the risk. Even still, 4 days had passed and I hadnt slept or gotten any of my training or homework done for my classes.

Day five and I've finally had about 4 hours of sleep and the day comes that I am to stand watch as Reactor Operator. My overinstruct (OI) has been nagging me and criticizing everything I've done up to this point almost 2 hours into my 4 hour watch when the scram alarm goes off. I started having a panic attack. I'm shaking and stuttering and my arms wont respond as I'm trying to take the necessary actions to prevent core damage (dont worry it's a training simulation, but my body wouldn't accept that). Instead of taking the watch as he should have, OI starts screaming at me for not taking my actions.

It's been a year and that whole week (mostly the first day of the shitshow) still has me traumatized. I think about the party almost every day. Sometimes I can still feel his grip and his breath.

Now onto today's issue. I've since confided in a very close friend (who we'll call roomie) everything that happened and what things in my life it has effected. He's also in the navy and has been dealing with some things himself so he was very understanding and supportive. I explained how this event caused me to go mute for nearly 3 months before I felt comfortable speaking to anyone again (i had made an exception for important work related conversation with staff), how that incident led to my girlfriend (who I had planned on asking to marry) dumping me, and that I had been altogether removed from the program and placed on indefinite hold with the expectation that I spoke to mental health before they considered putting me back in the program. So with roomie being so understanding of what that incident did to me and how it continues to effect me, I would have never expected his behaviour last night.

I had some friends over. They were good friends, but I still hadnt known them for very long. While I was streaming on twitch one of my friends was hanging out in my room keeping me company and cracking jokes about my gaming and stuff, it was a fun time. The other was in the living room with roomie.

Roomie made some joke about being gay, I didnt hear much else, but then I hear roomie say: ""oh, but he's got a great story about why he KNOWS he's not gay"" I can basically hear the smile on his face from the tone in his voice. My heart sinks and my 4 hour stream is basically ruined barely an hour in. I cant think straight and suddenly my game is pissing me off so I had to call it by an hour and a half.

I can't fathom why he'd act like that. Hes been my best friend, we've been through everything together and confided or darkest secrets to one another. But now im not sure if he's actually kept this between us and the very few others who I trusted with it. Im teetering on the edge of an anxiety attack while the person I trusted and thought of like a brother tries to make my traumatic experience out to be some joke, egging my friends to ask me about it cuz it's ""his story to tell, but is a good one""

I still don't really know if I wasnt advice or if I just needed to rant but I'm rather shaken and not looking forward to hanging or with that friend abaddon tomorrow like we're had planned."
1235,Why do I always want to be hugged?,"This questions sounds weird and childish, but why do I always feel the need to be hugged. I'm probably going to regret posting this due to the fact that it is extremely embarrassing. Everyday I want someone to comfort me and tell me it's alright. I don't know why I have these feelings and how to stop them."
1236,noticeably mentally ill,"I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and ocd the worst part is that it’s noticeable even tho i’m self aware and i’m relatively healthy especially for someone with all of this going on but the bpd and bipolar disorder are just so noticeable  it’s terribly embarrassing in my professional relationships it shows when i’m manic and i hate it people are kind about it but it’s awful."
1237,I’m terrified of my best friend dying,"Best friend isn’t the most accurate term, but let me explain. When I was 16, I(now 21m) met my best friend(now 21nb) online. We’ve been talking online every day without fail for around five years. Not only do we text, but we do phonecalls, video calls, play games, watch movies and even send each other gifts. The only thing we haven’t done is met each other in person.
At this point, we’re officially queerplatonic partners. Neither of us really have an interest in romantic relationships with anyone else. They’re seriously the most important person in the world to me, I love them more than anything. 
We’ve tried to meet up in person before, but it never seemed to work out. My mental health has always been a struggle for me, and lately with this whole Coronavirus thing, my anxiety is at an all time high. My partner, they have really bad asthma. Whether it’s realistic or not, my mind is constantly occupied by the fear that they will get Covid-19 and die. Their asthma has been acting up really badly in the past few days, too. 
I’ve worried myself past the point of tears, thinking about this. They’re my entire world. I can’t lose them. I don’t know how to rationalize this in my head and calm myself down. 
I don’t want to lose my best friend."
1238,"With the current lockdown, it's more important than ever to look after our mental health.

1239,BF plays mind games,"If hes an asshole to me because he had a bad day I avoid him, but I'm not hurtful. I ask him why he is upset, sometimes he apologizes. When I get upset with him for trying to problem solve instead of just being there when I feel shitty, I'm an asshole. I told in a nice way before I dont like that. He comes off like a smart ass. And why am I always the one who apologizes to him over and over? Even when everything seems fine, and the fight is over, he will still sleep on the couch. Which I fucking hate cuz I worry when he doesn't come to bed and he knows I hate it. He's still punishing me and why? Every time I think ok, I'm not gonna let him get to me, but he does. He pouts like a child and I feel like the fucking responsible one. I fucked up. I'm always an asshole. He told me he resents me and loves the fact that I do less in the relationship physically then him. He wants to and doesn't want to take care of me. I'm in school and dont work as much. Dont do that much around the house but he's also very particular. I dont wanna leave but I think about it sometimes. After I finish my degree, just running the fuck  away. And I know I'm not always an easy person, but I'm starting to think people just have a certain expectation of me in my personal relationships. My parents are more manipulative tho so I'm not moving home. I dont get what I need emotionally and its somehow always my fault. I think I pick people who like to be manipulative. I dont stick up for myself. What is it about me putting what I think are strong willed or steadfast people in my life, who are actually just mean."
1240,Please take a minute to fill out my survey about taking medication on the go (away from home),
1241,This whole corona virus pandemic has really made me anxious.,I really wish I were able to take a few weeks quarentine.  I work at a grocery type store and its kinda hard to do so when the company really hasnt released any info on shutting down or anything.  I mean we are closing earlier than usual but I dont feel safe all that much going outside my home . im not sure what to do and its been messing with my mental health pretty bad.   I guess im just gonna keep going with the flow.  Not sure what else to do when you need money for food and other things
1242,Is there anyone who doesn’t have mental health issues?,"It feels like everyone I know is either depressed, anxious, some are scarily deep into it, others just have occasional triggers. Are there people who are just honestly, genuinely happy with themselves and their lives?"
1243,I'm fucking miserable,"I am going to fail at everything I do in life. I'm ready to die. Fucking take me out. I'm done.

I WISH my depression was bad enough to do it myself. I want desperately to escape, but I've tried suicide before and the aftermath of survival isn't fun. The possibility of dealing with life AND a suicide attempt is just a big no for me.

There's no point to any of this.

Don't fucking respond with comments. I know what you're gonna say. I've read all these posts before. I'm stuck living here for a while, so don't give me the 'don't do it' speeches. I just need an outlet to talk. That's all."
1244,It’s definitely gonna happen,"Not sure what I’ll do next

I can’t stand it when my internet friends hang out without me. My friend group is a group of 4, me, G,P,and A. (Letters for their names). G P and A started playing Pokémon together. I was never interested/had the money to play the game so they just played it without me, for days. Days went without being able to talk to any of them because of the game- now I can’t even look at/hear about pokemon without wanting to die. Same thing has happened with other games. They play them without me and now I can’t even think about the games or the experience without wanting to kill myself. Last night I was on a call with P and G and left to go to the store, saying I’d be back later. When I came back they were playing one of the games. I didn’t tell them anything, but I had a full on breakdown. Like, shaking and stuff. Everytime this happens my mind is clouded with suicidal thoughts. This June P and G are going to meet up irl. I was going to, but possibly won’t be able because of COVID-19. If they do I don’t know how I’ll handle myself. I might actually do it. If seeing them on a call together hurts me this bad, I don’t know what I’ll do if they meet up irl. I actively try to avoid anything regarding the games they’ve played, but they always talk about it in calls and it’s struggle.

Also an edit, Animal Crossing has come out and all three of them are going to play it together! Animal crossing is a very long game so this is going to take them forever, so I really don’t know how I’m going to handle myself :))"
1245,Having A Hard Time With Corona Virus,"Sorry in advance if this is sort of all over the place, I will try my best! 
So pretty much, I am feeling myself slowing going back into depression. I work a really good job and make really good money. However it's in the service industry, I'm a barber. So, things have been incredibly slow this week and my everything is starting to suffer because of it. I know a lot will have the thought of why don't you have savings. I do, just not a lot. I have had this job a little over a year and a half so, I have been replacing old things, moved etc... 
I have been applying for other jobs in case when/if my shop gets closed down. I am just so worried about what I'm going to do if I am jobless for any amount of time. My landlords are understanding but, other things are still worrying me. I lapsed a month back in the fall with my medicine, just birth control but it helps with depression, hormones etc... I fell into a terrible depression when I started taking it again and it lasted months. I am so worried I won't be able to afford it for even just a month. I don't know if I can handle a depression fall for that long again. 
Anyways, not really sure what I am wanting out of this or if it should be as big of a worry as I am making it. Thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to read this, I think typing this out has helped some."
1246,"I don't know what's happening.... Paranoia/Depressed/Body Dysmorphia, getting flashbacks of bad memories from few years ago","Been in the house for 3 days now(feels like a year). I live with my family(sister, dad, mom). I've been feeling super paranoid lately (like my dad, mom and sis are planning something or talking about me behind my back). My parents are hard core traditionalists and believe that things should work in a certain way only. My mom is a school teacher and is always on the edge - keeps telling me how I'm a failure, *used to* call me a retard, says everything bad in the house happens because of me(arguments etc), is always negative and keeps blaming me for things that happened years ago and all other negative stuff. 

My background - 

- Diagnosed with BDD/Major depressive disorder 5 years ago. 
- Drank toilet cleaner in a suicide attempt. 
- Parents sent me abroad to study, but I failed out of all subjects and had to come back home. 
- Been taunted by my mother since(6+ months), how I'm a failure and a disappointed and she wished she never had me.

I have been trying to make apps(mobile and web) to get enough capital to go back abroad to study and get away from my mother and I thought this time of quarantine would be perfect for me to work on it. I've previously made 3 apps and a mobile game hoping to make it work, but it didn't. 

Anyways, all this stuff is very soul crunching. To add on top of this - I have no friends here. 

I'm currently taking Prodep and Abilify but idk what to do in regards to the situation with my mother - even listening to her voice gives me anxiety now and makes me think she's going to say something terrible that will bring back bad memories. 

Maybe my feelings are intensified rn because she just said that I'm a worthless loser and she's going to kick me out of the house. But I can't hide my feelings."
1247,I don't know if I need help.,"Perhaps the title is a bit misleading, but I've been in a rut lately. I have had an amount of misfortune this year. I try being as open as possible, but it appears that a significant number of people just can't figure me out. It seems that they refrain from trying to understand anything I say or tell them. 
Lately, though emotions certainly aren't my strong suit, I feel as if I genuinely hate talking to anyone for an extended period of time. This isn't to say that I hate socializing. No, I only notice the feeling when the other person is talking about something I REALLY couldn't care less about. I have absolutely no desire to talk about things I'm not interested in.
I'm far from being narcissistic, because obviously nobody can hate me as much as I hate myself-- but I don't perceive my want for isolation from boring conversation as bad. Is it, though?
I thought for a moment that perhaps I'm forcefully distancing myself from everyone because they don't make an effort to understand me, because I don't make an effort to understand them, but is it really so much to ask that my friends and I only converse about topics that are interesting to both of us? 
Yeesh, I still care about their well being, and I'm more than happy to help when they need it or I perceive that they need it. (Though I am particularly chuffed about how they victim-blamed me when I was talking about my ""feelings"") could I be holding a grudge? The heck is wrong with me?"
1248,Cant care or focus on conversation,"I used to be a really personable and ok conversationalist, but for the past year I find myself tuning out of conversation. Like I cant bring myself to care about what someone is saying, I even struggle with it in videogames where I just skip dialogue completely. In books I find myself skipping about or being unable to focus. I have depression and anxiety, but this doesn't feel like that. I get so annoyed with the person talking and the intrusive thought that pops into my head is ""just leave me alone"" on repeat even if they are a friend of mine. I know it's not good for me, and itll get worse if its unaddressed, but I dont even know where to start :("
1249,Stop trying to get me to buy a fucking gun.,"I'm losing my shit. Covid swept in and my MIL has lost her fucking mind thinking it's a huge conspiracy and we need to protect ourselves. She tried to tell me to get a gun despite telling her multiple times it's not safe and I live in a gun free home because safety. She then told my boyfriend (her son) some very misinformed and panicked info....AT WORK. But then also said that we needed to get a gun. Again. After I already said bad idea. I love her to pieces but like.....



My house CANNOT have a gun due to SAFETY reasons. NOT EVERY HOME IS SAFE WITH A GUN. STOP SAYING I SHOULD GET A GUN.  IT WILL TAKE MY SAFETY FROM A 7 TO A 2 MAYBE."
1250,Coronavirus and Why You Don't Have to Hoard: Chronicles of a Germaphobe,"I apologize for the formatting, I'm on mobile. I wanted to preface this by saying that I suffer from severe OCD of the germaphobic variety. This isn't the cutesy ""oh he's just afraid of shaking hands, how quirky"" kind of OCD most people think about. There are some times where I stay in bed for days because I am disgusted by the thought of touching even the things that I own. As you can imagine, this has a devastating effect on my college/personal life and subsequently it affects my mental health. I have experienced intense feelings of wanting to end my own life. I have cried myself to sleep before, cursing every breath of air that fills my lungs. I've lashed out against who or whatever it was that dropped me into this mortal coil. I've washed my surroundings and myself to the point that this is what my hands, the hands of someone in their early 20s, look like: https://imgur.com/a/zNLTUpT And I should make note that I am in therapy, but every day is still a massive struggle and a lot of the time it feels like the world is against me. Now we get to the part where I explain why I'm telling you all of this. You might expect someone like me to be scrambling to hoard every last paper towel or bottle of windex I can find. But I haven't, and I don't plan on it, even though every fiber of my being is telling me to. If I can swallow my fear so that others can have access to important resources during this time of uncertainty, I'm willing to bet that you all can, too. The world is afraid right now. This is precisely the moment where we need to come together and help each other out instead of throwing others to the wolves. Don't hoard. Share with others. While I'm at it, don't attack people of different races because of the outbreak, or in general. Go ahead and share my story with someone if you think they need to hear it. I hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. Thanks for reading."
1251,Is there some toxicity in the mental health community?,"This is usually online communities and I am in no way saying that this is everyone just the ones in these commuites just come off as toxic positivity in a way.

 not talking about evey mental illness 

Being too positive as if there is nothing wrong with mental disorders

Not educated others just telling them to not be stigmatizing 

stigmatizing people who dont understand about mental disorders 

Over diagnosing children as in result of fear of them suffering 

wanting everyone to walk on egg shells around you... put triggers on everything were its unnecessary not wanting no one to be happy when your not and one thing I see all the time is not talk about for example weight loss or exerciser or food because it will cause anorexia"
1252,"Subreddit offering a space, mental health information and news, support and a place to promote your mental health related work/blogs etc, mainly for people from the UK 🙂","Hello all! As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it.

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy.

1254,I really want my friend with an eating disorder to get help...,"A friend of mine thinks that she has an eating disorder but she never got diagnosed. She had a doctor's appointment the other day about her mood lately and she failed to mention her eating disorder. I must mention that she's my internet friend, I can't physically help her. On top of that, she has diabetes type 1, depression and anxiety. She eats 500 calories a day. She's aware of her condition, she's aware that she's starving herself. She has been feeling very shitty the past three weeks or so. I really don't know how to communicate with her, how to help her out. I just feel like she doesn't want to get out of this mindset nor help herself. I can't just let this happen, I can't let my friend eat 500 calories a day. She's aware that she is not overweight, yet she thinks that she still looks fat. She has a lifestyle that is rather unhealthy, especially for a person in her shoes. She drinks alcohol to the point of getting wasted and has a nicotine addiction. She wakes up around 3 pm every day... She has been feeling really shitty for a very long time now... I really want for her to get help, how can I help someone who is so unenthusiastic about getting help?"
1255,What is this called?,"I am diagnosed with bpd, mdd, and social anxiety. But that's not what this question is. I talked to a few of my therapist but none can put a name on it. 

Sometimes I get in these ""episodes"" which are sorta like an anxiety or panic attack but worse. I get physically cold and I start shaking(not like a sezure) just like an increasing shiver till my whole body starts shaking. Then it all stops. Everything feels like it is going slow. I often start moving my head back and forth. I just stare an empty stare. I've been told it's dissociation. But im almost like playing a movie in my head with a different ending each time of the situation I am in. It normally ends with me falling asleep. Does this like mental movie with the supposed dissociation have a name? Thank you in advance!"
1256,I don't know where to post this but I am very stressed - need advice,"Maybe I should go to r/cptsd but I'd like some advice


I am a personality type which deals with 'moderation' poorly...but I took up the role anyways because of a personal passion of mine. I've been a NEET for a while now and I don't enjoy it. I'm at home all day with a very 'cold' or 'emotionally neglectful' family, so when I have an issue or just want to talk, they make things worse and don't support me at all. They seem normal until I need them for advice or support, then they are dismissive and very cold. I have social anxiety and dealt with emotional neglect/some levels of emotional abuse and anyone with emotional neglect can tell you for the most part their self-esteem is non-existent.


At the moment I kinda am unable to sleep these days. I try to adjust my pillow but I guess it's not really about the pillow. My mind is racing in the night and I'm always worried about what's online, and my body is just in a constant state of hypervigilance due to the emotional abuse I've endured over the years....The funny thing is the corona virus hasn't worried me in the least. I've become very numb these days, but even this stress is beyond that. I guess being indoors all day I barely noticed the whole panic about it. I have no one to talk to about my stress and I feel like hell inside. I even have an embarassing habit I developed of talking out loud to myself because when I talk to my family they hate it or run away or worse case scenario attack me.


I had an argument with my mum yesterday and said I'm tired of her pretending to care, I said I'm also tired of her breaking promises, ignoring me and my mental health issues, gaslighting and invalidating my experiences and being in general a hypocrite. I said a few bad things I'm not proud of and then I said I'm not gonna speak to her anymore because...basically she is never there for me anyways, the amount of times I've been on the edge is astronomical but she just dodges me entirely. Only talks to me when I'm joking around and I'm sick of having to be chipper all of the time in order for my mum to not run away from my conversations. I usually am not serious in these claims but I simply had enough, something inside of me died, I'm just so sad I had to reach this conclusion.


Now I'm pretty much isolated in my house. I always am, a few years in fact, but having a responsibilty now and all the stress and just no internal sense of self-esteem or support outside is getting to me. It wasn't apparent when I was wasting time on the internet watching shows because I was simply killing time and I wasn't speaking to anyone. Even online I don't speak to anyone, I was warned constantly about my sister not to 'speak to strangers online' so I always kept my problems to myself. I don't speak to anyone (but myself), stressed, worried about moderating and just people online in general and depressed....very depressed. I feel like I'm being attacked on the side. I need to take a shower but I can barely brush my teeth. Even if I had someone to talk to I can't tell them I'm moderating online because my account is anon and I would like to just be calm.


I'm either bored or stressed. I hate being both. I want to be content and happy. Idk why life is this freaking hard. I have zero emotional coping skills (thanks to my family) or self-confidence. 


My family is very selfish and unsupportive and this dysfunctional household, the only person who can see how strange it is, is me. I don't know how I ended up a NEET. I think me dropping out of college has everything to do with how little self-esteem I have. I don't have any support or guidance. It's crazy how it is...I feel like a wreck and a mistake.


I don't want to not have anything I want to do with my life. I don't enjoy being indoors all day. I don't think it's cool or trendy either. I want to stop having social anxiety and live. But when I attempt to actually create something or interact with others outside the bubble of tv shows, I become very stressed. I take magnesium tablets to cope with the stress but I doubt it's helping. I feel very on the edge.

Im not sure if this is serious or not. I get sudden attacks like palpitations, cold hands and worries of the future. It all started after my ex left me. It’s like half of me was taken away. I hate myself for this feeling that my ex still has a hold on me. Please help on how to stop this?"

1259,"TW su!cidal thoughts mentioned, bad English","I feel ashamed writing this because I feel my struggles aren’t enough to warrant this, but I can’t go on like this. 
I told my mom I “didn’t want to grow up” on my 5th birthday, I spent my early childhood (3-6) being a cheerful, mature kid who spent their free time in a dark room (my choice), rocking back and forth and crying, which I found out my parents thought was cute.
I was a straight A student through elementary/middle/high school, extremely depressed and extremely isolated (although I had friends). I got bullied but protected others from bullying and had an active after school life.
I’m 19 and a freshman in engineering, something I’m good at but have no interest in and i simply want to d!e. I’m studying something that I have zero interest in (but would know what else to do as I have zero interest in general), to do a job that I don’t care about, not even for me, but to support my disabled mom and old dad, who I feel don’t love me a lick (family is a completely different crazy story), while feeling like su!cidal 24/7 for 12-15 years. 
I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up.
And now I’m stuck in quarantine with my older cousin, who’s constantly suggesting some courses I can take to better myself while class is out, and I cannot tell her that I have no energy todo my regular class work or exist.
I can’t dump that on her, especially since we’ll be stuck here alone for months to come (and we’re on different sides of a family cold war), so I’m just dumping it here to get it off my chest. I feel ashamed of myself, I think I’m lazy and whiny and just using this to excuse my unwillingness to do anything, but I just don’t know what to do. That’s it and sorry if you read this mess."
1260,"To tell or not to tell (that I slipped up), that is the question.","First time poster on here, long time mental health fighter. I’ve been struggling with Major Depressive Disorder for most of my life (having suicidal thoughts since I was 10) and didn’t start getting treatment until I was 22. Since starting treatment I have worked really hard to shed my bad coping skills, including self-harm; I’ve been clean of cutting for well over a year and a half at this point. 

For the past few weeks I’ve been unable to cry although I’ve felt like I really needed to. For the past week I’ve been working 11-13 hour days as I’m considered essential personal at a medical facility. I felt so overtired, horrible, and emotionally constipated last night that I cut. It was just a few, and they weren’t deep as I don’t want them noticed at work- I just wanted to try anything to get myself to cry and express myself instead of being so stoic and not letting my feelings out. 

I’m trying to decide whether I should tell my partner and/or my therapist. The marks have faded pretty much over night, so at this point there’s no evidence for anyone to call me out on. Do I keep this quiet and pretend it never happened, or do I let the people who are the most active in my treatment know I slipped up? I can’t figure out what I should do, so I appreciate any advice."
1261,I think I have a mood/emotinal disorder...,"I have been diagnosed with ASD at age 6. As a child I had no friends and would watch TV all day, I was also very fat. Each time I think about my childhood I feel so sad even tho there really didn't happen anything bad to me. I feel like I was wasted, and left alone, and deep down it's still haunting me. Because of my autism and of this """"""traumatic"""""" past I'm a very empathic person but sometimes it takes another level. Last day I spended 4 hours crying about Britney Spears and her life. The other day I wanted to kill myself thinking about how hard my mom's life has been (she grew up very poor) I use others as an excuse for crying and I exaggerate things. Life is a game and I need to win. I'm in constent competition. I feel so sad and angry at life until... euphoria kicks in. I start laughing for no reason and I imagine funny things, I go wild and become unstoppable. Suddenly life is so fun and I feel like I'm never going to die. It changes every hour. I go from happiest person on Earth, who believes in everyone, to rejected victim who feels like nothing is going to be okay. During my sadness ""episodes"" (which last for around 1 hour) I hear sad musics and feel like I'm trapped. Trapped in one of these sad 90's Vaporwave videoclips, assisting to my family's sad life. Everything and every breath I take makes me wanna cry. I want to die. Once I was passing an exam that I knew I was failing and during it I was thinking non-stop about my big brother who dropped-out of school and I thought I was going to end up like him. I kept crying that day. But when the laughter kicks in, nothing makes sens, the music I hear becomes happy and silly, like that: https://youtu.be/wkEVwEwT9GE and suddenly I feel very powerful. My sexual urges also increase. My emotions varie, but it's ALWAYS extreme. I've been like that since forever but recently I enterred adulthood (I'm 19) and I feel so lost and alone, yet I don't want any sign of affection from others.

1264,How to survive quarantine with bad parents?,"Sorry for my bad English, I'm not native speaker.
So, I am a girl with BPD and anxiety and I have been going to therapist but now everything is cancelled due to this Corona epidemic.

I'm living with my parents and my brother who is total opposite and flegmatic and doesn't stress about anything.

I don't have a loving relationship with my father for as long as I can remember, he is always making fun of me, saying ugly words, laughing in my face, etc. He roll his eyes when he sees me and so on. He sure does love my brother and always having fun with him. 

My mother is a women with depression and very manipulative and self loving. She has to be always right and always yells and if I want to tell her my own opinion and my emotions she tells me that she is sick and suicidal and that I don't have a reason to be feeling low beacuse I have a great parents and a great life and she starts screeming whenever I want to tell her that she hurt me with something. Beside this, she is having a lover and I have been living with that information for a years now, without telling anyone to keep her safe at home and to keep family going. And few weeks ago she told me that she doesn't have any emotions towards me and that when I was younger she had a struggle to hug me or show me any kind of emotions because it wasn't natural to her.
And then I told her I know everything about her and her cheating my father and lying to me and everything else and she blamed me and told me Im bad daughter, I should be ashamed of talking like that to my mother, she is perfect mother to me, etc.

She even had purposely made panic attack and ended up in hospital blaming me I almost killed her and forbidding me to talk about what I have told to her about her been a cheater. I am a student on my last year, have no money, I found I job but now that agency won't opet because of virus, and Im forced to be in quarantine with my family.

I'm doing my faculty tasks daily to distract myself and been praying alot and working out in my room but they are yelling all the time and whenever I step up out of my room they just put down my will to live and my positive mindset that I'm struggling to get in my room with these chores and routines I'm doing for myself and for my mental and psychical health.

This qurantine would totally work out for me if I lived alone because I can focus on getting better and eating healthy and working out and praying and everything good. Because otherwise I go out few times a week and drink too much alcohol and eating crap and I even had a drug problem years ago that I still struggle in my mind.

Sorry for the long post but since I don't have a therapist right now to talk to and my friends are great but they don't get me because they dont have mental disorders or any kind of struggles of this kind.. I just need to tell this to someone and to maybe have some helping words.

How to survive this quarantine?
I hope you and me survive and make the best of us 🙏 stay safe people, sending you love and prayers 🙏"
1265,I don't know what to do.,"I'm starting to feel jealous of my friends for things as small as a meaningless pumpkin drawing and I don't know why. Maybe it's because I feel ignored? Everyone got compliments except for me. Was it that bad? Probably. And I'm probably overreacting too. Logically thinking, its probably because I don't get a lot of praise from my accomplishments. Emotionally speaking, I'm probably just not liked as much in my friend group. I want to believe the logic but the emotional aspect is just so easy to fall under. I always dish out praise and compliments but never receive anything. I have to scream to get noticed while others only have to whisper. I have to step out of my comfort zone to do things when other people can just do it in their's. Why? Why is everything a struggle for me to do? One simple thing like playing a video game causes me to get upset because I'm not even good at that."

1269,My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been struggling and I can’t mentally handle it anymore,"Hi, I am going through something very hard and confusing and I just need help. I have a boyfriend who we’ve been dating for coming up on 4 years now. We were each other’s first bf/gf and everything. We linked super well and sprouted an amazing relationship. Everything clicked inbetween us and it was definitely one you could tell can last forever. Well.. my boyfriend gave up during our transfer to college and his life started to get rocky. I was there every step of the way. He lost motivation and effort in wanting to do small things and gradually big things until it also became no motivation for our relationship. He got diagnosed with ADD and begun taking adderal, which completely killed his personality and emotions. Taking this medication daily with the already bad mindset it changed his personality and views and he seems to have given up even more. He sees himself as a disappointment and knows his parents think of him as one as well, so he doesn’t get much support there anymore and so he gives up more. He also gained anger issues and can’t control his anger very well anymore. I think over the time that this has happened he’s confused me with his parents and everyone else he believes he’s disappointed and views me the same. When in reality I’m here for him and want him to succeed. Our relationship has grown quite toxic and one sided and I can’t handle it anymore. I love him with all my heart and he loves me too and doesn’t want this to be reality, I think he’s just dug himself into such a hole that he doesn’t think he can get out.
An argument happened between us recently and I got fed up with the treatment I was getting so I wrote him a letter of what I’m looking for and need in a relationship and I read it to him. I also suggested we go on a break for a month in which we are doing now. He said he is going to work on himself because he wants a future with me and I want the same. I have no friends and with this whole corona virus I can’t go to college anymore and try to make some. So everyday I’m sitting alone at home thinking and crying and it’s breaking my heart. I just want to go back to him and cut off the break and continued to be treated bad because it feels better than being alone and dealing with this. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I need help getting my mind off of him and being happy. I play video games but I find myself zoning out and thinking about our relationship. I honestly wish I had friends. I am at such a road block and need help, please anyone have any advice?

TL;DR I’m on a month break with my boyfriend and I can’t get my mind off of him no matter what I do. (Side note I also don’t have any friends)"

1271,Anybody know what's going on?,"Hi Guys,

I have been suffering with anxiety and depression for a long time now. 

I spent 2 years in Rehab and was told it was a dual diagnosis.

However, since I stopped drinking 4 years ago, I have been getting very serious ups and downs. From not leaving the room for days to self harming. Although in the last 2 years they haven't been that bad.

I can feel it coming and I just tend to as much as I can till it passes, I sleep a lot, try to play some video games till I feel myself again.

I am going through a very bad one this week. i haven't washed, barely eating, I get so angry that a punch things, the littlest things annoy me, can't look at myself, I hate myself. Where two or three weeks ago I was fine.

I have seen doctors etc and they don't know what it is. They say it's something I have to live with. That there is nothing they can do. Im on lexapro for years now. 

Im getting very pissed off about these dips and feel like I can't take much more of them. If the pubs where open I would be at the end of the bar drinking my face off.

Im way behind in college work and if i had a full time job I would be more than likely get fired.

Nothing seems to make this go faster. Exercise, healthy eating, it just comes and goes. Thats how I get through them. It goes away. It has before and it will again. I just want to crawl up in a ball and cry.

Im just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or is going through something similar know what is going on?

A Councillor I seen a while ago said it was like seeing two different people: One that was fidgety, couldn't keep still, depressed, anxious and the second that was happy, calm and relaxed.

A doctor said if I had bi-polar I would of known about it before.

Thanks for your help."
1272,Anxiety about having house mates,"I'm moving in a house with 2 siblings, I barely know them but since the covid-19 outbreak I was asked to move out of my current place. The siblings offer a very low rent price and their place is quite neat as well, so I'm moving in with them next week. 

The thing is, I'm not comfortable with sharing a house with someone I barely know. I've been very VERY anxious about this, I am an extremely introverted person and I'm very awkward around others, I also value my alone time a lot. I don't know how I will handle living with two strangers.  

Has anyone had a similar experience? Can you tell me how you get used to it? thanks :&lt;"
1273,What’s the difference between a trigger and a cause for an anxiety disorder?,"People with anxiety disorders often say that there are things that trigger their anxiety and panic attacks. But most people don’t have an anxiety disorder despite experiencing these things. The things that are triggering to them aren’t triggering for people without an anxiety disorder, so is it bad to say that those things directly caused the anxiety disorder when they don’t cause it in most people? Somebody who has anxiety might say that being in tight crowds will trigger their anxiety, but many people don’t have any problem being in tight crowds."

1276,Should I look for a new therapist?,"I started going to therapy in around october, I didn't do a good research before making the appointment and ended up going with a therapist specialized in psychoanalysis. At the begining this was a problem because big parts of the sessions were complete silence. But then I read a bit about psychoanalysis and learned that I had to do 99% of the talk. After that the silcence was not an issue but I still had the feeling I wasn't going there to solve my problems, I was just going there the tell the therapist about my week and how I felt, sometimes feeling the same or sometimes even worse after leaving. Now I'm not saying that was completely useless, I'm sure I've become much more open, and that having someone to talk to about whats making me stressed at the moment must help, as I don't normally speak with my friends or family about my problems But I have the feeling that I'm not solving my real issues. We have spoken about important topics but only to never touch the subject again.

Two sessions ago I expressed this to my therapist and he told me that I could be right but that the decision was mine. I also gave him a kind of mind map that I made with what I think are my problems. On our last session I asked him for a recomendation on what I should do, and he gave me as options (not really recomentations): to continue our sessions; to investigate about Behavioral therapy and see if it suits me better (and then find someone else); or group psychoanalysis with him. 

My biggest problem i think is that my lack of friends and love life caused by appearance issues, other isecurities, and maybe issues from the past makes me depressed, that affects my already poor performace at university leading to even more depression. And I also feel I have some type of attention deficit 

Tl;dr: I go to psychoanalysis therapy, I feel it isn't working because I don' talk about my real problems, and when I do I get no feedback or questions and we don't touch the topic again. I told my therapist about it and gave him a mind map where I wrote down what I think my problems are and he told me that it was for me to decide if I wanted to keep trying therapy with him or move on. My problems are mostly social, caused by insecurities and appearance issues.



Here is the ""mind map"" I gave to my therapist:

On the 6th of March, my nan died. 
And then, COVID-19 hit the UK. 

I have symptoms of COVID-19 and the funeral is on Monday. I had written a eulogy in preparation and I was due to be a pallbearer, guardian of my nans body, one of the last people to give her strength. I can't be there, I can't use the public transport with these symptoms, I can't justify putting everyone at risk for my own emotional merit.

I work and go to college full time in hopes of one day having a job I love and be happy. But I often think of hurting myself and I don't know why. I don't have insurance to cover psych help so i have been trying to deal with this alone since i graduated from high school.  I often feel guilty for being this way because many people are in way worse situations but i have no way out of my head and i am constantly tired and in a bad mood and i am afraid of that affecting my relationships with people. I truly want to feel better. I came on reddit as an outlet and a way to put my thoughts into words and hopefully not feel alone or like i'm insane.

When I was 16, this older guy took me to a party he was 18. I got wasted I had never been that drunk before. He took me to another house and had me have sex with him and his friend. They called me gross after and said it was my fault. They ignored me after it happened. Told ill ruin his reputation because I'm unpopular.
I hooked up with the guy a few times after because of what happened I felt like no other guy would want me. 




When I was 17, one time, when we were booking up, he took photos of me. Afterward, he ignored me, and I found out he was in a relationship (I don’t hook up with people in a relationship). He never made it clear from the start. He only wanted sex when I wanted more at 18. He was 20. He called me annoying that he wants sex and nothing more.
I moved away. I haven't seen him in person for five years. Now years later, he continually tries to contact me. 



I am 23 now he is 25. He tells me I'm beautiful and he's never felt so comfortable with someone. He begs me to visit him(I moved states). He also keeps the photos of me from when I was younger saying ”don't you miss this”
I tell him how he ignored me and used me to hurt me that I don't want to see him again. He told me,” what did you expect? You slept with a guy, and he didn't call you back grow up.” he was saying that I most guys suck that I need to grow up cause most guys would ignore me.
Am I the asshole for being upset about the past?

1288,Overthinking is ruining my life,"It's been pointed out to me that I overthink a lot. Not just on big issues, but also little things that shouldn't require lots of thought. I've tried to keep this post short-ish, as I can ramble a lot, but please let  me know if you have any questions.

It's gotten to the point where I won't join in on conversations, because I'm waiting for the ""right"" moment to say something, which always means I never say anything, because the right moment is never there. I'm becoming the quiet person who never says anything and no one wants to be that person. (To be clear, I don't think there's anything wrong with  being a quiet person, but I've been told it's not a good quality to be quiet all the time. :( )

It also  means I really struggle with comforting people when they're going  through tough times. They come to me with an issue and, if I can't think  of anything to say, my brain internally panics and wants to ""run away"". This means I freeze and don't say anything, which is basically not doing anything at all. I get the sense that this really annoys people,  especially my girlfriend, who has told me she sometimes gets fed up with me not being able to help her when she's having trouble and she feels she can't get upset, because then I'll get upset (because I don't know  what to do) and it doesn't help her problem at all.

Another thing I do is add loads of little caveats to things. I usually do this  to let people I have thought about something and to avoid people  ""jumping down my throat"", but it often means I say a lot without really saying anything at all. I'm trying to reduce the amount of these that I use, but it's difficult, because I've got into the habit of caveating things all the time.

Anyway, I don't want this to ruin my life, or my relationship. Is there anything I can do?"

1290,ADHD or just addicted to pot/nicotine?,"Hey everyone — So, a bit of background:

My father/sister have diagnosed ADHD *(I suspect my brother may too, but he hasn't looked into it).* About a month ago, I met someone who shared their experience with ADHD with me, and ever since then I've been really curious about my own mental health. This COVID-19 pandemic has given me a good amount of time to reflect on what I believe *could* be possible symptoms *(and yes, I know you're not qualified to diagnose me)*, but another part of me feels that I may be experiencing the impostor phenomenon, in that I could have internalized the idea of having ADHD—and that I'm tricking myself into thinking I have it—rather than actually having it.

In high school, I didn't use any drugs. To this day, I rarely even drink coffee. But in college, I picked up vaping and even smoke weed regularly. Now (senior year), I've heard that if you don't treat an undiagnosed person with ADHD with stimulants, they sooner or later will do it by themselves with things like caffein, nicotine and alcohol *(unless they've unknowingly discovered healthier coping mechanisms like exercise, etc.).*

I'm not asking for a diagnoses, but I would like to start some dialogue in order to dispel some the stereotypes that have ultimately prevented myself *(and I'm sure many others)* from going in for a diagnosis. The following are a few of these concerns:

**Is it possible that me becoming accustomed to nicotine/cannabis has made me \*think\* that I have ADHD?** I've already brought up my parents that I believe I could have ADHD, and they know I smoke weed, although they discourage it. They told me that my mental health is a priority, so they would take me to see a specialist, if I really wanted. However, they suggested that I should really give up weed/nicotine for at least 2-3 months to see if my ""craving for dopamine"" subsides. Part of this really resonated with me—because prior to college—I hadn't had a nicotine addiction, I wasn't a regular smoker (pot), and I never had occasionally experimented with stimulants to get assignments done. I'm worried that going down this path has made me believe that I have ADHD, when in reality, I could've given these symptoms to myself by creating a dependency? I actually haven't had nicotine in my system in over two weeks and I feel fine. However, I *need* weed in oder to sleep.

Not long ago, when I traveled abroad, I went about 2 weeks off cannabis to see if I could sleep at night—and I literally *couldn't* turn my brain off. I'm a very light sleeper as well. I ended up needing to use Benadryl/melatonin because I was becoming so sleep deprived after the first few days. By the time the trip ended, I pretty much kicked the difficulty getting to sleep. But as soon as I returned home, I went straight back to cannabis. This is what worries me about taking a few months off to see if my symptoms subside. I feel like I'd just be torturing myself. I feel like people will just tell me to give up weed and see how I feel, but as embarrassing as it is to say, I physically can't see myself doing so.

**Is it possible that cannabis gets a bad rap about ""being addictive,"" when it could actually just be a ton of neurodiverse people using it as a way to self-medicate?**

**I've heard that ADHD isn't something that is just readily/easily diagnosed—but I also commonly hear that psychiatrists misdiagnose or push pills for profit—do I have anything to fear with this happening to me?**

When things die down, I do want to take additional steps to investigate my mental health further, in a person-to-person setting. I have no clue how to find a reputable psychiatrist/ADHD specialist, and since I'm under my parents coverage, that probably needs to be factored in too. So if there's any additional tips for finding a reputable physician that I could trust, I'd appreciate it. Writing this out has definitely helped me organize my thoughts for when I do go see someone."
1291,I don’t want to live but I’m afraid of death,"
I no longer want to live, I’ve lost the will to live and I’m just in pain all of the time. I often fantasise about suicide and how better off I would be dead. I sometimes think about how I can kill myself and what’s the fastest and least painful way. The only obstacle in my way, is my fear of death. I want to end my life but I think about how I might regret it and how death is so final. So I spend nearly every day wanting to be dead but being too afraid to do anything about it. Sometimes my life can be going good and I want to live that day and the next few days but I never fully want to live. I don’t see myself wanting to live forever on those days and I remind myself of everything that’s wrong with my life and how the happiness is not going to last long. 

I have autism and OCD and my life is hell because of it. I hate having these disorders and I have no respect for myself. I see myself as a worthless person, that has no value. 

Having OCD affects my life so much everyday. I have so many disturbing, obsessive thoughts that I can’t bear any longer. These thoughts are about murder, harming others and others harming me, animal abuse, cannibalism, rape, sexual assault, pedophilia, stalking, poison, dirt, germs, diseases, death, racism and being a Nazi. Those are only the main obsessive thoughts that go through my head for hours a day, I have much more. No matter what I do, I can never control my OCD. It always takes over my mind and I’m constantly feeling as if I’m a murder or I’m dying from cancer or some other crazy thing. Feeling this way everyday is torture and I can’t do it anymore. I also have compulsions but my thoughts are far more overwhelming. I check vents, because people might be looking through them and I crack my joints and fidget, because something bad might happen otherwise. I have injury’s from some of my past compulsions. Not too long ago I injured the muscles in my neck from stretching my neck so much because of my OCD. I received CBT about a year ago but I hated every minute of it. I was too embarrassed to be honest about my problems and I constantly felt as if my therapist was judging me, even though I was just being paranoid. Nothing that she done helped me and she always presumed that I just wasn’t trying. I struggled to talk to her enough because of my autism but the fact that I had to talk about my problems made it even harder. I remember walking out of therapy feeling completely drained and so weak. I get very nervous in social situations and I’m not good at socialising. 

Being autistic is what I hate most about my life. When I was told that I have autism, I cried and I was in denial for a few years. I refused to admit it to myself. The reason for that, was because of what other kids would say about autism. They would use it as an insult and bully other kids who they knew had it. One girl in my class who had a disability of some kind would be bullied all of the time. Nobody would go near her, it was as if she had a disease. I became her friend but I haven’t made any other friends since. I’m 16 now and I only have one more year left in school, yet I haven’t made a single new friend. I still hear ignorant comments about autism from teenagers my age. I just feel so alone . I cry myself to sleep sometimes because of how lonely I feel. I love talking to people but whenever I open my mouth, I ruin everything. It takes me a lot of time to become comfortable with someone but when I do, I’m fine. When people start to know me, they like me but then find out about my “popularity“ and ditch me. Being rejected all of the time, makes me feel worthless and like I’m nothing. Because of this, I care about what others think too much and I have trouble seeing when people are being nice to me and I always assume the worst. My self confidence is so low and this affects everything in my life. Because I have no friends, I can’t do normal teenage activities such as hanging out with friends at the shops or at the cinema. I don’t have any social media’s where I show my face and real name because nobody ever wants to add or follow me. I’ve never touched alcohol or cigarettes, gone to party’s, clubs or done anything rebellious with friends. I never had a boyfriend and I’ve never even kissed a boy before. I worry that things will never change and that I’ll be alone forever. I think about never getting married or never having children. I fear that my children might suffer from the same problems as me or that I’ll be an unfit and embarrassing mother. I see myself as unsuccessful and lonely for the rest of my of my life and I think that I will probably regret not ending my life sooner. This way of thinking definitely doesn’t help my situation but I don’t know how to think positive anymore. My teenage years have been completely wasted. My life is just crumbling even more each day. 

I decided to quit school a few days ago because of how it makes my OCD worse and because I have no friends. I sat in school everyday looking up at the clock, I couldn’t wait for it to end. I never learnt anything because I felt so unenthusiastic about being there, I was tired from obsessing about being there the night before, my OCD was at it’s worst and I constantly thought about having no friends and what others thought about me. Everyone knows that I’m autistic because I had no other choice but to join an autistic unit in my school when I made no friends. I can eat my lunch there and not have to sit alone, while everyone looks at me and judges me. It was definitely a bad decision, society is so uneducated and ignorant when it comes to autism and I’m treated like dirt because of it. Nobody sees me as anything else but the label “autistic”. Everyone thinks that autism is an intellectual disability but it’s a cognitive disability. I’m treated like a child but I’m the smartest in most of my classes. I’m constantly looked down on and spoken to as if I can’t understand basic English. It doesn’t matter how many times I get good grades, people don’t change their minds about me, the label is stuck with me. Last year I was selected for an award and I went to get it, thinking that I was going to be rewarded for my good grades all year. I got the “personal achievement award”, along with another autistic kid. It was humiliating and I loudly complained to my sister about it and everybody stared at me.  I couldn’t get a subject award, like every other kid. They were basically saying that I wasn’t good enough for those awards but I tried. I only got that award because I’m autistic, otherwise I would of got a proper award. I’m nothing to anybody, I will always be less and I can’t change that. It really hurts to be both friendless and treated like nothing in school. I want to learn, go to college and be successful but I can’t go to school anymore. I know that I’ll eventually force myself to go back and cause my mental health to deteriorate even more but there’s no other option. When I was 14, I quit school for a month and I would rarely go. I was out of school more than I was in school. I was in a really dark place and I’m going back in that direction, accept this time, it’s even worse.  

Another thing about my life that‘s really causing me difficulty right now, is my family. Since I was a little kid, the fact that my family were bad for me, was clear. This might sound harsh, everybody always says that you have to love your family, because their your family but I disagree. Should I really love people that treat me horribly, just because their family ? I don’t think so. My mother is selfish and a narcissist. I stopped telling her about my problems years ago, as she always compared my situation to somebody who was less fortunate than me. One day my sister tried to tell my mother about her problems and she just laughed, while my sister was in tears. She then gave this fake apology to her and walked away. She never gave me an apology before, not even a fake one. She also suffered from mental illness as a teenager but she can’t relate to me and my sister at all, which I find extremely strange and upsetting. She doesn’t have much empathy and she will never admit that she is wrong. When you try to point this out to her, she shuts you down or laughs. She thinks that everything is just one big joke. When I told her in tears that I didn’t see the point in my life, she didn’t take me seriously and made me out to be weak. She always takes her anger out on me and my sister and complains about the smallest things. When she is angry, which is quite often, she calls me horrible names and makes horrible comments such as calling me a “bitch” or saying that I’m “useless”. She takes ever bit of happiness and confidence away from me and my sister and I honestly believe that she gets joy from it. It makes her feel powerful and like a stronger person, when she’s actually a coward. The biggest thing that she does and that my Father joins in on, is ganging up on me and my sister and favoring my brothers. They love my brothers and see me and my sister as burdens to the family and I’ll never understand why. Is it because of our gender or because we’re not perfect ? I’ll never know and they’ll never say, which eats me up inside. I just want to know, what is it that is so wrong with me ? It makes me feel so worthless and small. My brothers are always misbehaving but never get punished for it but me and my sister are over punished. One day my brother disappeared for a whole day and wouldn’t answer his phone and my mother and grandmother spent the whole day looking for him. When he casually just strolled in, my mother asked where he was and handed him food, like nothing ever happened. If me or my sister did the same then there would be war. They constantly compare us to them and other cousins. They buy them things more often and spend more money on their Christmas gifts. They always have and always will pick their side over me and my sisters, no matter what. My twin brother has been bullying me for a long time. He’s ashamed of me and my how I’m not perfect and he pretends that I don’t exist in school. Whenever we argue over something petty, he calls me worthless, a loner, he says that nobody loves or cares about me, he says that I’m nothing, he makes fun of my autism and OCD and he tells me to go kill myself. I’m sick of being told to go kill myself by my own twin brother. He has anger issues and is violent. One day he pushed me onto the floor and I pushed him back, so he got me into a headlock and refused to let me go. I was gasping for air so I forced myself out and punched him in the chest, I could never bring myself to punch my own twin brother in the face. He started fighting me and my my parents came running outside screaming at me. They took his side without even seeing what happened or hearing the story. Both my siblings seen what happened and defended me but they didn’t care and let him off. I was left with a big red mark on my neck and I felt so weak and worthless. I decided to confront them about it and it wasn’t until I was in tears and unstable, that they finally listened to what I had to say. They called my brother in the room and he said to me “ I don’t care, one day I’m going to die and none of this will matter”. He just couldn’t care less about me. They barely got angry at him and I just went to my room and cried. My brother was forced to give a fake apology and I know for a fact that it was fake because not long after he apologised to me, he made fun of the pain I was in that day. Another time, my brother was saying that nobody cared about me and other hurtful things in front of my mother. She told me to stop fighting with him and acted as if he was the victim. I ran upstairs crying and she ignored me, she went on Facebook and told me to go away when I “disturbed” her. And another time, me and my siblings were going home from school and he was mocking me and how he seen me alone in school that day. My Dad just sat there and said nothing, he let him say those things. My twin brother is so unemphatic and selfish and I can’t stand him anymore. My father is just as bad as my mother. He’s nicer than my mother but he also has anger issues and he gets violent, like my brother. When I was about 5 or 6 he picked me up and slammed me into a sofa. The cushions were removed and I hurt my back. My mother got my back checked at the hospital and forced me to lie to the doctors about what happened. Another time, he pushed me into a wall and I ran to my grandmothers house crying. He hasn’t touched me since I was about 10, that’s when I started to fight back. I forgive him but it still hurts thinking about it. I find it harder to forgive my mother for what she’s done to me. She’s so fake and unlike my father, I can’t tell if she has changed. Especially since she never apologises. 

I’m f*cked. My OCD won’t get better, I don’t know if I’ll ever have any one in my life, I hate myself, I don’t want to live most days and I’m always treated like crap. If this is the rest of my life, how can I change it ?"
1292,For Help With Depression &amp; Anxiety,"I highly recommend Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique) for any and all mental and emotional health issues, including depression, anxiety, OCD, suicidal thoughts, addiction, etc. It has literally saved my life. Lots of free videos and info online![Tapping for Anxiety](https://youtu.be/4g6PqHYvy_A)"
1293,My Anxiety and Depression - COVID19,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here so bear with me please and thank you in advance for your helpful insight :)

Currently we are all facing an unprecedented pandemic event, my thoughts are out for every life loving fighter, I'm confident we will beat this sooner rather than later. 

I'm a university student living outside of my uni alone in a private room and rarely go out and about only for classes and shopping, recently they have enforced a lockdown where I live and decided to go back( 2 days before the lockdown while the number of the cases were low) to my parents place throughout this lockdown to be with them and  take care of them if they needed groceries and so on. I've booked the bus (4 hour journey) which was half empty in the morning and I arrived and kept my distance, I've been here for 4 days now practicing social distancing and cleaning my hands regularly though I'm truly getting anxious for my parents as I'm afraid that I have the virus and asymptomatic, transmitting it to them in the process, I might seem crazy but every time someone is coughing and feeling tired I instantly go blank, I start to internally freak out and assuming the worst possible. I'm really getting extremely worried and its taking a toll on me mentally and physically, I honestly can't seem to get over it, I start regretting my decision to come back and should have stayed back, but kind of thought it was okay as alot of students were leaving too, chose the time where the bus was empty and avoided any close contacts in the process.

Reading the news as well doesn't help at all. I hope someone else can help me figure out how to stop over thinking and train my mind to think positive, even if the situation turns out to be negative.

I'm truly tired, mentally and physically because of this habit of thinking."
1294,Hoping I'll finally have a chance to die,"I've been avoiding this virus bullshit for so long because I've been afraid. Afraid of dying (ironic) or spreading it onto someone.
But I realized i have nobody who will miss me. I am a toxic person, I am nasty, I cannot get along with people in any way, and I know nobody needs me in their lives and won't miss me much. I hope I do get sick now and have this damn disease do good by sparing me and others from myself."
1295,Why don't my hobbies cheer me up?,"In theory, doing things you enjoy when you're in a bad mood should make you feel better, right? Well apparently that's not the case for me, doing hobbies when I'm down makes me feel worse and have bad thoughts (e.g more likely to compare myself to other artists when drawing) and instead I'm on the computer the entire time I'm awake to kill time. 

Yet if I wake up feeling alright I can do hobbies without getting distracted by negative thoughts and lose myself in them for hours."
1296,"Self-Image Issues, help?","Hey everyone, I’m dealing with a lot of Self-Image issues usually I keep myself super busy with work and I can pretend it’s not an issue but due to being quarantined it’s making me see everything that’s wrong. I guess here’s the back story 3 weeks after my 18th birthday I started dating a man who was 25 and ex-navy. Things moved way too fast and I basically moved in with him after a month (I still had my apartment but was there everyday) mind you this was my first ever relationship. Everything was good until it wasn’t. For months I would wake up to him telling me nobody will ever love me, I’m a disgusting fat b****. Then it started getting physical I explained my rape to him in the beginning to prevent him from triggering me but then he would reenact it on me for punishment, all I would hear is you need to go to the gym you look so bad, he eventually began starving me. He didn’t work because he had his pension and I did grocery delivery. So he was with me 24/7 and I couldn’t get away. He eventually had a schizophrenic break down and tried killing me. I left him and tried to move on but I fell to pieces, I found an amazing job and friends but I started starving myself, it lead to me not eating for around 90 days and I wound up in the hospital because they thought I was having a heart attack but it was just stress triggered. I lost 80 pounds from it and resumed a regular diet and everything was normal. Then I met my next boyfriend who at the time was my roommate and in a drunken night we hooked up and started dating for around one year. The first 3 months were great yk the honeymoon phase but then he started becoming controlling, he became mentally abusive going through the garbage seeing what I would eat and yelling at me because he thought I was cheating meanwhile I was loyal. He installed security cameras so he can watch me when I got home from work and listen to my phone calls, and if he heard me complaining about him he would freak out and scare me he took control of my life and my money. Eventually after a year I left him but we still had to live together until I closed on my townhouse. Every morning if I was wearing a dress to work he would call me a fat s*ut and stuff like that. Fast forward to now I can’t look at myself and think I look good. Some days if I’m alone and not busy I just feel empty, I’m not depressed or anxious, I’m just here I’m alive but I feel nothing, I’m not scared of anything. I’ve had a coworker say when they see me cross the street it looks like I’m trying to get hit. It’s really hard trying to date, I haven’t had any guys I’ve been on a date with compliment me or anything so I’m my fucked up head it’s a reminder who I am I’m just disgusting. When I get out of the shower I can’t even look at myself without clothes because it disgusts me. I stopped doing my makeup because no matter what I do I don’t think it’ll make me look good. I can’t even go shopping for cute clothes because I just think why would I spend money on this to look good when no matter what I won’t look good. I just wanna look at myself and think I’m beautiful for once. This month I went to the doctors for the first time and told them my starving story on how I actually lost the weight and was diagnosed with a eating disorder. I’m 20 years old and have never felt so broken, I don’t know how to fix it."
1297,We think my son's gf may have harmed herself,"She made comments like ""I dont want to be here anymore"" ""it would be better if I wasn't here"" and the like. we called the police. I assume the police will go there? will an ambulance go there? where will they take her? will they let us know that she's ok? my son is so upset and I do t have clear answers for him"
1298,How to find myself again,"Had a breakdown and am currently at my parents.

Stuck in isolation also.

Trying to keep busy but it's awkward when you live with your parents.

Anyway. I feel like I've lost myself. I don't feel myself. I'm acting abit differently.

How do I find myself again?"
1299,I need to snap out if it,"I’ve been struggling these last couple of days. I’m not sure why, but I think it’s not normal for me to not want to get out of bed. I eat mindlessly even though I know it’s only hurting my health.  I need to snap out if it. I know what I need to do in order to achieve my goals, but I can’t get out of bed. I don’t feel dad or depressed. I just can’t move."
1300,I'm overly defensive and I hate it.,"Like if anyone even hints that I'm doing something wrong or I'm to blame for something, I just speak up and get really annoyed. Even if a hundred good things are told to me, if one thing slips out as a critique of my character or something I did wrong, that part sticks with me and I argue it. It feels like it just destroys my credibility and that I'm being negatively judged. Maybe it's years of negative judgment, I don't know.

Just wish I could trust."
1301,I miss therapy,"My boyfriend thinks our relationship is dying and it's almost entirely because my emotions are out of control. I'm so depressed and anxious and miserable all the time and often times I lash out at him because of it. It's been a cycle of me angry at him because of how he acts as a response to how I act as a response to how he acts. I love him so much but I have so many changes happening in my life and without therapy, it's difficult to be the person he needs. 
I'm just venting, really."
1302,No personality whatsoever.,"For the past two years now, I feel like I could be totally happy doing absolutely nothing. Staring at a wall for hours on end. I don't enjoy any of my hobbies, haven't felt a genuine smile in ages, and basically any sign of emotion is forced. 
  
I know my parents and friends can tell but Im so sick of forcing my emotions that I literally just avoid every interaction. I was walking my dog down the street earlier today, saw a totally normal person coming down the other way but I turned around so I wouldn't have to act friendly.  
  
I can just imagine what's going through other people's heads when they talk to me. ""why isn't he reacting?"" ""why doesn't he care"" etc etc etc. The truth is that I just want to get to my bed, stare at the ceiling for a while and then fall asleep.  
  
Not sure what any of you can do about it but it's really making me question what I'm going to do in the future. Im scared of going to college, living on my own, getting a job, having to take on any responsibilities... I'm supposed to graduate in a year and my life feels like a dead-end."
1303,I can’t deal with university ending early,"My university is shutting early because of coronavirus. All exams will take place later this year but it will all be online. Since this is my last year of uni, most of my friends have decided they’re probably going home within the next week and might not come back at all. 

I kinda drifted away from my friends I had in school, because I hardly saw them during uni, so now that my uni friends are leaving I feel like I’m going to have no one around me anymore. Our grad ball, summer ball and graduation have all been cancelled because of the virus so it’s not even like I’m going to get to celebrate uni ending and say goodbye to everyone either. They’re all just going to anticlimactically disappear over the next week. 

None of them even seem remotely upset about the fact that we might not see eachother for a long time, and it just makes me feel like maybe our friendships have been more one sided than I thought. The one person I would consider to be my closest friend I’ve developed over uni, and the person I care about the most, says she’s excited to leave and can’t wait to move on with her life, even though by the sounds of it I might not be a part of her life for much longer. 

I’m just incredibly anxious that very soon I’m going to find myself completely alone."
1304,Covid-19 isolation.,"""Dont leave your houses"" they say,""dont be a jerk"" they say.
It baffles me that in cases like those,we are treated like a community,but most of time,we dont.
Social isolation literally makes me grow paranoid and anxious,i dont like me home,i dont like being home,the only thing that i had was my freedom,my ""friends"" and people want to take it from me because we have to act as a community? Where was the community when i was in my darkest hour? Where was the community when good people commited suicide? After all of this is over,will people act like a community to help those that suffered in isolation? No,they wont.
I do know that covid-19 is a dangerous disease,and while it doesnt affect myself,it does affect a LOT of people.
But why should i care? No one ever cared about my BPD and Aspergers,nobody cares that social isolation is literally torture to me,so,why would i care about them?"
1305,fear of being abandoned by my SO,[removed]
1306,Vent about my very strong possessive feeling,"Today I ordered a pizza from xxx (a certain pizza shop), a room mate wanted a slice of the pizza, so I shared it with room mate, because the room mate also shared food with me before and we are friends.

I don't have issue with sharing foods, but I have this mentality that I must be the first one to eat the food if it's a ""special food"". For example, this pizza is considered ""special"" to me because it's the first time I've ordered from xxx, I usually order from other pizza places.

Unfortunately, the room mate started eating his slice before I started eating my pizza... so I feel that I lost my first bite to my special pizza, and this makes me pissed off, somewhat angry, even furious, though I know it's not the room mate's fault, so I am just angry with myself now.

I feel why I didn't just eat a slice first before I gave a slice to room mate. Now I feel both pissed off and depressed.

So why didn't I just eat it first then? Because I am kind of in a conflict. From one side, I feel this isn't a big deal, room mate is good friend, so I can share food. On the other side, I feel regret and angry about my previous decision.

The same also applies to electronics and stuff, sometimes to the extent that I get pissed off if other people touch my laptop, for example.

I feel generally, people all have some certain degree of possessive feeling over their stuff, but I feel I have a ridiculous level of possessive feelings...

I feel venting makes me feel better and also I seek advice."
1307,Taking pills for no reason,"I used to be addicted to anxiety medication 6 months ago. I would take 4 or up to 6 pills a day. don’t even remember what it felt like to be completely honest because it really messed up my memory. 

Anyway I landed in the ER because I eventually took one too many (not a suicide attempt) and my liver was a mess. So I’m not on any medication anymore. Recently I’ve been craving them again but without a prescription I can’t get any. Instead I substitute my “craving” by taking random over the counter pills. Tylenol, Advil, sleeping aids, etc. Whatever I can get my hands on. And I usually double or on rare occasions triple the dose. 

I don’t know why I do it as they do not give me a high feeling per say. In fact sometimes all I get is a stomachache/headache. 

Has anyone else had this issue before?"

1309,Extreme overthinking is the reason I'm suicidal,"I've never admitted to being suicidal or even having issues with mental health because some part of the mental health community deeply infuriates me. I don't know why and it's definitely misplaced anger. But here I am because I need to finally realize I have a problem.

My cycle is misplaced anger / insecurity / social media / extreme overthinking. 

I get so mad at everyone all the time. (I have reasons but that's a whole other story) I definitely struggle with anger issues and I let my temper get the best of me on most occasions. 
This mixed with insecurity often makes me say stupid shit to people and really stupid shit online. When I come out of my angry mood I re read things I've said or posted and it gives me so much anxiety. I just can't believe I allowed myself to say the things I did. I'll apologize or delete something but the thought of it never leaves me. I just over analyze and fixate on everything I've ever done and said that was embarrassing, stupid, awful etc. 

I try to do exercises of letting go, I delete social media entirely for months at a time, I try and talk to a close friend about it. Nothing really works and I never feel listened to. I always end up falling back into my cycle and the feelings of loneliness and like everyone would be better off without me in the world. 
I just can't focus on anything else but how much I hate myself and hate my personality and hate the way I act. I just don't know how to change and I know that this pushes people away.

It gets so bad that I'll lay in bed awake at night or before I get up for hours and just think about how stupid everything I've ever done was and how much I just want to end it. And every time I do something new it's just added to my mental list. I know people usually forget about the dumb shit you do bc everyone is focused on their own lives, but something about all of my mistakes and failures being archived online freaks me out and makes me spiral. Everything I've ever done is just stupid, embarrassing, and makes me a generally unpleasant person to be around. 

I also know this is an offshoot of my other issues that make me so angry and hard to open up. I just wish I could be a nice, happy, and lovable person to be around. But I'm not and at this point it I feel so lost and unliked that its too much work to want to undo"
1310,I feel like i’m a monster... Please help me *trigger warning*,"ever since I broke up with my boyfriend (that was a very jealous and controlling relationship) I feel as though I am less than human. My friends tell me he was manipulative and I shouldn’t feel the way I do. He called me a cheater when I watched porn during our relationship which is fair that’s how some people view it during a relationship. I literally loathe myself bc of this decision and I also loathe myself since during the final days of our relationship I really did not want to be with him and I would think “oh that person would treat me better” and I know if my ex knew that he’d call me an emotional cheater so I cut it off and I wasn’t happy from our relationship since we argued all the time, like at least once a week if not every day. It was absolute torture, I loved him so much so it killed me when we’d argue about things that made me happy. Like creating love stories since i always had a passion for writing, he said i shouldn’t fantasize and also when i would play “The Sims” and he thought the male sims were too attractive to play with and that i was fantasizing about them or even when i’d read web comics such as “Hooky” where he thought Dorian was too attractive and that i’d fantasize about him too. Even though i told him that i wasn’t and that what he was saying was hurting my feelings bc i’d beg him to stop but he wouldn’t ever stop even if i was scream sobbing and begging him, which i know is immature and childish as he told me i couldn’t help how awful i felt when i felt as if i did nothing wrong. Now this was my first serious relationship, and his too, and we were only 17-18 during this relationship and I am now an 18 year old girl with girl hormones especially from being on the pill, but sometimes I feel like killing myself *im seeking therapy* due to what he’s told me and i feel like i’ve fucked up so so bad and he’s told me i’m abusive since i’ve grabbed things out of his hand hard during an argument said mean things while we were argument i’ve called him “immature” and “egotistical” and i feel like a fucking monster and I cannot escape how awful I feel and like I can never ever get into another relationship again since i’m so fucked up in the head and that there’s no point in living since i’m never gonna be happy permanently. It’s been about 20 days since we broke up now and every day I have something else to feel awful about, being a cheater, being abusive, never finding love again. and I can’t sleep and once i’m awake in the morning, even when i’m still tired my heart will start pounding and there is no way I can go back to sleep until nighttime, no naps and especially during this quarantine I have nothing to do to distract myself and I feel like i’m in hell and I live with so so much regret and sadness. Idk what to do every morning feels like i’m dying and slowly throughout the day I can somewhat forget it but little things will always remind me of him I can’t go a single day without thinking of him and either missing our good times (i lost my virginity to him and i regret that and now i can’t stop thinking about it) or i think about how i fucked up so bad. I don’t know if this is a result of manipulation as my friends and family have told me or if i’m really really awful. Please help me, i need help."
1311,"Post-antidepressant sexual dysfunction: ""is a medical condition that can persist after discontinuation of SSRIs"" ""Symptoms include genital numbness, decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, failure to become aroused or orgasm, pleasureless or weak orgasm, and premature ejaculation""","https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m754

&gt;An important iatrogenic condition, recognised by regulators

&gt;Sexual difficulties after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were first reported to regulators in 1991, but it was only in 2006 that these symptoms were formally characterised as a syndrome, now known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction.12

&gt;In May 2019, the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee of the European Medicines Agency concluded that post-SSRI sexual dysfunction is a medical condition that can persist after discontinuation of SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). A month later, EMA recommended that product information on all relevant antidepressants should be updated to reflect reports of long term sexual dysfunction after treatment.3

&gt;Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction is under-recognised and can be debilitating both psychologically and physically. Symptoms include genital numbness, decreased sex drive (libido), erectile dysfunction, failure to become aroused or orgasm, pleasureless or weak orgasm, and premature ejaculation."
1312,Severe chronic fatigue and fog wrecking my life,"When I was 16 (23 now), I noticed one morning I was a little tired for some reason. I have been perpetually fatigued ever since then. Not even a second of feeling well again. I've gradually gotten tireder and tireder over the course of the past 7-8 years, to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function because the exhaustion/fogginess and resulting symptoms have become so debilitating. So basically, my life revolves around me being exhausted, something that is very difficult to ignore. When I was about 13/14, I began feeling anxious/stressed out all the time for no reason. (This is prior to the fatigue). The anxiety/stressed out feeling continued well into the fatigue years as well but has gradually diminished the past 2-3 years as I’m honestly too tired and out of it to feel stressed or anxious. 

*Many of the symptoms below have been here since the fatigue/fogginess started, BUT have very gradually gotten worse and worse as time goes by.

SYMPTOMS:

· Chronic fatigue/fogginess 24/7. Used to be more of a mental fatigue/burned out feeling rather than a sleepy feeling, but has gradually escalated to both.

· Non-restorative sleep. I'll wake up to pee in the middle of the night and don't even feel like I'm in real life I'm so out of it. Can barely walk straight correctly to the bathroom. I tend to feel a teeny bit better if I can get 9+ hours of sleep though. Less than 6 or 7, the derealization the next day is awful.

· Energy bursts are now non-existent.

· Disassociation feeling that has gradually emerged over the past 2 years. Has worsened over this time span. 

· Drugged/drunk-like type feeling 24/7, especially as day progresses. Like I'm not quite in real life. Never fully feel ""there""

· Cognitive decline/impairment (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.)

· Motor skills/coordination decline

· Lightheaded upon standing often. Very disoriented and dizzy when doing certain physical things that move my head/body a lot. 

· Low arousal (jump scares, loud noises, etc have gradually affected me less and less as time has gone by).

· Feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Not nearly as bad as it used to be though.

· Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things.

· Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia)

· Eye floaters + Light sensitivity (seem more sensitive to bright light/sunlight)

· Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch.

· SENSES feel dulled. Hearing, taste, smell, touch, all feel weakened and suppressed. Especially as the day goes on and/or the less sleep I got. I literally feel like I have cotton in my head/ears, my hearing quality has decreased. 

· Libido low. Orgasm feels much less intense.

· Alcohol usually hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling drunk.

· Slow now both mentally and physically.

· Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often.

· Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across as an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I am emotionally flat lined.

· All of these symptoms seem to flare up more when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

· Never really have had any hobbies or passions as a result of losing interest quickly and being too tired/unable to focus.

· Feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”.

ADDITIONAL INFO:

I've had virtually any and all medical tests done I believe. Near everything comes back perfect. Tried so so many different types of medications, supplements, nootropics, lifestyle changes, diet changes, exercise changes, sleep changes, etc. 7 or 8 different antidepressants, Adderall, Vyvanse, Kratom, etc. Nothing phases the chronic fog/fatigue.

The only thing I’ve been diagnosed with is mild sleep apnea, and a slight intolerance to kidney beans. Avoided kidney beans for a while, didn’t help. Used CPAP for a few months last year, didn’t help. Gave up. Last month, I started recording myself sleeping without CPAP and I wake up throughout the night and sit-up and look around with my eyes open every 30 minutes unaware that I’m doing it and massage myself. Started using CPAP again, and with CPAP, I only do that about 1/4 of the time, but still don’t feel better. AHI is consistently &amp;amp;lt;2, but still feel bad. Modafinil doesn’t help AT ALL. 

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse and worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly. And the thing that sucks is that I want to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like an intoxicated zombie, especially at night.
Relationships fading cause I can’t function. Hobbies/interests lacking due to fatigue as well as having to spend all day having to use coping mechanisms to make up for my symptoms, etc.

I know this is a mental health page so people are going to come at it from that angle but any
thoughts? Advice?"
1313,I always feel frustrated and irritable,"As the title says, I feel a near constant frustration and irritability with pretty much everything. If I have to wait in line at a store, if I get stuck behind a slow driver, if my computer is a bit slow, if someone asks me a question or if I throw something in the garbage can and miss, everything makes me feel like I want to scream. I hide it well and I'm not violent and I don't really snap at people. But I always feel like I want to. I always feel like there is a ton of pressure on me, even when there isn't. 

I assumed it was from drinking too much so I quit about 4 months ago but that has made things worse not better(not that I plan on going back to it). Any thoughts on what is wrong with me and why I always feel like I'm about to snap?"
1314,Painless ways to commit suicide?,"Hey people of reddit,I’m one of those meaningless teenage girls who cares about what everyone thinks about them.
I’ll give you my reasoning for killing myself first, all my life I’ve dealt with bullying because well,in a non “give me attention way” I’m really fucking ugly and I’m overweight.
Overall,I’ve felt like a waste of space my whole life.
Im in a couple of group chats cause I have no friends left and I had hope of gaining new ones and I became a target for their laughter,saying me not wanting to show my face is because I’m fat and treating me like meaningless garbage...which I am.
Im tired,I’m lonely and I’m no one,I’m just another number on the suicide counter soon.
So do me a favor,tell me painless ways to do it...please.
Also,sorry to ask but one more thing,any ideas on how to say goodbye without making anyone think I will do it? They’ll be happier if I’m gone anyway."
1315,Just lost my best friend,Any body else with bipolar depression that ruins all you’re relationships? I just want a friend before I end it all.
1316,Do you ever feel like you're faking it?,"I sometimes feel like I fake everything that's wrong with me, but if I was faking it, it wouldn't eat at my soul and spirit. I constantly feel alone and like I have nobody. But is it because I don't want to talk to people or because I'm too scared to talk to them. I feel so scared amd confused all the time. I feel bad doing everything, and the things I feel good about, I can end up feeling bad about it. I want to feel better, and be happy, but that sounds so scary. It sounds dumb, but it scares me. I'm so used to my mental illnesses that not having them sounds terrifying. I'm scared of changes. Right now I'm a caterpillar who's afraid of being a butterfly."
1317,Rollercoaster,"I had a good day yesterday. Like, there was nothing particularly special about it - I just played boardgames with my little sister for the most part - but I felt happy. I was laughing a lot and genuinely felt really good for the first time in a long time. 

But I got up today feeling despondent, and as the day's progressed it's gotten much worse. I feel like crying. I can't eat. I want to go back to bed and stay there. I'm having suicidal thoughts again (I'm not going to do anything, but the thoughts keep popping into my head).

My mood flipped a complete 180 and I don't know why. There's nothing wrong right now. I just don't want to be here anymore."
1318,Should I see a professional or can I blame it on adolescence hormones?,"I'm 18F and have been struggling with negative thoughts, sometimes suicidal for a while now, but in the recent couple of years, things have gotten a lot worse.

I was in therapy for a bit at the age of 13 for having awful mood swings that brought suicidal thoughts with them, but I was too young to get diagnosed with anything, so my therapist at the time wrote it off as just ""teenage hormones doing their thing.""  
My mood swings have gotten a lot worse and the thoughts of wanting to die depend on the month.  

I'm worried that I have over-dramatized this all in my head. I recently found out what borderline personality is and I checked all of the symptoms. From fear of abandonment, shifting self image, feeling either empty or feeling extreme emotion, etc etc.  
But... don't we all?

I guess I'm somewhat hoping for someone here to confirm my doubts for me and that this will all go away as I grow older."
1319,When should you see a therapist?,"Hello everybody. I just want to hear some opinions about when you should go see therapy. I've been considering it for a bit now, but I'm not sure if this is just temporary and a ""I'm having a bit of a rough time atm"" thing, or actually something serious. Basically, I'm not sure if I should go if it's just something minor in the end. So what so you think? When is therapy appropriate?"
1320,Is there a big difference between a trigger and a cause for a mental illness?,"There have been evidence that certain things tend to ‘cause’ bipolar manic episodes and depressive episodes to develop, like stress, loss or even change in sleep patterns. However, most people who get stressed and other things don’t get bipolar episodes. So is it wrong to say that these things caused it? Should the word ‘trigger’ be used instead? Why do people use these terms synonymously?"
1321,i feel like i’m not even a real person,i know my illnesses “shouldn’t define me” but i have no sense of self so i can only identify with what’s happened to me and the choices i’ve made to cope with it. i am nothing but my trauma and substance abuse. i don’t think about much else. i’m not ok unless i’m high. i’m really really really tired and that’s the best way i can describe how i feel about my existence rn. i’m not going to kill myself atm but i’m really fucking tired of being alive. also i’m 105-110lbs at 20 years old and i feel so much fucking fatter than i was at 120-125lbs at 16 years old. i feel disgusting. i hate being in this body. i hate they way it looks and i hate what’s happened to it and i hate the way i treat it and the substances i put in it.
1322,I come from a country where therapy isn't really a thing,"I'm 18(M) and I'm glad I've found this subreddit. Starting from last summer I finished high school and i've been having some really bad days, it's like one moment I'm in a good mood, the next moment I'm feeling down and extremely hopeless.
Here are some weird things I've noticed about myself recently:
- I obsess over something for like 3 days and then completely forget about it.
- Short memory loss (I don't think this is the right word for it though)
Example: If I want to do something I have to do it immediately or I'll forget to do it in seconds.
- I don't eat so much
- I used to draw everyday but I can't do it anymore
- I have no energy but sometimes I feel like I have so energetic.
- I live with my family but sometimes I feel like I want to run away and live alone.
- Showering feels so tiring and difficult lately
- I feel like my family hates me
- I don't have any life goals whatsoever because I don't really know what I want in life.
Also, I had some really bad things happening in my life while growing up.
P.S: Sorry for my English, as you may have noticed i'm not a native speaker I wanted to share this here because I can't really share it with anybody else."
1323,I think I may have some early symptoms of Schizophrenia. I'm scared and lost.,"So to start out with I have an extreme phobia of Schizophrenia that started last May (I am a 19 year old trans woman if that helps with any of this). I was on the couch, and I hallucinated an extremely sweet smell. I freaked out, because there wasn't anything that could have caused it (I've occasionally hallucinated this since). Immediately afterwords I started falling down a hole where I started over-analyzing my behavior. If something seemed weird (such as people outside of my apartment talking) I would record it to make sure it wasn't a hallucination. I would analyze every thought that went through my head to make sure it didn't sound delusional.

I've had memory issues for a few years now, but I feel like something has changed. In June I was in the car with my mother. A thought went through my head of me lifting my head and manically laughing. I couldn't figure out if it had just happened or not. It took me ten seconds to realize that it couldn't have happened, because my mother would have commented on it if it did. I freaked out after this, because I realized that wasn't normal. I've had similar incidents to that a few times since. I've also had issues with my memory in other ways. I quickly forget things, and recently it took me 15 seconds to remember my mother's name. Sometimes it is difficult to remember if something actually happened or if it was from a dream (this is worse within the few hours after I wake up).

I've also had strange thoughts (I should also mention that I've always had intrusive thoughts). I have a lump on my neck that appeared in July. A few months ago a thought popped into my head, ""This is a chip the government put into my neck."" I realized right after the thought appeared that it was delusional, and I had a panic attack because a delusional thought appeared (I know the lump isn't a chip). I've also noticed coincidences in my reality that give my panic attacks since I notice them (Why would I notice coincidences like this?). For example, I was watching a TV show where a professor got murdered. Later I turned on the news to see that a professor near me had been murdered.

I've started having mood swings as well (or I've at least noticed them. They may have been there longer than I thought). My mood can fluctuate from super happy to sad in hours (minutes sometimes). I can sometimes go into moods where nothing feels real or where I feel apathetic and have to emulate emotions from memory of situations where I used that emotion rather than feeling the emotion at that time.

I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist about this. I got tested, and was told that my reality testing was great and that I just had major depression and generalized anxiety. I want to see my therapist again, but my deductible reset in January so I can't afford to go.

I go through periods where I am ""convinced"" that I am developing schizophrenia and other phases where I am just anxious about the idea of developing it. Psychosis has become my worst fear. I am terrified about at idea of developing it. As for what's going on with me, I am scared. I've looked up early symptoms of psychosis and I see a lot of these on there. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this is a fear or if my worst fear is coming true. It's tearing my life apart."

i feel angry, upset and very conflicted with myself. I feel compelled to make art, but then i get extremely angry at myself, calling myself stupid and childish and my inner voice tells me that art is stupid and that i must hate art."
1325,Am I okay?,"Without going into too much detail, I often have short depressive episodes, and recently I've found myself doing the one thing that helps while I can't visit my loving girlfriend due to coronavirus (she's immunocompromised so she can't go out and I can't go in). This is essentially submerging my face in the sink and holding my breath, so I can experience the feeling of asphyxiating and dancing on death's door, and I'm getting closer and closer to blacking out each time but I can't seem to stop myself. 

Is this behaviour considered suicidal or otherwise dangerous or stupid, and what else can I do to try and feel better in those periods?"
1326,Could we have some professionals over on the anxiety sub-reddit?,"I've noticed quite a few people ask stuff there, and I have too several times, but nobody there really seems to be able to offer much help to each other. Even I can't. Everyone there would probably appreciate an expert's opinion on their problems.

1327,How can technology help make therapy more accessible?,"Hi 👋

I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months and it has been a really positive experience. While I didn’t find it too difficult to find a therapist, I have a number of friends who have really struggled. It made me think about how difficult it can be for people to start therapy and find a therapist. When I looked for a therapist I found the tools I used were super outdated and didn't give me the information I wanted easily. For example, I really cared about the physical environment that I would be in, and most of the time this wasn't discussed or shown.

Because I work for a technology company it got me thinking about how little technology seems to be being used to support people to find and access therapy, and what cool opportunities might exist for it to be used to better support people. I'm thinking about creating a platform that uses technology to solve problems around making therapy sessions happen for both therapists and clients.

I thought it would be great to get some more opinions: 🧠

* If you managed to find a therapist, what was your experience like? Was there anything difficult or confusing about it? What bits of the experience did you like?
* If you tried and gave up on finding a therapist, why? What would have made you feel better about going through with it?
* If you were to look for another therapist, what would be most important for you to know? Would you consider seeing a therapist over a video call rather than in-person?

Thank you! 🧡"
1328,Need help on what kind of help to get,"My girlfriend sometimes imagines fully fledged conversations, but what I see is a nod and a grunt.

The issue is that she recalls fully fledged conversations, that usually include a greeting, a query, and a reply to the query. Based on double checking with the other parties, I don't think I'm the one imagining things. She currently acknowledges this could be problem but is pretty hostile and upset when this is brought up in the wrong setting. Not sure is this related but she talks to herself aloud in the bathroom sometimes.

We are wondering what kind of doctor should we visit about this issue. A psychiatrist, a psychologist, a family doctor, or the University clinic.

I'm in Canada."
1329,What are the signs of psychosis episode?,Just was informed I had a psychosis episode while I thought it was just stress and sleep deprivation so what are the symptoms of a psychosis episode
1330,I think I'm losing myself completely,"Over these last 3 years, I life has been completely miserable. Things changed for the worst in June 2017. I just don't know what to do anymore. I honestly feel like I don't want to exist. Everything is a mess.

Basically I have OCD, depression (quite bad depression because of my weight), Asperger's, anxiety issues and probably a binge eating disorder. I'm really overweight and am absolutely depressed about everything. I don't think my life has meaning anymore.

My OCD makes me think things that aren't true (at least I think it's my OCD). I can't help but think and believe a particular ethnicity of people are completely superior to every other ethnicity in this world. I feel like only this particular ethnicities lives are worth living. I can also sometimes hear, smell and taste things that aren't there. I told someone about this (a mental health professional) and they said it's stress. Basically I thought I has psychosis. It's like I want psychosis to feel special. I know I probably don't have it, but I can't help but think that believing things that others don't believe isn't considered to be OCD?

Also there's one minute I feel so high and great and like that I can achieve absolutely anything in the world. Like, ""yes! I'm going to become an animator and make my own cartoon!"" Then the next minute I feel like shit and listen to sad songs and cry about everything and all the bad in the world. This happens daily.

And there's the other thing, I'm morbidly obese an fucking hate it but I can't seem to stop myself from eating. It's fucking horrible; it's one endless cycle. I was assessed for an eating disorder, but just got told to get motivated and see a dietitian.

I saw a psychiatrist about a month ago, she thought I should see the eating disorder team, but then my care coordinator told her I've already been seen by them and then the psychiatrist said the same thing ""get motivated."" 

I'm meant to be going to an obesity clinic, but I don't think that will solve my problems."
1331,Why is nonsuicidal self injury bad?,"Leaving out infection, unintentional suicide and other obvious risk factors, why are people... not allowed to injure themselves? If I were to get a tattoo to symbolize my trauma, no one would care. If I was going through it and waxed my entire body as part of a self care routine, everyone would say, “good for you.” So why is self harm any different? Because they’re scars? Because they’re not pretty to look at or a positive experience? Why is it that I can tattoo and pierce my entire body head-to-toe if I wanted to, even at home with no kind of experience or training, but if I self injured, I can be locked up against my will?

I’m not saying that I think self injury should be okay; I just don’t understand why it’s so wrong. I swear, people react more towards my self injury than they do when I’m actually suicidal."
1332,How to stop constantly googling whats wrong with me?,"Its become a habit of doing it daily, especially at night when my anxiety is keeping me up. Ive been doing it for over two years now, and I thought it was a good thing but im just now trying to get myself to stop because it really isnt a good thing to do. It started when I made the bold promise to myself to try and fix myself and dive deep into my head and solve all my problems and become a better person etc. but all I do is google whats wrong with my brain and try to find answers. 

Sometimes I find something that resonates with me and I read about how to get better, and feel motivated but the next day I already feel hopeless again and find other shit that I think is wrong with me and the solution to why im depressed and the path to get better. So does anybody else do this? Any advice on getting over this. It really makes me absent minded about everything going on in the present, and makes me only focus on getting better so completing my tasks can be easier."

1334,Help maybe?,"Dear redditors,
Can anyone recommend a free therapy/mental health service?"
1335,Seeking Help for a Friend,"Hi!   
I'm looking for help in getting online resources and potential coping mechanisms for my friend. He's in high school, and he's just turned 18. We have a venting channel in our discord and he posts almost every day about wanting to die, he's having panic attacks, public outbursts, crippling anxiety, terrible self worth... the poor kid is just falling apart. I've been pushing him for months to get professional help, and he finally sought out a therapist in his area but things didn't go well, he sort of gave up before he walked in. He's from a conservative Vietnamese Catholic family but is closeted bisexual, so struggling with his sexuality as well, believing that he's going to hell. He's self isolated long before the outbreak and now any efforts he was hopefully going to make to make irl friends are quashed, I'm really concerned.   


I've been trying to offer him coping mechanisms and hobbies, things for him to put his energy into besides self hatred, but he shoots down every suggestion, usually with ""That's too much effort "" or "" I'll just mess that up too ,"" and I could really use some help getting him the help he needs. Community, hobbies, professional consultation, anything so that I don't lose my friend. I see a lot of myself in high school in him and I keep thinking back to when I tried to kill myself. I'm terrified to see him in that same position, I just wanna take all the pain away from him. If anyone has any advice or resources, it'd be incredibly helpful. I want to do something for him."
1336,I think im bipolar,So I was watching a video about it and I relieved I have some of the symptoms. I get depressed for months then out of know where I'm happy and full of energy I don't sleep for days I'm running around then I randomly get depressed I sleep all day cry all night I get sucidal thoughts. I don't want to tell anybody because I don't want to look dumb so can somebody tell me if I should tell somebody.
1337,BPD help,Anyone with borderline personality disorder please explain your mood switches i feel as if i might have it but to scared of judgement from family and friends to go to a doctor my mood switches maybe a good 50 to 60 times a day for no reason and i get very bad thoughts like harming myself when those switches happen i need help but i am so scared
1338,Why do I feel this way?,"I feel dead inside, I don’t exactly care what happens to me. It’s like I’m just living my life on auto pilot an just observing what happens and what does happen all I can think is oh this is what we’re doing now. I’m surrounded by people but feel lonely if that makes sense. Like I’m not really connecting with anyone. I put up a facade when I’m around people so that everything seems like it’s okay because when I think about trying to explain myself and how I feel I can’t so I gave up on things like therapy and trying to talk to someone I’m comfortable with which is no one. Once I realized that I tried my best to become apathetic(Figured if you don’t have any emotions you cant feel the way you feel) and find hobbies that can take my mind away from it so I began reading a lot and trying thrill seeking activities like Muay Thai, going to the gym even as far as to join the military but I’m getting bored. Truthfully I joined the military in hopes that it’ll kill me if I get deployed. (I chose the front lines) because I refuse to kill myself. I realized theirs a bunch of people out there who want to live but unfortunately have their lives taken from them if I could change places with them I would without hesitation. But I do all of this to keep me busy so I won’t have to think about it, but when I’m not doing something the thoughts just keep reappearing. But the thoughts only just started to resurface In February this year and I’ve been dealing with this since 15, but everything has it’s breaking point an I’m finally reaching mine I guess. Everything that happened in my past is just water under the bridge to me or at least I made myself think so or feel that way(That’s way to much to explain). But is there any advice that can be given to me on how I feel if this group does that here."
1339,someone please talk to me,I just don’t want to be here anymore
1340,My parents aren't supportive of my mental health.,"I went to doctors a few weeks ago, was pointless imo but she told me I seem to have a mix of anxiety and depression. 

I let my support teacher know, as she encouraged me to the doctors as she knew I wasn't coping. She emailed my parents and the next day I got screamed at by my dad and told to ""get out"". I went to school and cried for the whole morning. Was fine at home luckily and didn't get talked to about it. 

With this quarantine I don't know what to do. Sure I feel okay because Animal Crossing is out. But I'm sort of  not as I haven't talked to anyone in a few weeks about my emotions. I feel numb. I feel so lucky to have my friend who is messaging me every single day and  making  me feel happy. 

I hate the feeling of having to stay quiet or hide things. It's frustrating. I know I am not talking to my parents again about my mental health."
1341,A real crazy mental problem.,"I have something very specific and weird that I can’t find any other cases of or any information on it. Basically positive emotions I feel become neutralized when I become aware of them to the point where I don’t feel them anymore. It happens at a much faster rate than could be seen as natural mood changing or burnout from something. For example if I build up an emotional image or good feeling while listening to music it gets drained away and I’m just left feeling depressed and empty and getting nothing out of continuing listening.

Another thing this happens with which is actually terrifying is sleep. When I build up sleepy feelings that are supposed to help me lull myself into unconsciousness, they just go away, and sometimes it physically hurts my brain. Ever since this started happening I have been unable to go to sleep without the help of medication. It’s terrifying and the though that medication could eventually lose its potency and effect and I’ll be forced to stay awake by my own horrendously dysfunctional brain for who knows how long actually makes me want to kill myself.

I honestly don’t know what to do or what treatment to undergo. I’ve told my doctor and she’s given me antipsychotic medication but it hasn’t made my emotions stable or anything really other than allow me to go to sleep. I just want to know that someone else has gone through what I’m going through and has found a way past it. Please if you can help me identify this or know how to get into contact with someone who might know about it that would mean the world to me. Or any other advice you might have would be appreciated as well."
1342,"Help, please","Hey, there is a confesion/question
I do not fucking know what to do. My GF and i am meeting for more that 4 months. She has a lot of mental health problems and cut herself in the past.

 Lately she was kicked form university and after that she started having simmilar suicidal thoughts. Although she knows that i f-ing love her, she still denies this. Since after she was kicked out of uni we havent met due to coronavirus (big distance and no possibility of comming to her without public transport).

What to do anons, i started to panic that if i do anything, she'll do sth to herself. I have tried talking bout it, telling to go to psychologist or even talking to her family( not that supportive btw).

Im thorn between letting go and not to be sucked by that, or saying psychologist or i leave.

Help.

Ps: i need to go to sleep, sleep this through and talk to GF"
1343,"If I just end it, will the pain stop","I haven’t thought about it for over two years but it’s getting to that point where I think about it everyday. If I end my life, will it all stop. I don’t want to cause pain to those I love but I can’t deal with it anymore, it’s all too much"
1344,I can’t help it,"I want to cut soo bad, I am craving it. It started about 3 days ago and it’s just getting worse. Every time I am alone be it for a minute or hours my anger and feelings get so intense I can’t think straight. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t have anyone to talk to. If you’ve been there and have advice let me know"
1345,I don't feel in control of myself,"Lately I've lost control over my actions, all I do is lay in my bed watching YouTube or scrolling through Instagram, sometimes I feel motivated to get up and do something but when I try to it's almost like my body doesn't let me. It's like I'm only in control of the thing I want to do is comfortable, if it's something like studying I just can't make myself do it. I don't know what to do."
1346,I force myself to read the same sentences over and over again....,"In addition to other mental health problems, I feel like my mental illness is taking away one of my favourite hobbys: reading. Whenever I read a book I like, I often force myself to read the same sentences over and over again. Strangely this doesnt happen when I have to read books or texts for my university lessons, and it feels like the more I care and want to fully understand what I am reading, the more this problem occurs. Is there anything I can do about this?"
1347,One session made me feel validated.,"The other day I had an over the phone appointment with a physiatrist after having it recommended by my family doctor. It was disappointing not having it in person but I'm glad I went through with it. The purpose was for her to make recommendations to my counsellor and family doctor.

  


After the session she said it was clear I dealt with chronic depression, social anxiety with some generalized, with an insecure attachment disorder and signs of borderline personality disorder. Its weird and validating how in one hour she could see many things in me that some I didn't want to believe. It was a shock aswell when she casually said ""So you felt rejected by your father."" I had never thought of it in such plain terms. Sorry for the ramble, thank you if you read this."
1348,"For those that lost your jobs due to the Coronavirus outbreak, how are you coping.",I am willing to send prayers..
