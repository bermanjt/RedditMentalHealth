0,I seriously hate myself,"I was diagnosed today. With bipolar disorder, and PTSD
I always knew something was wrong with me. I was too emotional, too from 0-100 too..crazy. 
I ruined my mom's life with how awful I was as a kid,
 i ruined relationships.
 I have no clue why my husband stays with me. 

My parents saying I never had a thick skin, I don't take criticism well, I'm too emotional, I'm whiny just like my dad, I'm so annoying just like my dad ect.
It basically affected my childhood.

 Started cutting at 12, self destruction behavior at 8. I haven't stopped cutting. My cutting hurt my mom so much
When she found out I did it, she kept saying how I could so that to her. I hurt her so fucking much. 
Now I do it to punish myself for everything I ever did to her.
My family doesn't talk to me either. I don't want to be around me either, but I don't have a choice. 

I also found out, that it's a lifetime deal. I will be stuck with this my entire life.

I don't deserve my kids or my husband. I will just ruin their life too."
1,i hate the life we have to suffer 3 weeks to have a godd week my mental health always sucks i have a depression because my anxiety i cant ask for help and if im in new place i feel like im in prison i sleep 4 hours cause im afraid from tomorrow my relationships suck and yes im the clone of theclass,help
2,"If You See Something, Do NOTHING?","I'm still waiting for that phone call: ""This is the Chief of Psychiatry calling from ""XYZ"" Hospital, with regard to M.A.S. I would like to speak to you to learn more about her mental health history. Please call me at......""  


Initials don't violate HIPPA, and Ms. S. should have been admitted to a Psychiatric hospital years ago! There are at least a half dozen people who know just how mentally ill this woman is, who have known her for forty years or more. I have the hardest time understanding why just ONE of them hasn't taken steps to have her committed.  


One visit by the Police to her home, would be all it would take for transport to a local Psychiatric Hospital. Once a team of Psychiatrists evaluated her, a determination for long-term admission would be made. If it took 40 years for her to get as bad as she is, it will take at least two years in a Psychiatric Hospital, to try to undo the damage to her brain.  


People are told that if they ""see something,"" they should ""say something."" Her Landlords see plenty, and say nothing. So do close friends from childhood, and co-workers she's had for a dozen years or more, and her cousins. People who see what the inside of her home and car look like, people who know about her reputation as being ""crazy."" SO many people know how much this woman needs extensive Psychiatric help, yet not ONE is willing to help.  


I'd like to think that she was scooped up months ago and shuttled over to a Mental Hospital, or by some miracle, she ducked in quietly during the COVID lockdown. Maybe the same people who keep in contact with me since I've left the area, were told not to tell me, because she doesn't want me to know that she's in a mental hospital. Even though nobody knows more about her than I do, I'd much rather it be like that, than have another month go by with nothing done. This woman is getting worse and worse, heading towards a very tragic end, if no one intervenes.  


I've seen a lot of comments in this sub, about how people around them know they are struggling with mental illness, yet they don't seem to care and obviously, don't do anything to help. In my opinion, there should be a law against that. Failing to act should be criminalized, because leaving people to languish on their own with a mental illness, now that's criminal!"
3,I feel like i’m going insane,"So sometimes I get to the point where I feel the need to push everyone away, which i’m doing that right now, and i made dinner but i’m not eating it and i made brownies and i’m not eating that either, and i feel like i’m going to slip down a bad rabbit hole again and go do something stupid and i’m so embarrassed and angry and it feels like my head is fuzzing and throbbing. My dad doesn’t believe in mental illnesses and he believes this is a part of growing up but idk man i feel like everything in my brain is going 1,000 miles per hour and i’m doing 100 things but nothing is satisfying me and i pushed everyone away so i don’t talk to anyone about this because i don’t want people to see me like this and idk what to do if anyone does anything to silence the shit going on in my head that works on them and could give me tips i’d appreciate it but right now i’m so tired of being “AAAAAAAAA” you feel????? Like holy fucking shit man i’m so tired of it all."
4,Don't know how to get my motivation back on track,"Hey guys, I've noticed throughout quarantine, and now that I find it nearly impossible to get any work done for school. Taking today as an example, I had my first exam and I couldn't get myself into the right mindset to prepare for it. I often find myself struggling to find anything fun to do. I had video games in the first few weeks of Covid-19, but now those are unappealing. If anybody has any process/steps they took to shake this feeling, please help a brother out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated  


Thank You"
5,having short temper - help,"It seems, i have short temper, coz I easily gets irritated until I can't control my emotion or worst collapse (mostly of the time I collapse without any reason). What should I do to lessen it? Thank you"
6,"If any teenagers are going through anything mentally, and you need someone similar in age to talk to, dm me.","I only put teenagers because I can relate to them, I'm 16 as well."
7,hospital stay questions,hey im a college student with thoughts of harming myself and i think i need to go to the hospital. i dont want to stay for more than 24 hours and i dont want to be put in treatment what should i do? i am at the university of kansas in lawrence. how long is a visit and how much does it cost? what happens there?
8,Why do I feel this way?,"For most of my life I've always had a problem with overthinking things but for the past year or so it's gotten very bad. I hang out with my friends pretty regularly but for the past year or so every time I go out with them or we do anything at all, the next day I am filled with overwhelming anxiety. Most nights I go out and I feel no stress of any kind when I'm with people, I actually usually have a great time and love every second of it. But every morning after I can stop thinking about how I shouldn't have done certain things or how my friends probably hate me. Then I spend the whole day feeling like shit and hating myself. This has gotten so bad to the point where I just get so angry with myself and I don't want to hang out with people every again. But once I do eventually hang out with them again I feel completely fine. What can I do to stop feeling this way, I hate it because I can't even cherish all the fun I had on these nights out because I can't stop thinking about what I did even tho I didn't even do anything wrong."
9,"my desperation and suffering with contempt as a 17 year old with asperger's syndrome. I don't know how to describe my emotions and I seriously doubt I'm the first person to feel this way; so in a way I guess I'm not really that special, which contributes to my sadness if I'm going to be honest.","I had my feelings summarized perfectly then accidentally deleted the paragraph, so I'm going to be spitballing I guess.

I feel depressed and I don't know why. I was a toddler when I first noticed it was a struggle keeping my emotions in check. whenever I was angry I'd slam my head against walls, whenever I was sad I'd tear at my skin with my nails, and while that's generally gotten better over the years I still do these things impulsively. my mood shifts frequently without reason.

 I'll be having a good day time when all of the sudden my vision dampers and fades, leaving the empty sensation of a void in my chest area. my thoughts are then clouded with, what feels like in the moment, the most horrid existential dread I'd ever come across. I don't fear death much. I suffer from occasional bouts of suicidal thoughts, and in those moments I am afraid, and sometimes I find myself wishing I was blissfully religious so that maybe I wouldn't dread existence as much.

I love being alive; I love the people, I love the interactions that come with the people, and I love just the sheer feeling of existing, but at the same time I have a deep sadness that really never goes away. I don't understand why I'm depressed and why I feel so empty every second of my life. the weird part is that, even when I'm morbidly depressed, I can smile and be genuinely happy at the same time. It's extremely hard to explain. sometimes when I think about killing myself I can't help but crack a smile, and it feels... edgy as hell.

 the internet makes me feel insignificant. on every social media site I go to there are people joking about wanting to kill themselves, wanting to die, being depressed, cutting themselves, and to be honest it makes me want to bottle up all my emotions just to keep from acting like one of those tweens that uses depression as a way to garner popularity online. I'm 17 y/o and all of my friends are suicidal apparently. I don't really have any way to vent outside of reddit. bothering people that have suicidal tendencies with your own suicidal tendencies doesn't seem like a good thing to do, I guess, so I've been putting on a fake smile.

don't get me wrong, my friends make me \*\*genuinely happy\*\*, but again even while I'm feeling enjoyment/happiness/pleasure, there's that constant contempt in the back of my head that keeps me from 100% enjoying anything, and as soon as a pleasant conversation with friends stops, or as soon as I stop occupying my mind, I feel fucking unbearable sadness/grief in which I've only really been able to numb with vodka, cutting myself and sleeping. I am 17 y/o and I've never been genuinely happy in my life. I feel like I'm being controlled by my conditions/mental health.

there was a time when I was vulnerable to my mom for the first time in years, and I ended up venting to her about these problems. she made it worse. she took it as a way to project her religion onto me, albeit I guess she didn't know I stopped believing in a god a few years prior. ""Do you want to go see my therapist? She's great, I think she'll really help you out."" she said to me, in which I agreed; I thought it would help.

I went to this therapist. it turns out she was heavily religious, wasn't a professional, was heavily biased, heavily emotional, and all the things that I least expected out of a therapist. she lived on a farm and brought me out to see her horses, and then told me a story about how they had been abused and rescued, and how talking to the horses helped calm them down. this therapist thought I had anxiety, and I don't. I wanted a safe space to talk about my issues with a professional that wasn't obligated to talk to anyone about my personal shit, and instead I was sent to a god-fearing 60 y/o farmer that made me do all of her chores while preaching to me about god.

I have no issues with religion, none at all, but this seriously made me feel worse, so I bailed after a few sessions. my mom called and said she was picking me up to go to therapy, so I said I didn't want to go. ""You have to go, you've only been for a few sessions of course it hasn't worked yet, honey..."", ""I think she'll really help you, she's helped me a lot."" are some of the things she kept telling me over the phone, basically begging me to go. I said no and held my ground because she'd already guilt tripped me into 2 sessions previously... and then she starts crying, says ""Fine!"", and hangs up.

she wanted me to apologize to the therapist and gave me the woman's number, and I never did it. I don't enjoy when people say they care about me and then force me into things that make me feel worse about myself, especially the guilt tripping. overall I don't have many people to go to, I basically sit in my room most of the day now and cut myself. nobody on reddit is my friend, nobody online can be a genuine person through anonymity, and the internet is always going to be a toxic cesspool, so I don't really have many options when it comes to self-help. I guess It's hard to give a shit about people when you can't see their face and don't even live in their state.

TL;DR:      I am a 17 y/o with asperger's. no car, no license, all my friends feel like shallow imitations of people, my family doesn't understand my condition or what I need to get better, and neither do I. I'm posting on reddit to try and feel at least a bit better, but I know nobody I care about and nobody that cares about me will see this, so what's the point. I'm getting closer and closer to killing myself, and for once I think that might be alright because I've tried all I can at this point and I don't see myself getting any better; if there's a hell I hope I go there. I deserve it for wasting my life."
10,It’s just getting to be too much,"I have severe hadephobia, like diagnosable severe. I literally think every day about how scary he’ll is, and I see my dead mother burning in agony. It’s literally preventing me from doing certain tasks. I occasionally have hallucinations of screaming, and demons touching me. I need help on actually living normally. Any resources or tips?"
11,Not eating when anxious,"So recently I’ve started not eating lunch at work because I get so anxious when I’m there that I don’t have much of an appetite. I still bring food because I don’t want my parents knowing I’m not eating, but I just don’t eat it when I’m there. Which leads to me feeling guilty and more anxious since I’m wasting food, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Besides, just eating in front of anyone outside family makes me nervous in general anyway. Anywho, after not eating, I then stress more about the fact that my breath might stink because of the lack of food since I don’t eat breakfast either. I tend to drink more water because of that, and because it feels like I have a dry mouth a lot. 

Luckily I’ve made a friend there. If I didn’t have a friend there, I can’t imagine how much worse I’d be doing mentally, especially when I’m there."
12,A discord server dedicated towards helping and curing mentally ill teenagers,"I don't know why, but I thought that since this subreddit includes a lot of stories of kids with entitled parents that a few of you might have some sort of illness like depression, anxiety or something else, so this would be a good place to post this. I read the guidelines and it strictly mentions YouTube and nothing else about this type of thing. Anyway, the server is called the ""Kids In The Dark"" server and includes a staff full of people who want to (and are actually quite good at imo) help you get better and navigate your situation better. It is complete with a help bar, which includes an advice channel, vent channel, and suicide prevention channel. It's helped me in so many ways after 2 months and I honestly think this is a great place for you. The age limits are 13 minimum and 22 maximum, as this is a mainly teenage server. https://discord.gg/UJUQkPa"
13,I guess I belong here,"I'm another test subject with constant suicidal thoughts, alive or dead, I don't care of both if in done I'm done but I guess I'm a defect I belong here."
14,I don't know what to do,I (14F) strongly suspect I have OCD but no one knows except my best friend. And even she doesn't know how bad it's gotten. I call myself shit every time I make a typo and am in the vicious cycle of hating myself more and more. I'm against taking drugs for it and am afraid to see a therapist. Help
15,i dont know advise i guess TW just incase,"I just started highschool today[14yo demigirl?].ive been feeling like shit for awhile now but the week leading up to school had me really stressed out because i've always gotten good grades until last year and now i'm not special, i'm not good at art like my younger brother and my older brother gets better grades than me. Now I'm just average.

  	My self esteem has been slowly declining because I used to eat a lot and my brothers called me fat. Now I'm only eating 1or2 meals a day along with the fact that I think I'm a demigirl so I don't feel quite comfortable in my body.

 	I've also been having intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and others, and today I scratched my arm a lot and coloured my entire arm with a pen just because the thought would not let me sleep. I Have acted on these thoughts before, never the harmful ones though.

	I always seek validation from others i never voice my opinions because im scared other people will think its stupid and if ido imalways second gussing myself.

Now that i type this i might be doing this for attention but from what i read online that's a sign of something wrong to so if you have any advice it would be appreciated

	Also sorry about my writing all over the place i wrote this in like 10 min"
16,Ik I need help but I don’t know how to get it? Anybody have any ideas or have gone through something similiar?,"(17M) I think I might have depression, don’t 100% know tho. I have no motivation to do anything, but despite that I still help out and do what needs to be done. I always feel like shit but I’m also really good at being happy around other people if that makes any sense. I feel super numb, at this point idc if I live or die but it still takes nothing for me to feel worse then just go right to self harm. 

I forced myself into a relationship with someone that cared about me but I just couldn’t do it, couldn’t even get physical because I’d be too stressed out. Idk what the fuck is wrong with me because I’m 17 and a dude, I’m supposed to want girls but anyone at this point just makes me stressed. I’ve since stopped seeing her but fucking Christ.

The problem is that I can’t get any sorta counselling or therapy because it’s gonna change how my family sees me. Nobody knows what’s going on with me but it’s been going on for the past year or so and I just don’t know how to do it being discreet?"
17,Unsatisfaction,I’m so incredibly unsatisfied with who I am and just cannot believe I have to be this person for the rest of my life. I feel like a loser and I’m soooo sensitive and self conscious. I always wish I could just be someone else and I hate the way I look. Anytime I see someone else accomplishing something I just get emotional and start to hate myself. Idk what to do
18,I’ve decided I need to change,"Basically I came to this idea that maybe if I just try and get back into old hobbies and try to learn something new and keep a more positive outlook on life then maybe things will get better.I have to much time to overthink and need to do something else to stop overthinking.I know it sounds so incredibly simple and common sense but for me it’s not the easiest thing ever.For the last two and a half years I’ve been in a never ending cycle of having no motivation,anxious thoughts,”get through this week” and then “just get through this week” but I was repeating this every week as if something was just gonna magically change.Recently I came face to face with the idea of cutting myself with a razor(ik probably doesn’t seem like a big deal for most) but for me it was a huge deal and I never want to feel the urge so that again.As of now I have a very small support system,no prescription medication I do have some kinda anxiety med that works for the most part,and no options for therapy at the moment so I gotta make the best with what I got.Ive decided to try to learn Spanish again since after all I am Cuban and Puerto Rican.I might get back into art but as of now art doesn’t bring me the joy it use to and instead is associated with negative thoughts so I might just avoid that entirely.Im trying my best.Even if my best isn’t a lot.On the plus side I had a pretty good day today there were no breakdowns,very little negative thoughts, and no dramatic and sudden mood changes and I’m feeling pretty good today."
19,Can a new dog trigger depression?,[removed]
20,I need to vent this because this is affecting me even though it happened 3-4 hours ago tw: violence," 
This is the full what happened, not too violent except for the few hits on the head that I saw. 

Imagine a lady, probably 5’4 with a black purse. The guy was probably 6’0 and was wearing tan shorts and a heather grey shirt. He had some Grey in his beard and he is brown haired. He grabbed the purse and the lady hit him on his head a few times. The light turned to green so we left. He was twisted so he had the purse but it was still on her shoulder. He seemed homeless tho since they both were in the homeless area that the homeless people camp at (since the mayor abolished the law that in Austin the homeless could not be on the streets or something like that).



Now I keep seeing the lady who’s purse has been stolen hit the guy on the top of her head."
21,I just want to rant and get it out there. Its really okay if no one reads or replies to this.,"Prefacing this with I see a therapist twice a week and see my psychiatrist once a month. I am medicated and I am seeking help. I just need to rant anonymously. 

I'm tired of everything. I'm so all over the place all the time I don't even know what my normal is. I switch almost daily from a depressive state to Hypermania to borderline psychosis. I don't feel like i have a baseline, im just constantly going from one dramatic mind set to the next. Im exhausted, im tired of feeling like things are great for a day to hearing people talking to me thinking they're coming to get me the next. I dont fucking understand how i can jump around like this. I dont want to deal with this anymore. I dont want to deal with the daily hallucinations and the daily thoughts of dying. One day I will be terrified of dying, then believing I am already dead and in hell and then the next day ill be fantasizing about my death, wanting it to finally happen. I'm tired, i want this to fucking stop. I don't understand how it can go back a forth so often and so quickly. I dont understand why this is happening to me. I dont want to be like this anymore."
22,for more relatable content,"obviously this is the best forum to come to for advice and to easily share your thoughts or questions , however instagram has some great writers who post relatable situations and questions here’s a few new ones that are very relatable so far

23,I've been struggling about thinking about death and loved ones dying,"Now none of my loved ones have died really, but every night before I go to bed I always stress about this. It's really taking a toll on my mental health and I need some advice... Thank you"
24,fear of confrontation ?,"Whenever something gets me really annoyed and it has something to do with, say my job. I’ll have so much anger pent up and ready to speak to my boss about how unfair everything is and how shitty all the other workers are (i am an assistant manager), but then i just stick to being my sweet fun personality acting like nothings wrong... until something else annoys me and i regret not speaking up. how do i just say fuck it and say whatever i want like anyone else hahaha"
25,"Talking faster than normal and having a mind with new and different thought strands going off at tangents so that you have the effect of ""overwhelming"" the person you're communication with?","I've got OCD and OCPD and I have a racing mind that goes off on different tangents often and combined with talking fast and thinking fast I overwhelm people as they loose the their train of thought because I'm talking about so many different things

I want to know if anybody has suffered with these symptoms and does anybody know if these are related to either OCD or OCPD?

Are there any other conditions that have these thought and behaviour patterns"
26,Are my feelings justified?,"Hello, I am at a point in my life where I feel as if I’m a failure and am destined to stay as one.  As some background, I had a very rough and troubling childhood and adolescence.  When I was around 9 or 10 my mother became very ill suddenly.  We later found out it was a rare form of Lyme disease with not much in the way of treatments or a cure.  As time went by it got to the point where she couldn’t walk, eat, or do most things by herself.  Because of this, my mother went off to live with her sister and my father took care of me and my brother.  When I was 12 my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and I was his main caretaker for the months from his diagnosis to his death.  For the next few years my mother lived with me and my brother with my aunt coming daily to help her while we were at school until my mother died last July.  So now I’m 19, failing miserably at college, and I don’t know what to do.  I’ve always had bad anxiety problems starting with a long traumatic episode when I was around 7.  And every day the anxiety gets so bad that even the thought of some minor bad thing happening is enough to make my mind race and leaves me forcing myself to hold back vomit.  I also have pretty bad OCD that’s gradually been getting worse since I was diagnosed a few years ago.  At its worst it might take me a half hour before I’m comfortable going through a door way, or hours and hours of repeating a task before I can finally fall asleep at 10am.  And compounding all of this is the feeling of enormous guilt I have for failing my family.  I’ve always been told how much they expect of me academically and career wise and I’ve been a complete let down in that regard.  I went of to university right after high school and ended up dropping out half way through the semester.  I’m currently taking online classes at my community college but I’m still failing.  I just don’t think I’m ready for it yet.  But my family always reminds me how disappointed they will be if I don’t succeed in college and they tell me how disappointed my parents would be if they were still alive, and that really really hurts.  So now I just don’t know what to think.  Is it fair to say that because of my mental state I’m not ready for college right now?  Or am I just being a selfish brat."
27,"Even though I've worked hard to get to a good, stable home, I'm still not fulfilled","I know that doing the things I meant to do won't cure me of my mental illness. My depression won't go away even if my bank account is semi where I want it to be. Even if I'm living with my two best friends and some great cats. Even if I have a stable job, home life, and friends who love me.... I still will feel like shit. I'll still hate myself. I'll still have intrusive thoughts about how I don't matter and I wouldn't be missed if I was gone. I hate that. I hate that I can do everything right and still have this inky, slippery, infectious worm in my brain telling me that I'm wrong. I hate that I have depression. I hate this."
28,How to deal with my moms lack of... empathy?,"I wasn't sure where else to put this so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to put this.

My mom is a sweet lady and I know she really tries to be a good person, but the way she was brought up doesn't always allow for that. As an adult (twenties), I'v realized that she has a difficult time seeing other people's perspectives? I don't really know how to phrase it but she can be a bit narcissistic I guess. I don't know.

For example, I just had an occasion that made me really irritated at her and I feel guilty about what I said and how I acted. Her friend's kid, Liam, is having his 13th birthday. My mom loves books and she got him a book about whales for his last birthday. She never heard if he read it or not but she got him another book for this upcoming birthday. She showed me the book and told me about how her friend said he isn't a big reader, so she got a book that has graphic novel and reading parts. This kind of annoyed me because I don't understand why she's trying to get this kid books if they aren't one of his favorite things. The friend said he likes Pokemon cards so my mom also said she's going to get him pokemon cards. 

This is where I feel like I messed up. I said she shouldn't get him more books in the future if he doesn't read this one. Then she sorta got offended and I just said if he isn't a big reader don't get him books. And then she asked if I still had my Pokemon cards (I used to have 800) and I looked for them and I don't because she threw them away. Then I mentioned how I asked her not to throw them away and she did and she pretty much just left to go run errands then.

I feel like I didn't need to judge her about her gift for her friend's kid and I did anyway and I feel guilty about it. I know she just loves books and that's how she relates to people and connects with them and she tried to get something the kid would like and I made her feel poorly for it. I just felt triggered about my Pokemon cards and the fact I don't like that she's getting him something she likes rather than she likes (or at least that's how I perceived it). 

I know my mom isn't good at seeing other people's perspectives and talking about that kind of thing with her is difficult. I know I should just hold my tongue but it's hard. I don't want to create tension between us like this for no reason, it sucks and I hate it but I always end up doing it over the stupidest little things. How do I stop? It's hard for me to regulate being triggered and I really want to. I feel so bad about possibly making her feel bad about her gift when it has absolutely nothing to do with me."
29,Should I tell?,"I'm a teen and I'm hearing voices that tell me to hurt others, but mainly mock me and laugh at me. I'm very scared to tell, because last time I told I went to to a hospital and pretended to get better to get out and still am(not for voices) I just dont want to go back I just want help, but I'm to scared to. Also I dont think my meds are helping.

Does anyone have any ideas I really want help with this."
30,Feeling numb for the first time,[removed]
31,Has anyone done MST- magnetic seizure therapy? What was your experience?,"Hello reddit. 
I'm at the end of my road for treatments for my MDD with psychotic features, I've tried just about everything but my psychiatrist recently suggested MST magnetic seizure therapy. 

 In my opinion it sounds quite scary and I don't know whether or not to pursue it I was hoping someone here had experience with it and could let me know how their experience went and if they would suggest it. Thank you"
32,i think im a pedophile,"i think im a pedophile, while kids are not my prefrence but i guess i have some sexual attraction towards them. idk anymore i want to kill myself  
is anyone here, at least capable of helping me dive down and see if it is pocd or pedophilia?"
33,I’m gonna kill myself,"I turned 23 recently and tried to do better at attending work and not calling in sick so much but ended up calling in sick this morning. Binge eating. Thinking about what a loser I am. I’ve been craving alcohol for 2 days and can’t quit drinking.

I didn’t kill myself at any point during my childhood/teen years just to have this shit life and I don’t want it.

I wanted to do better and work harder but I’m just worthless. I can’t sleep and I want to die.
I want to clean up and throw away everything that isn’t my clothes and furniture, starve myself, and then when I’ve gotten rid of all of anything anyone could go through or judge me for, then going to erase my laptop and phone and hang or drown myself.

It might take weeks, the only reason I don’t go through with it is because I need to do all this stuff first and people I know will blame themselves.
I had kind of a bad childhood by no fault of my mother and all I wanted was to make music or art for a living.
I only really have one friend kinda and their dad died a few weeks ago and I feel like I can’t do this to them and just add to it.

I have no talent with music and art and absolutely no skills outside of this.
Even my influences say it’s best not to think you’ll make money doing that anyways.
I have no chance. I’ll be a nearly disabled cashier for life.
I have a drinking problem and body dysmorphia, I might have ptsd and I’m either ADD or bipolar.
I can’t take the meds, I gained so much weight from that and drinking.
I’m such a fucking loser, I hate everything about my body, I think I need plastic surgery to look presentable. I’m mentally fucked. I’m a musician idolizing loser. I’m ugly, don’t know how to do make up and I’m too short. I don’t have a license and live in a horribly maintained apartment building.
Someone gave me a cat and I love her, but it wasn’t my choice to take her so now I kind of own a cat I really don’t want to get rid of but I hate cat hair on everything and maybe it will put off a lot of people that I own a pet and it’s not like my appearance or personality or anything really does me any favours.
I’m going to die alone.

I never want to have children, I know I couldn’t handle it and even being in a relationship in the first place sounds pretty out of reach. I know I’m going to eventually just go through with killing myself and nothing in my life will ever change.
Everything is horrible.

I wanted to kill myself when I was 12 and nothing I stayed alive since then for has ever happened to me and never will so what is even the point.
I will never enjoy life, and it’s September, my birthday halloween snow and Christmas all trigger me in different ways and I end up really suicidal at that point so I don’t understand the point in waiting anymore.
I’m a worthless piece of shit."
34,i wish i had the guts to kill myself,"that’s all 
im just tired of being alive"
35,Developed discomfort with sex,"I’m a little lost on what to think about this. I’m not sure I need advice, but maybe someone to relate to. I used to be a pretty sexual person. I craved it and honestly made careless decisions (for my physical and emotional well being) for the sake of attention and validation. I can admit I didn’t know how else to connect with someone or show/seek love. 

Now, I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 3 years and I’ve never been more comfortable with someone. I don’t get insecure about the relationship, or worry about body image like I have with every one before him. However, I become more and more uninterested in sex to the point that I’m practically averse to it now. Sometimes he’ll start to touch me and I feel like I’m being accosted and my body just won’t give in to it. I have to actively tell myself that it’s okay and that helps me to relax and be more in the moment. I very rarely climax, but I don’t think I ever did with another human before I met him. Even on my own, it’s difficult. 

I truly don’t think the relationship is the issue, but it’s causing a lot of disconnection on my end. It feels like this is what it’s like to relive old trauma, but I honestly don’t have a past traumatic “event” I can connect this to. It just breaks my heart that this seems to only get worse."
36,Help with overwhelming feelings,"I have a lot of distractions that usually help me cope with the overwhelming feelings of anger, anxiety, frustration and just sadness; however, i just found out our wifi and cable are going to be out for a few days and i’m afraid that without the distraction i’m going to resort to self harm. i’m already  overwhelmed with a lot of emotion and it’s making me want to lash out. 

So i feel like i’m either going to end up lashing out and taking it out on the people around me or myself. Which i’m already having urges of doing

im confined to my home due to my anxiety about and around covid and most of my hobbies are completely non existent due to just all around fatigue. so my only distractions recently is basically tv and online stuff so i’m at a loss for what to do. 

i’m sorry for the formatting, i’m on mobile and not really fully here at the moment. i just need help."
37,What are the chances of being given the wrong diagnosis?,Was diagnosed as bipolar years ago while hospitalized
38,Can't stop thinking about my backup plan to drown myself cause this is the only option I have left. I can't do this a single more day. Why should I?,"In a lot of emotional pain and it hurts more than ever that it's my birthday. I feel more alone than ever and I still wish I wasn't born.

I don't trust anyone. I wish I could honestly talk to someone and I can't. I have had to always been by myself. My parents attack me, and since I was a little child I would go to my room, lock my door, and cry. I would have to stay strong and never give up hope. But that child in me has really died. I don't know how that little girl had so much hope even when she was suicidal all her life. Never was I able to talk to anyone about anything, my brothers and sisters all left me at a young age (they know visit but didn't when I was younger), and I feel like people on reddit people don't have good intentions and are using people for porn or something worse. To manipulate them or do something else. I don't know but I just don't trust anyone in this world. I don't even trust a therapist I'd be paying for and no way in hell would I pay for a therapist. Point is that I was born into the family I'm in and it hurts so much to see other people my age who celebrate their birthday with friends and family. It just hurts. My family doesn't care to celebrate birthdays and nothing is ever happy because my entire family is depressed. It's so hard to see other people and compare myself to their life. Why couldn't I have gotten that life? Life has been so painful and my birthday is not something I can celebrate. I wish I wasn't alive. 

So here I am just venting again while I just needed another good cry. For the first time in my life just talking to any stranger. 

I guess I'm just venting. I don't trust anyone and I don't listen. Just venting. Trying to figure out decisions again. It's really hard to not have had guidance or help all my life. I guess I raised myself wrong."
39,I'm all over the place. .,"28/F and recently got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. I've been getting chest pains but they've been getting worse ever since last year. My dad passed last year. Since my dad passed, I've been trying to be proactive about my grieving and mental health. I've seen my therapist 1/week for a couple months, and now I see her 2/month. Last week, is when I got diagnosed and got on medication to start. Anyway, these chest pains..have been panic attacks. I'm surprised that's the feeling because I never thought that's what panic attacks were. I would be lying down and relaxing and this pain happened. I'm Asian, and we've never talked about mental health. Heck, my mom gave me a hard time about seeing a therapist. However, I'm trying to be better--mentally, confident, happier, and grieve. I'm told journalling can help with anxiety, and just noting down all your thoughts out.. I have so much to say sometimes, sometimes nothing at all. But my question is -- is there a journal you'd recommend to use? I've tried writing on a regular journal but I get tired. I want to fill something in. Not sure if I make any sense. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance if you recommend any journal options."
40,I Can’t Live Like This Anymore.,"It’s been over a month since I’ve separated with my girlfriend of five years. I still love her lots and miss her badly. I’ve been having trouble sleeping and eating properly, always feeling nauseous too. Everything reminds me of her and the same scenes of the last time we talked keep replaying in my head. I could be fine for a good half hour but the urge to burst into tears always creeps up on me. I tried to keep myself busy by doing my passions like playing guitar and getting new hobbies such as working out but I just have no motivation. It’s evident that I’m up against depression. I considered telling my parents but they are very religious and they’ll probably make me join them at church which is something I don’t want part of. Going to friends isn’t much of an option either due to the fact that I recently moved to another state and know absolutely no one. Work and school is just adding more weight on my already weak shoulders. How do I go about this? I’ve tried everything for the past month and it seems to not be working, I only feel  like I’m getting worse by the day. A part of me is still waiting for this girl to come back even though it’s highly unlikely. How do I get rid of this emptiness? I’m so tired of being a zombie."
41,My mind wont stop,"Doing mindless tasks (shower, driving, trying to sleep) are so hard. I am constantly thinking of the past. Something dumb i said, or did, something someone did to me. It can be as tiny as me forget to say something to a dumb embarrassing comment i made 10 years  ago.

How can i stop these thoughts"
42,Getting the most out of therapy,"Hi guys! 

Im starting with a new psychologist, we've probably had 5 session and things are going well but I am wondering how to get the most out of the session? I used to work with a family and marriage counselor who I spoke with about the surface level ""how was your week"" thing, so I struggle to know what to say to my psychologist who is working on a deeper level for me. Any advice would be helpful!"
43,Faces of depression,"This article is excellent. I just wish more people would see it. I’m always told well you don’t look sad or you have no reason to be sad. 

[faces of depression](https://www.boredpanda.com/face-of-depression/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;fbclid=IwAR2WwfqUQZKBYhrgDnsjRMh3JgXvNcqjab5XfZGCPMEtn9xswUvGNvtvb6s)"
44,I have nothing to say but I feel the need to talk for the people I'm with to connect to me,I hate talking and I don't really like the things I say. I'm not smart so I usually just say what I've heard and talk about things I don't even really know about to seem knowledgeable. It makes me want to just duct tape my mouth shut. I always regret ever speaking even though the things I say are received well by others. I have nothing to say but I feel the need to talk for the people I'm with to connect to me. I also have a hard time remember exactly what I said afterwards once my anxiety's calmed down and my social interaction just becomes a feeling like I was annoying and I hear my annoying voice ringing in my ears. How do I just stop? How do I participate in a conversation without saying things that I don't actually want to say?
45,Separated from my wife because she wasn’t attracted to me anymore.,"My wife left me when she was away from home working. I have moved to a new city to be with my family and so many things have been going good for me since I moved. But I am still sad, angry, and depressed. I put on a face that I am happy but I am still sad all day. She’s moved on and I have no friends here and no woman to move on with. My confidence was destroyed by my ex and I don’t know how to gain it back. Guess it just takes time."
46,Confused,"About 5-6 years ago a relationship I thought I was going to be in forever abruptly ended when they left me out of the blue one day. Someone close to me is convinced that it is still affecting me in present day and that I have convinced myself that I am okay when I am still not over it . To me personally I think I’m fine because I don’t get sad about it or anything,but i was just wanting some opinions on this."
47,"The girl I stopped seeing because I thought I’d burden her, sorta confirmed I burdened her","I was seeing a girl for a few months and I felt like I was faking the whole thing, I don’t have any motivation in general so talking to people takes a lot of effort that I just don’t have. Earlier today she asked if I was doing alright out of the blue, I said I’m fine and asked how she was because she wasn’t doing great when I was seeing her, and she talked about how much better she was doing. So, that’s helpful that now I have the confirmation that I just drain people. I don’t even have any emotions about it, just find the information fascinating."
48,is it possible for me to get a diagnosis as a teen without my parents knowing?,"Hi. I’m 16 years old, and I live in the US in Georgia. Is it possible to get a formal diagnosis and/or treatment for depression without money or a permit/driver’s license? My family is strict as well, and leaving the house is not an option... Are there any online resources that are meant for situations like mine? I can’t find anything but self help “quizzes” and I don’t need those."
49,This is the longest I've ever gone without trying to kill myself,"Before it was like every 4 to 6 months with a lot of ideation in between. It's been like a year and half now. I still think about suicide, but my meds and healthy living help a lot."
50,How do I get spouse to seek help? Possible paranoid delusions?,"I’ve always suspected my wife may have some type of mental illness—bipolar disorder, depression, or something. She’s always displayed a handful of telltale signs; bouts of depression, wanting to be alone, unexplained crying or feelings of sadness, irritability, mood swings, paranoid delusions, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, etc. She always chalks it up to her period coming soon, which seems to be 3 weeks out of the month at this point. I’ve always just figured it’s who she is, her personality, etc. 

In the past several weeks, she’s had increasing paranoid delusions about her work place spying on her. She’s adamant that her personal cell phone, personal laptop, and work laptop are all hacked—and her boss, other employees at work, even third party vendors she works with have access to her personal and work electronic devices and can hack into her cameras or even listen in on conversation that we have within our own household. 

When I’ve asked why anyone would do this, she says it’s because they’re using this as a way of controlling the workplace, instilling fear in the workers, and cyber bullying. When I ask her for proof she gives me very generalized examples of people at work bringing out generic talking points and somehow ties it into something we had talked about at home previously. But they’ve all been really broad or generic. The biggest kicker, she also thought her phone was hacked at her LAST job and even went as far as buying a new phone. 

It’s come to a point that I refuse to play along and I’ve tried telling her that these things are not happening and that she needs to seek professional help. She’ll cry and tell me I’m not supportive and naive. I have no idea what to do anymore and how to help. I don’t want to encourage this behavior, but she refuses to see this as anything other than truth. A part of me is almost starting to even doubt myself—is something like this even possible? And how likely is it that it’s happened at back to back jobs? 

How do I get my wife the help she needs without her feeling like I don’t support her? How do I help her see that the paranoia may be coming from her?"
51,Online college is stressing me out immensely,I’m only 4 weeks into my junior year of college and I feel like I’ve been close to breaking down every week. The online classes just don’t have the interactions with the professors that I desperately need to succeed academically. My grades are really the only thing I have going for me right now and I’m terrified that I’m going to drop from my usual A’s and B’s to C’s this semester and I’m already feeling like a failure.
52,I dont think I have the full capacity to care,"I've went through some pretty tough shit growing up and I now have PTSD and an array of other issues because of it. But one thing that's always frightened me is how much I genuinely don't care. I've always been weirded out by it. Even when I was a young child, I never had a problem cutting people out of my life, friends or family. Just today I had a pretty good friend of 2 years decide to block me and stop talking to me because I wouldn't answer to a long ass paragraph accusing me of not caring for them and still holding resentment towards me because I was forced to drop out of the college we both went to because of financial issues, and that meant that they would no longer have a roommate. In my mind, I'm a busy woman and I don't have time to answer silly things like that, especially since I work long hours and have to come home to deal with my mental health now. I found out that she blocked me today through a mutual who was also having issues with her and called me about it just to tell me and I felt nothing. The first thought that came to my mind was how I should change plans then, and that was it. No sadness, no memories of better times, nothing. Even as I type this I feel nothing, and this was someone people considered my best friend.  It made me think back to when my childhood friend had a similar situation with her best friend who blocked her and told her she was a bad person. She called me in a fit of tears and had to come over to my house so I could console her. I've had people tell me it's a good thing that I can do this, but I feel like there might be something wrong with that. I've cut many people out of my life, including even both of my grandmothers. It shouldnt be this easy, I should feel something, shouldn't I?"
53,How often do you track your mood using Mood Tracker?,"So I've been using Daylio to track my mood during these quarantine times to ground up myself on evaluating my days and also to track my mental conditions.

My intention is to help me to discern which activities are fruitful and not fruitful, while also to look back my stats as a retrospect my life condition in general.

Thus, I want to re-evaluate my methods on mood input with you guys. How often do you input the mood? I usually put the input every 3 hours starting 06:00, so my input probably goes around 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00 and 21:00.

I strive for accuracy and efficiency of time input, is there any way to improve it? Or maybe any suggestions?

Thank you in advance!"
54,My brain keeps imagining things that I don't want to imagine or don't condone with,So to start it off I'm from a poor country where people have different views on mental health so getting a therapy is like out of the question. I said to my friends and family members that I have depression and they were like nah you're just lazy do your work everybody gets sad. So I'm asking this on reddit. I keep imagining things that I don't actually wanna imagine. For example a few days ago my friend sent me this f\*cked up vocaloid song called im sorry im sorry and it had some pretty messed up lyrics which I don't actually condone however when I think stuff like man this is messed up I won't imagine something like this my brain always goes like nah f u I'm gonna imagine it anyways . This is just an example of the many times this kind of stuff happens and I have so much messed up stuff that I've imagined even though I don't like them . Sometimes it feels like I may have multiple personality disorder or something but I don't think it's something like that. Is this normal I don't have many friends I can ask this about
55,I’m 90% sure I’ve had ocd all my life.,"Little backstory I’ve had big problems since I was 7 it started with physical ticks habits that my parents noticed but would just tell me off (roll my eyes or twitch my neck etc) but I couldn’t stop doing it, then came the germs on top of that and I’m a hypochondriac, then the thoughts to top it off, constantly worrying about things I might do or things that could happen to me, always worrying about my behaviour around people and over analysing things afterwards I could go on and on! All my family think I’m nuts, I’m very different to everyone I know and come off as weird. I get called lazy and mad by my family and loved ones, I’m extremely anxious constantly and I can’t sleep because of the intrusive thoughts I have, depression is crippling and I get overwhelmed with shame and guilt because of my behaviour and mistakes. I wish they could understand why I’m like this and that I’m trapped inside my own mind constantly which is basically torture, I’m not lazy my brain burns so much energy that I’m exhausted even thinking about doing something productive, and to top it all off I’m afraid To go to the doctors and explain my situation in case they don’t believe me or worst think I’m insane!"
56,I still want to DIE AND DROWN my F**** SELF. It's the best option I have to get untrapped.,"I can't do this a single more day. In a lot of emotional pain and it hurts more than ever that it's my birthday. I feel more alone than ever and I still wish I wasn't born.

Never was I able to talk to anyone about anything, my brothers and sisters all left me at a young age (they know visit but didn't when I was younger), and I feel like people on reddit people don't have good intentions and are using people for porn or something else that's evil. 

I don't know but I just don't trust anyone in this world. I don't even trust a therapist I'd be paying for and no way in hell would I pay for a therapist.

57,"I know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t know how to fix it.","I’ve known I’ve had a problem with masculine figures in my life since I was little because of the abuse I suffered from my father. It’s the common case of “daddy issues” for me. But I realized that the hyper sexualization isn’t really as simple as people think it is. At least for me, it’s because I’ve never had a stable male figure in my life, and now when I do have any kind of male figure in my life, I feel like the only way I can feel loved, or wanted by them is when I give sexual favors.  This isn’t the best mindset to have, and I want to know how to get rid of it, but it’s just so much easier to have that kind of relationship than to actually deal with my feelings. 

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve talked with multiple guys at once, none of them with the intentions of forming an actual relationship, and maintain a form of “friends with benefits” in a way. I’m not comfortable being in an actual relationship because it’s easier to deal with a friend with benefits leaving than someone with a deeper connection. 

Either way, I know what the problem is, why I have the problem, and how the problem is effecting me right now, but I don’t know how to fix it, and I worry that it will just get worse if I don’t."
58,Newly diagnosed,"Halp lol I’m actually really ok-ish but like what? Mental health is such a dense multi faceted world to dive into. I was diagnosed with three things at once and I’m trying not to re-evaluate the diagnosis’ and just accept them. Currently taking medication and it’s going well just taking a while to work. I know it’s no
Fun that I don’t listen them but I have privacy concerns for my future. I’ll give some hints I have experienced rape and was highly sexualized as a child by friends and just by being a teen model in NYC from 15-19.  Lol there goes the privacy but whatever (still learning to hop off the soap box). I’m looking for advice on how to cope and self soothe. Any tips?"
59,Is it ok to feel this way?,"Idk if I should put this as vent or question but whatever. So for about 10 year I have had minor depression and my main why of enjoying myself and coping for the past three almost four years has been to watch vtubers. Recently pokimane has revealed that she will be becoming a vtuber and I don’t know why but I just feel an emotional explosion of anger and sadness. I don’t know why, it’s not like I hate her I’m more just neutral to her. It’s not like anyone’s forcing me to watch her but yet I feel like I’m gonna have a breakdown just thinking about. Is it normal to feel this way? And why am I feeling this way? I’m just so confused."
60,i'm addicted to being sad and i want to die,"i had a fucked up childhood my parents drank all the time they were never around. my brother basically raised me and he died suddenly from a heart attack a few years ago and at age 9 i had to raise myself and be home alone every single day. i don't talk to my parents for months at a time and it's been like that for my entire life. i've been diagnosed with ptsd, deppresion, severe anxiety, bipolar, and a shit ton of other things. in 7th grade i was so depressed i didn't get out of bed for days at a time and i didn't have a single positive thought for 3 months and i completely isolated myself. 

i keep going through phases where i feel like i'm the happiest person alive for months and then a day later i'm so sad i attempt suicide. i can't deal with it anymore. everyday feels the same and i can't find anything to live for anymore. 

i have no family or anyone to watch over me. i have a lot of friends who love me and hang out with me constantly but i need more then that. 

i just turned 14 and i smoke weed 5 times and i do acid, coke, xans, snort anti depressants, drink an entire bottle of cheap vodka alone at night, etc. Ive been doing therapy for about a year now and i'm on a high dose of zoloft and a few other meds i don't remember the names of but nothings helping. i'm still just a kid and i'm already doing drugs that not even older people should be doing and i hate it i fucking hate drugs so much but when i'm high off something it's the only time i feel happy or feel like i don't want to die. 

when i try to get better i can't because i need to feel sad it's a craving and it almost feels like i go through withdrawls when i get happy. i'm so tired and there's nothing left for me to do. i've done therapy meds and there's no one there for me except myself and i can't take care of myself. i tried to move in with my cousin and cps has been called multiple times but they never end up doing anything. i don't want to kill myself but i just want to melt away and i wish i just never existed. i know i'm not going to live past 20 from either suicide or overdose and i don't care. i need advice or something i can't do this anymore i feel so lost and lonely."
61,How a normal person thinks?,"Since i am schizophrenic,  i want to know how a normal person thinks, how the thoughts came into a normal person's mind. I know it's a weird question but i was just wondering."
62,I'm attending college in-person and meeting people is so hard. I'm so miserable and every day it feels like I'm in a dystopian hellhole.,"**Background:** I earned my AS in business administration in June from my local community college in downstate NY. I transferred to UCF, expecting trips to Orlando theme parks with new people, tons of parties, and in-person club meetings where I'd meet people with common interests nearly every day. 

**The Problem:** None of this has happened, because UCF is taking COVID very seriously, even though cases in FL have been declining for months. Campus is a ghost town, there were few in-person rush events until this week, most events are over Zoom, and the ones that aren't have absolutely nothing to do with my interests or have an RSVP list that is full in like five minutes. 

**Roommates:** My roommates work a lot and don't leave their rooms that much when at the apartment. One of my roommates is in his 30s, the other one delivers pizza much of the day, and the other one sits in his room a lot, and they're not interested in partying or going out. 

**Silver Linings:** I have managed to meet several people by driving on campus almost every day and hanging out on the large lawn called ""Memory Mall"" and eating there. I even went to New Smyrna Beach and met up with the people I see at Memory Mall on Fridays. I've also registered for in-person events including a fair at Rosen College, a fraternity rush, a gardening activity, and Friday night dinner at Chabad, a Jewish organization. 

Despite this, I usually don't have that much going on, and I get sad many nights. I hope someone here has managed to develop relationships despite the challenges we face."
63,I need help,"Okay, this is going to be a lot of information but I’ll try to condense it into as small of a passage as possible. When I was a child, 12 or so, I got diagnosed with OCD, Depression, and anxiety. Over the years my anxiety and depression faded, but my OCD continued to get worse. I figured I could deal with that and stopped seeing my therapist. He agreed it wasn’t a bad choice. 

Now, 6-7 years later I’m sitting here going through another spell of interesting events. I feel like I did back then, but this time a little different. I’m constantly angry, I want to argue, and my emotions are everywhere. I consistently think of horrible things, and I’m not sure what I’m capable of. I know in reality the things I think will never happen, but it’s still scary my mind can even come up with them. Just super deep and dark though. 

My OCD is worsening, my habits now turned into routine. My simple little tics I had worsened into terrible things. I can’t stop them. 

I backlash and argue, i fight and complain. How do I stop this? After a moment of coming to realization of what’s happening I realize I’m in the wrong. I don’t think I’m right. I’m worried for myself. I’m scared of what can happen if I don’t put a stop to what I have now."
64,Became a nihilist after losing faith,"I used to have Christian beliefs, but after really trying to explore I just find nothing. I don't understand science and because I don't understand science I don't know what to believe. After listening to so many of atheists arguments I just tried submitting to atheism. Now I find no meaning in life, love, happiness, or existence. I feel like killing myself now and the only thing keeping me from that is that I don't want to hurt my family, especially my mom. I don't know what to do except just sit and hate myself because everything I hoped for in life is gone from me. Everyone I love and everything just seems so meaningless. Just wanted to throw this out there."
65,"Somehow, life finds a way.","I've been closer now than in my whole life to ending it all.

I have the method, tools, and the location set in mind. Somehow I just cant find the time.

It seems that every time I want to eat a bullet so bad I either have to take care of something before my exit or I have something great to look forward to.

The day before yesterday, I woke up early in the morning. I decided, today is the day. I got my clothes on, and drove up to the mountains to my chosen location.

There is a massive drain pipe running under a road, the end of it pokes out from a cliff and overlooks a gorgeous valley full of trees. The end of the pipe is my chosen spot.

I have magic mushrooms that I planned to take to enjoy myself one last time before ending my life.

My plans fell through when the way up the mountain was blocked off by police; the fires are devastating the forest.

I decided to stop and figure out if there is a plan b location for doing it. To lubricate my gears I stopped at a friends house for a beer. One beer became 2, became 4, became 8, became more. Next morning we receive the news.

Two of my friends lost their homes to the fire. The fighters had to let it go because it was out of control, they were willing to let the whole forest go.

My heart broke when I heard this.

My friend has always been there for me, and the forests have always been my second home. The fact we are losing most of our Woodlands makes me want to remove myself even more because I cant stand to live in a shithole like this and not even have a forest to camp in for respite.

But I had a mission to accomplish. I was in the Foothills, right at the base of where the forest fires are raging. We have to secure this home against possible spotfires. Rage and sorrow burned through me as I cut down trees, mowed the grass, pulled weeds, and watered down the house and yard. My heart aches for the dying forest and my now homeless friends.

Today, I feel some relief. I almost want to pursue firefighting to be honest.

Even still, I am being internally devoured by this festering wound in my soul. I cannot help but contemplate, when and where, now that my woodland refuge is gone?

My father called, he wants me to come visit him to help him work on his yard and his boat this weekend.
Somehow, life finds another day.

Maybe I will just make it to new years, when the life of my love will join my family and I for our annual celebration. It will be the first time my father, mother, and my grandparents meet her. I hope they love her.

I hope you enjoyed my story, maybe you will relate this to your own experiences."

70,Idk how to cope.,Everything has been piling up on me as of late. My bf dumped me and my friends don't bother with me now that they no longer have any issues in their personal lives. I'm trying to make new friends and it's difficult when I'm so sad most the time. I just feel so lost and hopeless which scares me bc the last time I was like this I was absolutely destroyed. I find it hard to get out of bed and I just don't want to be here. I'm sorry for this rant but idk what to do anymore.
71,September feels a little triggering.,"I used to be really suicidal two years ago but I’ve managed to build myself back up to be a functional nihilist who lives life just to exist. I’m a teenager and other teenagers are often involved in activism or performative activism. I know Suicide Prevention Month is important and I don’t think it’s a bad thing for it to exist but hearing about it everyday and seeing posts about it everyday is just making me feel less stable in a sense. 

It feels like an old enemy is just poking me with a needle in one hand while concealing a knife behind himself using the other hand."
72,I subconsciously feel like a piece of shit all the time.. PLS READ,"I am someone who others always perceived as outgoing and funny despite my anxiety and awkwardness which i’ve just recently reached a breaking point and healed from, around this time last year I had friends I would hang out with just about everyday one day we were smoking weed &amp; I felt a moment of anxiety and my friend noticed he quickly insisted that I looked suspicious in a joking manner I chuckled and looked away but I guess this arose suspicion of me because the rest of that night my friend was probing me even though we had known each other for so many years all it took was one anxious look to rise his suspicions after this I hadn’t seen my friend for about a week and I finally decided I would clear the air he asked me to meet with him so I did but in our encounter I could tell his demeanor was different than usual after all i’ve known him for over 6+ years his hostile intent was very clear so I decided I would tackle the issue head on and tell him how that was just an anxious look and nothing more, but when I attempted to explain myself it didnt come out like that instead in an act of desperation I completely spilled my guts and told him basically all my issues at this point he was a bit thrown off since that day we went from talking daily to not speaking very much at this point it was clear to me I needed to deal with my issues I stayed home and meditated on it but of course Im the type of person that doesn’t correctly handle his issues and it bleeds to other areas of my life, this instance im speaking about comes next when I decided to talk to my older sibling about it he is a bit older than me and has more wisdom I was certain if I had no one in life I had him. So I explain the issue to him hysterically because honestly at that point in life I was nervous I was being portrayed as an untrustworthy liar even though i’ve told nothing but the truth. He insisted I was overthinking the situation and being paranoid but I was so sure. For those who don’t understand the situation I was in people who are  in such a position of question where im from is punishable by death. This was the first time my word had ever been in question so I didn’t know what to expect exactly even though I was being honest. Fast forward two days later at first glace I could tell my older sibling had grown extremely tired and irritable of my theories and wondered why I was so concerned and insisted that if I truly had nothing to hide then why was I so worried ultimately it made him skeptical of me and has since put a seemingly permanent dent in our relationship. Time went by and my “friend” and I still dont speak but I believe that he realizes now that it was really all a misunderstanding but my family life has truly taken a toll from this and it seems im constantly under close watch as if I cannot be trusted and has truly effected how I look at myself no matter how much self reflection I do I cannot seem to get past this, i’ve also tried speaking to my sibling but its as if our mutual point of understanding has hit bedrock honestly I’ve accepted the fact our relationship may never be the same I would like to just get my life back on track."
73,"Reoccurring nightmare that I haven’t had in almost three years resurfaced recently, and it’s really been bugging me.","This is kinda depressing, but I’ve only ever had one reoccurring dream. It was years ago, but still haunts me. Recently however, it’s resurfaced. This is kinda long, so bare with me! 

I’m standing in my room in the middle of the night. My room is small and rectangular with the exit on the left wall in front of where I’m standing. It’s empty except a desk to my right (not mine, plain white) with a black clock with rainbow numbers on it (this has significance I will explain later), a twin bed behind me (from early childhood), and a full length mirror leaning against my closet door (which is in front of me). Three small windows are behind me with white curtains.

It’s dark. It’s night and no lights are on. In the dream I stand there and stare at the mirror for a long time. After awhile, outside shines a light like passing car headlights through my windows behind me. It blinds me for a second, and when I look back into the mirror I look sickly. My face begins to turn pale, and my eyes melt out of their sockets until black orbs are shown. I grab for my face, but nothing is actually wrong. 

Another headlight passes and I hear a door being unlocked in the distance from outside my door. The lights fade on underneath my door, I then vaguely hear my siblings voices from when they were young saying, “good morning!” and “Hi daddy! You’re back!” etc. which leaves me confused because it’s night. 

I ignore it and turn back to the mirror. In the mirror I see something behind me and quickly turn. Nothing.                     
When I look into the mirror again, I see the figure still and wave at it. It waves back after a moment. I turn on the lights and everything is normal for a second, then the light in my room goes out and it turns back to this weird room with the mirror figure. I wait longer.

Outside my door I hear my siblings (again, like when they were very small) getting ready for school/getting breakfast. I look at my black clock with the rainbow numbers and see it’s 3:17 am. I think that is absurd, but ignore it. 

Turning back to the mirror there is a whole bunch of figures behind me, but I’m not scared this time. I’m used to them, and almost welcome them. But one steps forward from between them, and I’m full of dread suddenly. Then I realize why I welcomed the figures at first. They’re my family. My mother, four younger siblings, and older sibling. The one who stepped forward was my father.  I began to tremble terribly, and stifle my tears. He suddenly yells, “Get your ass out of bed! What are you doing here still!?” I shake my head vigorously while being unable to speak, but he advances still, “You know better then this!? Why can’t you be more responsible! I raised you better then this!” He hits me upside the head and it knocks me against the mirror, shattering it. I can’t look at him, I feel sick, everything is still dark and my world starts spinning. “How worthless” he spits, “Look at the time, I bought you this for a reason!” He tore the alarm from the desk and threw it at my feet. It read “8:27 am” on it. I was late for school. 

As this happened the rest of my family plugged their ears and turned around. The room remained dark. My father stares me down and I hear whispers from voices unfamiliar and warped, “Trash” “worthless” “you can’t even get out of bed” “this is the fourth time this year” “what are you even doing?” “Your grades will drop” “you know how to do better, so do it” “there’s nothing wrong with you, so why are you so stupid?” Etc. 

It faded eventually, and when I looked up they were gone. I was alone in that room crying in a pool of my own blood (was cut from the glass). I picked up a shard of the mirror and looked in it again. I was actually alone, and looked lifeless. A creeping blackness begins to engulf everything. I sat for what felt like forever in the dark, and it faded darker and darker. 

It was now pitch black and I hear my alarm going off. Giant rainbow numbers flashing “8:27 am” was all I could see. Sometimes it’d continue for what felt like forever, and I was trapped. Other times, I’d wake up in a cold sweat and tears at exactly 8:27 am. That’s the dream.


Not long before these dreams occurred was the morning my father gave my a concussion and yelled at me for hours for not waking up on time. Thing was, I was just laying in bed reading and waiting to leave. I wasn’t actually late, it was just my clock which was fast. He didn’t care when he found out. Now he denies it even happened, cause he’s a “great father” and a super religious “god-fearing man” ha, more like a narcissistic abusive asshat. That morning I went into class, in eighth grade, sobbing. Not long after my parents had a nasty divorce. Everything fell apart after that. For a long time, I blamed myself for it. If only I had been a better kid. If only I was well behave 24/7 and got better grades. My dad’s favorite phrase to drill into us was, “obey all the way, right away.” The “or else” was an unspoken threat lingering over our heads my whole childhood. I fell into a deep depression and had panic attacks almost every day. That wasn’t a one-time-incident... it was my every day. 

I still can’t get rid of the damn clock. I don’t know why. I don’t use it, but it’s sitting in a box under my bed collecting dust. When I hear that type of alarm I have a panic attack. I’ve moved forward and things are better now, but I think about this morning every day. When I open my eyes and look at the ceiling, it’s my first thought. I can’t read books in my bed anymore, or in the morning, I become too paranoid and startle at small noises. Hearing doors unlock gives me bad anxiety. It’s my life now, even though I’d previously gone through worse, this seems to be a major event for me.

I just wanted to vent I guess. The nightmare came back the other night, and I’ve felt off since then. It’ll eventually go away again, and I’ll have my ease returned to me, but for now I’m anxious. It’s difficult to wake up when I have these dreams, and I hate sunrises and sunsets since that morning.

You could say I’m not a morning person."

I'm almost always alone at my house because everyone's at work except for me. I recently tried making a few friends on discord but my parents won't let me because they think everyone on the internet is a pedophile. Any advice on how I might be able to self-sustain until I get my license (about 1 year)? I know it may not seem like it but I really am just horrifically distressed. Nobody in my family cares, instead I just get in trouble for very menial shit. Please, I just need some advice on what to do. How can I go back to my normal, happy, and distracted self."

I’m thinking a book of some sort could be a good idea/resource to give to my parents that would help them learn and open up to the idea? My parents are of that generation where they look down on therapy, think a strong will and work ethic can fix anything, want to tie the depression to a specific occasion or event that happened. I’m pretty new to reddit so I hope this post is ok for this sub and not too repetitive. Just really need help getting my parents to open their minds."

82,10 Months Since I Tried To Kill Myself,"Roughly 10 months ago after an intense year long battle with depression and loneliness I lost and tried to take my own life. Since then my life has been on the up and up again. The weeks I spent basically just sitting in my bed or the shower I was able to realize the things I enjoyed about life and the things that really gave me joy (my religion, music, friends that never neglected me even when I neglected them, etc.). But there have been a couple things nagging at me recently as I approach the 1 year mark that I could use some advice on or things that I’m curious about. 

1.) When I think back on my life prior to my suicide attempt, the memories don’t feel like mine. Like I know they’re mine due to head knowledge but in a weird sense they don’t feel like my memories but rather like a really really bad and poorly made TV show or a bad book I read. Even the friendships I had from that era of my life no longer feel “real” in a sense. I still love these people and in some cases I’ve maintained the same amount of contact I’ve with them every before my attempt, but I just feel really detached from them. Is this a normal thing? 

2.) About two days after my suicide attempt I forced myself to tell two of my trusted friend about my attempt so they could occasionally check up on me as I knew I wasn’t out of the woods yet in terms of my mental health, and as the months ran on I eventually told a couple more people as it was apologizing to them for my behavior and for any hurt I caused them while I was in that state of mind. One group I haven’t told is my family. I’ve never really been able to tell them and it hurts me a little bit, but I’ve always felt like I couldn’t because I have a very sensitive mother who would either get mad at me or blame herself. So how do I do that? How do I tell my family about the gigantic event in my life? 

3.) People are people and they hold grudges (sometimes justly so). In the events leading up to my suicide attempt, I lashed out at a few people and I hurt the feels of many, and because of that there are many people who are angry with me. I want to apologize to them for the hurt I’ve caused but I feel like with a couple of them who don’t really have a grip on the basic understanding of “depression and suicidal thoughts can make you act a bit dickish” would just get more upset. So how would y’all recommend going about apologizing so someone who wouldn’t quite understand that depression can sometimes cause episodes of anger?"
83,I have a very serious phobia but I cannot tell if its irrational,"I’ve seen stuff on acid attacks, and I don’t put it past some men I have come across. The thought of these give me anxiety, and I wonder if there are any solutions or preventative measures to take. 

Can you report someone if you are suspicious of they are capable of? How else could you go about it? I don’t have much info on the individual to know how to avoid them. I’m afraid they know enough about me."
84,Is a mental hospital my only hope at getting back into a regular schedule?,"I’ve been sick with an autoimmune disease that has given me severe depression, anxiety, and ocd. I can’t remember when the last time was that I felt happy and content with myself. I’m 16. I’ve been out of school and have had no social life for three years. My routine is to wake up at 8pm, eat dinner, do something like shower or watch tv and then stay up all night and repeat. My mental schedule has been like this for so long. I want to fix it so badly. I’m not suicidal, I’m just numb and depressed. Hopeless in a way. 

Is a mental hospital really my only hope? I want to fix my schedule on my own and I am capable but I always fall back into the same patterns. I want to fix this myself before I go into a hospital. I think I am capable but I just need tips or any sort of insight. Thanks if you comment."
85,"Help for OCD, Anxiety, and possibly depression in Illinois, United States without parental consent.","Please help me I am getting much worse with my OCD and anxiety it feels like i’m loosing my mind. I am 17 and my parents are pretty anti medicine and don’t take mental health seriously but I really need help. 

Please don’t recommenced online therapy I am already going to look into it. If you have a physical place I could go to talk to a professional that would be great and ideal. Thank you all."
86,I feel like I’m a jerk tricking everyone into thinking I’m a great person,"I feel like a selfish, heartless, vindictive jerk. Everyone’s all about understanding others and meeting people halfway and taking the higher road. I wish I could think like that. I wish I could be nice like that. I have to try so hard to be kind and do kind things and project an aura of “friendly nice person” all the time, which probably doesn’t even work that well. People tell me that I’m fun to be around and I’m so considerate of others when 70% of the time I’m judging someone unfairly or feeling irritated at something stupid or straight up angry and on the verge of smashing something (but I still look happy, teehee). Maybe I brought this upon myself for not being more honest. Anyway, instead of that imaginary nice friendly person, I’m the type of person who fantasizes about hurting people who hurt me. I want to ruin the people who ruined me. Even when I try to empathize and think about situations from other points of view, try to forgive and forget, try to realize that people are complicated, that sometimes people don’t even mean to cause me pain and they have good intentions- I don’t care because all I can feel is MY pain and MY grievances and how I’VE been wronged."

90,I’m anxious about calling my therapist,"Sorry if this doesn’t sound good or make very much sense. I’m kinda sad and it makes it hard to think. 

Every month or so I miss an appointment with my therapist. I either forgot or I’m not in the mood to talk. Once I miss that appointment though I get scared about calling back to reschedule. And it’s like that with everything in my life. I forget to text someone back and my mind goes “I can’t ever talk to them again” I get depressed and don’t show up to work so I think “well I can’t ever go back I have to quit”. I don’t know what causes this but it’s the hardest when it’s my therapy. Everyone in my “support group” gets really mad at me. They’re frustrated and sometimes yell asking “why do I do this? It’s not that hard” but for me it is. I think their reactions is what makes it so difficult. If they think this then won’t everyone else? If they’re mad then won’t my therapist be too? 

My therapist has been trying to call me every week for a month and yesterday I got a letter saying if I don’t schedule and appointment in 10 days I lose services. After getting this I’m more embarrassed then ever to call but at the same time I really need this therapy. It’s been helping me more then I ever thought it could. I know if I talk to any of my friends or family they’ll be livid with me but I think I could really use some positive encouragement to pick up the phone. I don’t know how to explain it but I feel like my therapist will hate me for always missing appointments."
91,What's wrong with me,"I've had an issue with dissociation for years now, so it's become a part of my life. I've spoken to mamy thrrapists about my issue with it and I've never been given the help I need. But now as time has gone on it feels like it's getting unbearably worse. I feel like I'm physically dying and on some days it feels like I'm dead already. I suspected that it was something along the lines of depersonalisation or derealisation, but with these new physical symptoms I have no idea what's going on anymore. It's got to the point where I'm genuinely surprised when I feel pain of some sort, or wake up in the morning. It's like I'm a ghost, and all the people around me are just moving objects."

94,I’m scared of reincarnation,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts and the only thing after death that actually scares me is reincarnation, the thought of finally being able to leave this shit hole called life just to be brought back into it no thank you. I personally believe that there’s nothing after death just black like sleeping without dreaming or ever waking up, heaven and hell doesn’t scare me even if I have to spend the rest of eternity burning in hell, and ghosts well I find that incredibly stupid but if it were real it could be fun. It’s reincarnation that I hate, I don’t wanna leave this life just to have to live life again even if I’m not a human I don’t want to be brought back I want it to be nothing, black, sleeping without ever waking up."
95,Do you ever feel like you're helping so much people are taking advantage of you? Or am I just being selfish?,"So I have these three friends fking up at school. We are all behind in the delivery of homework and essays. They far more than me though. The thing is. There are a couple of essays that we can deliver only until tomorrow otherwise we won't pass, I already finished a few days ago, and one of them yesterday, but the other two aren't done yet. I have helped one of them a lot and put aside the other things I had to do, but the other one won't answer me, or the teachers, not even her mom will and we were best friends, one of the only friends I had. She's the kind of person that never answers unless she really cares. I called her a million times, left her a hundred texts offering help, called her mom, told the psychologist to try to call her, for two weeks, and the only thing she's done is telling the teacher by email that she's already working on her essay. Now she's online, I texted her and she won't answer, really bich? I don't know, this year I've had no motivation at all, I just need to pass this to go wherever I want to go, otherwise I don't want to be anywhere. And this rn, using my energy for my friends, because I ran out of ideas for my own things, just makes me want to go back to old habits and disappear, specially when helping makes me feel like they are abusing my kindness"
96,"One of my best friend is constantly posting suicidal memes in his fb, how should I approach this when talking to him?","Hello everyone,

Lately one of my best friend has been constantly posting suicidal memes over his facebook. I would normally not be worried by this if any other of my friends shared the same kind of images, mainly because we tend not to take ourselves too serious, but given that this friend is the only one that never finished college, never got a job and overall seems to be unmotivated to do anything I have become increasingly worried about his wellbeign in general.

If me and my friends decided to talk to him, how should we approach the subject? What should we say?

Thanks in advanced for any information that you can bring to the table."
97,I'm so tired,"I can't get over with my depression. My parents hate me, my best friend hates me, they all are so tired of this sad fucker I have become... I have no one left who could love me and I don't know what to do... Maybe I just don't deserve love and friends"
98,Friend is acting cold and distant to us. Mental health problem,"While im University, my friends and i met this really cool girl who later became one of our good friends. Throughout our time in University, we ran into a few issues with her but a few of us made up and remained friends. I was really close with her and i considered her as one of the closest friends i ever had until recently. 

We both struggle with depression and confide in each other. Some time ago, she started avoiding everyone and giving them the cold shoulder. She would say at times that it was because of her mental health. We would often ask how she's doing and check up on her  but she told us that she hates it when we do. We respected her decision and tried our best to understand her struggles. We remained there if she needed us. Things seemed to get better.

Over time, she became out of touch with reality and display disturbing behavior. We tried to get her help from the school but to no avail. Later, i found out that she would say a lot of awful things behind my back to a lot of people. The things she said were extremely insulting which confused a lot of people given our close relationship. She later apologized to me and said it was because of jealousy and i forgave her. Things were looking better for a few months until she started behaving this way again and giving everyone the cold shoulder. She keeps stating that there was only one person who was there for her and never left her side. It hurts whenever she says and gives us the cold shoulder. 

It looks like a dead end at this point. How can i get over it? She was someone i really cared for. Thank you so much."

101,Guilty Conscience is keeping me from receiving adequate mental healthcare,"I started mental health treatment with a psychologist who was amazing. During treatment he recommended me to a Psychiatrist who I also believe is an amazing doctor and absolutely love. A few years back my Psychologist retired which sucked immensely. My Psychiatrist agreed to also take on the psychotherapy role in absence of my Psychologist after he retired.

So here is the problem. I am prescribed adderal, which I sell most of what I am prescribed every month because I lack self discipline and really need the money. I know what I am doing is wrong in every way. I hate that I do it and wish I didn't, but every month those bills keep coming around the corner and every month I sell some. I feel so guilty that I sell my prescription that its hindering my ability to truly open up to my Psychiatrist about anything, even things that have absolutely nothing to do with selling adderal. Even after years of seeing him the guilt keeps me from sharing anything too deep. I am receiving medication for depression which definitely helps but I know from experience that medicine alone is not the cure all for problems. From personal experience coping skills learned through Psychotherapy are move valuable than anything a pill can offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its not right but I do not want to lose my adderal scripts because 1. I do take them when needed (but do not always need them) 2. The income defiantly helps. Yes I know I am trying to have my cake and eat it too.

So barring what is right and what is wrong my question is this: Can I see a Psychologist and tell them this information without them contacting my Psychiatrist and telling them what I am doing? If I could just spill the beans on myself maybe I could finally get some mental relief and work to the root causes of all these problems."

I usually dont get actually angry at most of my friends but some of them aggravate me a lot for some reason.

I was in a really dark place in life and she’s brought me a whole new meaning to the word happiness and continued to make my life better everyday. I try my best to compliment her and reassure her how great she is and nothing she can do will change that. She’s had some low confidence after her last ex was emotionally abusive and would say how she’s not enough. I want to help her out of that mindset and make her happy, but I feel as if nothing I do helps her. If there’s anyone out there with advice on what I can do to help her or say to her that’d be much appreciated, thanks for the help"
108,Questions about Emotional Self-Harm,"So I just found out that emotional self-harm is a thing and I have a few questions.

Is being extremely apologetic ESH? Is having a gender-dysphoria-induced negative body image ESH?"
109,"Why did the group therapy facilitator, and the driver of the mental health agency fleet minivan, tell me not to recline my seat while I was being driven with the other clients?","We were going on a shopping trip together to buy cooking supplies in order to teach each other how to cook. Since it was early morning and I wasn't a morning person, I wanted a quick nap so I reclined my seat while being driven in the mental health agency's fleet minivan.

Why did the driver tell me to put the seat back up? Was I literally harming anybody by having my seat reclined? How does reclining my seat *harm* anyone, therefore, what's the (valid) rationale for demanding that I don't recline my seat for a quick nap?"
110,The end is near. It's over.,Soon i will either kill myself or run away from home. I can't do this anymore.

112,To work or not to work,
113,I love you,"I love you
I don't know you but I love you. Sacred human being. Flesh, blood, breath and consciousness staring into the screen. I love you. I don't have much to offer but this tender love I hold. I love you and thank you for loving me"
114,I dont really know what to do...,"I'm 22, and I have struggled with pain for years, but recently I found the pain extremely painful. For 3 months I've been nearly unable to move. I have to have help to get to each end of my home, and use a wheelchair for most outings. I havent been able to get a diagnosis, or disability insurance. I have no recovery in sight, and im losing alot of hope. I lost my job due to this disability, and now I haven't made money in months im running low on hope, with no doctors willing to help. I am certain I have severe fibromyalgia, IBS, and have been diagnosed with severe IC (painful bladder syndrome), PTSD, Personality Disorder, Anxiety disorder, Severe Depression, and some other things. The pain is getting to me, and I feel like ill never be able to get diagnosed for disability insurance. Does anyone have any advice or otherwise."
115,My Endless Loop of Regret,"I regret most decisions I make in life, and I regret regretting most of decisions I've made in life, and I regret regretting how I've regretted most of the decisions I've made it life. It always gets me nowhere except wasting a lot of time. Who can relate?"
116,need to say this now for some reason,"i've got counseling tomorrow but for some reason i've got to say this now

i don't want to die. but i'm tired of feeling emotions. i just wish at least for a couple hours i could do something without feeling anything. it seems like everything i've done for the past year almost causes one extreme reaction / emotion or another. and i'm so tired. i'm so fucking tired. 

thing is it comes in waves too. i feel fine with it, used to it, whatever. and then like once a month i just break down and realize how tired i've been / am and how much it's built up. 

it doesn't help that i'm constantly physically tired too due to health problems and insomnia. but i can't block out the physical tiredness like i can the emotional. the emotional / mental exhaustion just hides in the background until it builds up and i just snap and breakdown 

it's so confusing and thing is i'm too tired to be motivated to work to permanently change this and avoid it. i just want some fucking miracle drug or whatever to do it all for me. i feel pathetic honestly but it's reasonable i think"
117,Work-related stress and anxiety,"My 10 hour work days are draining the energy out of me and my boss messages me on weekend nights asking me to check on work related stuff. The line between my personal and work life thinned out since I started working from home a couple of months ago. Feeling suffocated almost every day and I’ve also been having recurring dreams of missing deadlines. Doesn’t help that I’m expected to return to the office this Thursday and Covid cases in my city are increasing by thousands per day. 

Anyone else feeling the same? Feel free to open up too! Let’s all support each other 😢"
118,I feel guilty about self harming and I dont know what to do,"*Trigger warning for some people there is content on self harm*

I (17m) have been cutting for a while now, my parents found out about this a few years back and they were super worried about it, I went to see a therapist and they think I'm doing better now but I'm not. I've been hiding the cuts from them for the last year and a half and I feel really guilty about it and I'm ashamed of doing this so I hide it and I dont talk about. A lot of friends and other people have told me to tell my parents what going on but I cant bring myself to becuase my younger sister has been diagnosed with clinical depression and they already stress and worry about her a lot and I can see its affecting them in a bad way. I dont know what to do anymore and I'm scared to/dont want to tell them."
119,Going through major insecurity for a long time now.,"For the past few days I've been self introspecting and have come to realise some of the deeply embedded issues within me.
 
I am extremely insecure. I think everyone is better than me, both in terms of physical attributes and intelligence. This has always been the case with me, I never had the confidence to even raise my hand and answer a question in class even when I knew it. It's because I felt that I'll say something dumb. 
The problem has gotten worse, now I just feel self conscious all the time. Check myself out in the mirror 50 times a day, and absolutely hate what I see. Refrain from talking too much or expressing my opinions about anything to avoid getting laughed at. 

I think the reason why I developed such insecurity can be traced back to middle school. I hit puberty before most of my peers and so everyone would point that out and also my weight gain. I had this boyfriend who always laughed at my opinions about most things. Often not logically correcting me, and just waving it off like I wouldn't understand the logic. 

Anyhow, I just wanted to share incase anyone else has been through something similar, so that we can discuss and maybe share some tips to get out of it. It's really weighing me down and killing my motivation and it sucks!
I've started working out, reading more and just being more woke and aware in general but none of this makes me feel any better."
120,Please help,"For a tiny bit of context: She was my first girlfriend and I broke up with her about a year 1/2 ago. She caused me a lot of pain and there was a lot of betrayal, and I starting liking someone else who was better and less toxic so I broke up with her and went for the other girl. I'm still with this girl and have been for the last year and few months and she is amazing and we tell each other everything and actually have trust, unlike my last relationship. Anyway, some of my other toxic friends betrayed me throughout the years and I cut them off as well, while keeping other good friends.

I guess my main problem is: I get these weird scenarios in my head every time I think of someone who hurt me. I have daydreams and imagine situations of me having conversations with them. Whether it's my ex or other people who hurt me, when something randomly triggers their name in to my head I sometimes imagine talking to them and having specific conversation, as well as just wondering how they are doing. I don't like this, and I want them gone from my memory but this happens nearly every day. No idea what's wrong with me, but a lot of the time I even talk to myself OUT LOUD and imagine I'm having a convo with them and imagine their responses and stuff then I snap out of it after a few mins. Someone help me free my mind. Do I need to meet up with these people and get closure somehow (even though I cut THEM off)? Do I need to go to a hypno or therapist? Pls help. it's more serious than it sounds, and it's hard to get on with my life."
121,"I’ve [27F] been experiencing what seems like episodes of mania, coming to terms with an eating disorder, sexual, physical and emotional trauma and I just cheated on my partner to sabotage","I got out of an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship last year after having been in 3 physically, emotionally and 1 sexually abusive relationships prior to that. I met someone I think is amazing, treats me well, doesn’t do drugs and is not a narcissist which was my MO forever because I haven’t wanted to accept “daddy issues”. 

This person is truly the best partner I have had besides some offhanded comments in the heat of an argument that were deeply insulting and made me really insecure about myself. This happened more than once. It’s my first time not feeling physically attractive or uncomfortable naked around someone I love. Fast forward 10 months, we go to a strip club because that’s what we do, I love them, and he gets a lap dance alone. Last time we went together and that was totally fine. This sent me over the edge and it just so happens my most recent ex just moved to my state. We got home and I was already pretty wasted, we fucked and I laid there just stewing in my thoughts that have spiraled out of control greatly over these months. I left and fucked my ex. An abuser and a drug addict who would probably walk right over my dead body if I’m real with myself and not falling for the fake, abusive, manipulative shit. 

When my partner called to check on me at 6am because he was worried sick, I replied “I just cheated on you I hope you enjoyed that lap dance.” On my way there everything was telling me to just go home and I was just hoping I would get pulled over and get a DUI or something because alcohol is a major problem in my life for years and I would like to be done and don’t know how. I knew I was sabotaging worse than I ever have. The anger, worthlessness and alcohol fueled me to keep going. 

I’m a social worker so I’m definitely not unfamiliar with mental health, I just haven’t come to terms with my own or sought proper treatment. I’m realizing this reckless behavior, especially when it comes to alcohol and sex, are indicators of several illnesses, now compounded with trauma across my childhood and adult life, I’m thinking I’m bipolar and possibly even borderline and definitely experiencing ptsd and remaining in abuse cycles. I was in the hospital last week and they just checked me out with Ativan but I think I’ll go back tomorrow and ask to actually stay so I can sort this out or I really fear I’ll end up dead, if not by my own hands then at the hands of alcohol. 

What I’m wondering is: is it wrong to ask him to have some accountability too and approach it thru a trauma informed lens? Because this would have never happened minus all of these factors. I’m fucked up man, I’ve tried breaking up with him many times so I could sabotage alone and I think I just totally fucked it up in the absolute worst way possible. He’s been supportive thru my ongoing mental anguish and drunk episodes and I’m confident it’s not to the level of codependency. He is my first decent partner that cares about someone other than themselves. Then my paranoid ass just doesn’t think he cares and he’s like the rest and I am actually neurotic about it to the point it disrupts my day. I don’t think he’s coming back and I’m sad but I’m honestly pissed he made me feel unattractive/undesirable and like a bottom bitch because not even my worst partners have done that. I’m the dysfunctional, reckless, emotionally disturbed one in a relationship for the first time and I’m not sure what to do anymore but I’m certain I want to work thru this with him because I think it’s more natural and forgivable to say terrible things you don’t mean to someone than literally risk your life to go fuck an abuser and sabotage not just your life but someone else’s. So I’m just hoping he comes back. I just want a normal life that doesn’t include constant suicidal ideation and self-sabotage behavior."
122,I need help,"My mental state is deteriorating. I took a new job for the money and it absolutely sucks the life out of me. I have never been this unhappy in my life. I have no insurance yet and my anxiety and depression is at an all time high and I live in the US so without insurance I can’t get the help I need. I’m afraid I’m about to snap. What the hell do I do?

I can’t quit because I was unemployed due to COVID for awhile and I already almost lost my car and my apartment. Someone please help me."
123,My Mental Health is deteriorating because of my brother who has Cerebral palsy,"I have no idea what to do, my family and I have tried everything and nothing seems to work anymore. My brother (33 of age) was born with a birth defect and as a result, a part of his brain is damaged. He has difficulty controlling his emotions and he often yells and shouts at us for a minimum of 2 hours per day. Trust me when I say this, nothing seems to make him calm down (he has been to multiple psychologists, psychiatrists and general doctors; he hasn't improved a bit with pills and therapy). He just simply won't listen to us when he gets mad, it feels like there is literally a barrier between our words and him. I honestly can't take it anymore, especially with the pandemic I have no idea what to do when I need to study or just take a break from all this negativity (to grasp the situation; imagine being stuck with someone who keeps yelling out of the top of their lung saying ""I must kill this person or that person, and they are going to hell for etc."" for hours). Nothing is improving in my household and my parents are pretty old so I'm terrified of what the future holds and have no idea what to do. I sometimes wish I could start over... I even, sometimes, wish my brother was never born which then makes me feel even shittier."
124,Do you receive support for deciding to used medicine for help?,How do you deal with little or no support from friends and family to go the medical route of treatment? I have been on SSRIs for about three years now and I finally found a great mix that has allowed me to take my life back from depression and anxiety. But everyone close to me is suggesting I learn to cope on my own and live without medication. It is really hard to keep saying how much it helps to people who 'deal without meds every day'.

129,I don't think therapy is for me. What now?,"Maybe I just haven't found the right one, but I've been in therapy for a year and I don't feel like it helped me and I don't feel like my therapist really understands me. Also, I live in a rural area, so it's like a 2 1/2 hour drive in total for an hour long session since there aren't really any therapists near me. I mean, I know therapy is important, but I don't really feel like doing that every week forever?

So, I thought about ending things with my therapist at least for a while and see how it goes. However, I'm not sure if that is a good idea, because I'm worried things might get worse or I will regret not working on myself in a few years. Ffor context: I have recurring depressive episodes and in between some anxiety, self-esteem issues, stuff like that. But sometimes I have phases where I actually feel alright, like at the moment.

What do you guys think, any advice?"
130,Talked myself out of a negative thought loop,"I was having some really weird, hopeless emotions related to the mundaneness of my life and these intrusive thoughts were popping into my head like ""Your past is so standard, you are so average and you will die mediocre,"" etc. Took to my notes app, practiced some stream of consciousness style writing and eventually asked myself, ""What would I tell my best friend if she was experiencing what I have been feeling atm?"". That was the breaking point: a whole 30-line paragraph full of positive self-talk and alleviation. Now I feel OK and hopeful again. It actually worked."
131,Friend diagnosed with depression and anxiety. How can I offer help?,"Its been a year since my friend has opened up to me about her diagnosis. i am one of the few friends who know. She has been going through a lot of issues lately as well - physical health, problems at home - all of which take a toll on her mentally. I want to help her but I do not know how to give any advice to anyone in need in general. IDK how to talk to her when she feels off or shares her feelings with me. I always end up asking her to let me know how I can help. that's it. and she never explicitly goes on to explain how. Like, whenever I say ""let me know how I can help"", shes says ""yeah"" and that's the end of the topic. 

I sometimes suggest her things that I find enjoying ( exercise, movies etc) but she doesn't find them comforting. I also understand that depression and anxiety work differently for everyone. so some things that might work for someone would not work for her. I also understand I can't go on simply suggesting her stuff because that could come out as rude. i just. want to know how to react. whenever she opens up to me. how to react so that I don't hurt her further but also i am being helpful to her. currently, whenever she shares things with me, i feel my replies look like I'm just trying to do some formality and that i don't care. but the truth is i simply dont know what to do or say.

another thing is, that i myself struggle with mental health issues, although i have not ever been to therapy or got myself diagnosed. so i just really need to know how to help her but also remember to put my mental health first, at times. 

There are many articles online, all saying different stuff. but I would really like feedback from someone who has first-hand experience with something like this. 

Thank you."

136,"Birthday Blues, who's with me!?","Hi guys, 

I'm posting this up here not knowing if it will ever be seen but I feel like shouting it into the void could take some weight off my chest. 

I've thought about writing this loads but as I type I've forgotten it all, so here it goes. 

Basically I'm getting birthday blues. I get them every year but can normally skip under the radar. I purposely don't remind people and have managed low key acknowledgements and the usual- HP Bday an auld text off closest friends, If they remember. 😁
Last year, the only person I wanted to spend my birthday with was my daughter (6 then) She was so excited and asked every day that week, except for the day my sister took her for a few hours for a visit, I got a phone call around 7 and it was her asking for a sleepover at her aunts. I couldn't see why not, left down the phone to a blissful girlo while I proceeded to burst into tears, She has forgot and I made no effort to remind her it was exactly what I wanted and I was gutted.

This year seems it might not be so easy to schlip under the radar however, I got in touch last year with my estranged grandmother and my aunts and uncles. I hadn't seen them last since I was 16. 
My Dad passed away suddenly 6 weeks ago and I never got to meet him as an adult. (I will turn 30 soon) I know he wanted to know me. Being honest, I had no intention of meeting him until it was too late and my conditioning was smashed into pieces. 

I was raised by my mother who unfortunately has narsiccistic tendencies, and a dislike particularly towards me growing up, (she really hated me for being a heavier girl among a million other things, I reminded her of my dad, which I have learned since his death I also remind others) and had done extreme things to cause pain to myself and my adult siblings I've had to make the choice to distance her in order to protect my daughter. (The irony, dont think I dont feel like an iron hearted villain, the situation is beyond help) 

The result of Dads' passing is that we have met and gained alot of family, and they act like a real family who note, care about and love each other and are excited to have us back in their lives, and we as siblings also became closer. Granny already mentioned 'the date' - queue poker face. 'Oh yeah, that Sunday. Of course we'll come out to you"". So I know somethings gonna go on. And it scares the shit out of me. I dont want it, but I know they do. My boyfriend finally had to tell me he has spent the last 2 days talking my headstrong sister out of a surprise party. My Social anxiety is so bad I don't go to shops. (Ive been attempting to buy knickers for 3 weeks now and bf gets the food or there would be none)  

So on top of that I have massive confidence issues, my best friend is beyond attractive (housemate up to lockdown)  and my boyfriend likes to admire women- not in any purposeful or hurtful way  but I can see it in him. While my bestfriend and I were living together I lost so much weight I scared my bf. (I was always heavy, you could see my ribs 6 months ago so I scared myself a little also but I was hoping to die)
I spent so much time involuntary worrying over them realising they wanted to be together and I'd be the one with the issue so buh-bye me. This would keep me awake for nights. 
Eventually I had to tell them both and its still an ongoing conversation because I'm not well over it in general and not atall again now. 

So last week my best friend asks for his number, and I know she has my back but just the thoughts of some spark happening is dominating my mind while she is most probably trying to set something up for my birthday. Its been unbearable in my head since I realised why my brain got so scrambled. 

Its 11:26 am and I have yet to sleep, Im not feeling tired just sad. I have trich so I pulled out all of my eyelashes on my right eye. It took me the night to figure out I've been behind the scenes attempting to sabotage peoples plans without even knowing what they are. And if I dont succeed, I now have no eyelashes or eyebrows so I can look as awful as I feel. I didnt realise till most of them (lashes) were gone I was garenteeing I won't get the hope for a chance to feel pretty now.
I pulled them all out back in Feb and confidence plummeted. They were back by August properly and I was feeling OK about my face for the first time in my life ever. I guess my brain knew that long before I did. 
I'm not sure how to cope to be honest, I dont want people to remember or care about my birthday and the thought really upsets me. Both ways. My brain is fried! 

I'm just sharing, Im In councilling and am currently working on my insecurity. but to anyone who's read this waytoo long post, thoughts welcome. 
I do hope it makes some lovely soul feel that little less alone."
137,My therapy ends soon and I don't want to extend it,"I've been dangerously depressed since about 5th grade (13-14 years ago) and I'm in treatment since 9 years now. Me and my therapist went trough our goals from 2 years ago and well, what I reached could've been done without them (stopping eating my fingers) while we made zero progress on the important things. I've spent a lot of my remaining energy following their advice in the recent years, but doesn't matter how much I try: The following exhaustion from keeping up with something on the last drip of my energy just drags me down further. Simple example is doing some sport: I can break trough my depression and do it for a while, I'm so exhausted from keeping doing it that I end up more depressed rather than reaching the promised effect. The recent appointments with my therapist have been desperately looking for something to talk about. There's nothing to talk, I'm depressed without any reason and since we tried everything there's nothing left we could try. Now we'll run out of appointments soon and while I could extend it, I don't see a reason to do so and she doesn't suggest doing so either. It seems obvious that my therapist is done with my shit and wants to get rid of me after years of unsuccessfully working together."
138,PTSD bitch,I can’t sleepover at anyone else’s house. Physically sleep. I always have insomnia. The other friend or partner can sleep. But for some reason when I’m with another person I start getting really bad flashbacks to the point where I just start starring anxiously and either pretend I’m sleeping towards the morning or I leave. In this case I said “aight imma head out”. At least Ik it’s a ptsd thing now should be reassuring to live with myself hahahaha.
139,"Slipping into seasonal depression, don’t know what to do to help it","Pretty much don’t see the sun from October until April because of the constant snowing n shit, but I’m stuck in a cold dark place for 7-9 months of the year. It just makes me so depressed, especially with schooling. I would live with my cousins in Texas to see the sky more but that also just has a whole list of pros &amp; cons. For the past 7 years it’d often carry over well into my summers,  otherwise usually year round since I’d do nothing about it. This year I had my first 5 solid months of no mental illness (my previous longest was probably like a week) and it felt so cool to actually have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. 

Like I feel bad for the people who are going to have to deal with me. If it at least gets as bad as it was earlier this year, then I’m really really fucked. Is there anyway to make it not as bad at least?"
140,Do I have the symptoms of the OCD?,"Hi! So um I really don't wanna self-diagnose myself or anything like that I just wanna know your opinions. Sometimes when I do stuff I get random tasks in my head that i have to do or something bad will happen to someone i know, etc... (Even to my dog .-. and i love my doggo :( ). Its usually something really stupid, for example if i didn't close the box or something like that i have to close it, etc... Also i noticed that in my mind i get gross things that ill never do in my life. Things like eating a random gross item I'm looking at, touching something gross, etc. These things do not interfere so much with my daily life i just wanna know if someone with diagnosed OCD has similar situations."
141,A discord server for helping support and assist mentally ill teenagers,"Quick notice: we are NOT in any way professionals. We'rr just other kids who lke to help others in need, and having a community to support you after your loved ones don't listen can help a lot.

I assume that sense this is a mental health subreddit, that there are gonna be alot of teens here with depression, anxiety or something else, so this would be a good place to post. Anyway, the server is called the ""Kids In The Dark"" server and includes a staff full of people who want to (and are actually quite good at imo) help you get better and navigate your situation better. It is complete with a help bar, which includes an advice channel, vent channel, and suicide prevention channel. It's helped me in so many ways after 2 months and I honestly think this is a great place for you. The age limits are 13 minimum and 22 maximum, as this is a mainly teenage server. https://discord.gg/UJUQkPa"

So I decided to search “ WW2 bodies” at night because I was interested and now I can’t sleep. It’s been 5 hours and I am still can’t fall asleep. What is actually happening? I’ve tried everything like switch sides of bed. Also to add insult to injury I have health anxiety."
143,i am about to quit the life server,"here i am, sitting on my bed and listening to heretoir - retreat to hibernate. i took this decision long ago, but i can finally feel this is the right time. i am 21f, fat, ugly, engineering student, former bulimic (still struggling with it for 2 weeks). i was diagnosed with major depression at age 12 and i have dysthymia as you can guess. also i have anxiety which makes my life too hard to live. i can’t even ask for another fork in a restaurant if i dropped one. and i have very restricting parents. with the combination of all, i really did a lot to stay alive. i started to make music, currently i play guitar in two bands. whenever they talk about playing in front of people, things are getting worse for me. i can’t even cry because i live with my parents, i can’t let them catch me crying in my room. i can’t express a feeling, i don’t even know how to react to something. i am not addicted to cigarettes, but for the last 2 weeks, i smoke too much that i haven’t smoked this much in my life before. i also smoke pot to stay away from my mind - but it doesn’t work anymore. my thoughts are still there but in a trippy way this time. and i can’t sleep anymore, not more than 3 hours without being interrupted by nightmares. i want to escape this reality. i can’t even say what is real and what is not anymore. i can’t even remember if a thing really happened or was it a dream - or were i just dreamt about it etc. i don’t think that i can be something, it wouldn’t mean anything to me if i could be. i don’t wanna do anything anymore. anyways, it seems like i talked too much for an asperger, i better find a way to end everything without pain, until this “right time” feeling ends."

I’ve tried building up courage and hinting to some friends that I’m not okay and I’m pretty sure that they didn’t acknowledge what I said and just moved on to a different topic. I know the general advice for these kinds of things is to seek help from a professional or family or friend, but I always feel like I’d just be a burden to them. Like they’d tell me that what I’m feeling isn’t real or important to them. I’m afraid that I’ll just be told to get over it."

147,I want to be fine on my own again.,"I used to be fine on my own. But now I'm in a situation in which nothing is certain because I'm not sure if I'm going to enjoy what I will do at University (I changed subject after not liking what I did for the past year). Other than to my girlfriend I don't really feel very close to anyone, which makes me codependent on her. I am also low on money and am trying to find a job that I won't absolutely hate. Overall I feel like I try to distract myself by meeting up with random people I know because I don't want to deal with the unhappiness and fear that faces me when I'm alone. I also don't have a good relationship with my family and don't feel very emotionally supported. I just sometimes wish I could believe that everything will work itself out and I won't fall back into a spiral of anxiety or depression whenever things get difficult."
148,It's getting to be too much,"Recently, someone threatened me with suicide because I wasn't giving them enough attention &amp; that took a toll on my mental even though I thought it didn't. My mental before hand wasn't really in the best spot &amp; I thought I was getting better but, it's gotten worse. I constantly feel lonely even if I'm around people &amp; it feels like I can't really tell anyone that I'm depressed because they don't really acknowledge it. Somehow, through all of the stuff that going on in my head even though I try to keep it quiet, I somehow manage to blame myself for all of this. I feel as if I'm constantly messing up and that I'm the reason there is so many issues with my friend group / just trying to reach out to make new friends or reaching out for help. It's starting to feel completely pointless and I'm not really sure how to keep myself going anymore seeing as how it feels like my friends just aren't there."
149,Is it normal not to feel anything?,"Sometimes I get random bursts of motivation, but I mostly feel numb all the time.
I can’t feel love, I only care about people because I feel like I owe something to them, they love me and I can’t reciprocate. My mom went to the er today, I  called the ambulance and I held her hand, but I didn’t feel anything, I wasn’t worried, I was just standing there."
150,keep thinking I'm someone else and living someone else's life in my head,"Not sure how to put it:) I'm male, 27 years old. Since I remember when I have some free time (not working hard, driving, studying, talking to others, when I'm not interacting with anyone etc.) I'm keep ""being"" someone else in my head, that probably sounds odd so let me start from begging.

When I was a kid I've always wanted to be a soldier/police officer/intelligence officer/spy/special agent-ish/jedi master. I've watched tons of action movies, I've read books, played cops&amp;robbers with friends, when grow older I never pursued a career in these fields. I think I've never actually wanted to focus on becoming one of these, can't really imagine me working like that. I have a well paid job, I like what I'm doing and I'm good at it. BUT ALL THIS STAYED INSIDE ME:)

When I'm driving home from work - I imaging being a cop on a patrol, when I'm working out I thinking I'm a special forces operator on training, when in office i work in, I'm thinking about being intelligence officer and my office is some sort of army headquarters or something. In the course of time, with getting more specific knowledge and stuff ""my brain"" started do demanding from himself to be as precise as possible - so now, when i imagine being let's say soldier I can ""dream"" about being some high ranking guy but I need so be someone with rank matching my age, serving in the unit that really exists... and other details. Also I can't focus on being one imagined person all the time, this changes all the time, even few times a day, with every change I start to create new details and stories.

All this bothers me more lately, I feel overwhelmed with stuff going inside my head I feel like I hold too many not-really-important details and stories that don't even concern my real life! My head feels tired.

Anyone had that? Any ideas how to deal with it?"
151,How not to be paranoid,"Hello, i would like to share that i am constantly anxious and paranoid about others. I always feel like people are talking badly or laughing about me. I do not know how to shake these thoughts away. I am now waiting for therapy because there is a long line. But my paranoia does not get better. I feel it gets worse. I do not know what to do when i am waiting for the therapy..."
152,How do I know if I've mental disorder?,"So my life had quite been rough sometimes. I'm 28 years old.

In my childhood I've not been confident kid neither I was good in concentration in any subjective matter but through times my confidence level got its place in my life but I feel that my concentration point is still weak and as I m growing through the age it seems my mind is getting weak.

Why I feel my concentration is weak?
- I never had peace of mind in my childhood days. My nature does demand peacefull environment around or else I can't get through...! at home my mom and dad use to fight all the time(andcthey still does) so all I know that their fight use to make me numb and scare in my childhood days and so I started to distract my mind in every possible way to avoid such noisy, stressing situation. Since then making my mind wander became a habit and maybe due to this I never had good concentration level. 


How this had affected in my journey?
- I had been overthinking about lot of thinks and I cannot shut my mind until I feel exhausted so indirectly my mind is almost controlling me no doubt.
- Again, stress and depression had consumed me. I bring on this issue on every negative phase comes in my lufe. Like, loosing friendship, rejections, no satisfaction in  proffessional life, family issues etc.. Etc.. Each of these phase affects me to the core its not just my feeling but my mind gets affect too. Its been 28yrs and I haven't yet figured out what I accompolished as person. I still struggle with the issues under these phase - loosing friendship, rejections, no satisfaction in  proffessional life, family issues etc.. Etc..
- I had developed an 'Alter Ego' and she. is way more confident than me, actually a Tomboy! She is rowdy and rough tough one, fearless too. Well my alter ego takes place depending on situation so yes I had always got feedback that people don understand what sort of nature I have.
- Strange Memory issue. Sometimess I dont remember easily what I did 5 minutes before but I do remember some important events like 10-20 yrs ago only if they had made space in mind. Honestly I dont know why is it like this.
- I had been hallucinating since 4-5 yrs back and I think my hallucination rate is quite 20% whuch means I dont hallucinate frequently, but it is increasing as I m aging.
- I do have lots of mood swings. For a person like me discipline or a process doesn't work. This because everyday life situation has different impact on my mind and that decifes my behaviour for the moment. So in a day I do go from happy to depress to happy to self hatred etc. Yes I dont have control on my mood either. Recent case - on saturday I wentvto shopping with my dad. We came back home 3 hours later. It was raining outside and since my dad do get sick in rainy days easily I wanted to treat him very soon. So I went hime while he was parking car, turn on the water heater for him to have hot shower and was waiting at door for him to arruve and help him out if all the mess he was in. But it went 15minutes he didnt came up and in thise 15min I literally loose my temper alot. I was angry on him. As he came I literally blasted on him at the top of my voice which literally shocked him and made him angry as well. I knew he was off at the moment he couldn't. Understand my behaviour.

So this all my case which makes me wonder that if I m suffering from any mental disorder.
As far as I thought was maybe it will be minor case of Dissociative identity disorder or Bipolar disorder.

I had given very less example which might not conclude above things but tgere are many such things that I m missingvout right now again due to my lack of memory.

So do let me know if these are  signs of any minor mental disorder or Its just simple case of weak mind."
153,My respects to all teachers,"...Our schools are virtual learning for the First Quarter (at least, and probably until Jan. 2020) so I have to do everything online with our Autistic, can't-sit-still-for-a-second 10 year old 5th Grader.

The work he has to do isn't hard...

Just getting him to SIT STILL--aaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!

&amp;#x200B;

0\_0 This is how I feel today. My brains are already leaking out my ears and I need a Valium to make it through the rest of my day. What is worse is that I have to go to my Drug and Alcohol class in about a half-hour (9:30 am) and that means hubby has to take over until I get back at 12:30 pm...he has NO idea how the classrooms work. Eli (that is the 10 year old) has a Google Meet Meeting at 11:30 am so I have to show hubby how to get into that room when it is time. -\_-   


I am not really complaining...much. I just thought it would be interesting for you guys to read a bit about my life in the trenches (aka homeschooling, not by choice). Maybe make someone laugh a little. Today's assignment for our 5th Grader was a typing game to get him used to the keyboard. I do all of his typing...I have to sit with him or he would be bouncing all over creation like an even more-hyper Tigger. Ha ha. He can't sit still for a second unless he is watching Minecraft videos or playing Roblox.   


OK. I am done rambling. I am feeling ok this morning. I got a good night's sleep (EXACTLY 8 hours lol) after talking to our 21 year old daughter who is at school in Rochester NY right now. That is \~4 hours from home. It was sure nice to see her (we video chatted) again. I miss her lots. Can't wait until Nov. when she comes in for the HOLIDAY!! YAY!  


Bai! Have a great day all!!!"

155,"Sometimes when I'm stressed I think about what others would say to me, is this normal?","So here goes. 

Sometimes (usually when I am stressed out about stuff - mostly deadlines/study for uni) I just get these thoughts/voice inside my head but it is not my own conciseness or what ever you call it but the thoughts/voice is what I feel like someone from my past would be saying to me (I no longer hang out with the person now though) 

Sometimes the 'thoughts' are on my side or other times against me. examples like: you have taken on too much work and you can't handle it you shouldn't be doing so much, or its not that hard seriously so many people do it and they don't complain 

then it can just stem into hearing more thoughts about my life in general  eg. shouldn't be doing this or that

Idk but does anyone else relate to this or have any advice :/"

162,How to Support a Paranoid Friend?,"Hey guys! I have a lovely friend who I’ve known for quite some time. As we’ve grown older together, she’s developed quite a bit of anxiety and paranoia. Since then, she’s found help and medication that has balanced her out quite a bit. But, she still has one fear that stays with her- being poisoned. She is always fearful of someone tampering with her food/drink. Whether that be a food services worker, or her own husband/mother. My question to you all is, how do I better support her with this? Whenever we share a meal, snack, or drink, I always sense her hesitation.

164,A universal confession,"I’m capable of being happy, and I am proud of myself for the various skills that I have. I’m proud of myself for only breaking down a couple of times in this Lockdown, and I hope to break down only a couple times more. There is lots of comedy in each and every situation if you look deep enough, and there is a perfect timing to make that observation to be comedic enough. It is better to keep most of those jokes to yourself, and only tell them to people who you really care about, and who you know to care about you. There is some amount of happiness and satisfaction in mystery and not knowing as well. Not knowing whether a joke would make someone laugh when you refrain from telling it. Not knowing whether someone really likes you as much as you like them. The best part of it all would be not knowing everything. The sweet part of mortality is being aware that you won’t be able to know literally everything, so you know that there is an unachievable high score in life, which everyone will try to reach. The best you can do here is try to reach it too. Live your best life, and don’t struggle without a reason. I’m kinda sad that it took me years of self-inflicted emotional torture and being in a constantly depressed state to figure this out, but I’m glad that I got to this conclusion anyway."

171,My best friend has been out of my life for a month and I don't know what to do with my life. Thanks bpd and addiction.,"When you have BPD, you are hard to love. Even when someone does love you, you're skeptical. I had the opportunity of experiencing unconditionally love, and I'm only able to appreciate it now that it's gone. I loved her so much that I destroyed everything. Throughout our entire friendship I stayed on the verge of a panic attack, just waiting for it to all fall apart, for her to leave. Most days were great, really great, other days were a nightmare for the both of us. When the fear of abandonment became too much, I would do the toxic thing that people with BPD are known for. I would do awful things to her, just to see how determined she was to stay. She never left. It's an awful feeling to know you are capable of such things. She stayed through the lowest points in my life, and never gave up on me. She stayed through my eating disorder, when I was severely underweight and would deny I even had a problem, she thought she was watching me die. She stayed through the first time I used a hard drug, despite the fact her chgildhood had been destroyed by that drug. She stayed through my manic episodes, she was always got the brunt of it as I loved her the most. She stayed when I went into active addiction, she didn't lose faith in me. When I got clean after going to rehab, then relapsed, she even stayed then, she told me relapses happen, just to pull myself out of it. Our entire friendship was a rollercoaster of emotions, Ive never seen someone so worried about someone than when seen me high for the first time. She didn't deserve any of that. Our friendship ended after I lied to her about relapsing, when she found out, I had just been assaulted by my older sister. She said the tiniest rude remark, when I said I don't know why it happened, she said I should know why. I immediately took that as as sign that she was on the verge of abandoning me, so I blocked her. Three years of the most love I have ever felt, was gone in an instant. I miss her more than anything, but even if she wanted back into my life id have to decline because I couldn't in good conscience have a relationship with her knowing I'm not mentally well enough to where it would just end up hurting her more than it's worth. Im scared to ever be that close to anyone again, because I know the toxicity I'm capable of. Its an awful feeling when you're a good person that keeps causing so much pain because you just want to know that the people in your life aren't just pretending."

173,Accidentally enabled my sister to share self-harm content,"My sister (14, I'm 20) makes art that's usually pretty creepy and sometimes leans onto horror, and she often asks me to crop and send back pictures for her to post. Last night, I was with a friend watching a movie, so I pretty preoccupied- and she sent me new art. I saw that it was violent and gory, there was blood, but I didn't take a good look at it until she actually posted it with an added trigger warning. Realizing that, I feel awful for enabling that, because even with a TW prefacing it, that content could have reached little kids and her peers, and I'm sure posting and dwelling on that kind of stuff isn't good for her either. I just wish I noticed that she made art depicting self-harm right off the bat, and I wasn't distracted. I usually take more time to look at her art because she's great at what she does, but for some reason she caught me when I was seemingly too occupied. I know she struggled with this, so I should have been caught off guard as soon I saw blood, but I wasn't. My mom saw the art since my sister used her phone to take the pictures, and now she's deleting my sister's instagram. She is in therapy, and because of this my mom is going to make sure she gets help for this too. I never had to really struggle with anything like she is, so I'm trying to be more of an ally and protector for my sister than anything, which obviously I have failed at in this instance. I feel awful about my carelessness and again, I wish I noticed it sooner so I could have talked to her about it instead of allowing her to share this stuff on social media."
174,"My fiancé thinks I don’t want him after 13 years together, and doesn’t believe me when I say I do","For context, we’ve been together for 13 years and our wedding keeps getting delayed thanks to covid.

We have a great relationship, we’re best friends, we run a business together and we’re in love. Everything is open and full of trust which is why this situation is so confusing for me. 

I have sometimes debilitating generalised and social anxiety and it gets in the way of me showing affection and of course my desire to have sex.

He suffers from anxiety related to health anxiety but he is on medication so he is handling it.

His idea of a healthy sexual relationship is having sex every day. My idea is sex 2-3x a week.

Every time we get in a “rut” - read: over 3 days - he brings up his discontent and worry that I “don’t want him” or find him attractive.

He has always suffered with low self esteem physically (appearance), where as I have low self esteem mentally (am I interesting/smart etc). We both comfort each other knowing we love each other and are a great boost to each other’s confidence.

He brought up tonight that he thinks I don’t want him and it’s been like this for “over 5 months”

It’s midnight right now and I’ve had one of those days where I cry at the drop of a hat, so when he brought it up tonight for the first time in months, right as we were turning lights off for bed, i instantly exploded in tears and called him unfair... and I probably didn’t help the situation by yelling and saying that he shouldn’t go to bed and bring something like this up so out of the blue.

I can’t shake the fact that this came out of nowhere especially because I’ve been working on my anxiety and how it affects my desire to want sex. In my mind I’ve been making progress in the last few weeks, but slower than I’d like due to being in lockdown for a really long time. It’s been a transparent effort and I had no idea he thought this the entire time. It honestly does not link with the conversations we’ve been having of late.


He’s gone to sleep somehow but I just can’t sleep and have been on the couch crying for an hour.

We usually iron out these issues in the morning, we’ll have makeup sex and all is forgotten but this time he sounded even more convinced that I don’t care about him.

It breaks my heart because it’s just not the case. I really don’t know how to prove something I thought I was already doing :(

Any advice or similar situations would be appreciated."

I've suffered from what I think is depression for a long time now, I always feel out of place and I have a lot of trouble to interact with people therefore i dont have many friends. The thought of me dying, be it by my hand or just an act of destiny has been there in my mind for years, and I've never talked about it to anyone. Truth be told, this quarantine has taken a huge toll on my mental health and this though has become more and more present. I think I'm on the limit of what i can handle, so after thinking it for a long time i've decided i want to share this with my best friend, as I know he is someone I can trust, but still, I am afraid at the same time as I feel that him knowing this will be a burden to him.

So that brings us to this post, can someone give me advice on if i should and if so, how should I do this?

When it first happened, I handled it the worst way that anyone probably could, I denied, called the person a liar, said that I would off myself if they got the police Involved because I know I wouldn’t be able to handle the stress, and it was really bad, but I didn’t know how to handle the situation otherwise.

Everyone involved and I have talked things out, and nothing is going to happen, but I still feel terrible.

Everyday I have flashbacks that leads to severe stress and anxiety, I’m unable to look myself in the mirror, because the day I was accused, the accuser called me god awful things that still sticks with me, I can’t trust people anymore, I can’t do the thing thag comforts me the most anymore, it all seems useless.

186,No friends,"Hi. 
It seems like I can't make friends. True ones. That invite you to their place to chill or talk about whatever.

Every time I think I'm going somewhere, that I'm joining ""the gang"", they just punch me in the back with pictures of dinners on social media where I wasn't invited to. (Yes, even with Covid). 

The people I'm precisely talking about are all my coworkers. My boyfriend works there too. He even went to a work trip with them, so they had the chance to get to know them ""for real"", had fun, drank beers. But still, every single person is invited to activities, but us. It hurts. 

Maybe I'm the weird, the person that causes it all. I remember my ""friends"" drawing pictures of me with knifes and blood back in primary school. It's not a new situation for me. I thought I had friends in high school but I was just invited because one particular person had pity for me. She ended up being something that we can call a friend, but she moved away and don't talk often anymore, because of that. I'm starting to believe that I might be the problem now.

Thank for coming to my talk."

I have bouts of extreme emotions. It's very random and short duration. But I lose complete control during these ""phases"". I'm scared. I dont want to hurt anyone. Nor myself. I cut myself twice without knowing what I was doing. It wasnt a deep cut but yea there was some blood. My thoughts are jumbled and I'm not feeling great. I thought I would post some of the things im going through before I let go. Well thanks for listening to my sad rant about something that doesnt matter!"

193,Guilty Conscience preventing me from receiving adequate mental health care,"I started mental health treatment with a psychologist who was amazing. During treatment he recommended me to a Psychiatrist who I also believe is an amazing doctor and absolutely love. A few years back my Psychologist retired which sucked immensely. My Psychiatrist agreed to also take on the psychotherapy role in absence of my Psychologist after he retired.

So here is the problem. I am prescribed adderal, which I sell most of what I am prescribed every month because I lack self discipline and really need the money. I know what I am doing is wrong in every way. I hate that I do it and wish I didn't, but every month those bills keep coming around the corner and every month I sell some. I feel so guilty that I sell my prescription that its hindering my ability to truly open up to my Psychiatrist about anything, even things that have absolutely nothing to do with selling adderal. Even after years of seeing him the guilt keeps me from sharing anything too deep. I am receiving medication for depression which definitely helps but I know from experience that medicine alone is not the cure all for problems. From personal experience coping skills learned through Psychotherapy are move valuable than anything a pill can offer.

​

I know its not right but I do not want to lose my adderal scripts because 1. I do take them when needed (but do not always need them) 2. The income defiantly helps. Yes I know I am trying to have my cake and eat it too.

So barring what is right and what is wrong my question is this: Can I see a Psychologist and tell them this information without them contacting my Psychiatrist and telling them what I am doing? If I could just spill the beans on myself maybe I could finally get some mental relief and work to the root causes of all these problems."
194,Crush,"Seven months ago I get crush on my classmate. Even I know we won't be together, the first two months were a nightmare. 

Every day I got up early in the morning and thought about her right away. It took me even 4 hours to eat breakfast or another meal (I lost my appetite), I spent the whole day listening to music and I didn't feel like anything. I feel a kind of 'fear' and I don't know why (maybe because I know we'll never be together). But the schools were closed because of COVID, so I managed to get back to normal life after \~3 months.

Since the schools opened, my problems have returned. I see her again every day and I don't know what to do anymore. I would like to forget about her, but it is impossible if I see her again tomorrow. 

This has become a tiresome for me and I have no strength to live like this. What I am supposed to do?"

198,Something is wrong.,"So basically, for the past month I've been having some health issues. These issues could be caused by cancer and for the entire time it's been effecting me I've been stressed to hell. I went to the doctors for a physical and they could see anything wrong there and said if it kept bothering me to come back. Part of the problem is I don't have health insurance yet and I'm in the process of getting it. So that physical is gunna cost me money out of my pocket. I over think things so much and stress myself out with what I could be. So much so that I get violently sick sometimes. Most days I'm scared and sad and I don't want to put my family through me having cancer and stuff.

Sorry for this post not being coherent. I just need somewhere to vent my problem.

TLDR: I think I might have cancer and I've been really stressed from it."

I’m doing better with doing my work this year, but I’m literally below grade level math now because I stopped doing BOTH math classes last. I’m supposed to be in trig or calc, but I’m in geometry instead because I decided to be lazy and also dissociation got in the way a bit.

202,Awakenings- Dr. Sacks 1960s Trials and Combatting Parkinson's,"In *Awakenings*, one of the top selling non-fiction books of all time, we take a trip to Mt. Carmel, NY and meet post-encephalatic patients reviewing their life from a vessel which they’ve been trapped in. Dr. Sacks was one of the leading researchers in the fight against Parkinson’s being the first to have assembled a history of the disease. In order to combat this amalgamation of malfunctions, Shock said the medical community needs to combine resources and focus attention on finding causes rather than treating side effects. Like a leukemia patient mustering every bit of strength and technology within their means to rid themselves of cancer, the pharmaceutical industry would need to unite to put to rest this end of life mental degeneration. This book accounts the introduction of L-DOPA a dopamine antagonizer that revitalized catatonic patients to a level of youth they didn't know was within them. Before an age where 1/8 of people are on antidepressants, Dr. Sacks found the key to a healthy sustainable life is holding onto that enlightenment and continuously refining the sense of self.

203,"I want to get better, but I don't know how to","I don't know how to describe my mental state. I have anxiety, that's pretty obvious, I struggle to talk to people because I get stuck trying to talk like a regular person, but it's just not something I know how to do so I end up getting stuck on certain words or saying something that doesn't make sense. I also think I have something like psuedo-depression, if that's the right thing to call it? Things feel pretty hopeless and I often think about what I could've done to avoid my current life, but I don't have a want to hurt or kill myself and I wouldn't say I genuinely hate myself, I just find myself annoying.

Anyway, onto the reason I titled this post what I did. I have a very small group of friends spread over two locations, one of which is 100 miles away and is hard to visit given covid and such. Overall I'd say I have roughly 10 people I'd call friends and of those 10 maybe 2 or 3 that are close friends, in addition I've never had a girlfriend which is something that I want to do in the not too distant future by bettering myself mentally. 

I've set myself a goal to try and socialise, by choice (i.e not at work), at least once a week. The issue with this is, I find it really difficult to meet new people as I don't like places with large crowds and I struggle talking to new people even when it is a quieter setting. Like I say my friend group is limited so I don't want to be a burden to them and make them like they're all I've got, plus I want to meet new people anyway. 

Do you think this is a good way to help give my life direction, help me out of my position and, if so, how would you go about it? where are some good places to meet new people easily, especially with the covid situation. 

Thanks all."
204,Submitting myself to a mental health hospital,"I might actually get an appointment with the GP and get an assessment to see if I'm applicable to get treatment in a mental health hospital but I'm really losing my grip on reality. Is it worth the struggle?

Always struggled with my mental health since I was 11, I'm 18 now and I'm just...I don't know what to do anymore honestly, I've gotten professional treatment at a clinic, personal help from a friend, but no matter what I do, I always end up in the same old miserable place in my mind. 

I found myself thinking of suicide a lot more these past few months and it's starting to make me feel that sickness again, like the sick feeling you get in your brain when you do something messed up. I'm really nervous to speak to someone, I get so nervous talking over the phone too, but I really want to get better, I don't want to feel sick anymore."
205,"I have ""worldview intrusive thoughts"" every day and I am super checking everything I read or hear - What are your tips to cope with this?","Pre-cap: I am 22, and I've developed OCD since I was like 16 and something. Being in love at 15/16 has fcked up my hormones (if I saw that girl back then it felt literally like a punch in your stomach and my knees were weak like jelly). Before that I was a normal boy without ANY OCD

**Worldview intrusive thoughts**

I do not want to say what my worldviews are specifically to not start a debate here. 

But just for the sake of the example, let's say, someone has communistic views. He then hears some, for him, good or at least interesting arguments ""Why communism doesn't work"" and so on. He then cannot find peace until he finds a good counter argument to be ""in equilibrium"" again. It seems sometimes so hopeless to find a counter argument that he literally gets nihilistic that ""what's the point being here if communism doesn't work?"", but the more is his joy if he finds a counter argument for himself

I am not a communist, this is just an example. But this is what I feel like if my worldview is challenged. It's like I can't keep cool or something. It doesn't have to be political, it can be philosophical, teological, whatever.

I once tried to simply tell myself ""Maybe the counterpart is right, who knows, maybe yes maybe no"". It worked, until I started to think things like ""Maybe I'm dumb, maybe not, who knows"" and it ended with a nervous breakdown when I came down to ""Maybe the world i see is what it is, maybe not, maybe it's just a simulation, nobody knows, maybe your red is redder than mine, nobody knows"". So this coping mechanism will not work for me.

**Super Checking Everything**

As I am a height challenged guy, I literally get obssessed with sentences containing the words ""short, shot, shoot, tall, tail, tale, tell, little, big, large, small, etc"". I firstly make sure that I've read it correctly, and then think about the context of the sentence. 

I also check other normal words ocassionally, or if ""there's not a . or something else left if you go to the very right or very left of a sentence where's the background usually"". 

The same checking goes for listening to videos - I usually go like 15 times back with the left arrow key on YouTube just ""to get it right""

I am just afraid that I'll not read or hear anything and that the context I'll be missing would be insulting me, like my height or nationality or something else. Also I just don't like to not know things, because it feels like a little voice inside of me tells me that ""ha ha you forgot what Homer Simpson said at 10:24 min in the ""Homer loves Ned"" episode)

I also check doors and lights a lot, or if there runs no water in the sink by pressing the faucet multiple times

I'm pretty bad at the whole counseling thing and have no idea how to help her. She always had solutions to whatever mess I was in, and it kills me that I can't return the favor to her. All I know how to help her is saying ""things will get better"" and pretty sure that's not remotely enough.

210,Beat COVID with your mind and body,"COVID-19 is putting stress on everybody, and patients like us with mental conditions are particularly vulnerable.

We have to educate ourselves to be aware of symptoms as they arise:

211,Am I wrong for not wanting to live with my sister who's suffering from mental health issues?,"I'm 27M (gay if that helps), and my sister is 30F. We're both single. She's been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and has had depressive episodes intermittently for over a decade. 

The thing is, my sister is extremely unsociable. She's been fired often from jobs, and is often in conflict with her bosses or coworkers. She also has episodes every few weeks (sometimes more often) where she becomes extremely verbally abusive and sometimes physically violent as well. We've got no other family, and not much money either. So I've kind of become my sister's keeper, if that makes sense. I love her, but the truth is, I've wanted to move out since I was 18, and it's never happened because I know she's got no one else and she can't be alone. I've come to a point where I've accepted that I'm gonna probably live with her for the rest of my life. I wouldn't mind that, if only not for the times when she gets aggressive. She's generally negative and hates everything and everyone. I feel it's affected my mental health and I haven't been able to have any long lasting romantic relationships because I'm pretty messed up as well. (I feel I can't blame her entirely for my issues as that's pushing blame.)

For the last year or so, I have been feeling more resentful towards her with every passing day. I know that's terrible of me because she's a good person and it's the disorder that makes her this way. But I can't help think how I'm missing out on a normal life and a shot at happiness. I've been feeling low, have distanced myself from all friends, and have had suicidal thoughts (but I would never actually do it). I also know it will break my sister completely if I left her. I don't know what to do.


P.S.: With what I earn, I can't afford therapy for myself. Just paying for my sister's therapy and psychiatric meds is difficult to manage."
212,What works for me when I'm in the midst of feeling anxiety/panic,"I wanted to share this technique because it has helped me so much. 

It's called 5-4-3-2-1 and how it works is, whenever you begin to feel anxiety or panic coming on, in your head or out loud you:

1. Name 5 things you see
2. Name 4 things you hear
3. Name 3 things that you feel, physically (example: I feel my feet on the floor)
4. Name 2 things that you smell
5. Name 1 thing you taste

It's so simple, but so effective. I find that it works better than other mindfulness techniques, when I'm feeling really intense anxiety. It gives my mind just enough to do and it really brings me back into my body and the present moment. 

If you want a demo, I put together a super short video, you can see it here: [https://youtu.be/IpG4sgF21pQ](https://youtu.be/IpG4sgF21pQ)

I want to know if this is related to any mental disorder as I have other mental disorders too. 

the personality traits :

Has created entire anthologies of imaginary events.

Inner monologues has become my entire reality.

Has no interest in any career, just wants to think.

Imagines success to cope instead of actually achieving it.

Imagines what is would be like to start life over with everything he's learned.

214,Am I being overly sensitive?,"I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for years, and recently I've started hearing things that aren't there. It ranges from voices to music and I've told my closest friends about it so I can check with them if things are real or not. Just telling them took a lot of effort and trust and I made it clear that it wasn't a joking matter.

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist recently taught me trick where if I cover my ears and the music/voices are still there, then it's most likely not real. I told my friends about it because they asked why I kept covering my ears and the way one of them responded really messed me up. Effectively she said ""maybe it's just a placebo effect because you believe that method works. There's no way to know for certain"". I straight up had to leave because I freaked out so badly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Was it fair for her to say something like that? Did she mean to mess me up that badly? I can't figure out if I'm just being overly sensitive or not. Thanks in advance for any advice.

215,"I don't feel like taking my meds, which is insane","I know this is completely nuts, but when I wake up in the mornings, I just don't feel like taking my meds. It doesn't happen when I'm on a schedule, but I'm currently in quarantine with nothing to do and nowhere to go, and seriously depressed, meaning that even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing it anyway. And I don't just take antidepressants (which aren't working, by the way), I also take a med for chronic GI issues and, more importantly, meds for my epilepsy, which I need in order to *prevent seizures* (obviously). The point is, my other meds are important, but they won't kill me. (I don't have suicidal tendencies, so my depression won't.) A seizure isn't going to cause my death or something, but falling and hitting my head hard enough or falling when I'm near a busy road could. Like I said, I know not taking my meds--especially when they're sitting *on my bed, with a water bottle*\--is completely nuts, but knowing that hasn't seemed to help. I just... Can't. I need to go out and buy groceries and meds, but if I haven't been sleeping well (which I haven't) *and* I've been taking my meds irregularly (which I have), I could put myself in serious danger by going out. So I just stay inside. Then I get more depressed, then I eat even less and forget my meds even more, etcetera, etcetera. I'm just... done. I'm not planning on hurting myself or anything, I'm just so tired of all this. So tired."
216,Just need to vent,"Hi,

So lately I've been having a really hard time. I had a bad sexual experience about 2 weeks ago where I was pressured into doing things I didn't really want to do (I consented out of fear) and he was doing drugs, however I managed to get out and thought that was it. However I then started noticing rashes and red bumps on my genitals and I've been absolutely freaking out. I got onto my doctor and he gave me some cream which hasn't done much, so I now have to sort out an appointment with a sexual health clinic, with the probability that I have herpes. This has caused me immense stress and has really made me mad at myself, extremely anxious and panicky (especially when the symptoms flare up) and has destroyed my confidence. I can't sleep, and have had suicidal thoughts several times. I'm just really worried for my future, like how am I ever meant to get into a relationship and find someone to love if I have this? Especially since it is incurable. So thats one things that been extremely stressful.

Additionally, I started my new placement (i'm a student) last week, and so far it has been pretty stressful. It's a small studio (8 people) and we are producing a product to sell at the end of the year, but there have been quite a few issues so far with people not getting along at all, ideas and people being ignored etc. I thankfully am not really too involved in this drama, but obviously it still affects me. Anyway, this week (last tuesday to today) we were producing a small product just to see how things go, and it crashed and burned. In the end we had nothing to present and there were several very heated arguments. Thankfully people seemed to really like my work and everybody praised me at the end (not trying to sound cocky or anything just literally recalling what happened) so I have that going for me, but that along side the sexual health situation has just completely stressed me out and I feel like screaming.

Thirdly, my friends have been really upset due to one of the friends (lets call him A) basically calling one of the other friends (B) horrible things, and really causing alot of arguments. Person B is understandably upset, but what really makes it worse is how two of my friends in the friendship group are living with person A. Therefore, they are having to find a new person to live with because person A is going to move out, but this happened literally 2 weeks after most students signed their contracts so its a real struggle. This again is causing Person B to really suffer (I live with person B) and understandably the whole friendship group is having a really hard time. I have really bad anxiety issues, and when theres conflict or drama my first response is to just shut down - my brain stops thinking and I become zombie like so that has again, really not helped everything else.

Finally, I really hate dating. Each time I find someone that I like, and want to get to know better, I just fuck it up and I don't know why. Like, everytime I just dont seem to be attractive to them, or they get to know me and leave or something and I just hate it! I try my best to be spontaneous and fun, to be caring and to listen to them and just try to be myself but each time it has gone wrong and I don't get it. It's like i'm turning them off and I don't understand why, like perhaps i'm just putting signals out there that i'm unavailable or something? The last couple of guys that i've liked and got to know better just stopped wanting anything to do with me after a month or two, and now that theres this whole herpes thing I just feel doomed to be alone. Additionally, i'm developing feelings for one of my coworkers and he is giving me so many mixed signals I just cannot tell what is what with him. Like I really wish I just wasn't developing feelings for him at all, its just making things worse. 

Oftentimes I just wish like I was never born, or that I could skip ahead a few years until shit is sorted out"

218,Fear of new experiences?,"Not sure if it’s the appropriate sub to ask this question, but have any of you do the same?!

I feel so tense and uncomfortable watching new movies/tv series, I am more like rewatching old stuff that I have seen for thousand times and I can’t figure out why. As if my brain is rejecting to be receptive to new information/experience (that manifests in clinging to safe films/series/cafes). Maybe I am afraid of new experiences (I know that pattern of myself, it’s very hard for me to adapt to quickly changing circumstances), or maybe I am not curious enough which bugs me cause I do feel like I am ambitious person which a bit contradicts being not curious?

220,My emotions have been messed with so much 16m,"1. My ex girlfriend abused me mentally, i thought maybe I was just being stupid but after hearing what some people have said she was definetly abusing me. 

2. I got sexually assaulted, nobody believed me, ""just tell someone"" yeah I did and guess what, nothing happened, she did it multiple times, she was much older than me and nobody did anything to help, I told everyone I could and she got away with it

3. After not being in a relationship for a few years I've been pretty lonely, today I got a message from a girl saying she liked me, I was so happy I thought I finally could feel good again, but no, she was just ""joking around"" and didn't actually like me.

Everything's the same everyday, wake up, go to school, go home, play games by myself, and go to bed, everything just feels depressing.

I don't believe its for the rush of getting away with stealing (I do get one but it comes with so much anxiety) but I use materialism as a coping mechanism as items tend to bring me joy. I usually steal things I really want, like clothes or little things here and there or snacks. I figured I'd be saving money on all my stupid impulse buys to get the 'rush' from that. Yesterday I put on an expensive cardigan and some sunglasses at Target and walked out while wearing them and when I got home after the high wore down I was sweating from anxiety because I felt like such a horrible person, I don't want any retail employees to get in trouble cause of me. I know I'm just going to keep doing it again and again and I wanna stop."
231,I just went home from my first therapy,"And i feel horrible. The therapist was good and everything, but i can't move on from the fact that someone know so much about me. I'm so scared he's gonna tell my parents who signed me there, cuz they were worried about me. I feel so bad that i opened up. Please help is that normal? I dunno if it's good idea to go there again. Does anybody feel this way too? Should i go there again? I feel really bad right now"
232,will i ever be good enough for anything xxx lol xxx just girly things xxx,pls end my suffering 🤪🤪🤪
233,Happiness Is KEY,"Day 15 of **Suicide Prevention Month**. We are halfway through! 

What is happiness? When was the last time you felt happy, if ever? 

**Happiness** = the state of being happy. 

Do you see that definition? The STATE of being happy. Does it say that you have to be happy continuity? No. Do you know why? It’s impossible to be. You’re not going to be happy 24/7, 7 days a week. It doesn’t work out like that. If that was the case, the World would be in a perfect condition and not in the state it’s currently in. But, that’s for another day... 

You’re more than likely lurking and posting on this sub due to lack of **happiness**. You’re simply not a happy person. In fact, you’re suffering, hurting and at times, on the verge of tears. I get that. I understand you. Believe you me, if you’re looking for happiness by lurking/posting on this particular sub, it’s going to take a while for happiness to come to you. Or, as usual, for some people, the feelings of happiness comes and goes. Today, you may be happy for approximately 2 hours and then unhappy for the other 22 hours. The next day, it could be the opposite. We cannot tell when we are going to be happy or not. Usually, we can feel it when waking up in the morning. You’ll either wake up to the sunshine shining through your window, the smell of freshly cut grass, the comfiness of your cushions and the feeling of relaxation. **Or** you wake up in the morning to worrying thoughts, signs of regret, a hatred for yourself, not wanting to leave the bed and locking yourself in the bedroom. 

We all wish to be happy every single day, every single second. But, that’s not the case. We get good days, but we all get our fair share of bad days. For some people, in a year, they’ll get roughly 75% bad days and 25% good days, it’s rare for them. In today’s post, I will share some tips and advice on ways to be happier, even it if lifts your mood up a little. I sincerely hope some of these will help you out and if so, carry on doing them. :) 

**Never Forget To Enjoy Yourself**

Life was made for enjoyment. Life was made for laughter and having fun. But, at the end of the day, we don’t experience it all times. As previously said, many people don’t experience it at all. One way of finding the true happiness inside of you is trying to find enjoyment in anything you do. If you’re suffering from depression or mental health, I understand that this will be extremely difficult for you. You will start to lose interest on the things/activities you’ve loved for years, you will simply lose interest. When you feel ready to do so, find an activity you’ve always wanted to try or give a go. By doing so, not only will you find enjoyment in it but you will learn at the same time. :) Doing the things you enjoy is brilliant for your emotional wellbeing. This can be the simplest of activities such as walking, watching TV, listening to music, reading and many more. Anything! 

**Become A Healthier Person**

Nobody wants to wake up in the morning, looking into the mirror and not be impressed at what’s looking back at them. This will heavily damage your confidence. Instead, start a healthy lifestyle ASAP. Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to run 500miles today, so breathe! When it comes to having a more healthy lifestyle, you have to start off slow then build up your progress, whenever you feel ready for it to grow. For example, today, throw out all the junk foods you have in your cupboard, replace them with healthy fruit and vegetables. Whenever you’re hungry in the day, instead of eating a chocolate bar, replace it with a banana or an apple! Secondly, after a few weeks of healthy eating and you feel better within yourself, it’ll then be time to start exercising. If I was in your position, I would start with a very easy exercise to build yourself up. For example,  a slow relaxing walk. Personally, I enjoy walks where nobody is about, that sense of freedom and the fresh air hitting you in the face. Lovely! If you’re not comfortable going for a walk or a run when people are about, you can either go for an evening run (if it’s dark, remember to wear high vis jacket!) or a morning run (which can be very nice), it will wake you up and get you ready for the day ahead. Once you get used to eating healthy and starting a slow exercise programme, it’ll then be time to up it a little. Instead of walking, go for a slow job and so on. Exercising takes time, if you can’t see any Improves, don’t worry about it, it’s all about patience and you’ll eventually get to where you plan on being. :) 

**Keep Your Busy**

As they say, busier, the better! Although researchers say that becoming busy shows the feeling of “rushed” which could possibly make you more stressed and unhappy, keeping your busy will also keep your thoughts and worries out of your head for the time being. Studies have suggested that balancing your free time is key, at times it can lead to boredom. Your target should being having a productive life at a comfortable pace. Constantly being busy is no good, constantly having free time, is no good, it’s time to balance it. Add 1 and 1 together, you’ll get the perfect answer. As previously said, when you’ve made yourself busy, for example: cleaning the house, it’ll give your mind some rest as it will be focusing more on cleaning the house, rather than having dark thoughts and think of past mistakes and regrets. Make yourself busy! 

**Self-Talk**

One of my personal favourites. Sure, it sounds a little crazy but having mini conversations with yourself throughout the day can help you greatly. Let me say, I don’t have a FULL ON conversation with myself.. “Hey”, “Hey”, “How are you?”, “Good thanks you”, not like that! Sell-Talk is a good way to motivate yourself whenever you’re feeling down or anxious. Say a few words to yourself here and there, you don’t have to say it out loud, say it under your breath, if you may. For example, if you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning, tell yourself “I’ll get through it today”, “I will overcome this” or “I’m stronger than this”. A little words to yourself can help you throughout the days. When all said and done, YOU are there for yourself at all times, YOU have your own back and YOU know exactly how YOU feel. 

**Family Time Is Best Time**

I don’t know about you, but spending time with my family is the greatest thing in the world. I adore them and I always will. That being said, if you have strong love for your family, then what should you do? You’ve got it, spend more time around them. Family members are there to make you feel safe and secured. They will always be there for you no matter what. Unfortunately, some people no longer have their family members and my heart goes out to you, but this can also work for friends. Nobody’s said that friends can’t be your family too. A true friend will look out for you and be there for you whenever you need them. Instead of locking yourself in your room, eating Cheetos and watching Netflix in the dark, phone up a friend, talk to a friend over social media and when the pandemic is finally over, go and meet a few of them (don’t forget your mask!). Family and friends can make you feel great, especially when it’s full of smiling and laughter. It’s the best medicine! 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you very much for reading, I hope you learned a thing or 2! In life, the #1 priority for everyone should be happiness. When you’ve experienced happiness, you never want to lose it. But if you do, which you will, do everything in your power to get it back. If you’re in any need of further help, guidance or some support, feel free to message me at anytime. My PM’s are open for you needs, I look forward to hearing from you. Cheerio! 😊"
234,Is it normal to completely lose all motivation for no reason?,I'm just curious. This happens on at least a weekly basis and I was just wondering if this is normal or not
235,A note on messy homes,"Hey everyone, 
just wanted to say a couple of words about something on my mind lately. 
My flatmate has been struggeling with PTSD and is now away at a therapy center. 
Before she left i was mainly doing the household chores as she had terrible days where even getting up was a struggle. She was constantly apologizing even though i told her it was fine. 
So here's my word out to you. 
It's okay if the biggest thing you managed to do today was make your bed or brush your teeth or whatever little thing. 
You are not a burden, you're doing the best you can, no matter your home circumstance. 
The most important thing is that you keep trying and accept a helping hand without feeling crap about it. 
And if the people around you don't say it enough: you matter and are loved"
236,My (27m) schizophrenic boyfriend (20m) doesn't want to take his meds any more; thinking of leaving him,[removed]

I needed to tell my gf, that i love a fictional girl more then her...
She said:""it's OK and I should not worry"" but I am afraid that she lied and wants to leave me.
My mentional problems are also making me worries, I don't feel good every second day, and she is helping me when she has time, but what is when it gets to much for her?
I just hope that she will stay whit me...
And if not, that can end terrible"
238,Being insecure about my concerns ab my mental health and lack of motivation (rambling),"Since I (17F) started being more aware and concerned about my mental health, I've also become really insecure about even thinking about it because sometimes I feel like I'm just overreacting. I keep thinking that ""it's not a big deal, a lot of people feel stressed"" and that ""it could be because this is my last year in highschool and I'm just stressed out"". I really want to see a therapist to finally get an answer but I'm terrified of them telling me something like ""you don't seem to have any problems regarding your mental health"" because then, how do I justify feeling so unmotivated and lazy the past month? (not that I know anything about how therapists and diagnoses work) I have been a good student all my life and this happening so suddenly at such an important time is terryifying. In previous years I have felt like ""oh I'm getting tired of studying"" but never to this extent?? Could it be that my body and mind are tired from years of consistently working hard? That it's an accumulation of negative feelings? But that sounds ridiculous, I've just never heard of something like this happen to anyone. During august this was less of a problem because we didn't have school every day, but now I'm even more scared of not being able to complete my schoolwork simply because I cannot sit down and do it. 
And the most scary thing is, what if I'm simply lazy? How do I even change that? Because I really don't think I can do it on my own at this point... My teachers are always demanding things from us and telling us to just, you know, do the work that we have to do??? But it's so so hard for me to do that. My parents have always been supporting of me and they still support me, but at this point it feels like we're disconnected when it comes to this because I'm taking a diploma that is very different to the one they completed. So asking them for help feels like a bother when it comes to certain things like essays. 
I'm just rambling at this point but I'm so scared of disappointing my teachers who have faith in me because last year I was a very good student. And I also absolutely do not want to stay behind in any of the work that we have to complete because it'll be a nightmare to catch up later on and I don't know if I'll have the energy to do that in the following months... I really want to get good grades like last year or even get better grades than that, in order to get to the university that I want, but it feels like it's becoming more and more impossible now that I'm like this all of a sudden"
239,my mental health is in shambles.,"my boyfriend and i both have bpd. we’ve always been a bit volatile. i guess we have both treated each other poorly. he has cheated on me, but i forgave him. he has abandoned me. and ghosted and gaslit me, and i forgave him. he is now saying i am gaslighting him. i can openly admit i’ve been so dismissive of his feelings.... i disgust myself. i try talking to him and explaining myself but i usually turn it into an argument. for example, i expect a lot of him. like to retrieve things if i ever am sitting, which is so often as i am lazy. expecting prompt replies to messages, doing dirty work for me that i prefer not to, expecting essentially to be pampered. he had been saying he didnt mind, but the truth is i’m a lazy fuck and he hates it. i need to support myself. 

recently i’ve really been bad. almost anything that comes out of his mouth i disagree with. my moods swing between bitterness and anger, to sudden, almost manic happiness and hyper. back to pissed or sad. he tries so hard not to hurt my feelings, but i still get offended. the biggest issue is i still view myself as correct in a lot of situations, but have conceeded that my brain must be lying. 

i have been having memory lapses. my grip on reality is loosening. i have false memories and things that apparently happened that i have little or no recollection of. i can barely be civil to people, but they are all so fucking annoying!!!

my boyfriend and i are soul mates. i choose him. we have decided to go through this life thick or thin. the transfressions he’s made have been fully forgiven. his actions were a result of his mental illness, just like me. when my mental health is stable, the steady love i feel for him is insane and beautiful and real. i know i just need to fix myself to get through this. but i don’t know how. i have a therapist but i dont think she understands how severe my situation is. i’m afraid to tell her i have been plagued with thoughts of self harm to relieve my internal pain. i don’t want an ambulance sent to me. i don’t want to admit i have self harmed, even if i dont consider it major. 

my boyfriend told me we need space. a few days away from each other. it’s been a while since we have been. he thinks i should go to the hospital. do you agree?? should i go inpatient? my mom is encouraging me to reach out to my therapist. i’m scared to go and not have access to my phone, vape, or weed. i don’t really know that it will help me as a lot of the root of my problems lays in the structure or our society. i am in the US for context. i could really use some advice. thank you."
240,Parental pressure to get a job,I’m in my last year of high school and my younger brother got a job a while ago and my parents are pressuring me to get a job. They know I’m too stupid to get passed an interview they know I have crippling social anxiety that makes me too anxious to even pay at a cash register. What am I even supposed to say at an interview when they ask for skills or something? Lie? I have no skills and I’m a terrible liar. I have bad posture and terrible at presenting my self. I stumble and stutter my words a lot and even if I somehow fake my confidence that would still ruin everything. Am I basically screwed for the rest of my life? If I can’t get a job now because I’m too stupid and anxious then how can I function in the future? Should I just end my wasteful life?
241,How do you combat negative self-talk about being a loser and a failure when you *actually are* a loser and a failure?!,"I'm thinking maybe find small ways to be of use to the world, like feed stray cats. Any other ideas?"
242,What happened to me today?,"Im not lookin for some diagnosis, maybe just some clarity. 

Im a GCSE student and weve just come back to school to find everything is fucked, especially my year. Its been a week and were getting heaps and heaps of work. Anyway i had three assignments due for the next day, and managed to do two and just try and not care about the third. However to even manage to complete them i had to wake up at 5 and work till 8. I went to bed at 12... 

This is still more sleep than ive been getting recently anyway so i thought id be fine. Anyway im coasting through the day with a sleep deprivation headache that i dealt with fine. And we get to the final lesson, geography. Geography is known to do two things to me, 1) put me to sleep, and 2) make me not care about anyone or anything. But when i got into the lesson i felt so fucking stressed out that i couldnt help but maniacally laugh for a solid 20 mins at different things. When i finally got myself under control i felt so embarrased and just confused at what just happened that i started crying. Mid class. Im a silent crier because my body cant take the idea of showing other people my weaknesses, so there i was silently crying and i suddenly realise the absurdity of it all. Its just one fucking day i thought. 

So there i was, laughing again like its no bodys business and i feel genuinely insane. And when i say maniacally laughing i mean uncontrollable, joker-esque laugh. 

What happened to me today?"
243,Depression story,
244,Therapist wants to send me to hospital for psych evaluation,"Hi all,

I just started therapy for my depression and already my therapist is wanting to send me to a hospital. She says she feels I’m a danger to myself and others and she’d prefer I start medicine management quickly by going to a psychiatric hospital. 

She told me I can choose to go by myself or she’d call local police. 

I cannot financially afford a hospital, I have no one to care for my pets and I can’t afford to lose my job. 

If I go to my hospital emergency room for psych evaluation at my therapist request, are they going to send me to an actual psychiatric hospital? 

I’m depressed but Jesus... going to a psychiatric hospital and falling behind in bills would drive me insane."
245,How do i know im having a panic attack/anxiety attack??,"I think ive been haviny panic/anxiety attacks recently but im not sure, i just know i feel awful"
246,What are some options to normal therapy?,"
I’ve tried normal therapy and I don’t really feel like it have helped me that much, and I want to look into some options to ‘normal therapy’ (talking one-to-one with a psychologist). 

I don’t really know that much about what alternatives etc. there are yet, so if anyone has any tips and suggestions on what I could try/what helped you, please let me know in the comments :)"
247,I don't know who I am anymore,"I seriously don't. All I have Is a name, a face and a collection of brief moments of ""oh, maybe that's what I enjoy doing."" But the honest truth is that I don't know what or who I am. I must be Jon snow because it appears that I know nothing. I don't know what I enjoy. I know what I do, but not what I enjoy. I don't enjoy much of anything these days.  I don't seem to care about my friends for which there are few in number and far in proximity. I don't know what it is I understand more so than others do nor do I think I have the energy to find out. 

All I do know is that I simply exist. I have no traits; no defining characteristics that I can recognise and truly call my own. I feel like an imitation. A shadow cast in the shape of someone else yet never something so easily confined or understood. The truth of the matter is that I have no identity. I exist as a blank slate: A cup, waiting to be filled with whatwver convenient truth needs to be swallowed. For my mother I'm a young adult focusing on his education. For my friends I'm a kind, yet somewhat aloof individual with an intense interest for the unknown and a passion for things yet to be understood yet I never actually believe any of these pre-packaged versions of myself. 

Perhaps I am both? I don't know. As anhedonia sinks it's dull teeth into every waking inch of my existence it becomes harder and harder to understand what it is I may even be, let alone what I can become."
248,I'm at the end of my rope,"Hi. I dont exactly know what to say. 
I'm 22 years old. I've been struggling with depression since I was 13, but have had ups and downs. Well I'm currently in a massive down. I just keep laying in bed crying. All I can think about is standing on the bridge. 
I'm so alone. I live alone. I'm single. I hardly have any friends and even then I feel too guilty to burden them with my shitty fucking thoughts. I keep missing work. I dont want to do anything. I have no motivation and no self confidence. At work I have too much anxiety to ask for my raise that was supposed to be given 2 months ago. I cant even bring myself to ask. 
I'm the only one that takes care of my grandma. I do all her shopping and cleaning. I havent even been able to clean my room in months. I'm so tired. 
People only ever want me around when they can use me. Nobody ever just wants to hang out. Its always because they need a ride, or someone to split the bill. 
I've reached out to mental health resources. My work has counselling in our benefits. She told me to go see my family doctor. Why the fuck do we pay for someone to say see your family doctor? I called another resource and they seemed promising but they never called me back. Everyone just wants to send me elsewhere. Why can't anyone help?

I dont know what to expect out of this post but I'm just hurting so bad right now"
249,Dissociation w/o trauma.,Is it possible to have a dissociative disorder without trauma? I feel very dissicuative right now.
250,Need help for getting out of my house before I get worse/A vent about the argument.,"I've been looking for a job for the last month and a half, but I've heard nothing back from the places I've applied. My dad is using it over my head and is becoming more agitated with me. It's getting to me, and I've never been good at dealing with it. 

Today I got up at around 10, they had gone to my grandmother's at around 8. I made breakfast, watched a movie, opened some packages, and made meatballs with mozzarella in them for dinner because mom made a joke about me making supper and I wanted to help. I put all my package stuff away and left the stuff I'd need for dinner out so I could make dinner later on. 

Dad immediately got home and started getting annoyed that there was stuff out on the counter (Some cheese I was going to eat, but had forgotten about, 6 small bites, and the breadcrumbs, and the toaster.) 

I went in a bit later because he called me to the kitchen, and immediately put away the toaster, my mom asked why the breadcrumbs were out so I said they're for what was in the fridge. He got mad, and when I say mad, I mean the whole ""Well mom hasn't looked in the fridge, I haven't looked in the fridge stop giving us attitude and disrespecting us"" Lecture, while yelling, as I was trying to get rid of my mess. 

When I say I'm not good with yelling, I mean, if anyone starts yelling angrily, at me or not, I'm bawling. I can't control it, I just start deteriorating into a ball of crying. I put the cheese in the compost, and he yelled at me for that because it doesn't belong in the compost (pests and all). 

He brought up that I don't have a job, and I should get one so I can get out of the house if I want to stay up late (I stay up until about 1-2am and wake up around 10am, and get out of my room at about 12pm, because I'll make stories or continue dreams in my head or scroll through my phone.

I want to leave, I want so badly not to be here, but I don't have a lot of money saved up, I hurt my back while I was tree planting, and I've not been able to find work yet. I need help, advice, tips, on how I can get shit figured out so that I can leave this hell hole."
251,How do I know if I really don’t love my family or I’m just depressed?,"there’s nothing wrong with them. we used to be fun and close but I don’t really feel anything towards them anymore. On their birthdays, I used to prepare weeks beforehand with gifts and cards. I used to put up HAPPY MOTHERS DAY letters at midnight on my tippy toes with a fast beating heart in the thoughts of seeing my mom smile the day after. Now, I feel obligated to celebrate those big days.

Due to personal reasons, I also don’t have a job rn and I’m(22f) completely broke so I guess not having money to prepare gifts plays a role.

I’m tired and I wanna be alone in bed. The only attention I truly want rn is from my boyfriend. I feel it’s weird and disrespectful but idk I’m just confused."
252,I may or may not have messed up at my second day of university and I can't stop thinking about it,"I'm not entirely sure, if venting is the right flair. I just need to get this out of my head to stop overthinking and maybe someone has some thoughts about this.  


Basically, I am scared that I already messed up on my second day of university. Yesterday we had to sign in into different lists for groups, which were for the appointments for the introduction to the library and the website. I thought I signed up for group 1 (there were 7 groups in total).  
Well, yesterday in the afternoon, that plan changed and somehow an 8th group was added and some times shifted around. All groups will have the same introduction, just at different times because of the current situation.

So I went to the group 1 appointment today, just to see that no one of my major was there. I thought it's alright, maybe they signed into the lists earlier. Turns out, we were 10 people in the group instead of 9, which were suppose to be there. So I went to the lady, who held the instruction for the website, and saw that my name wasn't on the list. I was horribly confused by that. She said, she'll keep my name in mind, maybe the lists were off. She also said I could take part at the library introduction (there was a break inbetween) and that it should be fine.

That's what I did. Now I know everything about the website and the library. Only at home it occured to me, I might have misread 7 for 1 and maybe I am signed in for group 7. And that's basically what I am overthinking. As I wrote, I did talk to the instructors and they said it's fine. I was there after all. I know everything that I need to know about the library and the website, so there would be no use for me to go to one of the other appointments. I even asked a friend (who has a later appoinment), if she could ask, if that lady from the website instruction remembers me, so I don't get in any trouble. Although I don't know what kind of trouble could wait for me, as I know everything I am suppose to know.

I just keep on thinking and thinking about probably having messed up on my second day of university."
253,Resources for finding a place for my psychotic bipolar brother to live,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

First, I hope this is the right sub to be posting in for help with resources. If not, can somebody point me to the proper sub for that? Anyway I’d appreciated some advice/resources to sort out my brothers living situation... 

Diagnosis/Substance Abuse:

A few years ago, my brother (21) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with a psychotic component. I personally think his symptoms more closely align with schizoaffective disorder (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504), but our dad has bipolar disorder which might have influenced the doctor’s diagnosis. I’m not a doctor though, so this is the only official diagnosis he’s got. 

He also struggles with substance abuse issues. Mostly Xanax as far as I know, but he was a heavy pot smoker in high school and got into cocaine in high school as well.

He’s seen multiple psychiatrists over the years, but basically refuses to continue seeing them if they don’t prescribe him benzos.

He also went to a PHP program for several days but refused to continue. 

Living Situation:

My brother currently lives with my mom. My sister and I have been out of the house for a few years now. My dad lives with his girlfriend about 30 min away from my mom’s house.

In March of this year, he and my mom got in a fight and he pushed her out of the house and pulled a knife on her. My mom called my dad who called the police. They came and arrested my brother, who had been in jail for the past few months, but was released in the middle of August. 

This last incident (along with previous anger issues) made it clear that he and my mom should not be living together anymore.

Question:

My sister has been looking into finding places for him to stay. She’s looked at local NAMI support groups, buying a trailer and renting a lot in a trailer park, Section 8 housing, Mental Health America’s housing webpage, SAMHSA’s housing webpage, Healthy Place’s housing webpage, and the Public Housing Agency’s website.

Does anybody know of any other resources that we might be missing? He gets just over $900/month in disability benefits. The rest of us can afford to pitch in around $100/month for whatever we can find. We live in Pasco/Hillsborough County, Florida.

Thanks for your help."
254,How would I help someone get therapy or some kind of proffesional mental help if they can't afford it?,"In USA for location context, in a LDR with my boyfriend and his family doesn't take depression very seriously, and he clearly has a bad case of depression. The thing is he is uninsured, so getting therapy has never really been an option for him. He's working but even then I worry the costs would be steep and because of that, I'm scared to suggest he get help, and in fear his family would overhear and ridicule him for it. I don't know what to do and I want to help him so badly, but I know realistically it wouldn't be healthy for me to try and play therapist. I love him so much and I want his mental health to get better. It's blatantly clear to me as someone with diagnosed depression and anxiety he has those things and on a severe scale. What can I do to help?"

258,Curious about my wife's behavior,"Hi, so I've been married to my wife for two years now. She's a college professor teaching English. I notice that my wife loves to take things apart, cut into stuffs and she couldn't sit still. I saw her a lot of times, cutting open random stuffs like old clocks, stuffed animals, snow globes, etc. If she has to go to meetings/classes, her notebook will be full of small triangle drawn close together, and she couldnt stop fidgeting. Every night, she would bounce her legs until she falls asleep. I asked her why she does these things, She said that she's been that way since she was small, and she likes cutting into things because she wants to know what's inside. 

I remember that her parents told me abt how when she was small, they would hide away all the scissors or sharp objects because she would cut open every single thing that she could reach for. She once disassembled her toys, her bicycle, and also the dvd player bcs she found her father's toolbox. I thought she was just being a rascal until i realized that she's still acting this way now. 

Should I be worried for her? I'm afraid she's suffering from some sort of hyperactivity disorder and is not getting proper help. Or is her behavior normal?"
259,My brain is so fogged that I almost got hit by a car today.,"It is crazy how much depression effects your ability to have a clear mind and focus on your surroundings. I have felt really really down in the last few days and can feel how I can't really concentrate. Today I got almost hit by a car because I looked in the wrong direction. Just didn't realize that this wasn't a two lane street and only looked left. Dumb me. 

It wasn't even the first time that I crossed that street which makes this even more worrying. 

Worst thing about this is that I am currently at driving school to get my drivers licence but now I am terrified of actually driving (even though I really wanna do it) because of how much my brain is fogged.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant. I am too ashamed by this to tell someone but it gave me a nasty shock today and killed my general mood even more."
260,I don't know what to tell you...have you tried....have you tried....,"WTF

Why do people think that we have not tried anything?

People push others who are in crisis to 501c3, 211 phone number, crisis hotlines

What IF the only issue is that I need a living wage?

But I cant get it.

I'm not here to discuss the why.

If I was a criminal, that would be simple

If I had a mental illness that could be simple

If I was a Veteran, if I was a former criminal

There are programs for that, there are ""get on your feet programs....""

I dont need a ""program"" to teach me what I know....

But nonporofits have to justify their grants so they will tell people, ""attend lifeskills classes, learn how to budget, get counseling, go to a food pantry, get used clothes, take a job at a partnering agency

They dont care about your education background or what your income needs are

Its ""one size fits all.""

Take it or leave it

Never mind what your healthcare needs are, or car maintenance costs, insurance, housing....just take any job, ignore bills and keep coming back to our nonprofits so we can put your name down as a ""head count"" to keep our grant money coming in.....

Keep at the low wage work oppty tax credit job....we (nonprofit) get a kickback from referring you there....and even if you are way over qualified to work there, we dont care, its not our problem"
261,Tips for ignoring haters at work?,"One of my coworkers has heard second hand stories about some dark parts of my past where I made a lot of mistakes and now his whole ""clique"" of friends make fun of me and talk shit about me, often right in front of me, at work, often calling me crazy which is really sad considering that I work in a psych unit. I'm trying my best to ignore it, but it's getting to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
262,I made an appointment,"I finally made my first appointment for therapy!! I’m very excited and while it has taken me so long to build up the courage to go, I’m still excited. Hopefully all goes well even though it is on zoom 🥴"
263,How do I live like this?,"I genuinely believe I don't deserve to live because of how ugly and worthless I am. Like I am ashamed for existing. Like I want to apologize for anyone who has ever been my friend, I don't think I ever deserved to have them as friends, because I am so ashamed of myself, everything about me and how I look. 

I don't think the same way about others. Only me. Everyone has got at least one good thing about them. But for me, I genuinely feel guilty for even existing. I am worthless and ugly. I am so insecure about my mere existence.

How do I live when this is consistently what is going through my head 24/7?
I am suffering because of my mind. I can't help it."
264,How can I help a sexual abuse victim?,"**WARNING SENSITIVE TOPICS**

Hi everyone, 

One of my best friends had the strength to tell me that she had been drugged and sexually assaulted a few days ago. She had been fighting depression for 3 years now and I know that she needs help, I fear that this event will erase every progress she ever made against this disease
I just want to be there for her and I don’t know how and where to start, I don’t want to overwhelm her with questions or anything but at least let her know that I’m here 
If anyone has any advice please - 

Thanks for reading
Stay safe"
265,Just got Random panic???,"I was chatting a little bit whit a friend and now I just completely random got panic, idk why but I just feel worse and I am bad at controlling somfing like this"
266,(18M) Need help understanding wtf is going on with me.,"I'll just list my ""symptoms"" below with some follow-up below it.

1. I have alot of anxiety
2. When I'm in any social situation I tend to check my phone for no      reason whatsoever
3. Trouble talking to people or in groups
4. I'm insecure about what others think about me

It's been like this since I was 13. My parents fought alot and they were at the brink of getting divorced, this was a really traumatizing situation for me.....they aren't divorced but they still fight with eachother till this day. Im scared of opening up to people as I worry what they'd think of me. I haven't even told my parents or my best friends this (whom I've known for about 8-9 years) due to this fear. 



It's the first time I've told anyone this. I'm sharing this in a public forum for hopes to find something which can help me or help someone who's in a similar situation.

Thank you."
267,I'm not sure what's wrong with me,"Having a hard time focusing on anything. Got a ton of work to do. But i don't know why, I just don't feel like doing anything. It's not like I hate my work. I used to love it. But it feels like a burden these days. Just few minutes after sitting on my chair, i start feeling restless and annoyed, and i give up. I feel sad and tired throughout the day for really no specific reason. Every night i sleep dissatisfied due to pretty much wasting my entire day. Have been thinking of visiting of a therapist since days, but due to the super bad coronavirus situation here, a bit scared to leave the house. Mental health is considered a joke in my country, so family isn't of much help either."
268,"I'm struggling with anxiety, a lack of motivation and Aspergers. How can I convince my Mom that I should get a therapist?","I'm a teenager in the UK. I'm also probably on the spectrum (haven't been diagnosed yet). School has been back on for nearly two weeks and I'm struggling to keep up. There's so much work and I have no motivation at all. Everything's disorganized and the systems I've made to keep on track are falling apart. Not even my bullet journal is helping.

I've been anxious about everything constantly and my parents are no help. My Dad literally hugged me and said, ""Don't be anxious honey. There's nothing to worry about.""

I know that I shouldn't be worried about this stuff but I am anyway. I've had two minor panic attacks and three meltdowns this week.

Math seems to be the class I have the most trouble with. I'm actually good at math but the teacher is really loud and let's people talk about the work so it all gets overwhelming.

I've been doing a lot of bad stims too. Biting my fingers, scratching my arms all that. I've been trying to stim less because I don't want my teachers to get mad at me for fidgeting. It is not working.

I'm also being bullied for being gay. It's not like physical violence or anything (except for the time someone threw a rock at me but I sure he was aiming at something else).

Its mostly just people yelling slurs at me in the halls or making obscene comments about me having sex with other girls while I'm nearby. I know they know I can hear them too.

My mom is contemplating getting me a therapist to help manage my ASD. I really want one but she is eering on the not get one side.

I get that I'm super privileged considering I have well off parents and my mom is willing to get me help if I convince her I need it. My dad less so but what can you do? The thing is I don't know if I can talk to a therapist for ASD about all these things. Will they tell my mom about our sessions? What if they hate me for being gay?

I really need some support and maybe some advice here. Has anyone been through a similar process?"
269,I feel completely trapped in my room right now.,"I am living on campus, and my campus is basically forcing everyone off it. If you live here you can come, but if you don't they literally escort you off. TBH my mental health can give less of a shit if its COVID and whatnot, and it really hit me hard. I know how to deal with this shit, its just a question of why am I dealing with this shit. 

I wanted to see my friend for so long, and have tried to get her on campus for a long time we were so close today, she literally got on and then everything just failed all at once. I feel completely isolated and there is no hope of seeing her again. Her family and living situation is an ass, and I absolutely hate her mom, so the only way we can actually meet up is if she comes her but now it feels like that's not even an option. 

Why do people assume that everyone would be okay living in 24/7 isolation, I think people on this campus are more likely to die from suicide than from COVID like legit, this campus is LOCKDOWN. No everyone wears masks and social distances and everyone has to take mandatory tests and mandatory vaccines. We have probably 0 COVID but are acting like an elderly society, where anyone coming on this campus is a health risk when in reality its not that bad.

I just feel like a statistic at this point, it doesn't matter how dire my need for personal interaction is, all that matters is I don't get COVID. O look he killed himself at least he didn't get COVID!

The main problem with restricting it this much is, that it, yes, restricts people who just want to have hookups and shit, but it also restricts people with mental health problems. My friend has literally attempted suicide a few times since I have been talking to her, and the feeling you get when you can't help them because you are away is massive. I feel like if they died I wouldn't know until a few months because I am so isolated on this campus. I have very little ways of leaving, and it just feels like I am stuck here forever.

I am going to follow my own personal philosophy and try to calm myself through this, but I fear for my friend and people more vulnerable than me."
270,"""violent"" urges...","Throw away account for obvious reasons. Lil background on me, 28 mom was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, I'm single, stopped going to therapy because I lost insurance, I smoke weed and drink a lot, it ""evens"" me out. Or atleast I tell myself that.. I've always been depressed, feel like in my later 20s I really figured out how to get a grip on it. I was going to therapy for around 6 months when I lost insurance, for the last three months I've not seen any medical professional. 

A month ago a family member was going through some medical shit and it was really hard on me emotionally. Family member IS better, and I feel good about that situation now. However, recently I've noticed weird feelings and urges, some of which are scary. The other week when I was laying on the couch watching something my roommate sat down, I had my feet up on the back of the couch and for some reason started feeling like kicking him in the head... I started feeling scared and telling myself ""stop thinking this"" but the urge wouldn't go away.. It wasn't a voice or anything it was just a feeling, a thought that crept in and would not go away.  After 10 mins of feeling like kicking my roommate in the head I started playing on my phone and I was able to get out of that mindset.. never have I ever felt that away, I've never felt like hurting someone in such an unprovoked way, I've never hurt animals, violence has always grossed me out. If this was a one off thing I wouldn't think much of it, but since that first time it's happened almost everyday. I've never actually kicked, but it's this urge, almost a craving to want and kick my roommates head when we are on the couch. I can't see myself ever acting in it, but it scares me. 

Before that happened another situation happened that was similar. I was at a party pretty fucked up. A female friend of mine was sitting across from me when I started feeling like I wanted to makeout. I've NEVER felt feelings sexually for this person, just a friend. It wasn't just like ""oh I'm going to try and hookup with her,"" it was like a day dream of me just getting up going over to her and making out right there. I got up  didn't say anything, went to the bathroom and started sticking my fingers in my mouth and stretching my cheeks, I have no idea why. maybe i just wanted to stop feeling that urge. Again, I have literally never done any of that before, the feeling, the fingers in the mouth.. I have punched myself in the face while drunk in efforts to sober up, but the motivation behind this felt different.  At that point I just left the party without saying goodbye to anyone and I felt like I was a monster."
271,Taking fun little exhilarating risks,"I’ve been doing things now that are “risky” behavior that could hurt me or put my life in danger. I get the fucked up thrill out of it that satiates me.

I’ve been accelerating, peddle to the floor, going up to 70 miles and hour and swerving. I’ve been running stop signs. I took some u-turns so harsh today I made tire tracks. At one point I was in far right line next to the curb and a driver in a large truck was next to me. Usually I’d stay behind the truck so they can see me. People have honked at me for trying to stay in the line of sight of the driver before lol.  This time I sped up in the driver’s blind spot and this guy was so close to my lane he almost ran me onto the curb. I’ve been experimenting with not wearing a seatbelt and today I opened the door on the way home and ran a red light.

A few weeks ago I lay in the middle of the road in the middle of the night to see what it would feel like. I also drank and mixed all my medications. I’ve been overdosing on medications when upset. Also, self-harming of course lol. And today I saw a sign at school that pissed me off so I ripped up the sign and threw it out the window and also ripped a flow out of the ground. 

The worst thing I’ve been doing is playing chicken with other cars. I pull on the opposite side of the road into oncoming traffic and then pull back into my lane. I also today went into the men’s bathroom and hurled the doorstop at the wall, lol. I’m a girl."
272,Podcasts on mental health during COVID,"I want a few podcasts maybe google or Spotify, on mental health during covid-19. How to manage work, studies, families, finance and social life."
273,What is my purpose in life? What is a good reason to live?,"Tldr; I feel like I don't have a purpose to my life. How do I find one? What do you think your purpose is?

After years of putting it off, I finally got myself into therapy. It's been going great so far, but my therapist hit me with something hard in my last appointment that has me stuck. And I know this is gonna be long, so apologies for that.

I was expressing to him how I always feel very anxious in the mornings right from the time I wake up. I believe it's mostly tied to work as I feel it on days that I work and on Sundays before I have to go back. It's been very stressful for me lately. I'm in a job that I haven't ever had experience in before and I'm still learning, so needless to say I haven't been perfect at it. I constantly worry about messing something up. I constantly am worried about being a disappointment, and not just at work. He told me that I'm basing my worth as a human being off of my successes and failures, and that's not how I should look at myself because every time I fail it hits me really hard. It's not reliable. A more reliable metric would be to find a purpose in something that allows more with my values.

Thing is, I don't know what my values are anymore. I've been going through a lot with my family and left the religion that I grew up with all my life. I used to think my values were loyalty, hard working, and selfless. Well, since the issues with my family has lead me to want to get rid of that kind of baggage in my life and not deal with my family, and that doesn't sound very loyal. I thought I was hard working, but it seems like no matter how much I work it doesn't seem to make me happy. I still can't afford the things I want, and it never seems to be enough. I was taught by my church that in order to be happy I have to forget myself and serve others, leading me to completely ignore how I feel and what I need. I'm at a place in my life where I want to focus on myself; actually get to know who I really am without feeling bad about it, and to think about my needs before discarding them for someone else. But that also means that I feel like I'm a selfish person.

If I don't base my purpose and value in my life on my successes, then what do I base it on? Just that I'm overall a good person? That kind of seems like too easy if an answer to me. I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking things.  I guess I would like to have a reason to feel like I should be alive, because I currently don't. Sorry to dump all my thoughts here, but I like having deep conversations with people."
274,Online school is too much for me,"I am 16 years old and go to a small farm town high school. i’ve always struggled with my mental health and I got a therapist earlier this year but they’ve since lost a member of staff at that office so my therapist is totally booked up so I have no one to talk to about this. I have always had amazing grades without ever having to study or anything, the only thing I’ve ever made a B in is math but even then the final end of semester grades are always As. I take pride in my work and like to do my best, I don’t like just b-s ing my work. well I am THREE WEEKS into my junior year and it is just too much for me. I have four honors classes with the highschool plus two college classes eith the local college because I wanted to graduate highschool with an associates degree. I did just fine with my summer college classes, and did just fine the week before highschool started when I only had the two college classes. now though, it is just too much work. I can’t take it. Our school gave us the choice to go in for two days of the week or to do online all week long. I feel like us online kids are such an afterthought. we don’t have anyone teaching us, we just do the work. I have done more fake outs and BS in these 3 weeks than I did all my other two years of highschool before this. Going in to school isn’t an option since i’m currently living with my grandma who has lung and brain cancer, it’s just too much of a risk for her to get the virus. What on earth can I do??? I usually try to get myself out of bad situations but what the f*** can I do about this? I’m going to talk to a guidance counselor soon hopefully but I just can not take all of this work. it’s not hard, it’s very doable, but it is too much. I work from the moment I wake up at 6am to the moment I fall asleep at 10pm (an hour later than i usually like to go to sleep but the work must be done) I can’t take it. I came so far with my mental health but now it feels like i’m back to where I was when I was prepared to put a gun to my head four years ago. please help me"
275,"How can I convince my sister not to commit suicide, when I can’t think of any good reasons?","My sister (48) and I (51) live in different states (me NYher CT). She’s always been “tricky” to get along with. I suspect some type of mental illness but she’s never been properly diagnosed. She lives in disabled housing in ct after losing her home to foreclosure. She lives in a tiny 1 br with two large dogs (Great Dane Australian shepherd). The Great Dane has gotten out and terrorized some smaller dogs and cats in the housing development. Now the police have taken both dogs away. 

These dogs are my sisters whole life. She lost her job to Covid, her unemployment ran out and she won’t be allowed to see either dog again. Her neighbors are all at odds with her, and it took her so long to find this place. She talks about “seeking revenge” against these neighbors then, in the next minute she talks about being tired of living and wants to end it all. 

She was very active in her church but I think they had recommended she give up the dogs and she refused to listen so I don’t think she wants to go back there. 

I would invite her to live with me but our relationship is best when we don’t live near each other. She can be difficult to get along with. 

Any advice? I don’t want to see her do something to herself, yet I have no idea what to tell her. 

Thanks"
276,I dont know how to feel,I dont know what to type here I am on the brink of suicide and I don't know what to do. I have tried and tried to get help but it never helps. I wanted to end my life more times than I can count. I believe that I am never enough and I the reason for every bad event that happens in my family even though I have nothing to do with it. I dont know what to do and I'm scared to even be only with myself. I want to end everything I dont know what else to do anymore.
277,New diagnosis....and I'm not coping well.,"Got diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar and OCD last night, along with my nearly debilitating thyroid disease. I just cant help but think....*why me?*. For FUCKS SAKE, WHY ME??

Why do i have to be cursed with all this bullshit? Why do i have to be the only one in my family or my fiances family to struggle to fucking stay alive? I got out of bed once today, just now to go to the liquor store because. I just cant. Im so angry at the world. At myself. At everything and everyone. I envy ""normal"" people like my fucking life depends on it. Why cant i just be like them? Why cant i JUST. BE. NORMAL?!

I needed to vent somewhere. Im about to down this southern comfort and sleep the pain away. I hate myself. And to top it all off? Even though i finally have my diagnosis, ive been fighting to get SOMEONE to believe that there was something wrong for ten fucking years now, only to be met with ""youre just a hypochondriac, dont stress so much"" so now, even though i finally have a name to put to all my problems people in my family and inner circle still just think im the same fucking hypochondriac that just stresses too much.

Fuck everything. Maybe ill die in my sleep tonight and put everyone out of their misery for having to be around me. Thanks for listening guys. Needed to get this out somewhere."
278,What do you do when nothing seems to work?,[removed]
279,"Being passively suicidal has alienated me from having the ""correct"" emotional reaction to the pandemic.","At the beginning of 2020, before most people thought that life would soon revolve around avoiding a coronavirus, I estimated that I had about 50/50 odds of dying from suicide in the next couple years, and would almost certainly be dead by the end of the decade. No immediate plans to do anything about it, but it does feel inevitable. I've been a student for basically my whole life, in a field that I'm not truly passionate about and can't see myself ever employed in, and if I could find the motivation, I'd be nearing the end of my PhD, which I basically equate with the end point of my life (I have no other aspirations or marketable skills).

So it's been stressful, in a way, to see the rest of society put so much emphasis on the sacredness of *life* and *health* over the past 6 months. If I get really unlucky and die of Covid-19, that's totally fine by me. Saves me the trouble of having to do it myself. The risk of death from this virus has always been lower than my daily desire for death, so the whole thing almost feels like a tease. It's strange to remember that social media used to be full of edgy memes about young people being tempted by death because their lives are so pointless, and these are all just... suddenly gone? Did people not really feel that way?

It's also stressful that I now have a highly taboo political opinion, that the preventive policies much more harmful than the pandemic itself. I don't care if I die, but I don't want my last few years of life to be more miserable than they have to be. Right now one of my main motivations for staying alive is to see the ""new normal"" eventually rejected by society. If it prevails permanently, I won't be sticking around.

Would my mental health improve at all if I could be ""converted"" to the mainstream/leftist view of the pandemic? Does anyone here want to try?"
280,How can I help a friend who is struggling with depression but doesn't want to seek professional help?,"I can't see her in person as much (she lives quite far from me), but we keep in contact pretty much everyday.
She's been struggling with low mood/stress/depression for quite a while now. Probably longer than a year. She's mentioned that she's not ""content"".
I've always made it clear that she's important to me, I've mentioned the generic activities that help me, and I've suggested seeking therapy but she's afraid that she might be put on some sort of medication.
What else can I do? Is there anything I'm doing wrong?"
281,I feel like no matter what I do I will always be a failure and a disappointment,"so fucking overwhelmed and I know nothing will get better. I find relief in daydreaming about death or getting sick with something terrible, I feel then I will have an excuse to be a fucking failure. I failed so much in college, I've tried making my passion for art into an income through social media but when I started to get some sort of money &amp; success making content, I chickened out and stopped for two years. Now I'm trying to make content again with a new username/account but nothing is working.. I'm never getting back what I had. I tried freelancing and I don't really like working with clients they are a pain to deal with. those are the top of the iceberg and I really wish I could disappear."

I talked to my father about this once, i told him that i thought I might have BPD, and i thought he might actually believe it and try to help me since I have been having anger issues to the point where i scream at them VERY loudly. I also feel weird right now as if i'm not really real so its a bit hard to focus on what i am typing. I constantly feel like the people around me are going to get disappointed and leave me, and i have ruined multiple relationships and im literally ruining one right now by being weird and sbksksndj i want death. I feel like im never going to accomplish anything, my life has been a mess for the past 5 years now and i still haveng changed anything about it, i just cant. I ALSO FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO PERSONALITY AND JUST COPY OTHER PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY LIKE IM SUCH A MESS.

Now, i'd love to get diagnosed hahahah but the age is 18 and no my parents arent going to take me to the therapist. And ""meditating"" or ""journaling"" doesnt work for me either, i have no motivation to do that currently and im scared someone might read what i write.

I vented alot to them! Before we met i was friendless.. but with them, they make me feel happy and forget about my sadness.. i know it chessy but they never fail to make me day.."
287,I feel like a mess and have no idea what to do,"First, some demographics. 22M, medically diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, and Clinical Depression. I'm not on any medication for my mental conditions.

I have a lot to be thankful for in my life. I grew up with a family that fed and supported me, I was never homeless, I have a job that isn't going anywhere despite the pandemic, have a decent income considering my age and lack of degree, enrolled in college, and I'm decently healthy. And alive, that's pretty important too. 

That being said I often sit here and just think about how drastically different my life is to most people. I have only two friends, no joke. Both are online and hundreds-thousands of miles from me. I'm extremely introverted and shy. I don't trust people. I have big problems with envy too. If I'm envious of someone, I feel strong hatred toward them, no matter how petty the thing I'm envious over is. Sometimes this can spill over and I'll wall off an entire community. I'm also shy to reach out into the hobby-related communities where that isn't a problem. But social issues aren't the only problem I'm dealing with at the moment. 

I lack motivation. As a kid I used to royally piss people off on the internet with my Mountain Dew fueled levels of enthusiasm. These days I just don't give a single fuck about anything. My career and hobbies barely interest me anymore. There's still some interest here and there, but I'll usually pick it up, dick about with it a little bit, experience either some form of resistance, failure, boredom, or worst case ""someone else ruins it for me"", and then say eh fuck it I don't feel like it anymore and just let it go for a while. 

I don't see a career change as something suitable. I'm too deep down the rabbit hole I chose and anything I'd remotely be interested in as an alternative is either is too much above my head or it's not enough to make a living off of. This isn't me wanting to sit around and play video games, I'm talking stuff like being an auto mechanic or communications engineer. 

I am enrolled in college but my lack of interest in.... well.... anything really... has resulted in me stalling around and not wanting to do my work. Which isn't doing my any favors. I'd like to get it done and over with so I can move out and live on my own. 

I also have mounds of debt due to impulsive spending. I don't even have most of the things I've bought over the years anymore. And even of the things I still do have (which don't total up in value a lot), only a fraction of it is stuff I actually consider worth the money. I tried numerous times to get out of debt, but I just fall back into the same trap all over again. Or I put myself in the hole with medical debt. It seems somewhat hopeless. But at least I don't have any negative marks on my report, so that's one good thing going for me.

I've sought therapy, the particular therapist was more interested in talking about COVID which doesn't really bother me so much on the emotional level given that I barely go out and do stuff. I broke off with him. I haven't sought help of another therapist, life has been too busy with work and by time the day is over I feel exhausted and don't feel like doing anything.

I'm terrified of medicating. I've had bad run-ins with side effects. My previous PCP wanted me to try Xanax, and that was an immediate nope from me. Heard too many bad stories about that drug and don't want to risk the side effects. 

My self-esteem is in the pits, I'm just going to leave it at that.

I'm at wits end. I'm ***terrified*** of death so thankfully I'm in no way going ""in that direction"". But I am quite sick of the place I'm at now. I want to pull myself out of this. One of those two friends told me that I'm going to look back someday and be sorry that I didn't go out and live, and he's probably right. I just want to stop being lazy. I want to start getting stuff done. Start getting in routines. Start accomplishing things and doing my schoolwork. Start socializing and not being afraid to go to meets and conventions. Hang out with people who are like-minded, or maybe even slightly unlike-minded. Stop being embarrassed of myself and my interests/hobbies. I want to enjoy my hobbies again and not sit around wasting time on the internet constantly. But most importantly, I want to live. I want to be happy.

What are some ways I can begin this epic war against my mental health barriers?"
288,Will my parents be in the room at a psychiatrist?,"I'm 16 (almost 17) in senior year of highschool. At school today, I almost had a mental breakdown because of how hard school is for me, its so frustrating sitting in a classroom completely lost, and then looking around and seeing everyone else perfectly understanding the material, and being able to work flawlessly. So after today I texted my mom and asked her to get me an appointment with a psychiatrist, and she said she would. The reason I never asked earlier (well I did once, but got shut down by my dad) was because im scared my mom or dad will be in the room when im there. I am extremely uncomfortable talking about my problems and feelings around my parents. So what im asking is if they're going to be in the room, and if they are can i ask them to leave with no problems? Some other stuff worth mentioning is ive also started smoking weed and its helped me a lot in terms of my mental state, but its not perfect, and I dont wanna have to rely on it. Also, my parents would kill me if they found out."

292,is it bad to tell my depressed friend that i USED to feel like he does now?,"My friend is 18, i’m 24. He’s going through hard time. I went through hard time his age up until 22 or so, is it wrong or a “slap to the face” to tell him that i know how he feels because i used to feel the same way? It makes me feel guilty that i DONT feel that way anymore, but yet he DOES. It makes me feel bad that i am over the obstacle in my life but he isn’t..i know it makes him feel bad but idk what to do or how to help"
293,I’m supposed to be moving out in less than a week and my brain is not working. In need of advice please!,"I am 21F and am going to move into a college dorm next Monday. I have had treatment resistant depression and debilitating anxiety since I was 15. I also have other health issues like digestive problems and am therefore terrified about using a shared bathroom. I also have major food allergies and fears, so I will have to eat in my dorm (which doesn’t permit a microwave). I’m a mess. I have never had a proper job, cannot drive (I have my learner’s and taking the test for the 2nd time in a couple days), and have been completely friendless and socially isolated since I was 15. I have no social medias and am worried people will think I’m weird if they find out. My social skills are severely lacking. My brain is a solid fog. Every time I think of trying to do normal functions and focus on schoolwork, my brain literally starts to hurt (like when you think about something too hard). I really cannot think or focus. My psychologist says I should stay living with my parents and either get TMS or ECT, but my parent’s house is a toxic and limiting environment. I have been living w/ them far too long and I am very ashamed and mad at myself. 

Should I just jump into it and suffer? Should I seek treatment where I am moving? Should I not go and turn 22 with my parents? I am under so much stress that I can’t eat or sleep. And then there’s covid to top it all off. I have so much to do in such a short time frame. Thank you for reading."

295,"(25f) I have developed a very angry/resentful mindset over the last year, what do I do?",I’m a 25f and over the last year I’ve started to become very resentful and angry and I let small things get me fired up. I have always been a very happy/positive person and I’ve just become extremely pessimistic and I have no idea how to stop or why it’s taken over my entire mental state or where it’s even come from? It’s like the smallest things just set me off and I can’t even react/respond rationally. Maybe it’s from the stress of my job? But then thinking about quitting sounds stressful because I’ll have to find another.. It feels like nothing could help me stop being this way and I feel guilty for people who have to be around me and my negativity. Like a constant state of anger and annoyance. Has anyone else experienced this? Does therapy ACTUALLY help? Is there a medication for this? Please help me understand what’s happening if you’ve been through this! Am I depressed?
296,finally cried,been anxious and depressed for the entire month and had a couple of panic attacks. had the urge to cry &amp; scream for the entire time but couldn't and finally started crying now.
297,Finally told my mother about my suicidal thoughts.,"I finally told her that I was having suicidal thoughts since 2017. I told her about how some nights it was really bad but other days it was just there, she said she would call and get me an appointment with a therapist. I am happy that she understood and didn’t judge me because my dad overreacts a lot and I was scared she might do the same but she completely understood and she even had and still had depression."
298,What's wrong with me?,"I'm a 17 male and for the last 5 to 6 months I've had alot of problems with my parents that I've gone to therapy for against my wishes. I've also got myself on probation with some stupid decisions at the beginning of July. Between my family problems and the stress of probation and some of the colledge classes I'm taking all I have been able to think about the last 2 weeks is ending my life. I dont think I would actually do it unless things get worse but it's all I can think about. I try to get my shit together but everytime I try too, it feels like life puts more bullshit on my plate and I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to my breaking point and I'm not sure what I'd do if I reach it. Everything and everyone makes me so unbelievably mad that I feel pissed at the world every second of they day. The only person I feel like I have is my girlfriend who I've been with for just over half a year now. I havent told anything about how I feel because shes had trouble with depression and cutting and I'm afraid she might go back to it if she knew how much i was struggling. Everyday I have to tell myself ""take it one hour at a time"" and everything I do to fix my situation makes me feel like I'll never do enough or be good enough and I'm getting tired of it. I hardly leave my house anymore except to see my girlfriend. Every day when I'm not working or going to school I sleep and I think I know that I'm not tired I just do it to get away from my life. I've been trying just tough it out but idk if I can anymore and I'm starting to wonder if there is something wrong in my head."
299,I think I might have Bipolar II,"I've had depression and anxiety for almost a decade now. They were finally diagnosed in 2016. I've had suicidal thoughts for most of my life. I'm not sure I know what it means to be happy, honestly. When I was first diagnosed with depression, I didn't know what manic episodes were and therefore couldn't quite give an informed answer on if I had any or not. Now I'm looking back and seeing some times where I was overly hyper and couldn't control what I did. They weren't frequent, maybe once a year. I don't know if they were me having truly happy days or manic episodes. Would anybody mind sharing what some of their manic episodes look like? I'm trying to decide if it's worth bringing up to my doctor or not and would like some insight first."

301,Wanted to die since 14... i am 19,"Hate to much about my life...

My father who has no job, me being alone and fantasizing about a life that I will never have, the guy that i liked so much and he forgot about me, the endless times i spent all my day learning and night crying, the unhappiness that seems to follow, the songs that can't me happy ever again, the books that i love so much and their characters they seem to real( wish i can meet those characters, because we are so alike, like two raindrops) 

I was always that A graded student- who spent their entire life learning and crying, that beautiful girl (tall and slim and b*sty) that guys wished to f*ck- but always stayed alone... nobody ever talked to her.

That girl that spends every day thinking how it would be easier to kill herself- who wishes to be hit mortally by a car/ train, killed by a mysterious illness.

It's so miserable being so unhappy.

And that guy...that guy that that i know since I was 11, that guy that I thought he can really love me, that guy that I tried to make him understand how I feel, that guy that never cared."

Why can’t I be happy that I’m happy and just not let them being down affect me? Ugh
304,Medication dosage,"My doctor has me on 137.5mg of Effexor, 150mg quetiapine, and 2mg of prazosin but I stopped taking them a couple months ago because I had gotten sick and I legitimately didn’t have the energy to take pills. I want to start taking my medication again but I’m scared to consult a professional because I was able to take my Clonazepam and I’m worried they’re going to get suspicious on why I was only taking one medication. Does anybody have any tips on how I can start myself back up on my medication as I have them still and I’d like to start taking them tonight. Note I’m 90ibs and a lot of medication doesn’t go well with my body at first so I could like to start off slow. My inbox is open to any advise and please no negative comments.

305,"How to support someone refusing help in a state of mania? Mother is really unwell, refusing any help and getting more aggressive.","I really don’t know what to do anymore.

It appears that my Mom has been in a state of mania now since the end of July/beginning of August and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. She won’t get help, or accept any people that reach out, and accuses us of not being there but she’s been receiving support throughout over and over. Including financially but says we aren’t there for her.

She is now becoming physically aggressive and abusive when people go to check on her because she’s making posts threatening to hurt herself. She pushed me, hit me, threw rocks at me, kicked a table at me and hit me with it when I went to check on her last week after she made a threat to hurt herself.

I saw her house and it’s completely destroyed. She’s been burning stuff in her yard and the neighbours have called the police on her. 
I tried calling 912 worried she was a missing person with the ability to potentially hurt herself or someone else and they were completely condescending and unhelpful. 

She voluntary placed herself in a psychiatric facility at the hospital on the 22 of August; and checked herself out on the 24th. Left me a message telling me if anything happens to her it’s my fault. 

We got an order last Saturday through our court system here to get her involuntarily placed in the hospital for a psychiatric assessment, and she also got released.
I know she’s not well. She’s either Borderline/Bipolar or both. Back when she was diagnosed when I was a child they said it was “multiple personality” but I know that’s not the terminology anymore. I feel like it’s bipolar based on her behaviour and posts. She posts on FB constantly, going from aggressive and threatening to nice and encouraging. 

She got her vehicle impounded last week or so but the details are very uncertain because she’s not talking to anyone, she’s blocking everyone. She might have been charged with a DUI or B&amp;E.
She’s been using weed daily, to excess for months now. I’m not sure about drinking. 

I got rid of FB/other media months ago because I was being emotionally/verbally abused by my sister who is an alcoholic who was in the past several months being very awful to me and my mom. My mom and I were sort of on the same page with setting boundaries with my sister because she was being so verbally abusive and putting her child in danger. My mom got fed up and threatened to get child protection involved, but didn’t. I intervened. 

Everything has been so awful but anyway, I don’t have FB and people are sending me or calling me to tell me what my mom is saying online and it’s so scary, but she won’t accept help. 

I’m sorry I just don’t know what to do. Our mental health and emergency services here aren’t helpful at all. 

This isn’t the first time she’s been like this, she was like this when I was a kid with me and my siblings, but she would voluntary get checked into a place and we would stay elsewhere with grandparents. But this is the worst I’ve ever seen her.

She threatens to hurt herself more if people call 911. 

TL;DR: What does one do when their loved one is in a state of mania that won’t end from Bipolar? 

Thanks for any input or reassurances, I’m just really scared and it’s really affecting my ability to function normally on a daily basis - I just want her to get the help she needs."
306,Am I traumatised?,"I’m 21 and a female, I have been on and off with someone for about 4 years now. After I discovered a few things he had done to me (manipulation and betrayal) and also after he punched through a door during an argument, I decided it was finally over.

There is much more, like him calling me worthless and stuff because I got tinder (after we broke up) but I digress. 

It should be noted that this man is very manipulative and has now become very angry, he says he misses the relationship, my therapist believes he is a narcissist or has narcissistic tendencies.

I decided I will not even entertain his calls, so when he called one night I ignored it. We’re over, I don’t need to answer.

The next morning, I wake to banging on my door. I freeze, because this already gives me anxiety. The banging grew louder, then I heard his voice screaming for me to answer the door. 

He had not texted me to ask me for something or anything or the sort, just called once and showed up at my house, so I was scared. 

I ignore it, because I’m terrified and I don’t want to see him. This man, opens one of my windows and climbs into my house without consent.

I have a panic attack and try to call the police but he lunges and hangs up the phone. I stupidly don’t call them again. He doesn’t leave after I’m screaming for him to go. I’m shaking and crying at this point. 

After an hour and a half I finally get him out of my house. He wanted to pick up something he said I could keep a few months beforehand. However, once he had that thing HE WOULD NOT LEAVE.

So, this morning I was sleeping and get a knock on my door. I freeze and begin to panic and my brain switches right back to that moment, now I can’t get it out of my head when I thought I was okay. It was the post man but I couldn’t move, couldn’t go an answer I was frozen.

I do already have anxiety issues as I have BPD and unipolar depression. I have had many anxiety attacks in the past, and many BPD episodes due to this person.

Does anyone have any advice? 

TLDR: my ex broke into my house and now I panic anytime someone knocks on my door... am I traumatised"
307,I see no solution,"I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore, firstly I want to point out that I’ve never been diagnosed or tested for anything but I’ve been in this state for years where most of the time I don’t understand my own feelings, it’s like I have no idea what I’m feeling, I’m not sad or happy, it’s just nothing, deep down there’s sadness but I’m just confused, I talk to people and tell people but it doesn’t help anymore because I can never even tell if I’m telling the truth because I don’t know what I’m feeling, it’s so irritating and I want my thoughts and brain to just fucking stop, I just want to be happy and I can’t, no feeling makes sense to me anymore and I don’t know how I figure it out, it’s like a puzzle, everything’s so vague I have no idea if I’m sad or happy it’s just flat, I just want to feel something, sometimes I purposely overthink things because I want to make myself feel sad because otherwise I feel nothing, I want to cry and breakdown but I can’t because I don’t even know what my feelings are anymore, I know I sound insane but I genuinely have no idea what I’m feeling at any given point, it’s just a fog, and it doesn’t hurt on the surface but deep down I need to feel something and it’s like I can’t, everything’s a loop and I don’t want to do it anymore but I could never kill myself because I ain’t at that point yet and my sister already tried when I was younger and I don’t want to put anyone through the pain that I was put through, for more background info I’m 17 right now and I’m pretty popular, everyone says I’m funny but I can still never believe it, I still dislike myself, but I can’t tell my family because they’ve been through enough, it’s like an impossible situation, if anyone can help it’s appreciated but I don’t see how anyone really can because nobody really knows what I’m thinking, I feel fucking insane, I just have to vent"

Now, I don't exactly understand Where'd the psychosis come from. Is it possible that it's because of parnate? Or sleep deprivation because of extreme insomnia? 


p.s- it's 4am and i felt extremely lonely but had a little bit of energy to write this down. The hallucinations and paranoia has been really bad for me so if at all anyone can help it'll be appreciated :)

314,16 years of therapy,Hey everyone I have been doing therapy for 16 years and I just started talking in my blog since now I am finally getting to the core of the issue in my depression.

Here it is https://punkrockerdad.com/2020/09/15/chapter-8-god-hate-us-all/[God hate us all](https://punkrockerdad.com/2020/09/15/chapter-8-god-hate-us-all/)
315,Friend needs help. What do I do?,"This is long so thank you for reading if you do. 

Me: ( M/20) 

Him: (M/19)

My best friend (in a rough spot right now. He’s been trying to find a career or some kind of calling that he can work in for the past year and he’s been having a tough time pinning that down. He finally found something he likes and can turn into a career but he’s just now bogged down mentally. 

He had a long bout with depression when we were younger (I didn’t know this at the time I couldn’t tell back then what kinda mental state he was in and we were new friends) and had suicidal thoughts and it got really bad but we were not close then and I was his only friend. 

He just now has been having a rough time with motivation, irritability, leaving the house, sleeping, even talking to people he just doesent wanna do shit. I understand there is rough patches but this one is different for him (he’s said this himself). It’s not like him and both of us know it he’s been complaining about it for awhile and I treated it like any other rough patch till tonight. 

Also we both drink and smoke weed (like any self respecting young adult lmao) but he always was cautious of it all you know? He has pretty bad anxiety so he is an always in moderation guy, which I respect. But he lately has started doing it very often and very early in the day almost to the point to which there is days where half of it is spent high. 

He said he thinks he may be depressed from a facts standpoint looking from a third person view at his troubles. Obviously that makes me very nervous. 

I have his full trust and secrets are few and far between for us. We have been very very close for years and I know him like the back of my hand. 

 Is it depression is it just a rough patch i wish I could tell him

I don’t even know why I’m writing this whole back story I mean he already has a therapist but I want to know how I can help him I feel helpless and feel like I can’t help him other than just listen to him go on about this shit that I can’t change no matter how hard I try"
316,I'm so close to giving up,"I'm so tired of dealing with my anxiety, I know that sounds ridiculous but it feels harder to control it than to not, sometimes I'd rather feel nothing. I feel the most stressed about my uni, its my first year and I know that it's hard to do online but I am putting in so much effort and it just keeps getting harder and harder and I hate getting low grades. My family is now saying to drop one of my subjects but I don't want to do that yet, I may consider it in the future but I just want to be able to handle it all and get out of uni as fast as possible. There's also this sense of impending doom, with covid, with climate change, with just everything bad going on in the world, the phrase ""you have so much to live for"" was true for a while but I'm not sure anymore. I try to battle the thoughts in my head, but the minute something goes wrong, they come.

I miss myself, but it seems like everyday I get closer and closer to the truth, and it's that I'm always going to have to try so much harder than everyone else in EVERYTHING I do. Sure I shouldn't compare myself, but what do I do when the only thing I'm good at is helping people, and I want to do that as a psychologist, but uni is already proving to be way way harder than I had ever anticipated. How studious do I have to be for it to pay off? I'm not saying I want shit to be handed to me or for it to be a walk in the park, but I'd like at least one thing in my life to be like that! I struggle with sports, with getting part time jobs despite being experienced, I'm not artsy, I know I'm not a total dud but it just feels that people have things going for them, but me. Everyone around me has one thing that they're just really good at and haven't had to work on in too much to get good and that's amazing! But I can't help but get mad at not having that, I mean, I'm good a cleaning? Cooking I guess? But I don't enjoy those things. 

I hate to sound like I'm feeling sorry for myself, but I don't think everything I just mentioned is a lie, I usually just accept it, but then I get a kick to the guts and I'm back to square one, it is tiring. It's like I put in 110% effort, and sure a low grade doesn't define me, and neither does getting knocked back from a job, but when this was the only thing that I thought I was good at and had the upper hand on, it hurts!"
317,I feel so alone...is there anybody out there?,I feel so alone...is there anybody out there?
318,My ex says I was abusive is it true?(21F)(30M),"

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn’t interest or challenge him enough.




I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong



He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.



He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.



He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He’ll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I’m the meanest person he’s ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he’s said about me he says “everything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult”




I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,” I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.” When I lost my temper he’s sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar?

I was in a toxic, manipulative relationship for almost two years before my exphysically. My coworkers pick fights with me for no reason. I had a panic attack yesterday that was so severe my brother had to drive me home from campus and I missed two classes. I got in a nasty fight with my parents, then my brother dropped the news that my mom was super depressed and approaching being suicidal. My depression as a result of all this is keeping me from being with my friends, doing the things I love, and being at least an okay partner for my now-boyfriend, who was a friend for three years. I'm really close to losing it and doing something I'll regret, such as hurting myself or others. My father threatened to pull me out of school if I went to a mental hospital, so that's not an option. I'm stuck, I'm lost, and I'm exhausted spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and pbhsically."

I’ve never felt like I was anxious enough to have a disorder, or depressed enough for it to be out of the ordinary...

321,Full anxiety mode,"I'm moving, and I'm a compulsive hoarder. The anxiety about all of this is incredibly debilitating. 

I'm renting the basement of a house with my bf. We have four upstairs roommates who don't quite know the state of our basement area. The basement is full of piles of my old childhood junk as well as garbage. It's such a huge job.

We have a deadline to clean everything by this Saturday because they've scheduled to show the basement to some new potential renters. I'm struggling to clean up, my depression has kept me from ever scrubbing anything, and trying to tackle such a huge seemingly never ending job of cleaning gives me such bad anxiety I get nauseous and just need to sit down. 

My bf isn't helping, he's waiting until Friday to just do it all. I have half a mind to just call my mom and ask her to help me clean it all but she's a school teacher so I don't think she'd be able to squeeze it into her schedule in time. 

I'm incredibly overwhelmed and it's plummeted me into a pretty bad place mentally which just makes everything even harder. I just don't understand why cleaning can't make me feel good like everyone else, it gives me such intense anxiety my reaction is to just shut it all out and feel apathetic towards everything. I feel so stuck I don't understand what I can do about this."

TW mention of self harm and suicide 

I miss being depressed. I don’t know why or even how that’s possible, but I guess I liked being so miserable. I was put on an antidepressant a little over a month ago because I was crushingly depressed, couldn’t leave my house, and was probably just a push away from suicide. I had gone as far as to make video diaries for each of my family members and loved ones to watch after I was dead, and picked a date that I would end my life by if things weren’t different. I had pretty much given up and was ready to kill myself. I enrolled in college at the beginning of the year, but by the summer was so depressed that I figured I’d kill myself before the school year started, and so never bothered to get myself prepared for school. Didn’t think it would matter. 

Literally the week of my chosen suicide date, I felt my antidepressants starting to work. My partner told me he was starting to see a change in my mood, my mother acted like it was a miracle to see me smiling again. I felt more energized and motivated, less anxious and the feelings of hopelessness went probably from a 9/10 down to a 4/10 in what felt like a couple of days once the drugs started working. I worked my ass off to get ready for college and managed to get into all of my classes on time, and have been managing to keep up with the work well. I’m leaving my house multiple times a week to go to stores or for walks just because I feel like getting out more. I’m interacting with people and am just ultimately not consumed by the desire to kill myself anymore. During my depressed period, I was self harming almost daily, and now that the meds are working I NEVER feel the urge and as a matter of fact actually feel stupid for cutting myself up so bad and can’t even understand why I did it to begin with. No matter how hard I try, I cannot force m self back into the mindset I was in before the antidepressants started working. 

Yesterday, the first time in months, I felt myself looking forward to the future. I thought to myself “Wow, it will be so nice when this is all over and I can go to festivals again” , then caught myself and quickly shook away the thought. Since pretty much the beginning of quarantine I have been fairly certain I wouldn’t see the end of the pandemic because I’ve figured I would kill myself before a vaccine comes. Now all of the sudden I don’t feel hopeless and am motivated to wait out the storm and am excited for things to get better. But I don’t like it. What the hell? 

All day I have been talking and thinking negatively almost trying to make myself depressed again for some reason, but I literally just can’t. The antidepressants have actually worked and I am truly just not suffering from depression anymore and I wonder if it’s just because I have always suffered from some degree of depression for as long as I can remember, but I genuinely feel like I am now missing a huge piece of my life and identity and want it back despite the fact that I felt like I was living in hell. I don’t understand it but it’s literally just as simple as I want to be depressed again. I miss crying and feeling miserable daily. I miss going days without showering  because I didn’t feel good enough to. 

All day I have been thinking about going off of my meds so that I can be depressed again but the meds are working well enough even for me to be fully aware that it’s a terrible idea. They are  helping me and I am grateful to feel okay for once but I just wish I could enjoy it without it feeling so wrong. Why do I feel like I still want to be depressed? I was so indescribably sad and uncomfortable with being alive that it’s awkward for me to even talk or think about now because I cannot even remember or relate to how that felt anymore. It’s like there’s a constant fight going on between the naturally mentally ill parts of my brain and the healthy parts that are responding to medication. 

Does anyone else understand this or am I just stupid for not letting myself enjoy being happy?"

328,My roommate is self-diagnosing to be relatable?,"I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar II for about 6 or 7 years now, and have struggled with mental health almost all of my life. I’ve found a lot of comfort in the community of people who go through similar experiences, but I find it insulting when people try to relate on a level they just don’t understand.

My roommate is a very sweet and fun person. She’s absolutely gorgeous, but she’s very privileged; she’s lived a rich and lavish life since the day she was born. However, I do respect her a lot for her accomplishments and hardships she has overcome. 

Recently, I’ve started explaining my bipolar diagnosis and the struggles that come with it, and she claims to be undiagnosed bipolar. Now if I thought this were true, it’d be one thing- But when I go into the details of disassociating from reality and the many life obstacles that come with bipolar, she draws lines to things in her life that are not the same. I have not brought it up to her, as I am not a doctor and cannot tell her she doesn’t have a disease. Yet it’s starting to upset and offend me when I try to explain how hard it is to deal with things, and she makes it about herself. Am I being selfish? How can I express my discomfort in a respectful way?"
329,Does a self diagnosis mean anything?,"I'm using an alt so I don't look like I'm searching for attention.

So for like maybe a year or something I've been thinking ""maybe I should see a doctor to see if I have anxiety or something.""

So, I looked on Google and, I know this will sound very very stupid, but after reading some stuff on the first page after I look up ""depression diagnosis"", I may have some???

I know it probably doesn't mean anything and either way I'm not gonna do anything about it but I'm just wondering if a self diagnosis has any merritt to it at all."
330,He's gone and I can't accept it,"I had a friend. I had the most amazing year with him that I knew him. It was so surreal and as if it was never supposed to end. 
Then he was just gone.
One day, out of nowhere, he disappears on me. He had already been doing this, for a couple days at a time then he would come back and explain it was because he simply couldn't hold a conversation as much anymore, I was fine with that, sometimes I'm the same way. But this time, it was longer than just days. Days were weeks, weeks were months. It's been 4 months since we last spoke. I don't know what happened. We didn't fight, we did not trade insults in our last days, everything was normal. I've tried to contact him but to no avail. I gave up, and eventually, I became afraid to try again. 
I told others around me about what happened, and they either told me that perhaps it was because he had gotten depressed due to the quarantine and just wanted to restart. Others say I should continue to try to contact him, but I can't do that. I gained a fear of crazily messaging him due to things that happened in the past. Or maybe it's just because I'm afraid of any outcome from it. Though at one point I gained enough courage and I sent a brief message essentially saying, I'm sorry. But I never got a response. Others tell me I should just get over him, that it is entirely his fault and not mine.
But I don't believe that. I don't want to. When someone says something about him like that, I feel genuinely hurt because they're attacking him in a way. 
Anyway. From him being gone like this... I didn't want to admit it, but this has severely impacted my mental health. I know that's ridulcous, and maybe I should listen to those who say I should forget about him. But I cant. I cant. 
Everywhere I look, there are hundreds of things that remind me of him. Even the smallest things, he's the first thing that I get reminded of. Things people say or do. And to top that off, I have to be near one of his friends that do not like me at all, 5 days a week.
He is everywhere, but he is not here.
I miss him so much. There are moments that I just burst into tears because i am instantly reminded of what I have lost. Such a gentle, caring person. I miss his laughter, his stupid humor, his comfort. 
To tell you the truth, I'm sure I was in love with him eventually, but I could never tell him that. I sometimes wonder if i still do. 
I can't help but to dream of the day where I see him again, and everything is fine. But I know this will never happen. I have a low chance of seeing him eye to eye again because of certain circumstances. The last time though that I figured he still existed was that he had entered a call that I was also on with another person in charge. Of course, something silly, I almost screamed into the microphone.
Ive recently asked around about him to people that he knew or people he would eventually know. Some told me some information that led me to one conclusion, and others I'm still waiting on. I know that sounds crazy, but I just want to know that he's okay. 
Or maybe I just, want him back. Because I can't handle this anymore. He meant so much to me, to a point like nobody else ever has."
331,"Honestly, I don't know why I even try",.
332,I'm still alive.,"Today was a bit tough. It's the middle of the night and I am hundred of miles away from home, my family and the people I cherish the most. And today was fucking tough. But I'm still alive and that is such a fucking accomplishment in itself. 

I was talking to a new friend earlier and he laughed when I said that ""I'm still alive"" as one of my accomplishments. He wasn't trying to be mean, genuinely thought I was joking because, to him, being alive is just granted, something basic. 

He is a few months older than me and I have the habit of saying to people that I come to like and who are older than me ""I hope you stay older than me forever"" because it's not granted to me. I had friends, people I knew, who were older than me, and they were supposed to stay older than me forever. But now I'm older than they'll ever be. When I said that to him, he also laughed. How reality can be different to people who haven't been constantly around the idea of death...

Anyways, tonight, I'm sad. I can't do what I want, don't know what matters anymore and if I'll be like that forever. But I'm still alive and even if, for some people, it's normal, to me, it's a fucking huge, huge accomplishment. I wanna scream it, to all those motherfuckers, to the whole fucking world, to everyone, that I'm still fucking alive and I am NOT gonna die now.

DO YOU FUCKING HEAR ME?!

Even if things are hard, even if I'm crying and I feel so lonely, and it's shitty, and I hate this I'm NEVER gonna take my own life. Life can do whatever it wants, now that I've come this far I can't go back. And I'm not afraid to say it, I'm a fucking survivor. I'm gonna survive every fucking single second, day, week, month and year and I'll get better and no matter what, I know I will resist. 

And no matter what other people think, I'm so proud of myself for that."
333,How should I reply to a friend that says “it’s fine” about their suicidal thoughts because “everyone has them”,"While hanging out, I had a friend suddenly cry because they feel like they “shouldn’t be here”. I think they ended up calling a suicide hotline, but they asked for me and another friend to leave the room. 

The next day, they said “it’s fine” because “everyone has these thoughts”

My question is, should we have left? I’m not sure if they’re saying that because they feel as though they’re burdening us, or if they genuinely need time alone

I also didn’t know how to reply to “it’s fine”. Should I reassure them that their thoughts are “fine”, or should I tell them it isn’t? I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know what to say, but for next time, I want to try to help...or at least not make it worse"

I found it unfair that for some reason I have to go so long without it, and anytime I feel close I feel like it's preceded by a ton of negotiation, while for her it can ""just happen"". I know that sounds entitled but imo it's total bs that I'm jumping through all these hoops for years on end (dating apps, fetlife, old fashioned talking to girls at bars) with no results, and for her it can ""just happen"".

I tried to reassure her that it’ll be okay, but that she has to eat and exercise. She saw the stress it caused both of us, and she promised to start working out and eating. She didn’t even try to start, even with me constantly trying to remind her. It’s this sort of problem that’s been going on since we got together. She’ll have no motivation to do anything. She doesn’t even have motivation to do things for me, to gift me, to go out of her way for me for anything, and it’s been going on for so long I’m starting to question how much she loves/cares abt me. It’s been too long and I’m lost on what to do. It’s like I bring up to her something that’s been going on, she’ll realize it get upset at herself by it, say she’ll work to be better, then forget abt it by the end of the day, and the process always continues, no matter what.

344,Concerned about my mood swings,"I've been dealing with mood swings for over a year now. I mentioned it to my therapist when I first started noticing it and she attributed it to either my depression or anxiety and told me that was a perfectly normal thing to experience given the circumstances. They used to be longer episodes where I'd be in bed for a few days, then feel okay for a week, and so on. However, recently I had an episode that really made me aware of how intense things are getting.

My episodes are set off by things like minor rejections. The most recent was only a few days ago, I was out running errands and my friends (who knew I was busy) did an activity without me. I had been feeling pretty good that day, and when I heard that I completely shut down and acted irrationally. I shut myself in my room and cried for hours. I was completely inconsolable and refused to see anyone and told people I was sick so I didn't have to see those same friends later that day. I very seriously considered things like deleting social medias, blocking people, cutting contact with friends, and even hurting or killing myself. I was thinking completely irrationally and journaled a lot as a coping mechanism. (I also threw away some things and cut my hair, and I'm not sure why)

I woke up the next day and felt fine. I read some things I wrote the day before and I was in a completely different mindset. I understand that my friends knew I was busy and didn't mean any harm by not inviting me when they knew I'd say no. My friends are kind people and if I said that I felt left out, they would have remedied that or reassured me! I was writing about how my friends hate me and never want to see me again, that I'm useless, worthless, and not welcome anywhere. I feel like that was a different person.

Alternatively, some days I feel overly motivated and confident for no reason. Once, I was frustrated by reading about so much human suffering and convinced myself that I could start a religion that was so loving that people would change. I literally started planning for that. I make detailed lists and schedules about how I'm going to completely overhaul and change my life for the better, but I never stick to them.

These are day to day changes, with no pattern and completely unpredictable.

Can anyone here relate or offer some coping mechanisms? (I do not currently see my therapist for some financial and COVID related reasons but I'm starting again hopefully soon!)"
345,TW: Mentions Of Suicide (Suicide Is Not The Answer),"When I was younger I always thought about suicide and what would happen if I did commit suicide. These thoughts have stopped for me but little did I know my friend was having the same thoughts. She was a very happy and kind girl when I met her in 8th grade. She was very shy but open to friends. One day my friend had received a call. We are currently in high-school when this happened. She was her best friend because they have known each other for a long time. We found out that she shot herself in her back yard. My friend was absolutely devastated so I had to act fine and support her. The two friends live beside each other and her boyfriend had to go to her house to get something when he heard a shot being fired. He went to go check and he saw my friend. I had to take my other friend to a trail where it is peaceful and quite. I often go on this trail whenever I am stressed, need to cry, or need to talk to somebody. I hugged her for what seemed like an hour because she was affected badly by this. She talked to her everyday and she said that she showed no signs of suicidal thoughts. She left early and when I went to lunch I noticed that she posted something. Three hours before she shot herself she posted that she was drunk. We don't know whether she was actually drunk or it was just a cover up. My friend couldn't come to school because her mental health was a whole mess. She told me and one other person. I will call the other person ""Cat"". Cat decides to tell all of her friends even though she was told not to. The day after the incident a lot of people were crying and refused to tell why. I already knew why and who told them because my friend only has two other friends, me and Cat. After it was spread by her friend it was starting to spread by the whole school. The family had requested that everybody not post about it but people were making tik-toks her just to get clout. They had to shut down the website for and remove her name because it was getting so much traffic but my grandma still has a screen shot of it. She was in a hospital at the time but eventually they pulled the plug. I was absolutely devastated because I couldn't see her. I know that she found me annoying but I should have at least visited her. My mental health went down the drain and my grades started to drop. That Saturday there was a funeral and she invited Cat which was her closest friend at the time. Nobody we recognized was there. Not even Cat. None of the girls who were crying even went to the funeral. One girl we used to know went which was surprising. We all hugged the parents of my friend who committed suicide. The mother was absolutely in tears. When she hugged my friend it felt like an hour and she completely started sobbing. I hugged her but only for a short time because she didn't know me. When me and my friend went to see each other you could see where her mother had cried. I also noticed that my mother cried when she hugged the lady. My friends suicide affected so many people that I did know and didn't know. You might think suicide is the answer but it truly isn't. It has almost been 8 months since her suicide but it still affects me greatly. If you think suicide is the answer I recommend calling the suicide hotline and seeing a therapist. You might think nobody cares for you but so many people do and they just don't show it.

The cycle of my dad’s emotions. 

1. He gets mad at himself for dropping something or just for existing
2. He blames things on us which makes us in a crappy mood which we know we don’t dare talk about it in front of him
3. He forgets what he did but still is grumpy

5. Cycle repeats.

Do y’all know the show the end of the fucking world on Netflix? I can kinda relate to that show when James kills animals.

How did I not know that I was going to end up with mental illnesses (I haven’t been diagnosed with anything) but this is really messed up but I used to squish sandwiches if it fell apart. Then I ended up putting my hands around my cat’s neck and choking her. She’s fine but that was really messed up. That was a few years ago and I stopped and will *never* do that again but it was really cruel but that’s probably the first sign of my mental fucked up ness that I now recognize. 



Now I hear voices and they tell em to do some things but most I don’t act on but I’ve attempted 2 time this past year. I also have relapsed after 466 days clean. I attempted on the second day of Suicide prevention month. I relapsed and reset my I am Sober 30 times within 2 days. 


I’ve had little emotions and empathy. I’ve been suicidal. I’ve dissociated. My grades are lower than Normal. I’m having trouble focusing. I’m having trouble reading because of these mental health issues (I’m wearing the right prescription of glasses too). 


I truly don’t know how much longer I can do this."
353,study/motivation tips for online school while not feeling mentally the best?,"
Hi everyone. I started my senior year of university (finally, on my 5th year of college) about 5 weeks ago. All my classes are online. I don’t mind the classes being online since I am a homebody. However, I one, had to move back home for the time being from my university house because my roommate got COVID, and I’m TOO much of a homebody. So I never leave the house. And it’s making me have depressive episodes (I have bipolar disorder) more and more often, not wanting to leave my bed and just read (I love books) or peruse social media all day, and miss some of my zoom calls for class even though I’m at home, and purposefully not do hw assignments.

Anyways, I feel quite shitty about this. I feel like I should be doing better, but I’m not. At this point I’m still considering grad school, so I’m trying to get my GPA higher after a really hard year transferring from community college to university.

So, advice: does anybody have tips or tools to keep on top of online school is going on while not feeling mentally the best? or just tips for motivation in general? I’m Bipolar 2, so when I get hypomanic I get tons of stuff done. Which makes me FEEL like I’m getting better and productive, only to crash into depressive episodes. 

Any and all advice, motivation tips, and virtual hugs are welcome. 😃 be well, everyone!"
354,A rant and help,"I have a step mother at the beginning we got along great this was around age 6. But when I turned 7 she started to manipulate my father and sister. Tried to get me to wear dresses. Saying i was rude when i just said ""I dont remember you saying that"" I already had trama before this. She had/is making life hard. I told her i think i have ADHD and she said and i quote ""Yeah i know im not taking you to get tested because i know whats best for you and I am trying to help you"" but her help is constant nagging yelling at me to be calm and giving me goals to focus on and if i don't get it all done im in trouble. I also feel like i have DID but i am not comfortable telling my dad or her that. She wont let me go Face 2 face in school and i was planning on telling the school concluer. She also keeps saying ""So you know how much you having ADHD hurts me. Any tips? ,(I really dont feel comfortable self diagnosing"
355,I have no motivation and I feel bad.,"I'm 19 and I have bipolar/schizophrenia and I'm overly medicated. I live in my parents house and have a horrible job that pays 9.25 an hour. 

I am super uncomfortable with having close relationships. I always want to be alone. I'm a lonely person. I have a massive fear of intimacy. It makes me feel weird for some reason. I hate myself for it. I could have gotten into a relationships many times but my fear of love ruins it all. I have abandonment issues. 

I am a mess and to top of it, my mental health is horrible. I'm super paranoid and having weird dialogue with myself. I'm always talking to myself. I get random depersonalization episodes, they are so horrible I go basically catatonic. I'm not talking at all. Just a empty stare into space while thinking about how life makes no sense. Sometimes I have an idea that I'm in actual Hell. I hallucinated a black spirit man. It told me things. It told me that life is just a big bore. Join me into the secrets of life. When I sleep, I hear voices. Little chatters behind walls, sometimes I can't sleep. They scream ""STOP"". 

I rarely have an friends because i'm the schizo freak. I always talking to myself, no one wants to speak to a suicidal mentally ill person.

I have low self-esteem. I don't believe in myself. The only thing I can make myself feel somewhat ok is playing video games. I sometimes waste over my whole day playing video games just to feel ok."

Long story short. I’ve sucked at life, I’ve been trying to get better. My physical health good, but mental health is a disaster. My entire life I’ve never express my feelings to anymore, I’ve always kept everything hidden. I’ve never had anyone to talk too.

Lately I’ve been having really bad anxiety attacks. I often don’t even know what’s causing it. I just start panicking, my heart starts racing, and I don’t know what to think.

Death, school, work, money, motivation, everything. It’s rushing in and out of my head and I can’t get it out.

The only person I can think of turning too is my GF but every time I try to express my feeling about this, I just get attacked. I get told I’m the problem, I’m the one not doing enough or whatever. I need to fix it. But I can’t, I don’t know how. I don’t even know what I’m feeling but every time I try to get it out, I get punished.

It’s getting worst and I can’t take it. A professor reached out to me and I almost let it of, he said he’s there to hear my out but I can’t do it. He doesn’t seem like that type of person to want to help me. Not that he doesn’t but more like, it’s out of his expertise. He’s likely going to listen but not know what to say. 

I just want to run away and go somewhere alone that’s safe. I don’t even feel comfortable in my own house. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I want to cry but I can’t let it out. Someone please tell me how to help myself. I don’t know how to start."

360,I'm so lonely. Why don't I have any friends or relationships. Friend forgot about and has better friends than I was. He has a girlfriend now too. So lonely.,"makes me sound stupid and a loser. But my old best friend who just straight never contacted after uni finished three years ago now has a girlfriend. I remember going to school with him when I had a crush on a girl and he's the one I could talk to about it. Ever since he stopped contacting me ive known he'd be the first of us to actually have friends and girlfriends. I should be happy and we should still be friends.. I've had to see pictures of him hanging out in other countries with so many friends for the past few months. He climbs mountains with our uni friends. And now he shares pictures of himself with a girlfriend. He's got everything i ever wanted. Now I wanna cry at 2am. I'm so lonely. Like I told him back in school 'I have no personality.' That's why I'll always be lonely. :( :(

Now I'm just seeing that all the people I went school with are in relationships. I want to be an adult and have friends and a girlfriend in my pictures. I see all the people from my school liking each others stuff. Why am I not friends with anyone from school.

I'm so alone. My old friend has no idea I'm up at 4am staring at his stupid smiling face and his 43 likes and his holiday pics. I'm so lonely. My only friend just forgot about me I have no personality. I jsit wanted friends.

It's 4am and and I'm sitting up in my bed staring out the window. I'm so lonely. I'm 22 and I don't want to be any older and still coming to reddit to say how lonely I am :( I want to be like the people who went to school with me who are now happy or at least have people who like them."
361,Overcoming anxiety,"I'm a 17F struggling with anxiety, the most prevalent being social anxiety and possibly depression.

I have been going through this phase for about 5 years and my daily life has been greatly affected - I'm not able to communicate with people,  especially my classmates, I have been moving schools but I was never able to properly make friends like a normal human being, I've become such a pessimist,  consistently feeling hatred and anger, always in a state of sadness and I keep on thinking about death every single day. Even when I've made new relationships, I was never able to keep them due to this fear of socialising and I'm always missing out on oppurtunities because of this damned anxiety. At this rate I feel like I will never be able to integrate into society once I start my career. Heck, I'm not even sure if I'll be getting a job. Even at the moment of writing this,  I'm having anxiety over posting it here. I can't even communicate on social media platforms despite  anonymity and this is my first time posting something on reddit.

364,Visual intrusive thoughts?,"so i have a question. Basically when I was younger (15-17) i used to imagine some very gore filled (also less gore one for example was burning trees everywhere) images and it would muddle with my real life.  I knew they were not real images but they still affected me emotionally. At first I thought i had schizophrenia but looking into it i thought it was maladaptive daydreaming  (which didn't line up with the negative images but did line up with the fake conversations my brain let me have with fictional characters on my way home back then). After high school it stopped until some bad family stuff happened and in 2020 these images started popping up again but much more gore-y and even more negative then back when it started. I talked to a friend about it who said its probably just intrusive thoughts that are visual (especially that having intrusive thoughts line up with my depression which i ended up getting diagnosed with) however i started looking into it just to see if anyone has had such strong visual thoughts but i have not been able to find any sources. So i am asking, is there perhaps something bad going on with my brain or has it always just been part of my depression/ my brain. Or if i should discuss this with a doctor? Honestly any advice is a big help."

You know the three hour run of all the tests that’ll figure out where you lye with Autistic spectrum, bipolar, personality disorders, IQ test, and so many more. The thing is I never do those kind of tests well. I second and triple guess every answer and convince myself that I subconsciously chose an answer that was wrong. Like are you depressed 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 days out of the week. I would choose a larger number but in my head I’m like “do I just wanna say that so I get the diagnosis because I want the treatment and I need to make sure it happens”. I can never agree with myself on personality tests and so I never trust the outcome. So does anyone have any advice on how I can better trust my answers and even seduce the real ones?"

I want out. I’ve trapped myself in my room for so long, even before this corona started.  The worst of all of this is that I’ve started hating my existence, not life per-say, but my existence as a whole. I no longer know who or what to turn to.

I don’t expect anyone to read this but maybe casting these thoughts out into the void will at least lighten my spirit."

375,I'm addicted to emotional abuse,"I 22 (M) am so addicted to looking for submissive females so i can be emotionally abusive.

I have seen many reddit profiles that stated they were 18-21 yo females who just got out of a toxic relationship or people with very low self worth and esteem. Resisting the urge to message them and try to charm them to win them over, and than have total control over them is uncontrollable. 

It is a really bad habit and i don't think i wanna stop.

I want someone to submit fully to me so i can have control, control over someone so deep to the point i can shape their decisions whether it is financial or emotional. The idea of having so much control strokes my beliefs and reinforces that i am strong, powerful, ''Manly'' and that i am as capable and good as i truly think i am deep down.

I get a lot of pleasure from emotional manipulation and abuse, it genuinely makes me happy but i do experience empathy and love, just not for my victim.

I’m obsessed with finding new hobbies- first drawing, then weight lifting, then resin polishing, then screen printing tshirts and now it’s playing the drums. All within the span of a month. 

The big slap in the face from reality came when my boss confronted me. He straight up asked me what I’m avoiding. I ended up getting a promotion a few days later with a decent pay raise which is definitely a silver lining. I am so overworked and exhausted but I can’t.stop.

I’ve been through x, I don’t want anyone else to, but I’m not gonna be an activist. I don’t want to be an advocate, I want to be alive, and I’ll be damned if that isn’t enough for me as it is.

Who cares what I do with the rest of my life? I’m past surviving, I’m actually living now. And I’m not gonna be sad the rest of my life because I can’t cure mental illnesses, I’m gonna go on with the knowledge that yeah, sometimes things suck, but I got through it and I’m fine with that. I don’t need to do anything else because I’m badass enough already.

380,fear anxiety and failure or stress avoidance is preventing me from achieving and being great,"Hi,  so I am fully aware of this particular trait of mine that is holding me  back from life so hard that it's actually destroying me; it's fear and  anxiety. I have massive fear and anxiety for my ego, I cannot let it get  damaged in anyway, whether if it's being insulted, criticized, or  simply failing at a task, this causes me to avoid doing anything, to put  myself out there and really utilize 100% of my potential. How do I  overcome this? I've been trying to for so long, but as soon as I reach a  certain threshold, I just can't take it anymore and I quit and never  want to come back. For example, say I am doing extremely well at a job,  but the more I succeed, the more I become fearful and avoidant of  ruining it, so I avoid it at all cost and just quit, or if I don't quit,  I take a really really long break before I can get back at the job  again, however this is bad because it causes me to not be consistent."

I constantly question the meaning of life and I simply cannot come to a conclusion. My closest guess is that love is the meaning of life, to love the people around you and be the best person you can be. But then eventually you die, and so will they, and no one will remember. And why does it matter then?

I guess there is no meaning to life but that makes things even worse.
I wish I was religious so I could be part of a group and “know” what would happen after this life, and fully trust in (a) God. I unfortunately do not, (at least, nothing concrete) which means I’m back to square one; questioning everything and having an existential crisis.

How do you cope with knowing there is no meaning to life/what is your take on the meaning of life?"

These recent years they've gotten worse and I've started losing motivation and the will to do things. I'm just about failing every class right now. I think to myself "" what's the point in trying so hard if I'm just gonna die, eventually, a pretty insignificant person to the world"" or ""the world and my family would be better off without the extra hassle of having me around"".

I'm thinking that I'm just thinking these things and acting this way to get attention or to get recognition for the work I've put in so far. I'm not even that good of a kid. I get A's, B's, and the occasional C's. I'm mediocre at best. I tell myself that in just being excessively lazy, sensitive, needy, and a procrastinator. I also think it might just be the whole teenage angst and hormone stuff. I just feel so out of control though.

Anyway the whole point of me rambling one about this is to ask this: is this something serious I should stop trying to brush off or is it just a minor thing that will eventually blow over? Should I go try and seek help and get someone to talk to or a diagnosis of some kind or something? If so, could you guide me the right way? I've never really done anything like speak about this or asked questions about it to people IRL, so I'm kind of at a loss when it comes to these things.

384,im struggling in college and have no idea what to do,"tl;dr at bottom

i just started college out of state and am really struggling.

for reference, i go to a private college and took out a large student loan in order to attend. i don’t have a job yet, but have been looking which seems like just another thing on my to do list.

anyways, i have always been the type of person who needs their alone time. i have been able to find some, but i would really just like an hour or so to myself in the room a couple of times a week to just be alone in private and do private things (if you know what i mean.) since most classes are online and i have two roommates (not my choice, but i do like them), i never really get that alone time.

on top of this, i have been struggling with some of my classes because i can’t really find the motivation to do the classwork, especially since all freshman are forced to take two absolutely pointless classes that just assign a bunch of busy work on top of everything else we have going on. i have also been struggling to do the readings for the classes because i always find something else I would rather do. you would think that the thousands upon thousands of dollars would motivate me, but it doesn’t.

not to be cliche or anything, but im also struggling with boys and friends. so i really liked a guy and we were very physical and it made me sad that i had to leave right when my life was getting better. i think about him and our relationship almost everyday. on top of this, i met this super clingy guy on tinder when i first moved into the dorms and we went on a few dates and the feelings i have for him are strictly platonic and i think he can feel that im drifting away from him because he keeps telling me all the bad things in his life when i ask if he has a minute to talk.

as for friends, i have some roommates and girls on my floor, but none of them are my best friends and people i can necessarily confide in. i feel like they all have their friends and want to hang out with them and i just kind of third wheel and i feel like shit about it.

the people who serve my food always seem to be in terrible moods and it makes me feel really shitty. today one of the servers literally tossed the box across the counter to me. i don’t know what to do about that.

and on top of everything, i think i either have a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. i had a uti right before i left for college and took some antibiotics to clear it up, but i read somewhere that they can give you either bv or a yeast infection. im leaning more towards bv because i had it earlier this year and have very similar symptoms. my school has a free health center, but it makes me nervous making an appointment. i don’t know what to say or what pharmacy to send any medications to if need be. and i don’t want to go alone, but i don’t want to tell my roommates about it and don’t want to dump it on some random girl on my floor.

tl;dr: im kind of scared and alone in a new place with no support system. i want some time alone, but don’t know how to ask my roommates for it, im not doing great in classes because i lack the motivation i had in high school, im struggling getting over a boy from back home and with another boy i want to cut ties with because college is a lot right now and i don’t really want a boyfriend, im having a hard time with making friends, the servers in the dining hall are always in bad moods, and i think i have bv and don’t know how to get help.

i know this all seems like im some whiny kid with cliche problems compared to everyone else's, but i am really, really struggling here and its really affecting my mental health. so if anyone has absolutely any advice for any of these problems, i would appreciate it so much."

388,Anxiety and relationships,I’ve been starting to get extremely bad anxiety recently and I don’t know why. It always happens when I think anything relationship wise. I was starting to think maybe I wasn’t into females but that wasn’t true. I find them attractive and I’m not attracted to the other sex but any time I think about females in a relationship way I get very bad anxiety and I start to vomit. Idk why this happens but I just need some advice on what to do. I’ve also started to slowly hate myself. I don’t even know why or when this started but I just don’t care about myself anymore and I’m starting to think what’s even the point of living. I feel that I don’t really have anyone to talk to and that my friends are using me in some way. I would go to a therapist but because of Covid I can’t. Any advice on how to stop hating myself or over coming my anxiety would be much appreciated.

When I'm out and I see someone I know I smile at them and when they go past me, I can feel my face going back to an empty expression. I find it very hard to talk about how I'm feeling. It's been like this for a long time because of emotional trauma from a years ago and my childhood as well. It's like my brain wants to say ""I'm not okay. I need to talk to someone and cry. I need a hug"" but my mouth goes ""yeah, I'm fine. How are you?"" 
I'm scared that when all this gets too much to handle on my own, I'm going to have a terrible breakdown."

400,I dont know how I feel (TW mentions of suicide and self harm),"I've been feeling so weird for the past week. I've been feeling so disconnected from everyone. Or that I've been annoying everyone. I'm not replying to group chats much. I dunno ive been in a depressive episode for a bit and it's weird. Last week I was able to play video games. This week im not able to find joy in anything. Everything is so boring. I've been cutting myself. Worse than I ever had. It's not bad, but I've never really broke skin before. Now i do it almost every night and I see the blood and make more cuts. But I still feel like it's not enough. I've been feeling so empty. I feel like I could just stop existing and everyone would be so relieved. I dunno. I dont want to be here. I'm scared. But at the same time i couldn't care less. I want it ti end. I want the emptiness to end. I want to feel the good things again. I want to be able to enjoy things again. It's so hard to live. I havent been eating much, not like I've been hungry. I dont want to eat. I dont want to do school work. I dont want to take care of myself. I dont want to get up jn the morning. I dont want to be alive rn

Ive been too empty to cry. I just want to cry again . it's been too long especially compared to how much I did before... this week maybe? 


I dunno.. i feel like nobody cares... like none of my friends care. A few times I'll talk to them when I'm bad mentally. But it doesn't really help so I just thank them and continue to pretend to be ok 


It's so hard pretending everyday. All the time. I want it to end. I dont wsnt to be here"
401,Anxiety And Anger,"I have been dealing with persistent anxiety over the past couple years and have gone through periods of more and less intense worry. Recently, when I’m feeling anxious I’ve begun experiencing almost irrational anger usually about the conditions that cause my anxiety. This has led me to come across as rude to people when I’m experiencing intense moments of anxiety. I really hate this and usually I’m able to mask my anxiety symptoms but feel I no longer can’t. Are anxiety and anger linked? Does this mean my symptoms are getting worse?"
402,Just started seeing this therapist and I can already tell she's useless.,"I had my second appt with my new therapist (third one so far) and I was telling her that I've started having these experiences where I start to have, like, an out-of-body experience (I don't know how to describe it well, that's the best way I can) and they end in headaches and dizzy spells. I've been having these headaches and I finally made the connection. She told me that I just need to ""start thinking about things more positively in order to tame [my] anxiety."" Are you kidding me? ""Start thinking more positively""? Useless. I think I'm going to quit this again, but my thoughts are starting to scare me and I feel like I'm only getting worse.

Agh. I'm sorry. Thanks for listening."

I’m extremely self conscious about my voice even though I’m sure it sounds fine to other people, I’ve been told as much but it doesn’t even matter. I’m so tired, I’m barely sleeping anymore because of the stress and I’m worried it’ll affect my work. I want to reach out and get help, and come to terms with my what happened, but when I tried I couldn’t even talk to the person. I tried a text line but got nowhere, wasn’t told anything I didn’t know, and was brushed off after 20 minutes. I just sat alone in my car and cried because I realized it’s impossible for me to get help because I can’t even listen to myself"
406,My Social Anxiety is Ruining My Life,"I should give some context, when I was a child, I was bullied for the majority of elementary school, around 5 years, for being gay. If it matters, I am not gay, they labeled me as such because I became friends with a classmate who had licked some girl back in kindergarten, which made him gay for some reason. I got targeted by the bullies a small bit at first, but after my friend had moved away, I became the target of all the name-calling and social exile that came with being labeled as gay. (Social exile as in because I was labeled as the gay kid, nobody wanted anything to do with me, so they ran away from me at recess, spat on me when I walked by, and generally shunned me from anything and everything.)

My home life wasn't any better during this time, as my step-dad, which I will refer to as Evil Step-Dad from now on because reasons, was even more abusive than my classmates. He would call me fat, work me and my younger siblings like slaves, withhold dinner because I was fat, complain that life was way harder when he was a kid, whoop us for little things like spilling ice on the floor, and yell in our faces whenever we did something wrong. So you can see this was a dark time in my life. It went on like this for longer than the bullying at school did. The bullying lasted from 3rd grade to 6th grade, even when I got held back in 5th grade to escape them, it still happened.

My mom and Evil-StepDad were together since I was around 5 or 6 and didn't divorce until I was 17 and in my Sophomore year of High School. You're probably wondering what happened with my mom during all this, well she had to work double shifts at her job because Evil DoucheBag had a back injury because he fell off some machinery while he was high off his nuts. So she had to work overtime while he tortured us.

TL;DR: Because of being shunned from both sides during my childhood, my anxiety became so bad that even talking to someone I don't know face-to-face causes me to shut down, I've lost jobs because of this. Yes, I've gone to therapy and it helped me get over my depression, but the anxiety is still there, and from what I've heard, it will always be there. It's ruining my life because my crippling social anxiety won't allow me to move forward in my life, so I'm stuck in the same place, fearing what will happen when I have to talk to another human being again.

407,I feel like I have a mental illness but I don’t know what it is,It started 4 years ago.. it feels like every time I get a bad memory in my head I have to wash hands or wiggle hands to get rid of that memory from my mind.

I don’t know if everyone feels the same way or I am the only one who has this issue.

408,What does coming down from bipolar mania feel like?,"Over the past week, I have been feeling unusually confident, energetic, and very alert. I have also been more talkative. I’m not sure if this has to do with the fact that I am trying to be more present and observant of my surroundings and therefore feel less anxious or inhibited/in my head, or if it’s some sort of mania. 

But earlier today I felt like I “crashed”. Physically, I had a slight ringing in my ear and it felt like I was starting to lose hearing in one ear for a few seconds. And then mentally the self-doubt, insecurity, and feelings of resentment and jealousy started to creep back in. 

Is this normal burnout and exhaustion from just constantly trying to be “on” all week or is this something else?"

413,Has anyone else had an adverse experience with Prednisone (steroid)?,"I went to urgent care yesterday because I had mild yet frequent pain and ringing in my ears. Found out I have an ear infection! The doctor prescribes me a few things with one of the being Prednisone. I had remembered the name before but wasn’t sure what side effects I had experienced while taking the medication. Whelp... probably 5 hours later my resting pulse is 120 and I feel like I’m going to have a panic attack. I remember taking it a few years ago and felt “crazy” bc my mind was swirling and heart racing. I already struggle with overstimulation so I felt like it was all too much. I take Lexapro (anti-anxiety) &amp; a high blood pressure medication so I wonder why the doctor still prescribed it the steroid? Ended up calling her to ask if I can not take the meds since today was my first day of doing so. Thankfully I can!

Has anyone else been poorly affected by this steroid or other meds like it??"
414,Supporting my roommate after suicide attempt?,"Pretty much what the title says and also a TW for suicide mention. 

My husband and I’s roommate attempted suicide tonight. Thankfully, he told me before I went to bed and I was able to get him to the hospital. Due to COVID restrictions, I was not able to stay with him so I was sent home but I doubt I’ll be able to sleep tonight.

He may be admitted to the psych ward (depending on his assessment tomorrow) and I’m trying to get advice on how best to support him when he’s home with us. 

I know that after my own attempt, I wanted space but that me seems like she existed so long ago and I’m not sure it was the healthiest desire/response to trying to kill myself. Just trying to see what I can do to make him feel more comfortable?"

Just some little math problem(homework) is too much for me I tried to solve it but I can’t think logically;-; the teacher somehow explained me how it’s going “solve” but then when I got home fucking didn’t know how to do it I had to write an essay I mean yea it takes time but my mentality couldn’t take its time to even choose a topic on my own for this essay 
It’s due today And I didn’t do any shit
I just get mental breakdowns and like first I wasn’t aware about the voice in my head but then they just boomed in and there was this voice of my mom how she always say why can’t u do it even little kid can do it why are u so dumb you aren’t enough..I had are harder life than u I needed to do everything when I was 10y/o and u say that u have mental problems u don’t even do anything sir at home have no job but still be sad/anxiety/depression just without any doing shit.

417,How can one deal with anger,"I’ve always been quite aggressive. I lash out when things don’t make sense or I doubt my abilities and I really want to stop that. It’s explosive and always ready to boil over. I’m not really an angry person, it’s just my family and reminders of my “failures” that push me over the edge. How can I be less angry? How do I express it in a way that isn’t destructive. Anger isn’t a bad thing but this is getting to the point where it’s abusive and self deprecating. When angry I’m also quite impulsive and self harm to bring the anger down (I have stapled my arm before just to calm down.) 

How do I be better for myself and my loved ones. We both deserve peace."
418,"I just cancelled my appointment with my counselor because I couldn't do my ""homework""","He told me to take notes about my intrusive thoughts and a bunch of other things, but I can't.

And it's embarrassing to share any sort of info with anyone that is not a complete stranger. I don't know you guys, so I can talk. But the moment it becomes clear that someone might recognize me later, it becomes pointless to share anything. I'm scared of writing, but they're like just try. No. I don't think about counseling/work/school or any other situation that goes outside my home in my home aside from when I'm overly distressed. I hate to connect what I do in various environments. Me on reddit is not me at home is not me outside my home. That's it."

420,"Why is it so hard to tell her “as much as I can find myself to be happy with you, I just don’t find you attractive”","Like I know it will hurt her, but it’s the truth"
421,My teachers are assigning way too much work and its destroying me mentally,"So for context, when my school started doing at home learning during quarantine, they assigned work for all 7 classes once per week. This was easier on me mentally as I felt I was in no hurry. This year they changed it from once per week to once per day. They had also offered to do school in person (which is a DUMB idea). I took the at home route because I don't wanna get COVID and risk getting my family infected. 

A few weeks ago my science teacher assigned us a project that would take really long. I had initially put it off til the due date thinking I could do it in one day, which was a HORRIBLE mistake. I had spent several days on science ALONE just trying to figure out what they were trying to ask us to do. On top of that I still have my other classes to work on. This led me to figure out the hard way that you CAN'T put stuff off during this class. This means students have BARELY any time to themselves.

I know people in the comments are gonna be like ""Just suck it up and do it!"" And to that I say DOES IT LOOK LIKE I CAN TAKE SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT ANY TIME TO MYSELF JUST TO WORK ON MY SCIENCE CLASS ON TOP OF MATH, LAW, GOVERNMENT,  AND VIDEO PRODUCTION? Seeing my progress bar on the school program I use say ""Slightly Off Pace"" due to me putting off science work only to learn the hard way that you can't do that despite them giving no warning is destroying my mental health and making me cry and pull all nighters just to do work.

My parents don't want me to pull all nighters even if its for doing school work because they say YoU hAvE pLeNtY oF TiMe tO dO iT dUrInG tHe dAy even though science alone takes most of the day. Its like they just hate me and want me to be a perfectionist when it comes to school. I would get angry at them but the last time I did my dad threatened me saying they would destroy every electronic in my possession and my mom agreed to go through with it if I ever got mad at them again. I have considered running away, but I want to stay in contact with people like my brother and my friends. I have also tried contacting my school to tell them to SLOW DOWN on the work, but they gave no response (because expecting school to be useful would be like expecting Aqua from Konosuba to be useful)

All of this has nearly gotten me to crack under the pressure and cry. I don't know what to do about this. I'm trying my hardest to do the science work but the directions are so vague I don't understand what they're trying to make me do."
422,Self Care,"Im just realizing that recently I’ve been so bad at taking care of myself. Like it’s not even that i don’t have the energy to do certain things like eat, shower, drink water, etc. I just.. don’t. 

Eating recently has also been so down. I’ve had such a lack of appetite i don’t wanna eat and i have to make myself eat a full plate of food. I get hungry eventually but after a few bites i think “okay i don’t feel hungry anymore i don’t want any food anymore” but i know that’s not right. (Recently I’ve been giving into that more and a sub thought of nah i should save my calories for later)

(Also I’ve considered eating disorder but I’m not excessive about anything i just don’t really eat much and i don’t have any goal in mind)

Sleeping is my second biggest issue. I don’t know why but I’ll stay up at late times even though i know i have school early the next day. So i wake up generally fine after maybe three hours of sleep but after it catches up on my and find myself micro napping if i don’t sleep more. And i know i should sleep but i just won’t. 

That’s the most frustrating part KNOWING what i have to/ should do but just ignoring it and ultimately suffer in the end. I guess this is what becoming an adult it"
423,I feel too ashamed to talk to someone,"I feel too ashamed to talk to someone. She's a girl I went to highschool. We were good friends and I was into her, but when university came I avoided talking to her completely. 



Its only been recently that I realised I have a fear of intimacy. And I avoided talking to her because of that. But I don't think a fear of intimacy describes what I felt best. I didn't want to talk to her because I felt ashamed. 




I still think the right thing to do is to talk to her, but I don't want to at the same time because I feel still feel ashamed I can rationalize that all I want, but I'll still feel ashamed. Shame is a very powerful feeling. It's a deep sinking in my stomach; a feeling of impending doom. A fear of death. 



Which makes sense. Shame, I find, is an intense fear of social rejection or abandonment from a group, something that would be fatal more often than not in primitive society. We are still monkeys after all. 



That why I keep my thoughts in my head. I don't want to do nothing. I do want to talk to her again. I'm pretty sure that's the right thing to do. I want to confront my mental illness and my past. 



So I'm taking baby steps by making this post.  If there is a better subreddit for this please redirect me."
424,"Grounds for expunging mental health record from public health, also my struggle ; MH background.","I've been misdiagnosed and have had my life history misinterpreted and invalidated and I'm upset about this because this will cause more issues with doctors who may come across whom may feel apprehensive regarding future treatments.

I self admitted a few years ago due to progressively declining mental health from losing employment and reactivation of trauma coping mechanisms. I had my drink spiked as well as smoking some uncured cannabis due to shady connections which had me going to the ER. This was reported as psychosis and I agree. 

As a result they looked at my lifestyle, I came clean about past issues only those issues were swept under labels which do not currently apply to my present state. After meeting one therapist she recognized those impairments and understood my behavior which I've come to realize now where I felt a sense of relief from the acknowledgement. Many have agreed this is due to ADD, trauma and schizoid/ASD (high functioning traits). 

The wording of everything to me has to recognize that I'm not psychotic and don't have a substance disorder, only the treatment options available to me follows along this expert advice, all those treatments just exacerbate the sense of emptiness or apathy. It can be hard to function. I know people with substance use disorder and they feel they're trapped in this cycle whereas I may use (cannabis) to manage the impairment along with ADD as well as anxiety. When I'm not I drink a lot more than I should and I hate that. While I do experience depression this for me appears to be SADS (seasonal affective - undiagnosed but noted by therapist) so being recommended medications is something I'm apprehensive about unless they reduce impairment or distress.

I feel doctors treat me like a drug seeker. The more I feel like they don't acknowledge my distress the more I'm inclined to go into a place of hopelessness. I'm not a suicidal person but worst case scenarios are rarely discussed, the feeling of helplessness and not having my life validated as something of a concern SHOULD be a concern .. why should it need to come down to a point in my life where I'm trying to help myself and then not being treated seriously just because I haven't done anything 'crazy' to warrant professional care.

Anyway, incase there are professionals here reading this very worded and tangential post this is intended to give consideration to my background and experience. I've done quite a bit of research into my issues and despite knowing a lot more about myself I feel this only brings more question onto reasons I'm seeking help and the treatments that I feel may work with improving quality of life coincidentally appears to be someone who is a drug seeker.

The reason I need my record expunged is I don't want those inaccuracies and reporting of symptoms to hinder me on my path of improving. I really do and this is why it bothers me. What can I do about this ?

I just needed to see if anyone out there knows or has experience similar to mine in a way I can move forward, I may delete this post but this is just something I need to put out there."
425,Saw a recent video of myself and now I am Seesawing between Suicidal Ideation and the desire to stop feeling this way!,"I have low self worth in general.  Specifically around relationships and being able to be a success overall in life.  Which make suicidal ideation something I've struggled with on and off for a long time.

I have always believed that I could turn things around eventually.  That I wasn't as bad as I feared or that there was hope for love and joy in life etc 

In some ways of late I have proved how critical MINDSET is and how it can make you feel 

But feelings aren't facts and seeing myself in a recent video gave me a wtf moment. That's me?  The judgements I would give someone like me .   Even with recent wieght loss, I thought I was harsh before but now? There's so much to address to feel like I'm even NORMAL.

From my posture, to a lisp/way I talk, to how I move.  

Add in how I look normally and gym/weight loss can only do so much..  Even if I became like those body builders I'd be a butt his face.  Ugh

I am not saying this to be harsh as I know it sounds this way.  This is what I believe I would get from over half the population.  2.5 Stars or Lower. 

And I don't want to accept it.  I know how this sounds that my self worth is based on how others view me . Or that sexual status equals self worth by I'm trying to dig into this. But I'm not sure what to make of it . 

said differently if you want a mate you have to be able to attract them and I feel nothing I do will attract someone I'd want.  

I am aiming to do my best to prove this wrong over the next couple of years.  But I think I am just on the clock.  Because if I cannot find happiness and connection in. That time.  

I will give up.  Assuming I don't hit there before then"
426,Unhappy with how I look.,"I have a lazy eye, it’s extremely noticeable and I’m very self conscious about it. It looks exactly like the Exotropia eyes in this pic: [link](https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.155.175/c3r.3e7.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/strabismus-1.jpg)

428,I cannot feel happy anymore. School is too stressful to handle.,"I am 15 years old (male). I am one of the best at my class. During the quarantine everything was good, and this year was the best of my life. Now when my school is open, I cannot be happy, I cannot stop thinking about school. When I'm having fun, I always think ""I could be studying"". 

Yesterday was my breaking point. We had a lot of homework, and I wasn't able to learn it all. The problem was that when I was Learning, I was thinking ""It is too much, there is no way you can learn all of that."" I told it to my mom. She knew what I was going through, we have talk about this a few times this month. But this time I was hopeless, I was crying. She said that she will make a psychiatrist appointment. And I am not going to school tomorrow.  This is the first time I am not going to school for something else than physical illness, and I feel bad. Like I didn't have a reason to not go to school. 

I don't know what should I do anymore. I cannot learn like this or even be happy. And I have almost all the time headaches. I felt sad from school for years but never it was never this serious. I don't even know what is happening with me. Please someone who understand this, I would appreciate any help.

Sorry for bad English."
429,Need support,I am diagnosed with anxiety and major depression. My mom has schizophrenia and is in the hospital again after being suicidal. She called my brother and I to say goodbye last night. She said there was a bug in her nervous system that essentially was taking over her body. That she was in the bath and was going to  cut herself. We got her out of the tub and talked to her until the police came. She is in the hospital now. I don’t know how to feel. I am so far from normal at this point.
430,"Heres my story, none of the things ive listed effect my life negatively but it just cropped up today and my curiosity led me to asking my family questions and they suggested I should visit a therapist. Believe the story or not idk if I should be concerned about my habits.","I was a Catholic for a majority of my life, I am now an atheist, but I have one experience from my childhood that hinges my doubt that there is an afterlife. Ive told many people this story but nobody ever believes me or give me an explanation that doesn’t seem plausible to me, the reason I think they don’t believe me is because of pop culture and the many many MANY ridiculous stories told by liars. 

When I was real young I lived in an apartment complex in Mrytle Beach SC ( 1356 Glenn’s bay rd apt 207E, Is the exact address if anyone cares about investigating, I havent lived there for many years) my mother tucked me into bed and walked out the room, and maybe 30 seconds after the door slammed shut and locked, it wasn’t a slow shut, it closed very fast and loudly. My parents were freaking out and I think my dad used a coat hanger to unlock the door, thats all there is to the story but its still unsettling to me. 

Ive had people tell me it was an AC closing the door, I doubt that could be it but I dont even remember if a vent was near the door. If someone can tell me if anyones died at the complex or any information id be really interested.

Edit: Id thought Id add that when the door shut I hid under the covers and did not look around my room, I didnt cover myself fully and my legs were not covered, it was the probably scariest experience of my life and to this day I feel uncomfortable about doorways, I always will close a door to a room that im not in so I cannot look into the room, yes I close the door. That may sound counter to my fear but I am just paranoid that I will see something out of the corner of my eye peeking from the door frame, this never happened to me, its just a fear of mine. And rarely, somedays when I feel particularly paranoid I will jam something in between the door and the frame such as a baseball glove and sleep with the cover over my head with my body as close to the wall as possible. I am an adult now and thats embarrassing but its true. If someone else is in a room with me or im sleeping with another person, or dog, I feel completely fine and have no fear.

Another thing I remembered while writing this, when I start talking about creepy stuff, I do not like any blind space between my back and the wall. Im laying in the middle of the room right now a couple of feet away from the wall, it doesnt overly freak me out but its in the back of my head.

If its a late night and im watching TV on the couch I DO NOT want to be able to see into my room with or without the lights on, the empty room is creepy to me. If there are walls where there are sharp turns to the left or right where a person could be behind that is another thing that freaks me out. Some days when I am showering, I  

hate that I cannot see past my shower curtains to the rest of the bathroom and will open them to have vision of the bathroom and most importantly the mirror, mirrors are freaky. Some days ill be completely fine and have no fears, other days im have fear about doorways and whatnot.


Im reposting this on a couple forums to see if anyone can help me get into contact with the landlord or owner (Or current residents) of the apartment so I can ask him my ridiculous questions if he would even take them seriously or even answer them. Ive been looking but to no avail. 

One more weird thing that I didnt think about at the time was one of the images that I cant find again was a guys head peaking around one of the door frames in the hallway and empty apartment, I swear on my life. Take that with a grain of salt if you want but i thought that was creepy. Im trying to find it again."
431,BPD misconceptions,"I have been reading a lot about BPD and how it affects people, and I have been a part of the BPD group on reddit for a while, and I get so frustrated at the misconceptions around it.

These ideas that it's ""female narcissistic personality"" really hurt, particularly as there are a good deal of make sufferers too, who then don't feel seen, or feel wrong.

There's also a lot of ideas that it's just psychopathy with a different name, that people with BPD are dangerous and unhinged, when that just simply isn't the case. I understand that there may be a very small minority that these symptoms do overlap, as there are with a lot of diagnosis, but this idea that every single person with BPD is dangerous is so awful, and it makes it that much harder to get help as professionals will refuse to treat or see you.

I know this is likely to be ignored, but I really just wanted to share my views on this, it hurts so deeply that these misconceptions and cruel comments are allowed to perpetuate and essentially cause such harm to a whole community.

I really hope that one day these ideas of the community can change, and I hope that I can at least make one person think about their attitude towards bpd. 
Thank you."

435,Tw: eating disorder.,"Hi guys, new here so I’m sorry if this goes against any rules but I have a question. Does anybody else here suffer from restriction anorexia and sometimes you feel like you’re doing pretty well (it never leaves the back of my head but I manage) but then you become sick or unwell or in my case had a bunch of dental surgeries in a short amount of time and you’re unable to eat the way you usually would and therefore start to lose weight. And then once you start to lose weight you kind of like it and then all of a sudden you’re right back to square one, obsessing and wanting to lose more? I’m just trying to figure out if I’m just even more crazy than I’ve already been told I am. Thanks guys."
436,Depression vs Sadness,"**Depression is defined, as per the American psychological association, as a mood disorder characterized by persistently negative feelings and changes in one’s thoughts and behavior. Over 25% of the global population suffers from depression and makes it the most common mental illness globally.** 

**25% of the global population. That means approximately one in four people.** 

**Here are six essential things that may help improve your understanding of the difference between sadness and depression.**

## SYMPTOMS

**Depression causes a variety of symptoms. Symptoms may change from time to time. Men, women may feel different types of symptoms.** 

**If you have been experiencing any of the following signs and symptoms for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:**

#### SYMPTOMS FOR MEN :

* **Anger, irritability, or aggressiveness**
* Feeling anxious, restless, or “on edge
* Loss of interest in work, family, or once-pleasurable activities
* Problems with sexual desire and performance
* Feeling sad, “empty,” flat, or hopeless
* Not being able to concentrate or remember details
* Feeling very tired, not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much
* Overeating or not wanting to eat at all
* Thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts
* Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems
* Inability to meet the responsibilities of work, caring for family, or other important activities
* Engaging in high-risk activities
* A need for alcohol or drugs
* Withdrawing from family and friends or becoming isolated

#### SYMPTOMS FOR WOMEN

* **Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood**
* Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
* Irritability
* Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
* Decreased energy or fatigue
* Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
* Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
* Moving or talking more slowly
* Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
* Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
* Changes in appetite or weight
* Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
* Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without an exact physical cause that do not ease even with treatment

## SADNESS IS AN EMOTIONAL REACTION, BUT DEPRESSION IS A MENTAL ILLNESS

**Much like sneezing and coughing can be due to irritants like pepper, but you don’t have a cold. Similarly, you can feel sadness, but this doesn’t always mean a diagnosis of depression. Sadness is a part of the natural and emotional spectrum of healthy human emotions. That all of us experience at times throughout our lives. Feeling sad is a normal response to hurt or distress, and it also comes and goes, fading when the trigger is no longer present.** 

**Depression does not come and go. It doesn’t come up only in response to hurt and distress. It’s merely present. Depression is one of the most misunderstood mental illnesses in the world. It is affecting over 16.1 million people in the United States alone.** 

## SADNESS IS BRIEF BUT DEPRESSION IS PERSISTENT

**Sadness is only an emotional state, it doesn’t usually last very long. Most people feel sad about something for only a few hours or a few days at a time, and after that, it usually fades on its own. Depression doesn’t. Depression is chronic and depressive episodes can last to months or even years, especially if left untreated. It’s a severe condition that requires psychological intervention from a mental health care professional before it can get better.** 

## SADNESS IS SPECIFIC. DEPRESSION IS VAGUE

**While sadness can sometimes seem to hit out of the blue, there usually is a reason behind it. Specific nameable events like failing at a task, disappointment in a job, or losing a loved one can elicit sadness. So while it’s easy to share and open up what’s making us sad, the same can’t be said for depression. Unlike sadness, depression is not a reaction to a negative situation. A common difficulty is that those struggling with depression don’t understand why they’re depressed.** 

**While it’s true that specific events in most cases can occasionally trigger depressive episodes, depression seems to develop for no reason at all.**

437,I’ve been finding myself PERPLEXED with women and it irritates and confuses me.,"From women who ignore then send walls of text to women who have fake emotions to women who I invite on a date and meet up 2 days later and somehow forget it’s a date to women who claimed to have sex with a ghost to women who ask to see my dong then got offended when I asked if she wanted to bang. 

WTF?"
438,I wanna get alot off my chest if you're willing to listen,"I've been having nights where I don't sleep and I just stay up and do whatever, tonight for example. But tonight and many others I've started thinking too much and start being sad. By that I mean I think pessimistic and depressed. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a long while now but I've never acted on them and blown then off as a stupid idea, cause it would only cause more harm than good. I always lie to my therapist with most things, she told me that there were 3 things that wouldn't be kept between me and her. I think that they were harm to self, harm to others, and abuse. I'm not sure but I lie cause telling others my woes would only make things worse for me and cause trouble for thoes who care for me making them, feel worried and sad. I do feel there will be a breaking point somewhere, when I've had enough bullshit from my family. Yes my family is a good one, but I've picked up on little hypocracy and ignorance. I think that it's cause I don't tell them what they need to know about me. I feel at some point I'll just snap and start laying out everything that  I've kept pent up my whole life. My dad used to use volume to express how angry he was, I wanna hit that breaking point so I can do the same to him. I think that finally letting everything out will be the best thing to happen to me in a long while but I don't want to do it calmly if I ever do it at all. If I do it that way I'll be veurnuable and I won't be able to carry the strength of how horrible I feel and deliver my message. If I do it in an outburst then I'll be able to express the strength of my emotion. Another thing that bugs me is how I avoid contact but I really really want contact, I can't remember the last time I really hugged someone. I avoid it now because if I ever got a meaningful and heartfelt hug from someone I care about, I would break down and start doing whatever to vent. I've realized while writing this I am very against veurnuablility and I am all facade. I put it up so well I feel it a little but underneath I am me. TL;DR I am very sad and I lie very well so that I and others don't have to deal with my own crippling depression."

440,What's wrong with me?,"Im very shallow. I don't feel the same other people feel. I Just know it. 

I can't feel love for my family other than my kids. I would have done anything for them, i love them to death. I Just can't understand why i can't feel love for anyone Else.

I struggle to maintain relationships with people and i often feel like others are fake when they tell me they love me. Its becuase i know i dont love them, and i tell them i love them too.

I rarely cry, i Just go on with my life when Things happen.
I have broke up with two boyfriends, both of whom i were in a relationship with for many years. I dont miss them and i dont care. They stilk struggle to get over me.

I Just dont understand why my feelings are so shallow. Is there someone here Who have experienced the same?"

442,Vent family story?(maybe gonna delete this),"It’s kind of dumb but sometimes when I sit in the bathroom at a pretty late time then I get these shit thoughts like looking at my wrist and getting this urge 
 but then I’m scared not bcuz of dying I’m  scared that I make others feel shit 
My mom always says I’ve raised u with all alone w/so much hard work and stress and Blabla and then u want to go (i just joked about it becuz she watched a drama) and I was just idk she lost her little brother(my uncle) and I heard that he had some problems too but he never told anyone he just drunk alcohol and had alcoholic problems(he had something like a bar and then he started drinking occasionally and then he drunk more when he was sad) and took sometimes a overdose of pills..my mom told me that I resemble him when she’s is looking at me but not in a good way like in a bad way that I look like a psychopath or someone with mental health problems hah what an irony :D
I mean she said that when she looks in my eyes that I have like the same depressed stare but I just laughed off.

I mean I didn’t even know him that much although he had a lil anger problems too and he didn’t want to marry this women(my aunt?) this women was the big sister of my dad and she is really shit too like 
My uncle and my mom were forced to marry her and my dad and that’s where all the shit begun 
I could say that I have a broken family? 
But my mom says that family that only matters is 
My siblings + my parents and others aren’t our family 

And I would’ve even probably kill the family side of my dad after my mom told me what happened and it’s too much like even if I didn’t existed at that time I still get angry over it that I could just idk

It’s just a fucked Asian family so let’s just pretend to be a “good” family

443,I'm addicted to my new smartphone which my parents bought me for my birthday. And I think I'm going insane.,So my birthday came around in August and my parents gifted me a new powerful smartphone. i was already addicted to my old smartphone but i convinced my parents that i would control my usage and they gave me a last chance. Recently they've almost given up on me. They used to keep saying that using so much phone will damage your brain and make you go crazy but at the time i thought that was not true and my brain was strong enough. Recently I've been hardly getting any sleep because my mind is out of my control. Random thoughts start coming up random songs start playing and it's almost like I'm half asleep at all times I can't even control my own thoughts. This happens once a week. I use instagram 5 hours a day and I think it has taken a toll on me. I've always been smart in school and i didn't have to study much but still get decent scores. I wasted one whole year of college being addicted to my smartphone too. I don't know what to do I've deleted all the apps I've been addicted to.
444,Does anyone else feel this way?,"I am stuck
I don't know what im doing with this life thing and it gets frustrating...I havent found my niche and everyone else around me seems to be doing something meaningful
I often feel alone and deal with it in probably one of the most unhealthiest way...I isolate myself..distance myself from everyone and everything
I dont answer calls from my friends...and when I do i just give excuses to get me out of meeting any of them and spending time with them
I feel like I have lost many of my friends this way and the the worst part is I dont want to or feel the need to do anything about it
I sometimes tell myself that im gonna be productive but I just dont find the strength to do anything which leads to me feeling worse about myself..its like an endless loop that you cant break yourself out of
I am generally a closed off person and I find it really hard to tell people what i feel or what's going on in my head which guess what...only makes things worse for me
So I genuinely want to know if anyone else feels this way or im long lost into the dark abyss that is my head"

446,Scared of taking antidepressants.,"Finally after years of waiting and not getting the right treatment I need, I finally got the chance to get professional help.

The problem is I am really scared of taking antidepressants, I've been prescribed once before accompanied with antipsychotics and gave me really bad side effects and once a doctor misdiagnosed me with having bipolar, she is a really bad doctor and gave me the wrong meds that made me agitated and gave me psychosis plus made my symptoms much much worse, that I need to stop taking it cold turkey and that made me paranoid and psychotic for 1 1/2 weeks.

I'm 17 and I live in a third world country and there are just limited doctors here in my place and most of them are bad and the good doctors are in the capital, luckily they launched a telemental health here and the doctors are from the capital. It's just that I still have a phobia about meds especially antipsychotics, and I am afraid that it might change my personality or make me worser."

451,Wanting to get better but stuck at a crossroads,"I'm just trying to get a bit of outsider advice, hopefully from someone who might have been through the same thing before. 
I'm from Australia, and i'm literally like 5 weeks away from finishing year 12, and oh god has something ever felt like so close but so far away. I'm normally a really high performing student, enough to get financial aid and scholarships from my college and to get early entries into uni, but at the beginning of this year i hit an absolute massive wall and have been struggling with mental health and being productive since then.
Grades have dropped flat, picked up a nasty habit of lying to people about being ok, went to see a psychologist a few times, had bits of improvement. 
The biggest and most recurring thought i've had is that i'm a broken machine, that i can't operate at the level i used to be able to. i've had advice on trying to get back into working hard, into not placing so much pressure on myself, e.c.t., 
Really my main concern is that i think im certain that i don't want to go to university next year, or any time in the future. College has already been so much stress, and i truly want to do something good with the talents i have, but trying to study medicine like my original plan was might just lead to disaster. so now im just scared, idk what to do. i think the best idea would be drop out of any kind of acedemia so i don't end up necking myself, but i wouldn't know what to do after.
any ideas on fufilling jobs that don't require uni?"
452,My mental health team are pushing me to do things that are making me worse,"I’ve been out of hospital since the beginning of the year, the longest I’ve been admission free in 7 years.
Social distancing started a month or so after I was discharged so the person that I see and that brings me my medication (who I don’t really get on with, but we keep things amicable) started only dropping my meds at the door once every two weeks, no check ins, just “here’s your meds, the weather is nice, bye”, which I didn’t mind because I don’t really like talking to them (they’ve lied to other professionals before to have me unnecessarily sectioned so I don’t open up to them at all anymore). 

Anyway. I was stable. They took seeing me for 2 mins at the front door as a sign that I’m doing great. They told me to get a job. I did that, I started volunteering at a shop twice a week. The manager at the workplace knew about my diagnosis and would -what felt like- test my things I said trigger setbacks (I sat with them before starting to talk about what I felt comfortable sharing to try and make the workplace a safer place for me) which honestly fucked me up a lot. I ended up pretty much bed bound if I wasn’t at work and my family were majorly concerned but we can’t tell professionals that because the first thing they say to me is “we need to admit you before things get worse”. 

I told the person that brings my meds that I really didn’t like working there and the people were going out of their way to do things that would fuck up my head. Their response? “Every new job is hard... you’ll get used to them if you do more days. It’s good for you to be moving on”
I ended up on the verge of a suicide attempt at the end of August and my family asked me to stop working at that place, take some time to stabilise myself again and then try something new. They admitted their concerns that i’d be dead soon with how fast things are getting bad. 

Mom and I told the person that brings my meds out that I quit to take some time to get a bit more stable again and they basically went off on one about how they disagree with my decision and are pushing me to start work again. 

I took myself off my meds in March (I’ve never agreed with taking them, I’ve always been on CTO’s which have forced me to take the drugs, although I feel I should mention I’m not on a CTO anymore so I’m not breaking any rules by coming off them. Meds are fine if you feel they work for you but they don’t for me) but I can’t tell the services that or they’ll send me back to hospital so I’ve just got a massive hoard of tablets in my room. Nobody knows. I feel so close to the edge. The mental health services are pressuring me into living a “normal” life at a pace that’s too fast for me but when I tell them I’m struggling with the things they’re telling me to do, they act disappointed in me.

I’m letting everyone down. My family shouldn’t be thinking about me killing myself. The work place shouldn’t have done what they did but I feel like I’ve majorly inconvenienced them in starting only to quit soon after. The services are getting frustrated that I’m not where they think I should be. I just feel like a burden. I stay in my bedroom so nobody has to deal with me but I’m just taking up space I don’t need to. I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t know what to do."
453,I thought I had it under control,"My first post here and honestly I never thought I would need to post myself..

I'll try and keep this short and make sense, it's all sudden for me and I'm still processing it and barely know what's going on

I had 2 consecutive dreams last night about the same thing, I usually get this when I have wayward emotions that I can't grasp, it hasn't happened for a long time. Basically in this dream, I was free from this cruel reality, free from my fears and cares, and free of the restrictions of my physical body. I lived in a magical world and travelled with a group of people, the second was very similar with the same people etc.

When I awoke, I felt so lost and stuck. I live in a different country from my whole family and can't easily visit due to covid, I haven't seen them in a year. I hate this world and this life, I hate who I am, I recently got sebopsoriasis due to stress, I'm getting a handle on it but it's on my face mostly and I feel hideous after years of feeling beautiful, I've put on weight, not much but enough to bother me.. I'm depressed and I don't know where to turn.. and I hate to admit this, but for the first time since I was 14 I have the urge to self harm and was having suicidal thoughts this morning. I won't give into these, I'm not in danger, but the thoughts terrify me, all my work to get in control of my mental health feels like it's been for nothing. Now all I want to do is run away, run from everything ruling over my life and run away from myself.. it's all too much and I feel so overwhelmed

I'm ashamed and terrified and I don't know what to do..

Sorry to unload like this.. my friends won't understand and my family can't help me, I didn't really know what else to do.. we have no money so I can't seek therapy, plus living in Spain I don't even know how it works here.. 

Thank you for listening"

Hello

I need your advice because I struggle with my relationship.

One year ago I broke up with my girlfriend, we were together 10 years.

I broke up with her because we had problems, both responsible of it, and because I’ve met a girl at my work.

This girl I am with since 10 months now was immediately (too much) interested in me.

Good connexion, kind, smart.

I was planning a trip with my ex and as I was talking with this girls she asked me to cancel the trip to be with her.

I denied.

I left my girlfriend one month after that and we started a relationship with my new girlfriend.

Unfortunately the kindness, the connexion went away.

Quickly she started lying about her past, lying about the fact she Was still texting an ex, deleting texts.

In her story all her boyfriends were losers, assholes (but she stayed months with them), she told me that she was a bad person with X or Y, that she really destroyed them and is proud of it.

Started  to tell people that my success is due to her taking me by the hand.  That I need to see somebody to cure my jealousy (which is true).

She started to be way too much invested with things like a house, a dog, a baby,wants me to buy the half of her flat.

Her whole family is pathologic (in my eyes) : the first time i met her parents it was OK, but after that, i saw what they are really, the father, retired businessman, fully egocentric dont hesitate to argue and insult her mother in front of me and other people, he was absent during her childhood, the mother plays the victim, the sister is BP.

Her parents are defending her when she is insulting me, she is the poor little girl ...

She always rewrites the story after an argument as if it was my fault.

After all argument when I told her « you said that ... it hurted me » she told me « I never said that »

Then she started to insult me, and last week she slapped me in the face 2 times during an argument. She slapped me not in a way a girl would slap, but in a way to hurt me i saw it in her eyes. Fortuantely i didn't feel that much.

When I think about her, I started to notice that anything she is doing is never her fault:

* doing drugs? It is because I am sad because of you
* drinking : same
* being angry : your fault
* insulting : your fault
* I told my parent that ... they think you are «insert something negative here »
* you don’t have enough friends because you’re an autist. I’m not
* it’s never her fault
* I’m never good enough
* very dominant sexually
* she can do things that I can’t (jealousy, snooping the phone ...)
* Disrepectful with waitress at the restaurant
* selfish
* friends  are more important than the relationship -she is the victim and behave  differently at work or with friends : super nice, kind etc

She is the perfect friend, or colleague, nobody can imagine how she is in private.

I have a lot of intuition and something felt wrong since I date her. She is not like this all the time, but every time i make a comment or criticize her behaviour even in a neutral way.

I am really thinking about recording her or filming her to prove what i am saying, and to prove that i am not mad, nor a psycho.

It might seem a bit sketchy, but i feel like she is misbehaving with guys to get revenge on her father, and that she wants a baby to have her own family to get away from her shitty family.

I start to really lose self confidence and really don’t know what to think.

What are some signs that the other is a narcissist.

Tl;dr : girlfriend exhibits a weird behavior. Is she a narcissist?"

459,Do I have a mental illness?,"&amp;#x200B;

My head tells me to do bad stuff, such as ""Do this in 5 seconds or your mother will die""

So the other day I brought a knife upstairs to cut my toast and my head told me ""If their bedroom door is open, kill them."" So I checked and it was open. I just try to ignore it but it ends up in me having a meltdown for a while. This has happened for 1 year now. If someone can tell me what's wrong i'd be appreciated, thanks! If you need me to provide some more detail please ask."
460,Am I... Stupid-ish?,"I kind of got forced into sending explicit images against my will to my ex boyfriend a while back. 
I usually would never do it and didn't want to and honestly I am ashamed. I don't even know why I did it even if I didn't want to and I regret letting it happen. Because everyone makes their own choices and can't blame others for doing so.

I didn't wanna sleep with him because I didn't trust him at the time (had some bad experiences before meeting him) and I tried sexting at first to atleast go his way half way and apparently he was really into it. I dodged it tho when he wanted to have phone sex or me to send explicit videos and whatsoever cause I thought that's disgusting.
After that he kept pressuring on. Only wanting more and trying to get me to still do it after declining several times. Even texted me throughout the day kind of degrading me as a... Toy I suppose, telling me to suck him off instead of asking how I am, etc.
Even FaceTimed me jerking off while I was at the grave of my father, crying. Turned him on even more. He didn't care that it made me uncomfortable as I was quote on quote 'his woman and I had to except it because that's how it is in a relationship' 
Got more aggressive each time. Ended up sending him... Nudes. (lmao all 14 y/o casually sexting will laugh at me now like it's a big deal) 
Told me we won't work if I don't finally open up more sexually or again quote on quote 'open my legs for him finally' bc that's how he shows his affection.. 
In the end he cheated on me and said it was my own fault and kept on going how he thought it was me and I became more and more disgusted with him and myself. 
I was Sexually really open and comfortable before that but it did something to me. And now I feel enormously stupid for being in my 20s and feeling like some teen. 
Introduced me to his parents, proposed still and whatsoever it was... messy to say atleast. Reckon he had more issues than I did.

Did I go somewhat insane? Do you have any... Tips to go back to my old ways? And why does something so insignificant... Yet not... effect me in such a way???"
461,Am I mentally ill?,"So for at least 1-2 years now ive had this voice in my head telling me things. Its a guy, but he doesnt have an exact name at this point in time and he’s usually trying to help me make a decision, or at least thats how it started. After a while it started saying stuff like “Dont say that or your dad will die” and other stuff like that. I know that its just a voice, but not listening to it gives me anxiety. Its not as bad as it was at the beginning but it still affects me... I also cant seem to find my words whenever im talking to someone face to face, and lose my train of thought/ get side tracked while talking sometimes. I have some other problems as well but i dont wanna go into detail with those-

Now, i did consult a psychiatrist before but they werent helpful at all, they didnt let me talk about whats wrong, rather just assumed i was a brat that was just spoiled and throwing tantrums or something. So yeah that sucked, and i dont wanna go back to them again so im asking for help here instead *-*
Please dont judge me."

464,Help.,"I was sexually assaulted by my step dad last December. It almost ended in r*pe but the police showed up in time. The repercussions are horrible. I have a 13 year old brother and a 10 year old sister. Today is his last hearing and he will probably get 12 years. Financially we are going to struggle. Everyone is heartbroken, especially my mom. She is very supportive of me but the whole situation messed her up and I’m responsible for that. I don’t know what to do. We could lose our home and our car. Sometimes I think if I just got r*ped and said nothing then everything would be okay. I feel like I’m at fault. I feel like I’m the bad guy and idk what to do. I think I ruined my family. Idk how I can continue living with this situation. I feel horrible. I can’t sleep. On top of this I’m enrolled in school and I just can’t keep up and it’s only my 2nd week in. Fuck I don’t know how I can just live anymore. I’m genuinely a nice person and I just don’t know what I did to deserve this. Idk how to keep going"
465,Feeling disphoric - has anyone experienced something similar?,"So I got my hair dyed yesterday, nothing drastic just a few blonde bits put in my brunette hair and I really like it! But I cannot put my finger on the exact feeling I felt afterwards - like a panic attack that is just slowly bubbling but never ‘peaks’? I feel so restless and sort of dizzy too. I feel so weird looking in the mirror and just can’t compute that it’s me and it’s making me feel so confused and super emotional. 

I’ve had this feeling before when I died my ends pink - but I genuinely hated the colour so I didn’t think into it as much. Thinking about it now, I’ve had this same feeling countless time’s when I’ve changed my appearance e.g dressing up, wearing certain clothes or hairstyles. But this is definitely the worst it’s been - I think because it’s more permanent? 

I’ve tried explaining my feeling to people before and I think it just sounds like I’m overreacting about changing my appearance but I know it’s so much more than that. Just wondered if anyone else had experienced something similar or has any idea what it is?"
466,I was just told some good news and I don't feel anything but stress,I was told I might not have to retake a semester at university after thinking that I'm a massive disappointment to my family. But I don't feel anything but stressed. I don't feel happy. I just feel like something is going to go wrong again and I'll be disappointed at myself again. I haven't feel genuinely happy about things in a long time. This combined with low self esteem and depressive episodes sucks.
467,Offered a new job but afraid my depression and anxiety will get worse,"Hello lovely people 
I just turned 23 years old and I ’ve been on stress leave the past 6 weeks but it’s supposed to end next week. I was going to get it extended another 6 weeks but after sending out a few resumes to see what’s out there, I got a job offer. Initially, I thought it sounded amazing due to the $6 raise but now all I can think about is how I mentally don’t feel prepared to go back to work. I have a gut feeling that my mental health is going to decline again but this is the most money I’ve ever made. 

I was on stress leave due to daily tension headaches, anxiety/panic attacks everyday, terrible depression (wanting to die but not wanting to hurt my family or partner and wishing I would get into accidents on the way to work so I wouldn’t have to go in).

I’ve dealt with depression pretty much as long as I remember and life just really doesn’t seem worth it sometimes. I have had so many jobs but quit them all because of my depression but my current job is the longest job I’ve had but I hate it so much more than I’ve ever hated a job. My anxiety was so bad but this 6 weeks have been the first time I’ve felt.... happy in so long. My brain has also not been foggy and I can recognize my feelings and emotions and actually think. I’m just so afraid of falling back into my old mental state which has been creeping up this past week. 

when I joined my current job but I always thought the job would magically “get better” from the first week and was too afraid to quit when in reality it just messed me up more and more. 


What would you do in the situation?"
468,How childhood still effects me now.,"Sorry for the length of this and thank you to any and all who decide to read to the end. 
I love you all and we are stronger together than on our own. 
I fly of the handle at simple thing that dont go my way I scream I shout I lose my s**t.  
Last week we went out for a drink with a friend who had to leave early my partner and I still had drinks so we sat talking about what we need to work on and how I need to get help and find the root of my problem.  
The worst bit is I know the root of my problem I just have never felt withit.  It all goes back to when I was young my mum and dad would fight.  Pots and pans learned to fly, turns out my dad had an affair and my mum got back at him by going and having one as well.  
After this we moved city's. It didn't help any the arguments continued and the pots and pans still tried learning to fly.  It was normal part of every day.  Get home from school do home work out to play, dinner, bed and the screaming and shouting and pots and pans learning to fly.  
Eventually my mum decided that it was enough and did the correct thing and got us all out of there her my brother and I.  
Best day of school ever arguing with my mum that I wanted to walk home with friends as I always did.  Eventually she won and I climbed in the back of the car and noticed my duvet was covering the back see.  Strange but comfortable so were just round the corner.  20 mins in to the drive my mum tells me I wont be seeing my dad again.  
Well i lost my s**t and started beating the back of the passenger seat screaming shouting swearing everything.  My mum kept driving and left me to it. 
Eventually we arrive at the woman's shelter way out in the middle of nowhere.  This place has one shop a church, one old guy that fixes and sells bikes for £20 (got my first bmx from him, it got stolen when we moved back to the city) and a school that's a gym hall split in to 3 rooms and one big ass corridor. Primary 1, 2, 3 in one room 4 and 5 in another and 6 and 7 in one.  I am in primary 6 the class is made up of the kids from the woman's home. We all get along after a week or two slowly everyone starts to disappear.  We were there for months there is only so much you can do before sitting on the wall at the church is the only thing to do. 
We eventually moved back to the city I started a new school in p6 the held me back because of everything. I struggled with everything. 
The city was the same one we had moved to.  With my dad I thought great I would get to see him.  On the phone we would talk and i would be told see you at 5PM on friday.  So every friday I would sit at the kitchen table next to the window and wait. I fell asleep on the table. 
As time went on i got more and more angry at him.  I lost my shit at my mum and became my dad that day I lashed out for the first and last time as my mum beat the beat out of me.  I was black eyes and bruised all over my chest and face.  Any chest impact is bad I had had 3 heart operations at this time.
When I was born my heart was back to front so with ever artory twisted around my heart it didn't work so well. A few years a go I had my last operation to put a stint in to my aorta to open it up and make blood flow easier. 
Sorry I digress 
After I got the beating from my mum I did the only thing I could and walked to where we use to live lucky for me my dad still lived there with his new girlfriend and her kids.  He didn't recognize me. Eventually he tokens me in to the house and I lay in bed for a few days.  His partner was a nurse so she helped and feed me called the police and child services, when I was better I was moved back to my mums.  She had been to see a doctor and put on some medication. After it my mum started me in a taekwondo class I took everything out there on the pads for 6 months before we moved house again. That was the end of that, my primary school life. 
Secondary school I was looking forward to it I got in to the same one as my friend from primary even though we weren't in the correct area of the city. Great I'm going to have some friends.... 
NO I get put in a class for out of area kids so im back at square one what's the dang point in trying. I become a library kid sit there for the 4 years of secondary school I did.  I did try do 5th year but the classes I wanted I missed the grading to get in them so everything got changed around I ended up drawing my hand in art class.  Smog this i left school. 
Started working a few months after leaving school and digging my way out of the shit pile i was in my self.  
First job a call centre selling the jet wood screw my boss was a dick so I said fuck this and didn't go back after about two months of working there.  
Went on benefits and spent them in the pub in and out of relationships.  Always me losing my ship and being my dad who for all essential abandon my brother and I (my brother was to young at the start of it all to remember it)
I got back to work and went from job to job falling out with anyone and everyone relationships were the same.  Things would be great, I would blow up being happy and normal just dont work for me so I would mess things up and end them.  
I got a job as a support worker and am still in the job 13 years later . 
I then got someone pregnant she was diagnosed with prenatal depression, fabricating symptoms causing my daughter to undergo pointless operations.  I got it out of her what was happening and what she was going through, reported it it all went to court, I was given custody of my daughter I quit my job and raised her for the first 5 years of her life by my self. Her mum would get supervised visits and over time i allowed gran on mums side to be the responsible adult and would let her keep her daughter over night.  I was in a great place with my daughter.  
Then she turned 6 I am in a relationship with the most amazing woman who some how sees through all the bull s**t I spout.  
My daughter asked me if she could go stay with her mum.  As she dont was to just do fun things with mum but with me also.  Her mum at this point has had 2 other kids to two different dads,  Has been looking after them by her self for 2 years.  My daughter is begging me I cave in and say ok.  I go back to work full time in stead of part time.  The company I work for is expanding south.  
My partner gets accepted in to two universities to become a doctor one in the city we are in the other one is a hour drive from where we are and it's a better uni for what she has worked her whole life to specialise in.  I can say no we are staying her my partner does I talk her out of it with the whole peruse your dreams and go for the best one that will get you where you want to be.  
So my daughter has moved out I have talked my partner in to moving away and that I will be coming with her as it allows me to be at the fore frount of a new unit in the city for my work.  It's all great.  
But my daughter is staying up here. I start turning in to my dad again it's getting worse and worse.  We are a week two at most away from the move I lose it over getting on the wrong bus to get home.  The car is in the garage so one set of house keys are not available.  
Then we come to last week.  We are sat in a bar with a friend they leave and we have a chat about everything and get in to a great place for us to move on from. 
The next day we wake up and head to the city we are moving to vue flats to live it get some lunch at pizza hut have a great day.
Then we get home and drop the car off at the garage. 
We get the bus not the one I wanted to get as it a longer walk back home and the better one is in 1 minute. 
We get off the bus and start walking home.
I throw my set of keys at my partner and walk off. We are about half way home.  I think I have calmed back down and head home.  I haven't I get home and lose it again screaming shouting the only thing I have yet to do is throw pots and pans. (I dont) I grab my jacket and bag and storm out saying I am done it's over I am not moving with you. I am shouting all this at her. I storm out of the house and spend a hour sat in the park before going home we run in to each other and end up sat in the park and chat away before going to pick up the car.  Grap some shopping and talk the night away.  
She tell me it's not happening anymore I can sort my self out and acutely do something about it or we are finished. 
I have a week two at most to try my hardest to save the relationship I have destroyed from the inside.  And to truly find a way to sort my self out mentally and deal with my problems 
I want to save this relationship I want to fight for it not with it. I need to seek help with the move being so soon (if she still decides I can go.  It's all up to her if i am i want to) I have screwed up to many time to be allowed to decide anything.  
At the age of 33 now I have finally got to such a great place I am willing to say I need help and I want help.  Where I am will take weeks if not months to get someone to speak with through the nhs and I sure cant afford to go private.  Until I find out if I am still getting to move with the person I love I am here admitting to my issues and finally growing up and becoming an adult and saying

I need help.
 
Thank you for making it to the end."
469,I'm having suicidal thoughts,Lately life isn't going well I've fucked up everything my family doesn't talk to me I'm about a month out of a year long 300 a week drug habit and I guess I don't know what to do with my life or time anymore I'm not going to school I got fired I just sleep all day and message friends occasionally but now I don't have drugs all my friends have left I think that's a good thing because now I know they never really cared for me I have two friends that check up on me and we hang out occasionally they're the reason I don't want to go through with it I don't want to hurt them my family won't care they'll probably be glad I stop putting a bad name on the family. I have court soon and I don't have the money for legal fees and I need to go before that but I don't want to hurt my friends and my dog will be left I'm the only one in my family who walks him and plays and cuddles with him and he'll be sad if I just disappear he won't understand and I don't want to do that to him I don't sleep some nights because I just lay there for hours planning different ways I could kill myself and it's overwhelming now I don't do anything I just lay in bed all day and think about death I don't really know if I'll be able to pull myself through the legal stuff I know I'm not going anywhere in life I don't have an education I can't read well I'll never get a proper job I just want to get another job and disappear back into living high all the time and floating through life at least drugs give me a purpose or something to do when I'm on drugs I go out to get drugs and to go out to seshes or hang out with people and I guess I'm more motivated but now I'm sober I don't know what to do I just don't do anything and life seems completely pointless it makes me realize I'm not getting anywhere. When I'm high I know this but I don't care I'm having fun I'm doing dumb shit I'm running around doing extremely illegal stuff and it's fun but I'm also still fucking everything up it doesn't matter what I do my life will always be pointless I only have two people who still truly care about me my family has told me how much that hate me and that I'm making the family look bad and they with they never had me so I would be doing them a favor they aren't making money off me anymore and they just want me gone and I can do that they probably won't even care I'm dead they'll just be annoyed because funerals are expensive I don't even expect many people to come to my funeral because no one really cares about me my parents have given me until next year to move out so I will be homeless next year and I just don't see the point anymore there is just absolutely no point to my life I'm such a disappointment to everyone.
470,I have relapsed (ED),"I recently relapsed again, it's been a week now and I kinda am acknowledging it. People are noticing I've stopped eating. Some suspect I'm depressed lol.

I don't want to get help? As long as no one notices and I hide it well then what's the point? I can afford to lose 20 kg. I'd be underweight yea but what's so bad about that. Maybe once I'm at my goal weight I'll start eating again. But rn not eating feels right. I solely eat dinner. So I'm not being that unhealthy. Surviving 13 hours without food is hard tho haha.

Should I get help or just wait it out? It won't kill me too quick so what's the big deal?"

474,"A new episode is starting, any advise?","I feel that a new episode of my mental problems is comeing. I have a long history of abandentment issues.

When I was mabe 3-4, I don't remember it very well, my grandpa, grandma, my sister (now 27) and I (now 24) where on a trip to my aunt at the other side of the country. We took a wrong turn and that was the moment when my grandpa turned around to me and told the that I would never see my mother again. This moment scared me for life.

My mum also wasn't around that much. She was a single mum and my dad would not pay child support. She needed to have a fulltime job and another woman took care of us, until she came to pick us up in the evening after work. Well sometimes she did not come, because work took so long. I don't know if this was true of if she needed a break from us once in a while. That other woman allways told me I was not good enought, I should be more like my sister, that I was useless and that I only made trouble. I got punished for stuff her 1 year old daughter did and my sister and her older daughter played alone.

I remember never beeing invited to any birthday party in elementary school and asking my mum why I could not be like the other kids, because clearly there was something wrong with me. I made friends in the end, but they would ditch me when someone else came along or would only come to me when no one else was available. I stopped making friends near end of middle school and tried again in university, only to be betrayed by my so called friends and beeing left alone again. 

I live together with my boyfriend and he knows that some things happend in my past, but I can not speak with him about it. I can not speak with anyone. My mum always says that I should let go of the past and that she needed to work for us. But I know deep insode of me that she loves my sister more than she does live me, I can feel it and it makes me feel like an outcast in my own family. Nothing I do is ever good enought.

Even strangers who don't even know me ask how someone like my boyfriend can be with someone like me or even love me, just because I said in a conversation that I don't like kids. It just seems like I can't do anything right.

I thought about killing myself or wishing for a deadly disease just so it can end, because I could never end my own life (I am a chicken I suppose). I just don't think that I will ever be happy. I study something my mum wanted me to do, because I thought she would be proud of me and give me the love and recognition I need, but nothing is ever good enought. 

I am crying as I am writing these words, I know that I am starting to drift away again and I have that anoying sound in my head again. Please, does anyone know how to stop this? I just want to be a normal person and be happy."
475,How to stop hitting myself and clenching my jaw when angry?,"I don't know when it started but whenever I get really angry I feel my jaw clenching and I start punching my leg. I feel like I've always had some problems with my anger but I could never express it right. I would get mad and just stay silent with anger bubbling up in me and making the tension rise. I just want to healthily acknowledge my anger and deal with it in a way that would benefit me. If anyone could give me some advice on it, I would appreciate it."
476,Can traumatic event or mental health of loved one affect you as well?,"So i have been one of the few support for my girlfriend as she is suffering from ptsd and depression. and I dont want to sound like i am trying to be victim but i want to know if that can affect me, because i am continuously anxious for her, if i recieve text from her friend even that scares me for a second, when i twxt her and wait for her reply i feel like i am waiting for exam results. I love her don't get me wrong, I was just curious is its possible."
477,"Hey guys, so far I’ve beaten two forms of OCD. I’d like to know the strategy to destroy that intrusive thought that tells me “people are plotting against you”. Kindly help.",The thought makes me suspicious about most people and it creates anxiety leading to poor quality of social life. I overthink about this too much and feel like shit at the end of the day.
478,I made a mental health first aid kit,"I think a counsellor mentioned it ages ago and I couldn't work out what I would put in it. I'm not sure it's supposed to be an actual box of things but I felt it would be more helpful if it was.

My first aid kit contains some resources including a list of mental health charities and phone numbers, a wordsearch book, a notepad, a pen, a stress ball, a rubber band, a small stone I like to hold and rub and some lip salve because I think somewhere on the internet lip balm was suggested. I also want to add earphones although mine are broken and I need to buy a new pair. Things that I also consider part of my first aid kit are tea bags and my weighted blanket but they can stay separate. Also might get a smaller bag/box but the blue pouch thing was all I could find at home.

I think just knowing that this little bag of helpful things is on my shelf helps. Although I'm feeling a lot better now I'm about to do a wordsearch. Anyway I just thought I'd share.

479,Socially distanced from life worth meaning,"I just feel very alone. I tried to find motivation by having something to look forward to, but failed. 

I am a college student home for the semester doing distance learning. My anxiety, ocd, and eating disorder mount with each passing day locked away in my room. I just want to sleep or eat to get through my day. I miss the way my body used to feel... more energetic, physically lighter down 10 pounds, less chaotic. There is simply no reason to shower or get out of bed thanks to Zoom. I work a few days a week as a nanny for a 6 month old so it’s not as if I am interacting with people who understand my feelings. He loves me just the same if I am silent and in sweatpants. My best friends are all away. I have a few friends around but it seems no point to make plans for the weekend because it will just be stressed or cancelled. I don’t even want to go back to campus because the thought of managing making friends again feels as if it will just require all of my energy for very little return after all we might just get sent home.
Does anyone else feel this way? Guess I am just looking for reassurance"

481,Mental Health of Students Must Figure in Restarting Classes,"As officials across the nation decide how best to open schools, one  aspect too often overlooked is students’ mental health. Awareness of the  pressures on our children is the first step towards helping them heal  and preparing them to learn.

COVID-19 has left many kids feeling lonely and isolated. Research on  the effect of the lockdowns published in the June issue of the Journal  of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry concludes  that young people experiencing loneliness may be as much as three times  more likely to sink into depression in the future, but additionally that  their mental health could be impacted for at least nine years because  of it.

One answer? Since 2003, [HealthCorps](https://www.healthcorps.org/)  has worked in high-need schools, supplementing existing health and  wellness programs emphasizing physical activity, nutrition, mental  resilience and civic engagement. These are teenagers who, even in normal  circumstances, experience disparities in access to health services  based on their socioeconomic status, geographic region, race or  ethnicity – with perhaps predictable results. Specifically, higher rates  of chronic disease (including stress) and lower measures of both  quality of life and life expectancy.

And yet, through our unique curriculum – created by top heathcare  professionals and constantly updated to match students’ needs – the  students we work with have flourished. They exercise more, eat better,  and practice positive thought. And, yes, they engage with their  communities.

Since stress has always been an issue for many of these teens, one of  the most requested lessons we were asked to bring to classrooms even  before the pandemic hit was  [“Bust My Stress.”](https://www.healthcorps.org/program-resources)   And now? Add the coronavirus-induced feelings of isolation to that  equation, and you begin to see how fragile our nation’s teens may be.

As one of our Florida students so heartbreakingly told us amid the  lockdowns: “I still keep it in, but I still think negative like every  night. I cry it out so I won’t have to feel that way again in the  morning.”

Building mental resilience has become an increased focus of our work.

Of course, parents have their own role to play in their teenagers’ healing process.

“They can help by reassuring teens that, just because they’re nervous  or scared, doesn’t mean they’re really in any danger,” says Mark  Goulston, M.D., a HealthCorps advisory board member and widely quoted  expert on building a positive culture. “By reminding them that their  bodies don’t really understand the fear, and by talking it out and  discussing the fear, both the parent and child will feel better and  closer.”

The HealthCorps program is delivered by highly trained recent college  graduates who are future medical and health policy professionals. They  interact with teens on a daily basis – though, these days, virtually –  and have developed some simple steps that can help youths through these  trying times. Among them:

• Meditate or try deep-breathing methods, which increase your body’s natural ability to relax during high-stress moments.

• Get moving.

• Prioritize sleep.

• Talk things out with someone you trust.

• Do or watch something that makes you laugh.

• Keep a non-judgmental journal to help process thoughts.

• Practice gratitude and positive self-talk.

One last thing. These tips and others, available on our new [@teenhealthvibe](https://www.instagram.com/teenhealthvibe/) Instagram channel can also apply to adults.

482,How do I make myself happy?,"So recently I opened up to two dear friends of mine of a very personal secret. Unlike most of my life they took it rather well and supported me as much as they could. Though, I still find it hard that they believe or even trust me. 

Now, this isn't the secret but I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for most of my life and think about it at least once to three times a day. For my specific situation it wouldn't even be hard, as I have access to a firearm within my home.

I don't know why I've not done it yet to be fully honest... I've never really had any dear friends in my life before. Most people push me aside and use me as the mental punching bag. Ignore my perspectives, emotions, or opinions. 

My parents disapprove of everything I do that give me pleasure. Such as playing games, listening to weird music, and drawing. They push me to do things that they enjoy saying it will be better for my future. My dad wants me to help him with his small business and be able to manage it when I'm older, but doing that job drains me of my energy and makes me want to lay down and just quite.

Overall, my father wants me to reach his expectations but I know I never can. And his inability to express himself has left me emotionally drained of love and support. I can't even remember the last time I actually expressed myself truthfully and openly to my family. 

Due to my upbringing I've had a hard time expressing myself properly which has left me abandoned and alone by my fellow peers. I was the kid most people called ""weird"" or ""depressing"" and was avoided like the plague. This only further limited my expression to other human beings. 

Once I reached highschool I was well known as the quiet kid and was referred to on multiple occasions as ""emotionless"". Not excelling in my classes also gained more dishonour from my father which has only further fuelled my depression. 

Due to all this emotional ineptness i've never had a girlfriend which has left me feeling inadequate or not worth love. Which is only fueled more from the distance and hate people have towards me. 

Luckily I've found some really amazing close friends who have made me reconsider shooting myself. Despite this the pain I feel has not left, but rather intensified and I'm not sure why...

Perhaps I feel I don't deserve this? Or that they are only pitting me? Honestly I don't know...

What I do know is that life is getting harder. I feel more and more each day a feeling of emptiness and a drive to die. To my core I hate making others lives harder with my own problems. Which is why i've avoided talking about this with anyone or even scheduling a therapist. 

I don't want to feel like dying anymore. I don't want to feel like tomorrow is just going to be ""another day"". I want to be surrounded by people who love and support me. Who don't avoid, abuse, or ignore my opinions and perspectives.

Again, I have a hard time expressing myself. So if any of this was confusing I sincerely apologise and I'm happy to further explain if necessary. I appreciate anyone who takes time out of their day to stop and read this post. I hope you all stay strong and safe! :)"
483,I'm worried one of my OCD compulsions nearly hurt my cat 😭😭😭,"My OCD is currently focused on whether she is ill or not. One of my compulsions is to play with her with her favourite string to see if she's lethargic or not. She was sitting in these brambles we have in our garden and she ignored the string mainly until the end when she stepped over the brambles and looked ready to pounce. Then I started worrying that she nearly stepped/layed on the brambles because of me playing with the string. I hate this and I go to university in two days, I really don't want to go if I think I've hurt my cat 😭😭😭. I love her so much,it's just these stupid compulsions I get that make the situation worse ☹️. She's absolutely fine btw"

485,Unconsciously saying I want to die,"Hello, I am sure I do not want to die. I have never attempted but there has been times when I have been suicidal. I have been fine this year, even when I feel depressed it's just for few hours. Yet for the past 2 years I say "" kill me"" or ""I want to die"" in small situations. I think I am scared of decisions, mostly it's when I am thinking of the future. I do not think it bothers me or my day to day life, but I don't know if it's healthy or not."
486,Self-isolating,"Background: I auditioned for an arts school and got in. I have been desperately been waiting for school to start. It's all I've been thinking about for the last six months. My family and I have so many sacrifices to get in. School starts tomorrow.

So I got a sore throat the day before we were supposed to move into the new apartment (school is far away from my other home), and I asked the public health what should I do.

The public health said that I should self isolate and get tested for the virus. They also said that my parents should also isolate.

My parents got angry. They blamed me for getting the virus. They now are ashamed of me for telling them that I got a sore throat. They said I should have stayed quiet and went to school anyways.

I ruined everything."
487,Are 'panic attacks' while reading out loud in class related to anxiety?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit to talk about this, but I'm desperate for an explanation to my situation.

So, first of all, I'm pretty sure I have social anxiety. I've never seen a therapist or anything of the sort, so I don't have a diagnosis, but I know enough about social anxiety to come to this conclusion.

However, there's this problem that I can't really explain to myself.
For the past few years (it started when I changed schools) I've been having troubles with reading out loud in class. It's not an issue of being shy or lazy, I have physical symptoms.
The first few lines I read are fine. But if it goes on for more than a few lines, my heart starts pounding really fast, my throat ""closes off"", my voice and body start shaking and I stop breathing. It's gotten to the point where I almost vomited.
I don't know why this is happening to me, but I know it's not normal. Or is it?

I've tried talking about it to my mother and my teachers, but they don't seem to understand. They just tell me I should practice more and stop caring about what others think. But I couldn't care less about what others think. Sure, I'm shy, but I know that I'm not dumb and I have no problem with raising my hand and giving short answers that I don't have to read out. 
So why is it that I struggle so much with reading? Is my breathing wrong? Or is it related to my anxiety? And what can I do to stop this?

Also, I've been wondering if anyone can relate since I've never heard of other people having this problem.

I'd really appreciate your help."
488,The past week I have felt empty,So the past week I've only really been able to fake smile and laugh so nobody thinks anything is off but the only thing that made me happy was imaging brutally murdering one of my friends (who I think actually hates me but I have to stay with because he started dating my best friend and I have no one else and every time I try to talk to my friend he always cuts me off) and I have the constant fear of the person who strangled me 2 years ago to just suddenly appear and start talking to me my house was flooded about 8 months ago and I've been stuck in my grandmother's house who constantly gets on my nerves and nothing I normally do makes me happy anymore

490,I’m(21) applying for jobs and not getting any. So much pressure I don’t want to do anything.,"(Tdlr? Applying for jobs suck and I don’t want to do it anymore)

So before this pandemic I knew what I wanted to do and how. I had been travelling before lockdown, working abroad as an au pair. I was happy. I didn’t go to uni because I saw no point when I don’t know what I want to be. 

Anyway like almost everyone else my plans and ideas went up in flames. I was looking for part time work before the pandemic. Just a bit extra money before I go off again but couldn’t find any. I started applying with an agency but they were crap. I don’t like it there. Then the pandemic hit. I thought it’ll be a month or 2, whatever that’s fine. Nope. Still here. 

My dad is very very high risk. So I’ve been trying my hardest to be careful. I’ve been handling good, I’m not the partying type like my (just turned 20) sister or anything. I enjoy being on my own. (Even though sometimes I need to be with friends). So I decided not to go for a job until the pandemic and lockdown cools. I’m very much afraid of getting ill too. My sister doesn’t care. She’s the worst and this situation has brought the worst out of her. 

Anyway, I recently started applying for jobs and it’s going awful. I’m trying to find anything with childcare but everyone wants someone with a higher qualification and experience etc. But I apply and the worst thing is not getting a reply just to let me know I didn’t get it. I literally waited a month for an interview (they said they’ll contact me for an interview at the end of the month). Nothing happened. I had my hopes up waiting. They could have just said I wasn’t what they were looking for or something. It’s exhausting. Like I just spent 2 hours filling in your stupid application, least you could do is say I didn’t get it. 

Then I have family friends/ my moms friends recommending jobs for me. So I’ve been applying etc and not getting it. 

I’m at my wits end. So a family friend sent one. So I email for a form and I quickly scan through and I know I’m not getting it. I see what they are looking for and I know I’m not it. There’s loads of questions that basically repeat itself that I don’t know how to answer so I said to my mum I’m not doing it. I don’t care if I get a job in childcare. I’ll happy enough to get a job in a shop. I don’t care anymore. 

Fine. That’s the end of it I thought. Nope. The friend told my mum that the one person who applied who’s qualified isn’t getting it. She on the panel and she didn’t want her as well. (Didn’t know she was on the panel). I thought well if it comes back around I might apply. Then my mum jumps on saying they are willing to hire someone who will work towards a level 3 (I’m a level 2) etc. I told her straight up, I have no interest in getting a level 3, I don’t want it, it takes a year to get and I don’t want to be there for a year. I don’t want a future in childcare, it’s a waste of time for me to get it. So, okay end of story. Nope

Next day, today, I get an email saying today’s the closing date, I was like whatever, not interested. I was excited for today, I was planning on cooking( about now if this didn’t all happen) I was going to have a good day. I actually woke up in a good mood too. The friend messaged my mum again saying how she wants me to at least send my cv in (I honestly don’t think she knows my qualifications etc). Saying how she’s talked me up. I was like fine. Just because she’s trying to help. So I sent my cv and said I’ll send the application form in later. 

Crap. I start the application. Answer what I can. And it’s still half empty. I have gaps everywhere cause of my travelling. My grades aren’t the best either because I wasn’t trying to get into uni So I wasn’t too worried (stupid). Then I break down crying. I’m not going to get this. There’s not enough nepotism around for me to be close. I don’t want it. I don’t want to work towards the next level. I don’t want a permanent job. And the questions, again are impossible. I don’t know how to answer them. They clearly want people who know how to answer theses. 

So I tell my mum again. And she goes on and on. Saying how she can’t even help me cause it’s in a different language (I’m bilingual. My mum is not). I’m like I’m not asking for help. I can read it and I don’t know how to do it. She doesn’t work in childcare so she wouldn’t have been able to help. Then she goes, well just leave it blank. What’s the point. They’ll see it’s blank and go to the next application because they wouldn’t have asked a question if they won’t people to skip it. 

Writing it out makes it seem less, but I’m so stressed out. There’s so much pressure on me and I can’t do it. All I wanted to do today was try a new recipe and have a good day. Because I feel so depressed lately, everything makes me feel worst, as if there are rocks in my chest. I’m not getting along with my sister at all!!!!! And I’m not where I won’t to be. Now my good mood has shattered and all I won’t to do is stay in bed, watch the same show I’ve seen a hundred time and knit. 

I literally hate leaving the house now too. The first time I have in months and felt comfortable was to the craft store, where I knew it would be quiet and now that masks are mandatory. 

Also everyone is looking for jobs now who are way more qualified and experienced than me. I just feel like a colossal failure."

And then when I got out that room I went straight to the toilet but seeing myself like this made me mad/angry and I couldn’t calm down my tears didn’t stop YEA SUCH A LOSER I KNOW I just punched the wall and later I tried to hold my breath but nope I was in there like for an 1hour..

Ive only been awake for a few hours and its happened a few times already. Its hard to explain but ill try. Im at work rn btw.

The first time i was staring at my phone i couldn't tell what i was looking at anymore. Time stopped completely and i came to about 3 or 4 minutes later in another room continuing my work. 

When i came to i had no idea where i was, i didn't even remember i was at work. It slowly came back to me everything i did within that time but i dont remember all of it, just the general idea. I had conversations, googled stuff on my phone, and continued making work decisions. 

Its like my body took over and let my brain go somewhere where nothing existed. I had 0% control over what i did during that time and was unable to snap myself out of it.

I'm honestly scared shitless that im going to do something i dont actually want to do if it happens again. I can even feel it happening but its to late by then, i just come to afterwards.

496,Job rejection's leading to massive dips in mental health,"Like many people I am going through difficulty times in terms of job opportunities due to COVID and the current economic situation. To give you a brief summary of my situation (I am 29, living in the UK, University Graduate, suffered what could be deemed as bullying in my last role where management blamed me for something i didn't do reason i left in April 2020) Since around May i have been looking for new job opportunities alongside volunteering in my local area assisting elderly people in lockdown with supplies and phoning them to see how they're doing and it's been a struggle to put it bluntly. Dips in confidence and disillusionment with work in general have been strong following my last work experience. Reason for my post is that over the last month or so I've been lucky enough to get to interview stages in job positions that i am looking for, unfortunately on each occasion i have been unsuccessful. This is despite on each occasion been given positive feedback from employers or recruitment people. 

These series of rejections along with relationship issues i have had for a longer period (All my friends are getting married, have a home etc I don't have a GF and having to live at home still) has really impacted my mental health. Feeling lost, disillusioned with life, questioning what's the point have become a common downward spiral following these unsuccessful interviews etc. Whilst this is probably a common feeling i am not sure how many more set backs / rejections i can take and the positive outlook i once had is long gone that goes in both my working opportunities and relationships moving forward.  I thought others may also be in similar situation and they always say discussing is the best way to overcome these kind of things? Any tips ? Or discussion if you've experienced something similar is welcome...."
497,Question for mental health professionals. Would it be weird or performative if I wrote down the issues I’m having ahead of time and read them to my therapist or used a notebook for my session?,"Would it be weird or performative if I wrote down the stuff I want to talk about in a notebook and just read it to my therapist or used it in a session? 

I’ve been to therapy more times than I can remember and have been hospitalized several times in my teen years. I can honestly say, I don’t think therapy has ever been very beneficial. I had a really hard time being honest or talking about the real issues because I didn’t want them to think I was a bad person. I tried to open up to one therapist about a traumatic event in my childhood that I had never admitted to someone before and she totally brushed it off and immediately started making jokes and laughing about pictures of cats so I’ve never really trusted one since then. Also heard her taking about how other patients were faking their problems to another therapist. 

Last time I went to therapy, she was nice but I just went totally blank when she would ask me about my week. I couldn’t remember any of my feelings or even think of the words. I used to be able to articulate myself so well and now I can’t even explain how I’m feeling most of the time. Eventually we ended our sessions because we literally had nothing to talk about and I just said I was feeling a lot better because I felt awkward and guilty for taking time away from someone else when I don’t even have problems.

Lately I’ve just been writing down thoughts and feelings I’ve been having so I can actually remember.  But part of me feels like maybe that’s super performative and she’ll think I’m just making up these problems. If my problems were real I wouldn’t have to write them down to “remember”. If the issues were that bad they would be bothering me constantly. I’m conflicted though, because I can’t tell if I’m really being performative. My mom always told me I was just a manipulative attention seeker pretending to be mentally ill so people would feel sorry for me. Part of me believes it and I really just want this therapist to actually work. Do you think she’ll think I’m faking it if I do this?"
498,I tried to jump out of a moving car,"So I've had some trauma in my life like most people and apparently my psyche isn't strong enough to deal with it so I constantly get DRD (derealisation disorder for anyone who doesn't know) and severe panic and anxiety attacks. Ive also had voices in my ear before but slowly they've gone and now its just me and another me in my head.
Last night my step dad noticed I was in a strange place so we went for a drive for get some milkshakes and to have a chat. As soon as we started driving along the road I went into a total meltdown and started shouting and crying. I get 2D vision as if I'm looking at a flat picture of the world and it can be terrifying and I start freaking out even more and the whole time my step dad was just driving us around letting me have my moment when suddenly I'm like ""none of this is real. Why am I here?"" Then I undo my seat belt, open the door and get a leg out before my stepdad can pull me back and stop the car. I'm fighting him and screaming in his face that I don't know who or what I am and that I need to go and find out where I am. I lost myself so quickly and all of this happened in the space of about 5 minutes. I dont know where I was trying to go but something in me was telling me to get out of that car because it wasn't real. Nothing seems real  even my own voic e sounds like someone else is talking and Im not aware of it I dont always recognise myself in the mirror and sometimes I'm watching my life through someone else's eyes I don't know where I'm going with this but I just needed to get it out because I cant really talk to anyone because no-one I know has anything like this and its scary and I was just wondering if anyone on here has ever had anything like this happen

I am sorry that you had to hear all of that growing up, and you still have to hear it. I am sorry that you weren't allowed to express your emotions or feelings; even if you did you did, you were mocked for it. For a couple of you, I am sorry that all of you had to hold your emotions in to such an extent that it only came out in form of anger. I am sorry that the society invalidated your pain.

*I knew that my mother was in pain for close to 15 years. It was visible. She didn't accept it, still hasn't. A few weeks back when I realised that my father wasn't 'just' having anger management issues. He had been in pain. He had actually been in pain for over three decades, and I didn't know it. Nobody knew it, I guess. Army man. Doctor. Sharp focus. Strict routine. A concentration power I have rarely seen in people. Hands and legs which never stop working, even now. A outgoing personality with a stoic facade who knew how to make anybody laugh (weird combination, I know). With all of these, occasionally there would be these bursts of anger that would scare anybody to death, and no one knew what he would be capable of doing then. Now, I know what it all was. He is in severe depression and is suicidal. And he is in complete denial.*


*I know he needs help. I know both of them need help. I want them to get it. But I can't force them. Despite have a severe mental health crisis myself, I have to be wary of their, and tip-toe around their triggers. They will understand it one day.

506,"Back on medication, feeling like failure","I managed to come off of paxil in February after being on it for 15ish years, and have been managing okay until about 2 weeks ago. 

I feel like I've wasted the past 2 years of my life, and have been severely depressed for the past few weeks. I haven't been able to eat (currently forcing down smoothies and protein bars) or function properly. I'm constantly checking LinkedIn for job prospects, even though I have no skills or references. 

I graduated from a very prestigious art school with a postgraduate degree- and all I've managed to do in the past 2 years is teach a few classes at a university in my home province. I've lost the desire to make art and dropped out of a small business course because of it. 

I don't have friends because I had been focusing on my education, and I also think being numbed by paxil affected my social skills as well. I'm considering moving to an even smaller city to work at a textile mill just so I can start over. But even that's not a guaranteed job, and I worry that I won't make friends there either. 

Nothing I'm doing is helping my future opportunities, but I can't find a sense of direction. Everyone is telling me to 'wait it out' but I don't think there will be a job here in the future since art schools aren't making money. 

I've started taking Cipralex last night and I'm really hoping it helps, because I just don't know what to do. I feel guilty for even feeling this way because I know people have it so much worse, but I have been relying on calling my mother every day so that she can give me a task to complete and remind me to eat. It's embarrassing. I was such an over achiever growing up and now I have no skills to enter the workforce.

508,"I think I have or am faking multiple personalities, should I tell my therapist this?","Hello, first time in this community. English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes in the text.

Well, where do I start?

Since I can remember I have been dealing with symptoms of depersonalization and dissociation since childhood, as well as a very (very) maladapitive daydream, where I used to spend hours in an imaginary world created by me.

My childhood went as far as I remember (because I don't remember much of it) very difficult, with an extremely emotionally absent father and an engulfing mother who insisted on trying to control my personality, I was always an introvert but she wanted to turn me into a person talkative and super communicable, we have fought several times over I don't want to go to courses where I was the target of teasing and bullying from the whole class.

I don't like to talk about it, but I was also exposed to pornography very early when I was just 9 years old.

I used to be a very lonely child, I didn't know how to deal with trauma so I started to internalize things that I wanted to talk about, things that hurt me, emotions and other things like that. In adolescence I had depression and suicidal idealization because I could not stand to deal with all this locked up inside me anymore.

For a long time, I can remember 2 characters in my mind: The two have different ages than mine and slightly different personalities, one being much more assertive and sincere, while I tend to doubt my perceptions and be indecisive.

My behavior can change in the same situation (And I don't see clear factors that can cause this) I can for example answer the same invasive question with excuses and more excuses or be ""crude"" saying that this is not the person's business, it often happens when I am not ""afraid"" of the person or when I feel ""comfortable

I also notice a voice that doesn't fit my way of being, giving opinions on what I do that I usually don't follow, because isn't it my way of doing things or how I do

I really can't say if this is just a creation of my Daydream.

Once I even mentioned this to my therapist, she showed me a blank paper and asked me to speak what I saw there, so I said that I saw 2 people (the characters I mentioned) who were pulling the same rope in opposite directions and I was in the middle of the rope being ""pulled"" by both of them, she told me that she found what I said fascinating and interpreted it as ""the person I wanted to be and the person I didn't want to be""

Sometimes I am very anxious and bothering with memories, so I have the symptoms of depersonalization, in which I see everything around me as something unreal and fanciful, soon after I become calm, centered and correct, in a strange way I seem to forget what bothered.

I wanted to talk to my therapist about it, but I'm afraid she'll see it as an excuse of mine, since she ""analyzed"" the subject in the paper.

I know I have the symptoms of depersonalization and dissociation but really I think I may be in the beginning of insanity or something else, as it would be extremely strange if I suspected I had DID and found out that I am faking it.

I really wonder if I should waste time with this, because I have no confidence in myself and my interpretations.

I wanted some advice, should I tell my therapist? Wouldn't that be unnecessary insistence?"
509,Extremely low self esteem or disorder?,
510,In need of serious help and advice for my agressive behaviour.,"Long post warning.

For as long as I can remember I have been having weird 'blank' moments, as I and my partner call them. Whenever I get one of those, I find it extremely hard to talk, express my feelings, immediately respond, talk about a problem or talk along. I will go in more detail a little further up in the story.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 years now, we met on the first day of school and have been best friends, and later on BF and GF ever since. We are, and always have been unseperatable. In the beginning of our relationship I already had problems such as difficulties talking, my parents both also are horrible talkers so I must have that from them. In the past, the problem wasn't as bad as right now yet. Whenever I had one of those 'blank' moments back in the day it wouldn't take extremely long to get out of it. Right now, it either takes an entire day, or if I get one of those moments, I get angry and agressive within 30 minutes. I am not a violent, agressive, or angry person at all and I have never had anger issues, nor have I ever been agressive. It's such a big difference with 6 years ago and I have no idea what happened to me. 

For the past couple of months, everything gruadually has been getting worse. In March I have lost my job and I have been at home ever since (I only just now found a new job)

The blank moments have always been there, always, but right now they are taking a toll on both me and my GF. It has been happening for so many times for the past couple of week, and months that by now it is around the 2 days of everything being perfect, and the 3th day it goes absolutely horribly wrong. I have such a hard time getting out of those blank moments that by now it nearly takes an entire day before it comes to an end. An entire day of silence. No smiling. No laughing. I am unable to give my GF proper love/care/attention/affection.

My GF has been struggling with depression ever since she was young, around 12-13. (Right now she is 22) She also struggles with suicidal thoughts and has been self harming herself too. I have always done my best to get her through relapses, and I have always been there for her. Whenever she would do something to herself I would be beyond upset and immediately want to talk about everything.

Due to the amount of stress that I have been putting on her for the past while, with me not talking, or suddenly flipping the switch into one of those blank moments, she has been taking her stress out on herself a lot. A damn lot. It makes her so extremely upset, that if it goes on for too long she gets an anxiety/panic attack, which results in her either bashing on her head with her fist or worse, cutting herself. 

My GF really is someone who immediately wants to get to the bottom of a problem, and if there is something that needs to be talked about she will immediately do so. She is not afraid of talking and saying how things are, in complete opposition of me. I completely black out and have no idea how to talk. That is where we clash, and that is where things mostly go from bad to worse. As I cannot talk back in those blank moments, it upsets my GF and makes her feel extremely alone. She always fights for everything and makes it clear that she wants problems out of the way. Which I do to, but I just slip closed to such an extreme level that I cannot say anything at all. And if I do, it sounds emotionless and I do not have any expression on my face. 

Right now if we argue, it has gotten to a point that instead of being 'blank', I start becoming angry, which leads into agressive outbursts of me. Like I already stated, I am not an agressive person, at all. My GF has extremely bad experiences with people being angry and agressive, so her seeing me like that only pushes her more into certain directions.

I take all my anger out on her. Unjustified. I have no idea how to control my anger. It all builds up in an argument, until I at one point just snap and evetything comes out in one go. I say things I do not mean, do things I regret later on and act extremely erratic. Out of anger I either throw with things, bash on my own head, punch a wall, scratch myself open and go on a full on rant with how I see certain things. In the meantime I completely break the heart of my girlfriend, scare her, terrify her, make her feel alone, make her panic, she feels unheard in those moments especially seeing as she needs me desperately and I am just not there. As if I am possessed and as if it is just not me, that's how she states it.

It already happened a few times that me and my GF got physical. Which is horrible. We both are NOT like that. NOT at all. She isn't, and I am not.

I thought everything was caused by stress, seeing as we have had a lot of financial issues and personal stress which kept on going for months on end. But right now that everything is starting to get back together financially, the stress is still there. I also tend to stress about small little things that shouldn't be even worth stressing over, which also kicks me into a blank moment. The relation between me and my GF is suffering under all of this extremely, I am really trying to work on myself and to better myself. We don't want to breakup, we still love each other uncontrollably even though everything that we have been through.

Can someone please give me advise, tips, or tricks to;
A. Control my anger
B. Avoid my 'blank' moments
C. Get out of those blank moments
D. Become a better talker

I have been struggling with this issue for so long already, and I have not told anyone about this.
Only me and my GF know everything that is going on behind the scenes and how bad it is. We keep up this act towards our family as if everything between the two of us is perfectly fine."
511,I Feel Hopeless Now,"I started a music career a few months ago, and I haven't been doing bad for myself, until now. My father just completely took my computer so I have no way to actually record. I'm kind of fucked, to be honest. Now that my dream has been crushed, I feel worthless, hopless and an unspeakable amount of doubt. I just felt I had to get this off of my mind"
512,"Something just feels ""off"" Any idea what's going on?","Hi. I'm new here i guess. I have had pretty severe generalized anxiety for a long time. I'm okay about it because as a whole, i'd just say i'm used to stuff being pretty well, meh. While it's always there, i just deal with it. 

However, recently, i think it has been causing me some weird issues. I feel like one of my coping mechanism i sort of taught myself is kind of disconnecting to feel comfortable.  for the past few weeks, it has sort of become involuntary and more severe. I have felt almost fatigued and disconnected  have been perfectly aware and awake, i look normal to others etc. For example, my reactions are totally fine, i can do stuff but my head just feels totally empty, like i'm a robot or something.

The issue is i have had an incredibly weak emotional response to just about everything. Nothing is specifically bothering me, but i can't enjoy anything at all and i want to react to more serious stuff but i can't. It's like my personality has just gone. Everything is totally uninteresting and i'm going about the motions. It feels like i'm stuck behind a glass pane while my body has just taken over but in a almost in a literal sense, as in i am seeing everything wrong. Everything is washed out and kind of very clear but bland looking.

I had this a bit when growing up, but a bit different. It was more like a camera filter, like i'm in a movie and everything might be in sepia filter and it would change the way i experience everything. I have also had a period of feeling next to nothing when i was in high school, but after that i felt super confident and generally great, so not too bad. Overall, i have never felt totally disconnected like this before and for as long as this has been going on. I just think i want this to stop and i want to be in control again. I just have no idea exactly what this is or whether it's my fault because of my poor coping mechanism."
513,Are there any services provided for a patient to have therapy sessions with a psychiatrist?,"I have a bunch of different problems going back more than 10 years that include depression, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, etc. All my psychiatrists in the past just ask me my symptoms and give me medications based on that. In several cases they ask what  they should give me and it just feels like so much pressure since I feel like I shouldn’t be the one making that decision. My appointments never last more than 5 minutes. And it’s impossible to go through my emotions and thinking process in that short period of time. I feel my issue is not being addressed because I find it difficult to let the doctor know what I’m feeling and in turn they can’t make a decision in such a short amount of time. I understand that there are therapists who are specifically for that, but are there a mix of both? A doctor that talks to you for several sessions and prescribes as needed? Or are those just a movies thing? I have a great job now with amazing benefits and considering leaving the place I’m in right now, but not sure again where to start. Any advice appreciated."
514,I could have saved him,"This all started in 2018 during my graduate degree. I had great friends, Family, and also my wonderful SO. I had everything I needed in my life, looks like I've peaked in my life. But as they say ""too much happiness always overflows into tears of sorrow""

The next thing I know, my best friend was going through depression and I was trying my best to help, support, and encourage him. I used to call him back and forth every day just to check up on him and his health. 

It was my final week, and the stress had its toll on me. I was studying for my test and I texted him saying that I will call him after my test. Next thing I know, he is missing and I have a text from him, ""Why are you ignoring me like everyone else?"".

I got to know that he committed suicide. I didn't know what to do and how to feel, you could say I was in shock, I could barely feel anything anymore. I blamed my self for his suicide, only if I called him that day, he would have been alive. 

I tried to live my life as nothing has happened, and it was working for a few months. But little did I know, It was getting worse. I started having nightmares, I was afraid to make friends, afraid to get close to anyone who called me a friend, cause I don't want to them to blame me for being an ignorant friend.

My mental health was shit, but, pretended everything was fine. I could barely focus on myself. I tried to bury my self by working part-time and shifting my focus on something else. I was not brave enough to let people know what I was going through. My SO repeatedly said I was behaving differently, I wish I had the strength to tell her what was going on in my life. I had to break up, cause I don't want her to be with this depressed piece of shit.

I was trying my best to work on myself. Next thing I know another friend of mine has met with an accident. I was devastated.

 Exactly a year ago I had everything friends, family, SO. Now I just have my Family and I wish I was brave enough to explain to them what is going on in my life. I can barely sleep anymore, I end up crying every night. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. No goals and no ambitions. I don't wanna die either.

I feel like I'm lost and empty inside and too afraid to ask for help.

I wish, I did call my friend that day. I wish, I shared what I was going through with my SO. I wish I had the courage to get help."

I eat the same unhealthy junk food everyday, my home is always a mess, I either stay in bed, or at my desk all day and never leave the house, never exercise, never have motivation or interest in anything, terrible hygiene, i don't remember the last time I saw the sun or had fresh air, I barely get enough sleep. I wake up exhausted and disgusted at myself and feel like I'm dying, either from it feeling hard to breathe or like all the junk food is squishing my heart. 

I know I'm a mess, and I hate it, I hate feeling my life span shrink yet being too exhausted or unmotivated to even get up in the morning. I've tried multiple times to push myself, to make good habits but I always end up right back here, tired, always so tired. I'm not sure what to do besides just let myself wither away rather than waste resources."

I think I've grown attached to people and I don't like it. I don't feel good about being alone, being left alone, or doing things on my own. I feel as if I can't achieve anything if I do things alone. It's a terrible feeling that I feel everyday and I don't want to feel like this anymore.

I feel like I cant think clearly and I do get stressed very easily over basic stuff like cooking and I cant stop thinking about certain thoughts in my head and I keep thinking about the same things over and over the whole day and I have a hard time to notice my surroundings.

525,"Multiple personalities or Pretending to have, Should I comment with my therapist?","Hello, first time in this community. English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes in the text.

Well, where do I start?

Since I can remember I have been dealing with symptoms of depersonalization and dissociation since childhood, as well as a very (very) maladapitive daydream, where I used to spend hours in an imaginary world created by me.

My childhood went as far as I remember (because I don't remember much of it) very difficult, with an extremely emotionally absent father and an engulfing mother who insisted on trying to control my personality, I was always an introvert but she wanted to turn me into a person talkative and super communicable, we have fought several times over I don't want to go to courses where I was the target of teasing and bullying from the whole class.

I don't like to talk about it, but I was also exposed to pornography very early when I was just 9 years old.

I used to be a very lonely child, I didn't know how to deal with trauma so I started to internalize things that I wanted to talk about, things that hurt me, emotions and other things like that. In adolescence I had depression and suicidal idealization because I could not stand to deal with all this locked up inside me anymore.

For a long time, I can remember 2 characters in my mind: The two have different ages than mine and slightly different personalities, one being much more assertive and sincere, while I tend to doubt my perceptions and be indecisive.

My behavior can change in the same situation (And I don't see clear factors that can cause this) I can for example answer the same invasive question with excuses and more excuses or be ""crude"" saying that this is not the person's business, it often happens when I am not ""afraid"" of the person or when I feel ""comfortable

I also notice a voice that doesn't fit my way of being, giving opinions on what I do that I usually don't follow, because isn't it my way of doing things or how I do

I really can't say if this is just a creation of my Daydream.

Once I even mentioned this to my therapist, she showed me a blank paper and asked me to speak what I saw there, so I said that I saw 2 people (the characters I mentioned) who were pulling the same rope in opposite directions and I was in the middle of the rope being ""pulled"" by both of them, she told me that she found what I said fascinating and interpreted it as ""the person I wanted to be and the person I didn't want to be""

Sometimes I am very anxious and bothering with memories, so I have the symptoms of depersonalization, in which I see everything around me as something unreal and fanciful, soon after I become calm, centered and correct, in a strange way I seem to forget what bothered.

I wanted to talk to my therapist about it, but I'm afraid she'll see it as an excuse of mine, since she ""analyzed"" the subject in the paper.

I know I have the symptoms of depersonalization and dissociation but really I think I may be in the beginning of insanity or something else, as it would be extremely strange if I suspected I had DID and found out that I am faking it.

I really wonder if I should waste time with this, because I have no confidence in myself and my interpretations.

I wanted some advice, should I tell my therapist? Wouldn't that be unnecessary insistence?"
526,Why do I feel like this?,"I always get in these random moods where I don't feel like doing anything and I just get really tired and annoyed at everything. Today is one of those days. I don't feel like taking a shower, I don't feel like eating, and I don't feel like going to class (I already skipped 1 class today). I also get tired a lot more.  I would never self diagnose myself because that creates a lot of misinformation. But I think something's wrong with me. These moods literally come out of nowhere and last for about a week. I'm just so tired."

If we all listened more attentively to each other, asked each other questions with the intention of understanding each other better, if we put our phones away, stopped interrupting and waiting for our turn to talk, the world would be a lot better off. We need to be patient enough to hear each other's stories. It really helps."
529,Living in my household is painfull,"Hey /r/mentalhealth, just feel like mindlessly ranting to express myself somehow and possibly release this feeling I have.

So to begin, both my parents are deaf and have been their entire life, thats come with some obvious difficulties growing up, especially for me being the eldest son, one of the difficulties being very slow child communication development, but I went to speech therapy for about 2 years when I was young, but I still see myself 'behind' others.

But by far, like miles further, the biggest difficulty is what the household is like, my mum constantly results to screaming her lungs off whenever it comes to ANY complication, for example she wants the ipad, she screams and screams and wont stop till she gets it, I live with 3 younger brothers and shes constantly screaming at them, and I hear it, I hear all of it, all the time, when im sleeping (or trying to), trying to study, read or talk to friends online; its so frequent and consistent but it feels like im never going to get used to it, its been years of constant headaches, ringing and bad dreams (I hear her screams in my sleep, and its horrible).

As a result I'm super on edge, jumpy and moody all the time. I get criticised for being too serious all the time, but I'm sure its because of the way I've developed living in this house hold.

I speak to her about it and she laughs it off like its nothing, she always explains ""i'm deaf what do you want me to do"", my dad is deaf he doesn't act like this!, my friends parents are deaf and they are the polar opposite of my mum!.

I have this hatred for my parents that I dont think I will ever get over because of my experience, I want to move country/home and never come back.

To give you an example of how loud she usually is, i live in a 2 storey dwelling with timber interior walls  and brick/block exterior, i can hear her scream from outside the house, I can hear her inside the house with Bose quite-masters (bought specifically for this problem, known for sound reduction).

I know my mother has a disability, but she knows whats shes doing and she doing it to annoy me so I have to do the work of telling my brothers off instead of her"

In the moment I believe it wholly - Its almost like you're watching a film you've seen before and you know something is about to happen, but it plays out in real life and then fizzles into nothing.

My biggest problem is that I can't handle this good, if get depressed, I fall into a state where I can't free myself...
And it makes me even more sad, if no one cares, and they just ignore me.

536,I don’t think I want to exist.,"I don’t want to exist right now. I don’t want to be here anymore. Everything just keeps getting worse and spiraling downward. 

 I think I might want to die, but I can’t tell my parents that. I don’t want them to feel bad, and they have their own issues right now. My dad is finally recovering from drug abuse and getting treatment for his mental illnesses, but he’s still not really okay yet. My mom is recovering from some of the horrible things he said and did to her when they were together. If I told my parents, I worry that my mom would be upset, and that my dad would be REALLY upset and maybe start doing drugs again. 

  I just don’t feel good at all right now. I feel homesick while at home and I’ve felt bad on and off for a few months now. Its increasingly worse this week. Someone who I care deeply about and would consider a family member overdosed on her dads pills recently, and I don’t even know how to feel. I fear that I could have prevented this and maybe, I even contributed to what she did. I know I unintentionally hurt others feelings sometimes, and she took the pills the day after I last saw her. She is okay right now, but I really hope her decision had nothing to do with me. Her mom said she did it too feel better and not hurt herself, and again she is thankfully getting better but I just feel even worse now.

   I just hate myself. I can’t do anything. I can’t complete my schoolwork, I literally refused to go to school yesterday because I feel like I can’t do it, I keep making others angry with me and upset and everything is too hard for me. I don’t know if I want to die or not, but I’m scared. I think I’ve actually contemplated both running away and ending it a few times this week. I don’t know what to do. Im just so stupid and I hate it. 

   I need help, but I can’t get it by myself (I’m 14). I want to say I need help, but the words won’t come out."

‌Every cut is a story.

Every cut is a story,  
Each scar has its own glory,   
Soon you'll meet your demise, 
After a while it starts to feel mandatory,  
Before you know it you'll be facing the skies,  
Under memento Mori. 

You try to hide,  
And everyone thinks your just shy,  
They never ask how you are,  
Little do they know you want to fly- sky high,  
You're short lived and expensive like a cigar,  
But it doesn't matter because no one would cry after they say their goodbyes.  

Stop lying to yourself,  
You'll crack, succumb to your mental health,  
Useless, impractical and dysfunctional,  
Can't fix a bike or make a shelf,  
Got no friends or lovers you're unlovable,  
You can't do the right thing, I'll just have to make you do it myself.  

Stop resisting,  
On your arm you're sewing,  
Go ahead do it on your wrist,  
Grab the blade and start sliding,  
You have to listen to me and I insist,  
Ignore the thoughts that keep recurring.  

17th December, left arm, razor blade,  
Don't remember let these fade,  
Spent Christmas alone, decided to cut,   
But no it wasn't that bad, someone came to my aid,  
Went to her house, laughed and ate chestnuts,  
My brain tells me this but no, I'm being played.  

Your fable is just fake and created,   
You're not loved you're extremely hated,  
No. I've got family and friends,  
You take my mind and warp it, make it dictated,  
And all I've pissed I can make amends,  
You've failed to make me aggravated.  

It was all the thoughts of self harm,  
Why would I get happy from cuts on my arm?  
But it wasn't, it was the positive that came in my  anecdotes.  
No matter how anxious you've got to stay calm,  
There's always a positive or a scapegoat,  
So drop the rope or firearm,  

Always find the sliver lining,  
Never fall prey to your thoughts whining,  
There's always a meaning or purpose,  
The positives are what you need to be finding,  
So don't bleed and go to the nurse,  
Listen to your heart and you'll be shining.  

Every cut is a story,  
Each scar has its glory

543,I have never accomplished anything ever,"I’m nearly 21. I see a lot of posts like this saying ‘I feel like a failure, I got my degree and never did anything with it blah blah’ but I really have never accomplished anything. When I was young I never stuck to any sports/hobbies like my friends, got into high school and didn’t finish, dropped out in year 10. Failed every course I have tried. My first job was a Christmas casual position so only lasted from October till February. Second job I ran out crying on the fourth day and never returned. Third job was a 3 month long internship, they decided they didn’t want me after the 3 months was up. Last job lasted 9 months. Failed my driving test twice. I don’t have any friends. How can I keep going and staying positive when everything I do fails?"
544,How do I accept feelings instead of trying to fight them or rationalise them?,"I’ve been pondering this today. I might even not be fighting the feeling, but rather not accepting my inability to accept this particular feeling or lot of feelings. How do you guys deal with maintaining positive change and not returning to old thinking patterns? It feels like although I have begun therapy and I have been processing a difficult situation I am in now, I am slowly going back to depersonalising."

546,"I'm finally getting real, actual psych testing to help come up with a legitimate plan of care","My whole life I've been a bunch of DSM diagnoses with the letters NOS or words Rule out next to them. I've been nothing but a walking ball of mental illnesses and treated for about 8 different things, none of which actually made any sense.

My current provider's want to get a better picture at what's going on and I'm getting legitimate testing and I'm excited because I'll be able to have a more individualized plan of care to help with the things I need help with. It's been a struggle at 26 being told since I was a child that this is what I'm living with and this is how itll be treated. It feels freeing to know that I will get the help I truly need.

It's time to start working towards what important to me and staying happy, healthy, and future focused."
547,Short burst of rage,"Whenever I find myself getting overwhelmed or annoyed with something to a point, I find myself getting these short burst of rage that cause me to lash out on nearby objects or just simply find myself slamming my fist in a wall to release the energy. Does anybody have some tips for helping keep myself calm during these moments?"
548,Need Help,Does it count as hallucinating when I see motion in pictures? My most recent episode a woman blinked at me in an online add.
549,I don’t know if I’m autistic or if there is something else wrong with me,"I started having these thoughts months back before COVID, about October last year. I keep thinking there’s something wrong with me like I’m not right, I don’t feel normal. But that’s the thing what is normal. I feel like I have a problem but I don’t know what it is, my mind plays tricks on me thinking what if I have personally disorder or autism. And to be honest. I want it to stop. I have depression and anxiety and take sertrine 100mg. I asked one friend if he thinks I’m autistic and he says I act like it sometimes. But that doesn’t cut it. I feel really lost. My behaviour type to me feels not normal. I do random things when I’m on my own, when I was younger I pretended I was doing a YouTube video, when there was no one there but me. I rarely do this but I speak to myself like I’m in a 3rd person type thing. Like I’m talking to myself. I need help. But I don’t know if I’m just plain weird or if I may have a problem. Please let me know as this stuff gets to me"
550,I need to get something off my chest and don’t have anywhere else to vent. It’ll be a long post so I don’t expect anyone to read it I just need to get it out.,"I lost my mom when I was nine years old. She passed in the middle of the night of my parents 11th wedding anniversary to a blown aneurysm. At the age of nine I understood what had happened and all but I didn’t know how to let myself grieve. I cried for a very long time but I never really healed from that trauma. 

My dad remarried and my stepmom is not a nice lady. She is a Karen. But she also narcissistic and most likely bi-polar but she hasn’t ever talked to anyone about that. She would get uncomfortable with anything pertaining to my mom. She cut my sisters and I off from my moms family and didn’t allow us to talk about her at all. 

She would “have conversations” with me but it just her telling me that I was ungrateful and selfish. They always escalated to yelling. I started to change how I did things just to please her so she wouldn’t yell at me. I hardly had any friends in high school because their parents would talk to my stepmom and even though I was a good kid, if I did anything and mean anything it would always get back her. So I stopped doing things. I went to school, cheer practice, work and home. I never went to parties I never had sleepovers. Nothing. 

When I was deciding where to go for college one of the main factor was how far away the school was. I had the gpa and record to get into any school except maybe Ivy Leagues. I ended up attending culinary school for baking and pastry arts. This school was 8 hours away from my hometown. This program was part of a community college. She felt I wasn’t living up to my potential and I should just suck it up and go to a university to get a degree that I probably wouldn’t use. Well, I graduated in one year I was at the top of my class, I was on a national championship culinary team and got a great job right after graduation. I met an amazing guy while in school and we’ve now been together for almost two years. 

I still live 8 hours away from my parents and I’m finally able to grieve and reconnect with my moms family. My stepmom no longer talks to me because I told her (politely) that she needed to start respecting me as an adult. 

You may have noticed I have not mentioned my dad. Let’s just say he does not wear the pants in the relationship and never stood up for me or my sisters against my stepmom. He will occasionally talk to me but not often because he doesn’t want to upset my stepmom. 

I am happy to say that at this point in my life I am finally happy and it’s all thanks to me realizing that I don’t need to take shit from anyone anymore and I’m living my life for me.

551,"When increasing your SSRI dosage, did you ever feel 'over-medicated', but then leveled out after time","I recently upped the dosage on my SSRI 9 days ago.

I've been feeling over-medicated to the point where I've felt loaded on multiple occasions.

It feels as though I'm getting too much serotonin at times, a similar feeling to the uncomfortable feeling of coming down from mdma.

Have you experienced this? Did you have to cut back your dose or did you level out after time?"
552,What's the point of my existence?,"Life has never been easy. I know that probably sounds like a cliché, but it has been tough. 

My parents were never happy in their marriage, they were both verbally and physically abusive. Most of my childhood memoeries are of me crying and hiding under the bed, or of me protecting my sister, or of me wanting it all to end. 

As a kid, I was molested by my dad's friend and when I finally told my parents (last year), they invited him to open their new clinic (early this year) cuz ""he has connections"". They never consoled me or even reached out before inviting the bastard. Instead they blame me for not talking to them or ""drifting away from the love of the family"". 

As a teen, I was in a sexually abusive relationship where my ex used to blackmail me/threaten me that he would hurt himself so I would say yes to having sex. He once slit his forearm and forced me to strip and have sex with him with his blood spilled all around us. 

I'm now in a relationship, the guy is wonderful but he never stands up and fights for what he wants. I've finally started putting myself first and every single person in my life hates it, save for my sister. 

We are to be married in a few months and my parents are now trying to be more controlling than ever, and I'm afraid this is the end of me even having a voice. I'm afraid that I can no longer fight for what I want or what makes me happy. I'm afraid that no one will truly want me for who I am. 

I've already started to compromise on things that are important to me. Despite me telling people (my family, bf and his family) that I'm lonely, no one truly wants to do anything to help. 

I've been losing my mind and I've gotten to a point where I don't want to live anymore. The only thing I'm afraid of, is how it will affect my sister. 

I really don't have the will to live a half life."
553,"I really hate people who don't know what's happening behind the scenes, yet Judge people who talks about their mental health?","I understand it, where you have a point but not everyone who talks about their anxiety or mental health or autism is ""faking it"" you don't know how much they been acting or trying to show it to other people? For myself yes i have alot of post talks about my ""anxiety"" because i find there no there place in can open up to just here.. hell you say you're faking it, i don't care.. it's alright a fight in my head because it do feels fake and unreal.. but don't you judge any person, maybe they have suffered alot then you know, I'm don't know, i feel like im faking it.. but i don't anything about it.. I'm so sarced and trying my best to understand it.. it's really hard"
554,I want to wreck myself now,"Just 15 hours ago, I said I would be ok  and did not commit suicide. And now I want to do it again.
I have my Revolver laying right next to me, loaded whit 2 rounds. I could free myself from all my problems, by just pulling that trigger...
I am trying to not do it, but I focus every second on that thing while I write this.

557,There’s no point to life,"My household is under isolation due to COVID-19 and I'm scared about losing my mom. I think I’ve lost my will to live. I feel like I don't really have anyone to confide in and there's really no one who actually cares about me. I feel like all my friends only try to help me because it’s their obligation to. But I’ve also been unintentionally pushing people away from me I think. I just hate the way I am. How I deal with things. I don’t know why I’m like this, and I want to change how I am but I can’t. I don’t feel like doing anything.

I grew up in a Christian household and now I’m not so sure what I believe in. I think I would’ve committed suicide a long time ago if I wasn’t scared that there’s a chance I would go to hell. I want to die, but I can’t kill myself. If somehow I was dead tomorrow, I would be glad. I just don’t wanna feel anything and deal with anything anymore."
558,I hate therapy but...,"But I also find it beneficial. I hear the opposite from a lot of the people around me. They found it to be okay but not beneficial and stopped. I hate it, it’s beneficial but I hate talking. I hate journaling. I hate trying rather than just being a mental f*ckf*ck running around even though that’s not really an available option to live life. It’s annoying. Anyone else get this way?"
559,Could a lot of caffeine use lead to psychotic symptoms/problems later in life since it is psychoactive?,Title kinda sums it up. I have my whole life drank a lot of soda and so a lot of caffeine and am now recovering from a psychosis. I am wondering if always drinking sodas could have had negative affects on my mental health.

561,anti-depressants and parents,my mother has been advised multiple times by professionals that they think that anti-depressants would be extremely helpful but everytime it’s brought up it’s a firm “no” which is hard enough but then she is always saying “why are you so sad all the time” “you need to find a reason to get out of bed” “you just don’t care anymore” like therapy isn’t working but she’s always taking about how i’m too sad. it’s so confusing. she thinks i’m exaggerating it and i could NEVER tell her that i’m having trouble with something else. i get shouted at and told i need to find motivation to get up and do this and that and when i try to tell her that getting out of bed in the motioning is hard she’s is just shouting at me for being lazy. like i don’t want to take pills but i’m starting to feel like it’s my only option cuz everything is getting so much harder.
562,Choosing a therapist (please help!),"Hey everyone. As recommended by my primary doctor, I’m (f 21) currently seeking a therapist for anxiety, depression, and (possible) adult ADHD related issues. I’ve narrowed my search down to three psychotherapists and can’t decide between them so I figured I might as well see what other people think.

Therapist 1: Specializes is anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Solely works with adults. Offers online therapy at all times and is easy to get there by car and public transport. Is BIPOC, which I can relate to. Sessions are likely covered by insurance. 

Therapist 2: Specializes in anxiety, depression, and trauma. Works with people 12+. Offers online therapy at all times and is also easy to get there by car and public transport. Also BIPOC and states that they are allied with various marginalized communities which is important to me. Sessions likely covered by insurance. 

Therapist 3: Specializes in anxiety, depression, and self-sabotaging avoidance behaviours (basically behaviours that my doctor thinks might be ADHD). Works solely with adults. Offers online therapy only during the pandemic, is not accessible by public transit, and is really far from my home. Not BIPOC and doesn’t state allyship. Is 100% covered by insurance. 

I had a negative experience in the past with a mental health practitioner and really want to make sure I don’t pick someone who will add to the negative experiences. Please let me know what you think! Thanks for reading."
563,love having my dog around me,i like my dog lying in bed with me it just makes me feel less alone and it stops me from feeling as sad. i just had my dog laying with me and i felt so comfortable and happy and then my sibling came into my room and took the dog into her room. i now feel so alone and sad and idk why?

565,I don't like to change locations,"I've talked to many counselors about this and I don't know what else to call it. whether I'm going to get food or see a friend or go to class, I just don't want to leave where I am at the moment. I don't want to leave my room most days, but I often do anyway because I have responsibilities. I find it difficult to go to eat food (I live on a college campus) but when I do, I also don't want to leave that place once I get there. does anyone else feel like this? is it called something? is it a symptom of something? I just don't know how to express this struggle to anyone without repeating that I don't like changing locations."
566,Who can I call for a free therapy session?,"Hey guys, I’ve been dealing with insomnia and depression for the past few months. I’ve finally been able to get an appointment with a therapist but that won’t occur until October. I would like to speak to somebody sooner if possible even if it’s a brief session.

Any suggestions?"
567,No escape,"I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t kill myself, and can’t harm myself, I can’t comfort myself, I can’t better my situation, I can’t take a break, I can’t even speak much.

569,How bad do you have to be to go to a mental hospital?,"TW / light mention of suicide 

I’m 19F. I know admitting yourself to one is a worst case scenario type of thing. But like my suicidal urges are getting worse and I’m actively afraid that I’ll do it. I almost went through with it two weeks ago and again a few days ago. I also feel like I’m starting to lose touch with reality again. I just am terrified of being a burden on others and I don’t want to take resources away from people who need it more, because I can still take care of myself as much as I need to but its getting harder and scarier to. And I’m worried that I’d be doing it for attention and to manipulate people into caring for me. 

I just don’t know if I should do it or not. If I don’t, what do I do? I have barely any experience with mental health treatment as my parents never wanted to get me help. I don’t have a GP anymore, so I can’t get a referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist, and regular therapists and counselors have never been any help to me (and most of them are completely full on online meetings). What is the best thing I should do?"

572,"Why am I Only Creative After Midnight? Disrupted sleeping patterns, Love Languages, Mental Health","&amp;#x200B;

 The last few months, since lockdown started, my [sleeping patterns](https://www.taratalks.net/post/blog-love-languages-late-night-writing) have been awful. Up at night, not being able to sleep (as often doing less during the day) and I’m, only now, starting to get into a more manageable routine! What’s infuriating is that for months I would ask myself ‘*Why am I only creative after midnight?’*  Maybe it’s something about the city being asleep, (or sleepier) the quiet and peacefulness. Either way, it’s a habit I will break out of…

573,turning down career support/opportunities,"i have been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time and since going to university i struggled in such a way that i feel fairly sure i also have some other undiagnosed disorder (specifically ADHD or aspergers). i have been treated with therapy and antidepressants but still could not manage myself and ended up doing quite poorly in my degree. i could not manage deadlines, i could not self motivate, i could not focus.

i talked to my doctor and am now waiting to see a specialist. i tried to apply for jobs in my degree field (computer science) but have been unsuccessful so far. SO, my parents friend (who i barely know), who works in tech, offered to give me guidance and even offered to put in a good word about me to some of their contacts.  theyve sent me loads of helpful resources, and have been very supportive and attentive, and i am grateful, but i really cannot keep up with their pace. applying to competitive jobs is intense ofc, but  it feels almost impossible to me given i feel i have objective reason to believe i will not be a good hire. im a bad liar, so i doubt i could make it through interviews without letting on how low my opinion of my abilities is. i have recently started therapy, and my therapist said she thinks its a good idea for me to not worry about jobs right now (my parents are willing to support me for the time being, which i am grateful for too)

nothing has changed for me since my degree. im still very much the same person who barely succeeded to hand in work after being given heaps of extra time despite feeling like i was trying as hard as i could.  i dont see why in a job id be much different. so i dont actually want this family friend to suggest me to people they know in the industry, because if i end up being terrible itd be on them.

i want to tell this family friend that i cant act on all their advice rn and dont think im ready to push myself in a new competitive career. they also seem to be the kind of person who will need to be explicitly told this, since so far my (polite but) unenthusiastic and kind of late responses to their texts and emails have done nothing to slow them down in their efforts to help (very nice in theory and i feel very bad that i cant just appreciate it, but what can you do)

BUT i also dont want to be rude to them, or overly explain why i am struggling so much with their advice. i dont want to talk about my mental health issues with them (my parents barely even know much about it so i dont want to talk to their friend about it) especially given so far our correspondence has been very formal/professional. 

part of me still thinks that maybe if i get diagosed and treated in future in a way that helps me cope better, id still want all these resources and possibly want to pursue a career in this area after all. i dont want to burn bridges. 

does anyone have any suggestions for how i could politely tell this person i dont want any more of their advice for now, while not disclosing too many health issue details?"

*You didn’t stand a chance at times – at work when your head was chaotic, when you couldn’t sleep, when you were exhausted with the unease in your body, when you were all too quick to point the finger your way and when you let others down - because of your mental health and physical pain - without proper explanation.

575,I could use some advice,"Hi, I'm a random 14 y/o on the internet and need some advice on my current situation. So for some context, my parents got married when i was very young, like 2, and they got divorced when I was 9. They got divorced because my dad cheated on my mom with another woman. Then my dad started to make out with a married woman who he works with (her husband doesn't know yet). Finally, he bought a new house and lives with a different woman who has 3 kids. I have to rotate between houses each week, and I hate my dad. I hate my dad not so much for his past, but because of his personality. He keeps trying to force down my throat that I should treat the 3 kids better than my own brother and to be super nice to them and help out around the house. I would totally do this, but I do not get anything in return and I don't even like 2 of the 3 kids, as they are pretty young. The eldest son I can get along with fine. Also my dad always tries to tell me to stop being an introvert and to stop using free time on activities that I actually enjoy, like video games and hanging out with my friends.

Recently, I have wanted more than ever to live with my mom and to never have to live with my dad again, but I did some research and apparently the court doesn't give two shits about which parent you want to permanently reside at, because your choice could not be what you want, but what one of your parents want. And I desperately want to just live at my mom's house and have peace and quiet and no more stress from my dad's family. 

Any advice?"
576,I didn’t take a lax but had the same affect please read...,"I’m 19 and I don’t have an ED because I’m 195lbs and haven’t lost any weight but I do take laxatives (and have been for months) when I eat a lot so I had 2 doughnuts today after eating 90 calories yesterday but decided not to take laxatives because I did my burn 1,000 work out and walked 2 miles but I had the same affect without taking anything...

I take laxatives before I eat a high calorie food but decided to stop a week ago and just eat healthy instead... but for the first time I ate crap I got the craps as if I did take them... 

What’s going on it’s been over a week since I last took one"
577,i cannot tell if i have an ed.,"a few years ago, i used to suffer from bulimia. i was bulimic for about three years. however, i stopped binging and purging reguarly and now i am so happy and feeling great! 

about once a week or more depending on how i feel, however, i’ll purge. i suffer from some anxiety and it tends to calm me. it also helps me feel less full if i eat too fast or too much on accident.

i don’t binge and i don’t constantly think about my weight. i am very happy, i am just stressed out sometimes. 

is this an issue i should be concerned about?"
578,There is a lot of pent up emotions inside me which i dont know what they are and what to do with them.,I (16M) feel like there is a lot of pent up emotions its mostly the domestic violence my mom had to go through in my early childhood which i couldnt stop in any way for year i finally did but i wished it never happened(if you want to know more about  domestic violence lasted it lasted around 2 to 3 years when i was a kid which i tried to stop by watching my dad beat my mom but he never did in the and my mothers parents stepped in because i told them my father repented and he is now just a loud goofball which i love him he did something really hard) i never thought about this let alone speaking about it anywhere there is not a single soul alive who knows besides family i think that what i saw kind of broke me my parents arent aware since i dont want to worry them but there is a lot of unknown emotions if someone hugs and embraces me there is a chance that i will cry i dont know how to deal with this. This is all very foreign to me.
579,Telling my mom,"A while back my mom found out i self harm and I've been in therapy. But she didn't find out about my eating disorder and i didn't tell anybody. It was getting really hard to totally keep in so i told my therapist she's worried about me and said to my mom she recommends i get more sessions. So of course now my mom knows something is up that I'm not telling her and she's noticed I've lost alot of weight and it's just getting stressful.

She said it hurts her more to see me unhappy and not know what's going on then to know i don't want to hurt her and it's just getting to a point where she needs to know. I'm really scared to tell her how should i start the conversation should i write a letter or do it face to face when should i do it what should i say? I don't know what to do."
580,I was excited for my first therapy session today but my therapist never showed up :( now I feel sad and confused,"I’ve been feeling really stressed out and down since graduating college and moving back in with my parents and finally felt like it was time to deal with some lifelong issues so I took the time to research therapists and make an appointment. I was actually really excited for my first session which was supposed to be today and had been planning everything I wanted to talk about and hoping to start feeling better about things. When I got to her office the door to the suite she specified was locked so I texted the number she emailed me. Then I called the number. Finally I emailed her. I started wondering if this was some sort of weird test to see how I handled a situation like that. Then I started to accept that I had been completely forgotten about. All in all I sat there for 45 minutes waiting before finally leaving. Once I got to my car I completely broke down and couldn’t stop crying. 

At first I was really angry with her for wasting my time and then I just felt super hurt for getting my hopes up for something and being let down and just totally forgotten about. I felt like an idiot sitting there being stood up for my first ever therapy session. I felt like I was really putting myself out there and ready to be vulnerable only to wind up feeling like shit. I feel so defeated that my first attempt to actually get better went so badly. I feel like this just keeps happening to me and I immediately felt my guard fly back up. I think this experience was really triggering for me and brought up a lot of feelings of rejection and abandonment and worthlessness. It basically ruined my whole day and I think has really set me back in terms of trust. 

She later texted me that she had put me down for the next week instead of today and that she’d get back to me. Her full text read “Hello so sorry had you in book for the 23rd. Please forgive! I’ll get back to you.” So I realize she didn’t forget about me. But it still hurt a lot and sucked that she didn’t respond to my text or email or phone call til an hour later. Also we didn’t clarify the date as a number but I made the appointment on Thursday 9/10 for “next wednesday” which I understood to be today, 9/16. I feel like that is the obvious understanding. My question is should I try doing another session with her? Am I overreacting by being so hurt and angry? Do you think she genuinely thought “next wednesday” meant 9/23 or did she make a mistake? Maybe she really did forget about me and made that up as an excuse? All in all I don’t know how I’m supposed to trust her now. Maybe that’s something I should try to work on with her though? Or should I just try to find a therapist with better communication. skills? I don’t really know what to do. 

TL;DR I was supposed to have my first therapy session today and my therapist stood me up. Should I try again with the same therapist or find someone new?"
581,Mentally drained with what we live in?,"Am I the only one being mentally drained by all the crap that happens to us these decades? Why can't we have golden times like in 80's in America?(fortune making, smoking like if there was no tomorrow and no internet). Born in 1983 - I see the economic, natural disasters and skyrocketing diseases like cancer and now Covid, not to mention Karen's, millenials and the celebrities by a sex-tape? Am I the only one tired of that? I feel that it is unfair. I know times before Internet and life was so better before. I have to cut myself from news to recuperate. Can't believe no one is celebrating good news."
582,Stranger complex,"One day some thought crossed my mind.. I’m afraid this thought is the most terrifying one I have ever experienced and I’m not sure if I can recover from this.. 
Before I start let me tell a short story. My father is the man I neither could, can or will be able to stand. Actually we have standard relationship from outer view but, I feel so much psychological chemistry towards him. I always hated him moving, talking, eating, breathing, sleeping, sitting... I have never wanted to look at him, to listen to him, to talk to him. I am sure no further explanation is needed to read the situation.. so, that one day I started believing that I’m just like him. And I realized that he had been growing too much roots through my soul and my personality... I feel horrified. I still have some hope that I can change that.. but these roots are developed on the deepest levels.."
583,There should be a psychiatrist instead of a school councillors to talk to students about their mental health.,I am a teen and the school councillor I talked about my mental health with basically just told me that my grades are good so I don’t need to worry about it and that there many other students like me even in my own class. turns out I did need to worry about it because I had depression and by ignoring it only got worse. And also HOW IS KNOWING THAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE SHIT TO SUPPOSED TO HELP THAT JUST UPSET ME EVEN MORE. I get knowing that I am not alone helps but if half the people in my school are depressed there might just be a problem with the school.
584,Oooof--rough day at Program,"I am in a Partial Hospitalization Program at my local Counseling Center (for those who didn't know this), which runs from 11:30 am (though next week it goes to 10:30 am--an hour earlier!!) until 3:00 pm. It is basically a lot of therapy groups with topics on different coping skills, about anxiety and depression (and what they are), and suicide because this is Suicide Awareness Month.  


I admit, I have been having a hard time with my Probation lately. No, I didn't violate--not even close--but some things my PO is doing is just unprofessional and wrong. It has to do with the Forensic Case Manager I have. Look that up--it is a fascinating read. I won't get into it here because it is relevant, but very personal. Basically, I said something to the Case Manager in confidence and she still blabbed it to the Probation Officer. Now that would be FINE if it had pertained to my Probation or my conditions or whatever, but it had NOTHING to do with any of those. It was a personal matter between the Case Manager and me...and I was just stating my feelings about something to her. She broke my trust, and now she will have to work DAMN hard to get that back. I was so upset and depressed that the counselor at the Center actually had called me into the office...to have a one-on-one. I have to say that this counselor had made a HUGE difference for me. Nothing was done (nothing really COULD be done) but still...just her understanding what I was saying and agreeing that the CM had broken my trust and was maybe not in the ""wrong"" but it really should not have happened. I could have switched CM, but I said it was a moot point because it would be the same with any of them. I am still depressed, but that is no longer bothering me. I am very low today. I had to sign a document saying that I am safe and she asked the dreaded question: are you going to or do you want to hurt yourself. I do NOT want to kill myself (thanks to that one post on here and I do have things to live for) but I want to cut and I think I probably will sometime before this day is out. We also talked a lot about my disorder...and I have come to a pretty (sad--distressing--disturbing???) conclusion that I really do not want to stop setting fires and I will not stop. I won't do anything illegal again if I can help it (NOT going back to prison because next time it will be for 2 years or more UGH) but I am not ready to stop the flames...

No more on that. I have talked enough about that. Judge if you want. I don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend who is also a felon, an arsonist (he really DID commit arson by burning down a barn when he was younger--he is the same age as I am almost), and a pyromaniac. He also has pyrophilia, and if you don't know what that is...you don't really want to know. I am not that...into flames. Yikes. Anyway, they (courts, etc.) had tried to force him into therapy and meds, and he had complied until his Probation was finished...and he told me that it had made NO difference. The pyromania never goes away. We are stuck with it for life--that is just how our brains are wired. Some people are addicted to drugs, alcohol (I am also an alcoholic), whatever. We are addicted to the setting of fires and the flames and the thrill of watching them.   


Talking about my addiction only makes me want to do it more (triggers me)...medications do fuck all for it except make me tired, or sick, or gain weight, whatever...and ignoring it doesn't make it go away either. 0\_0 I even told the counselors this...it is not curable and basically almost untreatable in a lot of the people who DO have the diagnosis, which is &lt;1% of the population of the entire US. It is rare, unstudied, blah blah blah. I've said this all enough. I won't repeat myself. Some therapies work but the person has to WANT to get rid of the desire to set things on fire. I do NOT want to rid myself of one of my oldest ""friends"" that has been with me since childhood.  


So I am depressed as hell, urges to self-harm (and set fires) is really really bad now...I am fucking stuck. I have Oreos here (DOUBLE STUF'D!!!!!) but I have no interest in them. I ate, but not much. My appetite sucks and I am afraid my OTHER ""friend"" Ana is going to come back. That would just be the icing on the cake wouldn't it?  


Sorry for the book.  


TL;DR-- Got confronted about my disorder, tried to explain it, ended up sounding like a fucking IDIOT (who was just justifying a ""bad"" behavior), talked about an incident with Probation and was at least HEARD on that part. Had a bad day--about to cut myself to rid myself of the pain. :(  


Thanks for reading...Love you all. &lt;3"
585,I feel like I'm fading away,"23(M) Over the past 5 years I've experienced a gradual decline in oneself. Not just metaphorically, but quite literally. The easiest way to describe it is that I feel like I'm dying. 
My personality is diminishing, my thoughts are becoming less prevalent, my aspirations, emotions and human-attributes are becoming nothing.
I have lost all direction in life and I'm being carried, or transported, by life itself.

I'm trying not to be dramatic here, but I can't exactly comprehend what I'm feeling as it's happened over a long stretch of time, it's hard to guage the impact, but I'll do my best to explain.

I feel so confused, my working memory is atrocious, I've lost feelings for people and things. I've lost my self control, rationality and my critical thinking ability.

Physically I'm probably ok. I'm reasonably fit and healthy and eat reasonably good food.
My current mental health conditions are somewhat vague, though I'm being treated for ADHD, depression and Anxiety. ADHD seems to fit very well with my current state, though without the ""H"".

TLDR;
I'm very tired and am looking for some support.
My life is running away from me and I don't know what to do.
How can I feel it again?"
586,Voices?,[removed]
587,How do you cope with loosing your only friend?,"I'm an introvert and have always struggled making/keeping friends from young. I've never really fit into a group and in school bounced from one to the other. Saying that I was rather 'popular' (god only knows how) until I dropped out because of my ED. 

Honestly I cut a lot of people off during that time. I realised quite young that some of those people weren't good for me and others I just didn't want to be around. I wasn't interested in partying and boys, I just wanted to stay home. 

I only stayed in contact with one person, who at fifteen I would've said was my best friend, but things changed when she had a kid. She cut me out of her life for awhile and even though we started talking again it just hasn't been the same since. 

I honestly feel like she only stays in contact with me out of pity. We only meet up for a drink now and again. I've tried hundreds of times to see if she wanted to do something, take her son out for the day together or join a gym because she's always complaining about how she needs to get in shape but she would always brush me off. She never wants to hangout just the two of us anymore, there's always got to be a group. 

Since covid i haven't seen her, despite me asking if she wanted to meet up one afternoon last month. I check in with her to see how everyone's doing but she's not once gone out of her way to check in with me. I'm grasping at straws trying to keep this friendship alive because she's all I've had in the last six years. 

I've never been bothered about having a huge friendship group but I never thought I'd have zero before I've even hit mid 20's."
588,Help me please,"I thank you all for reaching out, I didn’t end up going through with my suicide plan but they did keep me in the hospital because of my thoughts . Now that i’m out the pain is still there and I feel a lot of it is in part of the breakup with my girlfriend. My meds don’t help and i still have this unbearable pain. I feel like a part of me is dying and it’s the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. I look pathetic in front of my 13 year old little brother. I’m 21 and I am supposed to be a symbol of strength for him. This girl destroyed me and the doctor and my parents keep emphasizing how i’m only 21 and that i’m too young to be heartbroken. 

We spent the entire summer talking about our plans with each other and about our love. She told me she loved me first and we spoke to each other like it was for sure we’d never be apart. She leaves back to campus for the fall and 2 weeks later she says her feelings have changed 


She basically said she didn’t feel the same about me as she did when she left
and that now that she is back in her element she doesn’t want me anymore
she also said as certain as i felt about her being the love of my life she was certain that i wasn’t hers
and she said since the day she broke up with me she has been good 
and that she only cried that day 
and when i was pouring my heart out on facetime with her and stuff it was almost like she was smirking and laughing 
and when i mentioned saturday (the day we broke up) she was saying how she doesn’t want to talk about that
she is like all good and everything 
she’s talking about some we only dated for three months 
and it was like i was talking to someone completely different than who i’d spent time with 

i just don’t understand how she could be so in love with me and then all of sudden not feel that anymore. it crushes me. i can’t comprehend it. i want to hope that when she comes back in town she feels different and realizes she really loves me but i know that there is a very small chance that happens. as i think of it my heart crumbles more. i’m afraid nothing will be left. i am trying to fight but i have lost all motivation. i really do love her and her love . i have tried to think bad of her but i can’t ever stick with it. please help me i feel so devoid of purpose. she knew about my mental state when i met her . i explained it might be better if i get myself together better before we started dating but she said she didn’t have a problem with it . help me."
589,Depression is hurting my relationship,"So, about a year ago I went to a psychologist for some time because I was feeling depressed for a long time.
after some time being there I was diagnosed with depression (the long term type).
i stopped going there because of CoViD about half a year ago

since then I got a girlfriend and started to feel good again, but recently we both noticed that I've started to act how I act when I'm alone (sad and quiet) when I'm with her,
we talked about it and I'm afraid this could break out relationship.
anyone got any suggestions or tips of how I can act less depressed when I'm with her without forcing myself too much?"

591,Time To Change Campaign,"For the 16th time this month, hello everyone! I hope you’re all doing great. :) 

Today, I read a handful of articles on a former Love Island contestant, Dr. Alex George. Unfortunately, with a heavy heart, Alex’s brother, Llyr, took is own life in July following a battle with Mental Health. Before I start, my heart goes out to the family, such awful news. This news struck my nation (Wales), as he is also from Wales. 

On the UK show “Lorraine”, Alex made his first appearance on television to discuss the matter of his brother. Understandably, Alex said that he will never over this tragedy and pleaded that everyone who is suffering with Mental Health illness, to go and receive the help and support that they deserve. Today post will revolve around receive help and support if you’re battling with Mental Health, it is crucial to do so. 

A quote from Alex: ** ""Mental health can affect anyone and I think that's something I think is so important that we all need to realise. Mental health and physical health are akin, it is an illness and that's why it's so important that we treat it that way**”. 

As Alex said, Mental Health can affect anyone. It is important to treat everyone with kindness. 

""**Please look after yourselves and realise the importance of self-care. Reach out and ask for help, there is no shame in it, don't be afraid**”. 

To whoever is reading this, if you’re batting with Mental Health in silence, speak out **today**. There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed about. You’re a strong person, filled with courage and knowledge. But, you won’t experience the courage and knowledge inside of you ever again, unless you SPEAK OUT. 

There is an organisation called “Time To Change: Let’s End Mental Health Discrimination”. It is a campaign for people to change the way to think about Mental Health and how to act upon Mental Health problems. 
On this website, you’re able to post your very own story and experience. You can do so here: https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/blog/speak-and-speak-out-about-mental-health. Share everything that’s on your mind. :) 

A very useful website for you to share you stories. If you’re willing to share, please do so. It will not only help YOU and boost your confidence, but it will help others to speak out regarding their Mental Health. 

Once again, the website is... https://www.time-to-change.org.uk. 

Thank you for reading guys and girls. It there’s something bothering you, keeping you awake at night or make you feel more distant towards your family and friends, speak to someone. If you’re asking yourself WHO to speak to, there are many people out there: your father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, uncover, aunt, friends, co-worker, your neighbour. Also, there are Mental Health charities out there, such as: CALM, Mind, No Panic, OCD UK, Samaritans, SANE, YoungMinds and much more. 

Don’t be ashamed, embarrassed, nervous or scared about speaking out. Now’s the time to do so! But, if you’re in need to start off slow by talking to someone else first, my PM’s are always open. I’m proud to say I’ve helped a lot of people out in the past to take those important first steps to conquering the illness. 

I’m always here for you! As Alex said, Mental Health can affect anyone, and if you’re here to grab some tips or advice for a family member, once again, I’m more than happy to provide you with as much information as possible. 

Lastly, my heart goes out to Alex and his family. With what has been said, Llyr was a very bright young man with a fantastic career ahead of him. Alex will carry his legacy with him with pride and passion. God bless Alex and his family. He will be looking down at you. 

Thanks everyone! Have a great Wednesday/Thursday! :)"
592,Do I sound mentally ill or am I just in a rut?,[removed]
593,I dont know who I am,"When people tell me to just ""be myself"" it gets me thinking. I create a... mask(?) for everyone i meet, i try to match my personality to theirs, and ive done it for so long that i dont think i really know who i was originally. is something wrong with me? does everyone do this? feel free to ask me questions or something, i guess."
594,Atheist,"My new counsler has brought up a religion a couple of times. Just small comments - like ""God has a plan,"" ""maybe you had a guardian angel."" I know she knows I'm atheist. 

I feel like I should be alarmed she's trying to push her views on me, or subconsciously brain wash me, judging me. 

I really don't want to restart with another counselor. It took me three years to build up the strength and courage to get help... But should I find someone else?"
595,i don’t know how to fix whatever it is that’s gone wrong in my head.,[removed]
596,Coming to terms with death. Spoiler Warning.,"This isn't about suicide.

I'm relatively young and not terminally ill (though sick enough to be house bound). I'm afraid of dying, afraid closing my eyes for the last time. So far no one has presented any solid evidence that god and afterlife exist, so I assume only nothingness awaits me, the death of consciousness. I'm mortified. Daily I keep myself occupied with stuff, but everyone so often it creeps on me, that I am going to die one day.

I've seen some videos of old people being content with death. I envy that feeling of content,

for I am **horrified**."
597,Can anyone help me understand,"I really struggle to put into words what I’m going through but I’ll try my best. Let me start by saying I’m 18m and this has been an ongoing thing for years, earliest I tried to explain what it felt like was 13 and my mother told me it was probably nothing. I’m generally a really calm but slightly ocd guy and I get on well with everything and everyone and I always talk to strangers I meet and am kind to every living thing. Mostly. When I get angry I deal with it fine and I never bottle anything up, when I’m stressed I know how to calm myself down, sometimes I bite my fingers to relieve stress but I don’t do it in a way that hurts me because why would anyone want to hurt themselves.....  what I’m saying is I know that what I’m about to describe is none of these feelings, it doesn’t feel like the me that is typing this, I know it’s still something in me but unless I’m experiencing it it’s so hard to describe. At least once a week  I will go through hours of extremely bad thoughts towards myself and it’s especially bad if I do something small like stub my toe or spilling the slightest bit of water, things that I usually brush off. These thoughts tell me to harm myself and that I’m worthless I will stand there fighting my own arm trying not to bite my fingers until they bleed or trying not to punch a wall, I become completely irrational and don’t care about anything except harm towards myself, I’ve broken my hand before and knuckles and have made myself bleed. I sit there crying afterwards because of what I’ve done to my body. These thoughts aren’t some people in my head telling me this, I know it’s part of me and this is the main reason I struggle to understand and explain to people. I feel as if I’m fighting myself, my head splits into two I sit there on the floor crying telling myself out loud I’m not going to listen to myself anymore and then I’ll shout at myself moving my head one way and the other like I’m having a conversation with someone(it’s hard for me to remember this but I’ve been told I’ve done this) until I listen and hurt myself. I have absolutely no control over this happening and I always try to isolate myself from others when it happens, not only do I become irrational and shaky but my arms and legs kick out a lot and I worry that Im just going to punch something and have no control over it. I don’t understand what’s happening and why it’s happening I feel like I’m going crazy and I’ve asked my mother to call the police before because I’ve been afraid that I’d tell myself to harm other people, I’ll pulled a knife on my mother and sister when they’ve come to see if I was alright, when they approached I instantly put it to my throat, I don’t know what made me do this I’m not sure what part of me told me to do this. It’s not always as bad as this but it can be sometimes it’s just me sitting there for an hour having a conversation with myself and asking myself why I’m doing this and it always ends with me giving in and hurting myself at least a bit. I know it’s not schizophrenia because I don’t have voices it’s only ever myself but if I had to describe it in one way then I’d say it’s like there is two of me and I’m genuinely scared that one day I’m going to hurt myself badly (I never self harm to try feel better) or maybe even someone else (even though it’s only ever been myself). I’m not the best at writing and this was really difficult for me to put into words I’m sorry if it’s not clear."
598,"Ive been having very specific thoughts of hurting myself, mostly with a knife.","Yesterday, my mom had to go to work for a few hours ( she left before 7:30 and and came back home before 10:00. As soon as she left, I had the Idea of taking a sharp knife and cutting my arm and then rubbing salt on the cut. I didnt do it, but the thought of it lingred in my head even after she came back. The only time I forgot about it was when I was on my online class. I also had the urge to bend my fingers the wrong way, I got close to it. I grabbed my finger with my other hand and was ready to do it, but then something snapped and I let go of my finger. This morning I was having thoughts of slicing my throat and skinning my arm with a knife. My mom also left me alone for less than an hour today. I even pretended to do it, pretending that my arm was a knife and running it across my other arm. In the middle of my last class for today, I had a pencil in my hand and I thought of stabbing myself with it. Ive also had thoughts of stabbing my eyeballs. I keep trying to distract myself but It getting harder to distract myself from them."
599,How do I get over a girl I've been in love with for over 3 years,"3 years ago I met a wonderful person. Her name was Zoe. We met in math class after being paired at the same table. At first she was just a really cool friend I got along with. But it soon blossomed and I began to fall for her. I've liked people in the past but I've never loved someone this way before. The very thought of seeing her excited me. It gave me a reason to keep going. To improve myself. I began to lose weight, get better grades. Everything. I even got to top 5 percent of the school. I thought if I worked hard I could prove that I'm worthy of love, to raise a family, to be with her.

She was wonderful. Smart, sweet, incredibly funny. She was everything I've ever wanted. I grew up talking to mostly guys so talking to her was awesome. I felt like I truly made a great friend.

Then Todd came into the picture. Super nice guy. She began dating him before I had a chance to ask her out. A year passed and I didn't give up. We were in our senior year and my love for her grew. I sat through all her stories of her and Todd dating. Supporting her however I could. 

At the time i didn't know how to go about love. I thought that buying her things and doing spontaneous things to make her laugh would get her to like me. I'll be the first to admit, im ashamed of my behavior. I was the definition of a simp. Im not proud of how I handled the situation. 

Little did I know, she broke up with Todd. She cheated on him and I never knew she broke up until she had already moved on with another guy. He was an okay guy but I worried for her safety. You see her new boyfriend was a drug dealer. He was a grade under us. 
I should of picked up on the hints that she hadn't gotten over todd and cheated on her new boyfriend with Todd.

I began to scheme. You see I began to lose hope and thought maybe I can set up a mock date. I invited her and my friends to go see a movie. They brought theyre girlfriends so I knew she'd hang out with me. I thought this was my way of getting closure, to experience what could of been you know. Once again, not proud of how I handled this. You see, she invited Todd. Leaving me the odd one out. I sat alone as all the seats with my friends were filled. It was soul crushing but I didn't lose hope.

I was never very good at asking girls out. I'm 19 now, will be 20 in a month and I still don't know how. I made thr mistake of confessing at a time when she was missing todd the most. She even told me she regretted cheating on him yet I thought maybe this is my chance. Some kind of romance movie move. It failed...horribly. 
She was completely surprised too. Thought I liked a different girl in our class. She thought of me more as a brother.

I was pretty much depressed for the next couple months. I was in a no bullshit attitude for a while. My house is haunted and for the first time I stood up to its constant demands to leave the game room. I told it to fuck off. (Story for another time) It led to me pursuing singing. I sang in order to express my feelings. I actually got better which Is nice. I never quite got over that depression of losing her.

After she moved to college, we never really talked. I was busy working and she was busy with college so we haven't really talked.

I thought I was doing good, I was beginning to get over her. Move on. Every now and then I relapsed and got depressed again, but for the most part I moved on. But I made a mistake today. I looked at her facebook profile...shes engaged. I'm sitting in bed writing this. Its been 2 years since she turned me down but I still can't get over her. It feels like a piece of me is gone. I thought that I may still have a chance. Maybe we'll talk again and hit it off. As adults we can hang out and do things together again. But now its over, shes with another guy, and they're actually getting married. I never received an invite, at least not yet anyway. 

My friends say this may be for the best. She wanted premarital sex, I'm more of the abstinence until marriage type. She did drugs and drank alcohol. Ive never even thought of doing such destructive things.

I'm having money troubles. I'm now pretty much almost handicapped after a brutal knee injury. My mom is having more medical problems, and my dad won't get off my ass about chores. Its always chores with that man. Get it done exactly how he likes it or else. Now im the only one in my group chat without a girlfriend. I join a voice chat and its a bunch of people cooing about how much they love each other.

Its been rough lately and I could really use some advice. Before you ask no, suicide has not and will not ever be a option to me. Id rather endure it then let the people i care for be hurt."
600,I think taking laxatives messed me up ( no ED),"I’m 19 195lbs so no eating disorder but I think I may have messed up my insides by taking laxative when I knew I was eating over 1,000 calories... 

So I haven’t taken laxatives in over a week instead been exercising to work off extra calories... so today I ate two 330 calorie doughnuts so I did a large work out and walked 2 miles so that I didn’t need to take a laxative but I still ended up feeling like I took some 

Can someone train their body into doing than when eating high calorie foods? 

( No eating disorder my BMI is 33.4 so I’m more than good)"
601,Advice on how to open up,"I have been going through a really tough time lately. Nothing new, just anxiety and depression like I’ve dealt with for a really long time. 

The problem is I don’t know to get help. I have friends and family I talk to everyday, I just don’t know how to talk to them about this. It just makes me really uncomfortable to the point that I can’t bring myself to say anything at all. I don’t even know what I would want them to do about it and I don’t want to feel annoying or like a burden. 

Any advice would be appreciated."

604,Drained and trying to persevere,"I  fell behind on my assignments. However, I am all caught up in my assignments and studies for university from last week. This is one of the greatest accomplishments I had today. I feel like I am dragging my feet to finish this term because I'm not enjoying my studies anymore. It has become a waking nightmare.

My reason for staying is that I am finally obligated to finish this term. So, I am trying to make the best of it. I barely have any other activities besides sleeping the majority of the day and eating. I try to keep in mind that there are only 5 more weeks in the term. Then the next term starts, Next term is  my last term before graduating with my AA in December. After that I continue with my Bachelor studies and so forth. 

i'm trying to take it one day out at time.  However, my emotional stress is getting the best of me.  It is taking all of my energy. I feel so drained... I'm not sure how much I can handle without the stress becoming unhealthy."
605,I ruined the only good thing i ever had,"One day ago, i destroyed my relationship with the best woman i ever met, she helped me with my depression, my anxiety, my self hatred, and i broke her heart. I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world, at this moment, i'm sitting on the floor and crying until my eyes hurt, i have been here for at least 4 hours.
I don't know what to do anymore, i have no wish to do anything. I just want to stop this bullshit, i can't take who i am anymore. I'm so tired."
606,Living alone during the pandemic is ruining my mental health,"I am a second year college student living alone for my first time thousands of miles away from my hometown. I moved into my first apartment a month and a half ago and I hate living here. I have all online classes and rarely see my friends during the school week. Prior to moving in, my mental health was already really bad. Over the summer I had frequent suicidal thoughts and was always irritated, stressed and anxious. I thought moving to my college town would fix my mental health issues but I was so wrong. In the last two weeks I’ve experienced two panic attacks (which are new to me) and I’ve become increasingly afraid of living alone. I don’t mind it during the daylight but as soon as the sun sets, I’m paranoid and hate my living situation. My apartment complex is also super small and anti-social. I envy all of my friends’ living situations since they have roommates. It’s been really hard on me mentally and I want to move out. I feel extremely guilty and privileged that I want to move out but I don’t know if I can last until July 2021, especially since we don’t know how long the pandemic will last. I’m looking into moving into a room in a larger apartment that I found off of Facebook with three other girls. I would hope to sublet out my apartment. Would this be a good idea for my mental health? Or should I suck it up until I feel better or my lease ends?"

609,fuck life tbh,"Y'know that moment when you and a couple of friends are vibing in a voice chat making fun of each other saying shit like ""show us your tits"" as a joke but then the next day some girl gets mad even tho she was fine yesterday and then you get blamed for everything, and the other people that do it too don't, then say ""she has free will she can date who ever she wants its not my problem"" because she is 15 and dating an 18 year old and get your words twisted by some cunt who gets forgiven for everything to actually say ""I support pedophillia"" then watch everybody you ever fucking cared about turn on you instantly because some kid the same kid almost everybody hates turn your words and make your own FUCKING GIRLFRIEND hate you, and everybody you care about just fucking hates you and don't even give you a chance to explain and you realize they never fucking cared because they can just turn on you instantly and not let you explain, no just me?"
610,A suitable home to get stuff off my chest!,"So I originally wrote this as a reply in a watch subreddit. Yes. I am that guy. Reality kicked in (luckily) before I posted it. Thought ""there's got to be a better place"" which brings me here, so I'm just going to post the text I cut and go about my business, just feels good to talk about it having recovered sufficiently to have hindsight. And a (friendly) hug to anyone going through or who has gone through a psychotic episode. That stuff sweeps the fucking world from under your feet and shoves the rug up your arse. Weird really how comfortable and second nature it feels whilst in the grips of it, you manage to make everything make sense, in a way that doesn't make sense. I dogress, here-

""Soooooo..... I wrote a long 'true-story' about why the purple GLS5600 in the second photo, whilst not in my top 3, not my aesthetic at all and functionally pretty boring is the watch I'll take to the grave. Long story short it was purchased for me by my daughter whilst I was in the midway point of a long and severe psychotic episode that led to hospitalisation for months and all sorts of weirdness. Anyway. I thought this was a magical watch (don't trust me I also thought I was Jesus, buddha and the black panther at the same time) I had a lot of beliefs involving colours, eg: (UK) paramedics= green + good (for me), police and nurses = blue + bad (for me). I was choosing my colours within this vast conspiracy and had to hide my 'true colours'; natural colours. Behind you in the car? Orange car good, white car bad etc. Anyway kids were rainbow coloured and weren't good or bad (for me) as they hadn't really commited- socially, religiously, artistically, professionally etc and being given this watch, that was such a strong mix of colours I was not, it was a huge deal and helped calm me down alot. Whilst unwell for a long period after being given it, it was part of an upswing (possible bad terminology in the context) that brought me back to comparitively good health.  Selling it would be bad juju, figuratively and, no, not literally.... That was the short version and if you get through it, thanks! If not, I don't blame you, I probably wouldn't have either.""

That was it, I swiftly changed my mind. I've battled (still battling some) severe depression, PTSD, anti-social behaviour disorder, numerous different drug addictions. The list goes on. Nearly died this Feb (still in my thirties) due to liver failure, pneumonia and other bits all directly as a result of alcoholism, sober since I left hospital in April. Had my foot chopped off in a motorbike accident too. Ikr, lucky me. Anyway. Any kindred spirits I feel for you. I hope I never go back there regarding psychosis or drug use and (TL:DR) i hope you all do well with your own demons, whatever they may be."

613,First nervous breakdown in months,"I call it a nervous breakdown but it’s probs just a manic depressive episode. My mental health has been at a decline for weeks and I think it has snapped me. Don’t really know what happened it was my first day back at college and it didn’t go well I was a lot more stressed than I thought I was invited to a few drinks with my friends this week and I told her I’d be free tonight only and she said she would let me know what day they would do. Here’s me waiting for a message saying it wasn’t happening and then I get a Snapchat of her and my other friend partying having this amazing time. This has happened twice where I’ve been blatantly left out recently and it’s really starting to hurt me. I get really panicky cause i feel like they don’t like me as much as I like them back. They are my only friends I am alone everyday apart from my off days when I see them and being left out sucks! All my other friends left me or were just using me and then I’m left alone and im panicking that that they are gonna end up the same. I had a panic attack in the shower which was traumatic, I’ve been crying and pacing for hours I’ve never gotten this bad before I was considering S/H but thankfully I’ve calmed down a little. I’m in such a state not even from what happens today but just how it’s been in general. I’ve been in a fog for months and now the world is moving on going back to colkege more hours at work and My mind is still fucked."

615,dream during the day then an intense feeling of dizziness and nausea,"i’m gonna try to make this make as much sense as possible. 

i’m a hair student, and yesterday while colouring a clients hair, i got this really intense memory that flashed in my mind for a few seconds, only it wasn’t a memory because it’s something that never happened. but felt real. it may have been a dream i had once before. 

after it passed, i felt like i was going to pass out or throw up so i ran outside. i was trying to remember what was going on in my head, but i couldn’t. I went back inside feeling fine, and continued working on her hair. 3 minutes later, it happens again. i see this fake memory/dream and all of a sudden i feel sick again. i can’t remember the last few minutes of doing her hair, and i can’t remember what the memory was. 

i decided to get a ride home early with my other classmate as i was too scared to drive. after being at home, it happens a few more times, and once as i am falling asleep. that time, i’m gasping for air and having a really hard time breathing. 

my mom asked me what i was seeing, but since i don’t remember i tried my best to explain what happened. she was being supportive, but i can tell she doesn’t believe me. i don’t know what is going on, it hasn’t happened in about 12 hours now. but i’m scared it’s gonna happen again. 

has anyone else experienced this? or is this really all just in my head"
616,Am I too sensitive?,"Sometimes when someone might give me some criticism I may take it the wrong way or I say something weird and it would stick with me for the rest of the day. Sometimes all night I would just feel like shit. I may stop or barely eat. I would be bawling all night. But it's mostly only a a few hours. When I go to sleep and wake up in the morning I will feel better.

Recently that hasn't been the case. Yesterday I said something to my mom and I thought she thought it was stupid and j felt horrible. I don't know why. I have been trying not to eat and then when I gave up a few hours ago I started feeling horrible ever since.

My mom has no clue. I don't tell her because she says it's ”just hormones” or ”oh I felt like that when I was younger you will get over it” but it doesn't work like that. She once guilt-tripped me into doing something by saying ”it will make your dad feel bad” and then when I confronted her about it she just said ”guilt is just apart of life” and I have felt bad for him since then.

I wanna know if this is normal or not. I have heard of these two terms called ”HSP” or ”Generalized Anxiety Disorder” and I have some of the symptoms but I am too scared to get a therapist. I always feel like I'm just doing it for attention. It seems ridiculous."
617,not depressed but not happy either,"i don't think i'm particularly depressed. i find joy in doing things sometimes and appreciate my relationships, but i don't feel particularly connected in life. i don't really feel like i have a purpose and think about death a lot. i just don't think i'd be that upset if it was to suddenly all end, but i don't think i'm supposed to feel this way either. struggling with apathy, don't know what to do if i want to do anything at all."
618,How do I be less toxic?,
619,Really low point. Not doing so well.,"So I'm at the stage of my mental health issues where I feel alone constantly and am irritable about everything. I am seeing myself looking terrible in the mirror, I see a hideous, fat, hairy, balding, body acne covered monster. I am having at least 4 suicidal thoughts a day, I have no plans of fulfilling them, so I am safe there. It still sucks to have them. I feel myself pulling away from my friends. I mean not like they are around much anyways. My work schedule is very different and no one wants to compromise so I just spend 90% of my time alone. I get blocked on dating apps as soon as I send a face picture or body picture, I get no matches on the more ""classy"" dating apps, besides bots and fake pics that are 5,000 miles away. Having to wake up and get out of bed is literally the worst thing ever, I am so angry I have to get up. I am so angry I have to go to work to survive. I am so angry I can't just stay in bed or in my house all day doing as I please. I am so angry I am in my house alone. I am so angry that I don't make 70 or more K a year. I am mad I have to pay bills. I am just angry, sad, frustrated, lonely, it's so many negative feelings all the time. I want to change my way of thinking and change my routines and live a healthier life that is more fulfilling and find my confidence and self worth. I want to so bad and it's just like as soon as I try my brain just shuts it all down. I hate to say this but it's just so hard. I know life isn't suppose to be easy. I just wish it was easier. Why can't I have a typical brain and typical hormones and typical balance. That's all I want. I want to see the world and the future like I did when I was 15 years old. It was so bright. So it's all just dark and unreachable. I know that's not true and I know it's my outlook and perspective and I know it is fixable. But why can't I fix it. It just gets partially fixed then breaks again after one go about. I see guys that have rejected having great relationships with guys that are hairy, bald, chubby even bigger than me. So it's not my weight or my hair. It's me. I'm the problem. It hurts. I know that I can fix Me but I don't know why I am not succeeding. I don't know why it can't just stick. I am alone so much I should love myself. I don't. I'm the worst. I am the friend that doesn't want do anything, that makes trips have to be shortened, that makes us have to get cheaper places to stay, I'm the friend that has all issues. I'm THAT person. I never wanted to be THAT person. No wonder my friends don't compromise, they rather not have to deal with me. I wouldn't want to deal with me either. Everything just feels so far away. The fact that I am writing this and it is so all over the place with no consistency, it just has my ADD all over it. That upsets me. I don't want to be that person. I want to be organized and consistent and type A. That's who I am on the inside but then I have all these other things fighting it so I am constantly having internal conflicts with my actions. I know what I want and what I need but I am doing the complete opposite constantly. Living totally on impulse and pleasure indulging. I hate it. I just want total self control over my thoughts, actions and words. Yet the more I try to more out of control it all becomes.  I'm over typing so I'm done, rant over. Feels a little better to have this all out."
620,I want this darkness gone,"My university offers free counseling sessions via virtual visits now.

First session tomorrow. Hopeful."
621,I love the way tears taste in my ramen,":,)"
622,My friend is being ignored,"So of the night I’m making this post, a girl who goes to my church had what I can only describe as an anxiety attack, and my dad, who is the pastor, seems to be disregarding that her issues may be serious. 

So, for some background, I’m 14, and my friend is 16, and we both go to a small church (10-15 people) every Sunday, and tonight a group of about seven younger kids came to our youth group, when we only normally have about 5-7 kids all around are ages. So tonight after the study wrapped up and we went outside, the kids started being loud and very annoying, which made my friend start breathing really heavy, and kids wouldn’t stop bothering her.

For some background, this girl doesn’t have a good home life; her mother is verbally abusive and she has terrible anxiety because of it.

So later after that she nearly passed out and I had to help her back to the building. Meanwhile kids were running everywhere and my dad and step-mom were standing and talking instead of controlling the children, which made me kind of angry beyond kids pushing and shoving me. When we dropped her back off at her house I had told her that she doesn’t have to come if she doesn’t want to, but she said she would continue just to get away from home. After that my dad said that she should be old enough just to let it slide off of her, and that she is just being dramatic and seeking attention, which I agree with to an extent, but when she’s shaking and clearly having a breakdown I’m not quite sure if she’s seeking attention.

It just makes me feel terrible, and subsequently gives me anxiety, when she has to walk back into a house where she gets verbally abused, and nothing gets done about it. I really feel helpless for the situation because my stepmom tries to talk to her about it every Sunday, but just says she needs to ignore it, and it just isn’t that simple. To clarify my dad and stepmom are very nice and caring people, but they just don’t seem to have a good grasp of what she’s going through.

Honestly I just need some advice. I feel like I should talk to someone like my dad and tell him that I’m concerned that she might harm herself as she has said that she’s at that point (though I never ever see marks or bruises on her skin, to clarify). My brother and her brother are very good friends, and he knows very well what his sister goes through (though he is much older than she is) and I’m not sure if I should express my concern to them. The only person I feel comfortable relaying the information to is my mom, who I see quite often, so I think that may be where I go first, to at least make the problem clear. I’m also going to try to talk to my dad about keeping Wednesday nights under control from now on.

Overall it just makes me feel terrible, and, being religious, I think it helps to pray as well. Sorry for this post here being so long, I just feel like I need to get this off of my chest (for anyone who worries about my mental health, I promise you that I’m doing well). I think I just need my dad and stepmom to understand that when someone says concerning things, they should be taken into consideration, because neglecting these things just doesn’t end well, and I don’t want to stay quiet about it anymore."
623,I don’t wanna live.. but I also don’t wanna die.,"The pain I feel inside myself is not able to be conquered anymore. I work in the veterinary field and we lost 3 patients today, it’s hitting me super hard. My grandma got admitted to the hospital today and she lives 12 hours away. I’m no contact with my toxic family and I recently moved out on my own. I’m in debt trying to get an apartment. I don’t even know where my next meal is gonna come from. I don’t wanna live like this. I don’t want this pain anymore. I’m fucking terrified. I’m to the point I’m screaming at people who are trying to help me. I made my guy best friend bawl on the phone today because I went off on him for saying I matter. I feel so worthless and useless. I mean I have my whole life ahead of me and I know that. But at this point my life doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere. It’s scary. I’m scared. I feel alone."
624,Advice on a situation (me an aspie with my friend),"Hey,
So ive been super stressed out and between depressed/self-loathing episodes lately. This situation is me still being stressed out alittle and im unwinding. 
My boyfriend and i were having a loudish volume conversation venting about how we need to do chores but we cant really do them because the tools are being used by other housemates (like cleaning up after dinner-the sink is occupied by other dishes that werent ours, the need to do laundry but washer is being occupied by other housemates, etc)
I was venting alittle, saying along the lines ""im getting alittle impatient. We have needs and a bunch of laundry to take care of, and we need to wash communal things. I might just go to a laundromat or something"".   I dont think i verbally said something necessarily rude, but i was alittle frustrated and it probably came out in my tone and my volume.  I thought me and my boy were alone, but i was woefully mistaken. My bf told me the other housemate was home, and in the other room but possibly didnt hear. I think the housemate in question heard, but hes being cool about it and nice.. choosing not to confront me on it.

After i found that out, i immediately felt bad and wanted the ground to swallow me up. I am the type of person to try my hardest to keep negative people situations away, i dont lie to gossip or vent (but i cant help but vent sometimes :(   ),. I dont like having drama or negative vibes with everyone, but ive been sensing a small tension growing... 

I really dont know what to do, do i apologize for being loud and frustrated and kinda jerky? Or would i make it weird?

P.S. please dont be mean, i genuinely want to make the situation right but i dont know how.. please help"
625,I want to stop therapy,"I’ve made a recent post about this...I’ll make it again. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist since may and I have been prescribed Sertraline for a few months now. I’m taking 125mg per day. My psychiatrist has referred to an adult mental health clinic because I turned 18 not too long ago and she only treats minors. I’m seeing another Therapist at the clinic now. I’ve seen her twice. She’s not bad at all, but I simply don’t feel comfortable going to therapy anymore. It makes me feel so nervous and anxious. It puts me in a bad mood for the entire week. I want to stop going to therapy and just proceed with the medication, but I’m scared that there comes a time where I will regret letting go of this opportunity. I’m also afraid that quitting might anger my mom. I’ve been a weight on her. She’s been trying for a while to get me into therapy. All I can think about during my therapy sessions is “I want to leave” for the whole hour. This thought doesn’t stop. I can’t get it out of my head. I really just want to quit, but I need encouragement or reassurance that my decision is normal and okay. I need to be reassured that I’m not a horrible person for (If) quitting therapy."
626,My brain feels like it’s deteriorating,"I’m honestly just having a lot of mental strain due to...life i guess. I’m in school right now mistakenly taking extremely hard classes because I thought I could handle it. I still think I can but being isolated with online college is making me act unlike myself. I continuously have headaches, I feel strained, stupid, irritable, and alone. I just have a hard time keeping myself motivated. I ask myself, how am I to become a doctor if I’m struggling to get through this right now??? (I’m only in my second year of undergrad). Being in quarantine makes me waste a lot of time and it’s really stressing me out. I can’t really travel or do many fun things (obviously because of covid). At least when I was on campus I knew where to reach out for help with others who can relate.. but now I feel like I’m struggling all alone. I guess I might be asking for some words of encouragement? I really just feel like giving up."

633,Having Trouble letting my ex friend turned predator go...,"I know... you're probably thinking ""He's a predator?  Let him go!""   It's not so simple.  This story is kinda long and complicated.  

So this person and I were friends for 10 years and last month he turned completely psychotic.  I told him to stop insulting me in front of girls.   For background I was abused by my father and am a shy guy.   So after I told him he began to harass me the whole day twisting everything saying it was my fault for being cuddly or shy.   And so I blocked him after some real nasty shit talking, thinking it would end.    Nope.   He goes on to stalk me by calling me on private numbers and even driving to my house and threatening my family that if I don't come out things will get worse.   The cops were called and he is now forced to stay away from me. 

But here's where it gets complicated.  He never used to be like this.   He was actually a pretty fun guy to be with.   Energetic and outgoing and friendly.  We went to a lot of places together, played a lot of games together.   We had a ton of great memories.  And it just saddens me that he threw all that away over something that could've been easily fixed.  It could've been so simple. 

But then I realized a lot more was under that persona.  I learned he has a history of violence with knives, a history of reckless driving, and a history of making unwanted advances on women.  And ever since his father died, he's been taking his rage out on everyone that even talks to him.  And I even learned some of the girls he had over who took an interest in me were advanced on even more harshly, and possibly assaulted too.  I can't guarantee the assaults but from the circumstances that followed after their falling ours, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.

And now I'm not only grieving the loss of the friendship, but I'm also incredibly worried about anyone else he may try to victimize.  As a survivor of abuse myself I'm passionate about helping people out of potentially dangerous or even deadly situations.   But I know I can't do anything because since the cops have an eye on him, and judging from his actions, my own life could be in danger if I spoke up.   It kills me though because I don't want anyone to go through something horrible.   


This entire situation just has me depressed, anxious, and irritable."
634,How do I stop overthinking?,"My mother in law comes from a very orthodox, sexist background and every time I talk to her, I think about our conversations for weeks. It makes me restless and angry. I cannot cut her out of my life, How do I stop overthinking? Our conversations keep playing in my head all the time.

635,"My mother is going crazy, please help","She has always been (I don’t want to sound rude) crazy. She always thinks everyone is against her, very narcissistic, becoming very irrational, crazy thoughts like I never take her side but only my dads, she won’t listen to advice and thinks we’re putting her down or trying to insult her even the littlest piece of advice, anger issues, possible bipolar. 

With that being said, recently she’s been getting worse. She has 0 money in her savings as she’s a impulsive buyer and lives paycheck to paycheck. Now she wants to buy a new car. Right now we have a 2020 Toyota Corolla. She is freaky about it being in my dads name and not considered “her car” when my dad bought it for her. He’s only doing that to get better rates on the insurance but she thinks he’s doing it because he doesn’t trust her. And now she wants to move out, divorce my dad, and get an apartment with her friend

I tried to talk to her today about going to a counselor or a psychiatrist to talk out her issues as I can see a lot is bottled up. She got into her headspace of “your against me all the time” “your only doing this cause you don’t like me”, etc. She gave me a very abusive child hood mentally, physically and emotionally. She too was abused in her family in terrible ways. I don’t blame her but we’ve had our moments. She always brings it up and says “Yeah Zach you just wanna mentally torture me for the rest of my life cause I abused you”. I don’t bring it up at all but she still says it.

I love my mom so much but she’s loosing it lately really bad. I could say so much more but the list would drag. I’m setting up a psychiatrist appointment either way. I don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like these little moments are gonna turn into one big moment and turn into something bad. Any help? Thanks reddit"

So I went on a walk today. Basically I’m worried that my facial expression was weird and that people in the cars just thought I was strange or awkward. I just feel like I don’t know what to do with my face when cars pass by?? So I just try to look normal but then I’m worried that it’s obvious that I’m trying to look a certain way. Also I went on a walk at night, so I guess I’m also worried that people in the cars thought it was weird that I was walking around at night ?? I live in a suburb and I don’t see people doing it much so idk. Generally I feel like everyone (in cars) are just looking at me and judging me. 

I feel like it would really help me a lot if someone can offer an alternate perspective. And yeah I posted this in a different sub as well but I’m just looking for as much advice as possible."
640,Self harm,"Hello everyone, so this pandemic apparently messed me up , i tought i had left self harm behind , i hadn´t done it for 3 years , now this conduct is back , i can barely keep myself from doing it, i just did it , not to severe , little bit of blood,earlier, i had this chat with a friend with benefits you could say, i could not find words to tell her that i would be more comfortable if started just being friends again and i used poor wording , like i f i was breaking up with her ,she told me it was fine ,, but i can´t help to think she took it badly,  so i turned a knife on myself for it, it seems i always commit errors , there is always a flaw , and i sometimes feel like i´m not enough, im simply too idk weird? , i kinda feel i like i hate myself sometimes and i start feeling anxious and this toughts start flowing , things like"" she should leave her"", ""you dont deserve nothing good"" and so on , and maybe thats true , thanks for reading"
641,My gf won't accept my mental health anymore,"Hello. 

I wanted to write a huge post, but I am shaking and sweating, and can barely think... because she brings this topic up every now and then, and it TRIGGERS ME. Like it did just now.

Me and my gf are together since 2018. We are in a long distance relationship, and we met eachother on the internet. Before we met in real life and decided to be in a relationship, we had almost a whole year to JUST TALK. During this period of time, I mentioned that I have agoraphobia (with many others), panic disorder, ocd.. I also told her that I can NOT travel.

I was diagnosed when I was 7 years old. It's most likely genetics, because my grandama has panic disorder, my mom had panic disorder too with ocd.
But I also had streptococus, if that matters. Many doctors and psychiatrists seen me, I tried different meds too, no improvement. however, over time, some phobias got better, some worsened.

I told my gf everything about it back then. 

During the talking session, she once asked me if I believe in ldr or not. I told her that I do, if there is trust. However, thanks to my mental state, I could not travel, so my partner should come to my place everytime. 

After we met irl for the first time, she asked ""what are we?"". I told her I loved her and I would like to be with her. She said the same thingies. I, again, told her about the fact that I can not travel. She seemed to understand it. We got in a long distance relationship. 

It seemed like she is fine with it, but after a time, she started to bring up the topic about me visitimg her. This usually triggered my panic attacks, and the topic always lead to a fight. Under fight I mean that I am only defending myself.. I am not attacking, because I love her. However, the fight lasts 2 days most of the times.

Lately, these fights got more frequent.. she brings the topic up at random times. It's at a point, that everyday I am in a fear that she will bring it up causing me a panic attack. I am afraid to have a good mood because if she brings it up, I will feel worse. And hell, I do feel bad.
But I am too scared to tell her, because she would think that she is an asshole. But its killing me inside. 

Last time she told me I just use my mental illnesses as an excuse, and that I'm just lazy to take actions.. but how do I tell her, that I am not taking the stairs over the lift to the 10th floor because I am ""lazy"" and its ""comfy"" for me?
How should I explain that I am not avoiding the toilet in the Mall because I am lazy and its comfy for me, but because its in the end of a long and closed hallway, which I am not comfortable with?

I am so ashamed. I love her inside and out. She is like a woman clone of me (but without my mental illnesses). I dont want to lose her. 
I dont know what to do. 

----
I am sorry if I seem confused, but I was triggered by thid topic.. I also apologize for my venting, but I dont know who could understand me."
642,I feel really tired when not doing something?,"I noticed that I need a constant source of mental or physical stimulation (I dont have ADHD or ADD). Otherwise I start to feel really tired to the point where I feel physically fatigued and sluggish and I need to sleep.

643,I empathize way too much with my friend.,"Not sure if this is the right sub. 

My friend gets sad a lot, and every time he does I get so sad, maybe even more sad than he is. He never tells me what’s wrong because he doesn’t feel like talking about it. It really takes a toll on me emotionally and I want to find a way to empathize with him but without being too sad. I really don’t want to keep it up this way, but I still want to be good friends with him. He is my best friend. But sometimes my empathy is too much for me. What do I do??"

648,What is Positive Psychology and Why is it Important?,"# What is Positive Psychology?

It's intimidating going into a therapist's office knowing they will be judging you and taking notes on what makes you ""sick."" My therapist has helped me get through a lot, but getting comfortable with the idea of ""having a disorder"" stressed me out for a long time. 

That's why I'm sharing [this](https://groundingpositivity.com/2020/09/12/what-is-positive-psychology-and-why-is-it-important/) article about positive psychology. It makes the most important parts of positive psychology easy to understand. Before reading this article I kinda knew what it was, but not past ""the power of positive thinking and placebo effect."" 

This helped me to understand how positive psychology is actually this awesome new direction in psychology that is TOTALLY different from ""normal"" psychology.

The gist of it is that positive psychology doesn't want to ""cure you."" The goal is to understand these three questions 

1. Do we have control over our happiness?

2. What is happiness?

3. How can we optimize human success?

# PP Exercises

1. This is a technique for being a better listener called Active Constructive Listening (she calls it the Response Keychain)

When our partner comes to us with good news, it turns out that getting excited for her and responding with enthusiasm is only the SECOND best way to respond. The FIRST BEST way to respond is by bringing her back to that exciting moment.

For example, if your boyfriend tells you he wrecked a top-ranked player on Call of Duty, your goal should be make him feel as close to the initial feeling of triumph as possible. I might say: “What map was it on? What guns were you guys using? You should make a Twitch account and get a milli subscribers!”

2.  This is a technique for increasing Gratitude! 

It's a deceptively simple practice. The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology says that it leads to six months of increased happiness for both parties, on average.

*You just write a one-page thank you note to somebody who wouldn’t expect it and then read it out loud to them.*

This practice is reported to disconnect us from toxic, negative emotions. [The study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-09279-001) found that gratitude keychains also brings both parties an increase in measurable Spirituality.

649,People tried to break into my house and I am getting very paranoic.,"A couple weeks ago, people tried to break into my house, ended up killing my dog by poising her. Even though they didn't do anything apart from that, I still get nervous whenever I hear anything at night. When I go grab something to eat in the kitchen, or I go to the bathroom or do anything in general in the middle of the nightI just keep staring from a window for extensive periods of time like 6 guys are going to pop out of the darkness. I wish I could stop thinking like this."
650,"Questions, comments, concerns about myself.","Hello to all ze internet strangers reading this. It is I, u/sleepdprivedcryptid, a random cryptid who may or may not be real, here to vent and ask some questions. 

I'll start this off by I've never been diagnosed by anyone, just yanked out of class by a counsellor who poked and prodded at my psyche, told my parents, and made my life worse. 

Anywho, I'll start with the depressive mood. I won't refer to it as depression or anything cuz I might not even have it. It might just be me overreacting, and I've come to believe its just that. 

I started feeling depressed around 10 months ago. It's been a time. It started just as lack of motivation and not really caring about anything. Apathy, so to speak. There was no event to trigger this. For the longest time I just left it be. 

Then I got sad. Felt low and just wanted to stay in bed all the time. I was always tired, apathetic, didn't give a single damn about things I use to like. I quit my volleyball. I just... I can't really remember it. It all kinda blurs together. 

Then I felt okay for a bit. My mood improved, I felt happier, more energetic, productive and thought, oh, I'm okay now. And it was like that for a while. 

And then it happened again. Low. Sad. But this time it was worse. I got suicidal. I wanted to die, I wanted to cut, I hated everything. Again, I can't really remember it, so I don't know what to tell you. I can't remember. I just hated it. I wanted to die. 

I felt good then, for a bit. 

Then it got bad again. 

And way, way worse. 

I attempted suicide 3 times. I started cutting. 

It got okay again. And that time was even worse than the sad. I started doubting myself, doubting my reality. Did that even happen? Was I just faking it? 

And then I started feeling like I wasn't thin enough. 

Yup, ladies and gentlemen and my non binary pals and whatever you identify as (you could be an attack helicopter, for all I care), I started starving myself. 

And I still am. 

I still cut. 

I still wanna die. 

But anyways, started starving myself, not eating, lying about meals, the weight had to go down, it had to otherwise it wasn't enough. 

Oh, and I started fading out, for lack of a better term. One second I'm there, but then I'm not. Like I'm out of my body. Like I'm not there. Those aren't my hands. I'm not me. 

I'm in the fog. 

I started making crazy assumptions. The walls are trying to communicate with me. A monster is following me and won't leave me alone. That's not me in the mirror. I'm not real, this is not real. I'm a test subject. And I believed them. Fully, truly, no matter what proved otherwise. 

Started getting random homicidal thoughts. Burn the house down. Do it. Kill her. Do it. Wrap your hands around her neck. Stab her with a pin. Do it do it do it do it. 

Started feeling like my thoughts weren't mine. Like someone else was controlling my brain. Sometimes, I felt like I was hearing things. Voices. Whispers. Once or twice I swear I heard it. 

But right now, I'm okay. I feel fine. Not bad, not happy. Fine. I'll have my good moments. 

And maybe I was just faking it this whole time. 

Maybe I just want attention. 

Maybe I'm lying to myself about being sad.

And no, I can't see a therapist. I can't talk to anyone. My parents don't believe in mental health and the time they found out I was suicidal they laughed it off. They thought the counsellor was crazy. And I had to laugh with them. They were never emotionally there for me anyways. To describe my relationship with my parents would be, they love me but they don't like me. They hate me sometimes and I'm always burdening them but they say they love me and it makes my head spin because two seconds earlier you were screaming about how you wish I was never born. 

Anyways, that's all. 

Thank you for coming this far, if you're still reading. I'm signing off now.

651,Thoughts of enlightenment,"Ok I feel we have to accept all walks of life in the beliefs of eastern and western world.  This goes medicine, government, philosophy and the like.  

A total blanket statement if you will.  Total subjectivness.  If we don’t we are shutting out of our own growth as human beings.  I am not saying fully envelope both sides.  

I am saying meet in the middle and grow from both support systems and also always growing and asking questions amongst each other. 

Not challenging mind you. Keeping in mind each other’s feelings, not emotions.  Remember there is a difference here. 

You cannot die from emotional experiences.  However you can die from feelings. Let me explain...

When you are are angry or upset that’s an emotion.  You can feel in the pit of your stomach.  So where do most children put their arm? Around their stomach/waist.

Now if you are freezing to death, where are your arms?  Up around your shoulders, covering your arms and what else...?  Your ❤️.  You can die from that.  That’s a feeling not an emotion.

Now think about that the next time some one asks you a simple question? Or how you ask a question a specific way to someone.  Hear me out again....

You are at home and your partner walks in and asks how your day was.  Thats asking how you are feeling. 

What if they walk in the room and ask what are you doing home so early?  Sounds pretty confrontational doesn’t it?  See my point?

We need to stop this type of thinking in society and putting labels on everything.  We have been doing it since the dawn of time and making excuses for our own behavior and close mindedness.  If not now, when?  

How is this no different than when a police officer pulls a black man over in a neighborhood he is lost in. This is the definition of white privileged too.  Again if not now when.

Religion.   They tell us how to live our live and give them money to get to the promise land.  I feel Jesus was saying this same message and the Romans crucified him for it because it challenged their whole system of government and thinking.

This is why we need to look at the teachings from the east and the west.  They are all loosely connected.  If you agree or disagree please comment and or share.   I feel this is something worth mentioning....

I feel  the meaning of life is to to fully heal the human mind and remove guilt/resentment.  So the ingredients we need is love and equality along with eastern and western medicine."
652,Help me help my dad please!,"Hey I am posting this for my dad since he is old enough he doesn't really understand how people struggle and doesn't like to talk about himself to anyone other than my mom.

He is only 47 and in the last month something happened with his health and hes rapidly spiraling with no diagnosis yet. He is getting 4 mris next week but right how hes extremely freaked out and worried. He can no longer walk more than a short distance on his own and couldn't even button his shirt this morning. The things the doctor is ruling out are all the longer life expectancy things and hes getting increasingly scared hes only going to have a few years in which he will be completely unable to care for himself. Hes a teacher and is working on being able to teach from home but he is losing the ability to enunciate words. Teaching is his life and I am scared that losing the ability to teach will completely ruin him. 

We are still kind of joking about it at home but the undertones have gotten dark. How can I help him be ok even if life expectancy is short. Hes a christian and I am not so I have zero fear of death or too much worry about his own but he is pretty scared both of death and of missing milestones for me(25) and my sisters(18,23). 

Would it be helpful to try to show him we can be ready for the worst (care, death, etc) or will that just hurt him more? 

I have no idea how to help him and my mom and its starting to wear on my own thin mental state. I have gotten pretty drunk tonight and last night and I am scared I am using it to cope since I don't normally drink. Also that's probably the reason I am actually writing this. Please someone just tell me how to react I don't know how!"

He was my best friend and it’s hard to grasp that he’s actually gone. I’ve been desperate to find signs he’s with me. He’s shown me some but it doesn’t feel like enough.

656,Newly pregnant and OCD fixation is making me miserable,"

TW: contamination OCD


I just found out I’m pregnant three days ago. Me and fiancé plan on keeping it and we love each other very much. But- it couldn’t be worse timing. Before I found out I was seeking out mental health treatment facilities because my OCD has been debilitating. Right now I have contamination OCD. I was already so scared about contamination because I live in a not that great early 1970s apartment that has old lead and maybe even asbestos. The place has same little dings in the drywall and a tiny crack in the popcorn ceiling and I can’t help but think I’ve already set myself up for lung cancer in the future. But now that I’m pregnant I’m completely obsessed that my poor baby is going to have a birth defect or developmental issue because of this apartment. I’m so sad because I feel as if I ruined his/her life already. I’m so sad because I should be so happy because I’ve always wanted a big family but it’s hard to be happy my OCD is telling me I’m a terrible mother already. I talk to a therapist though telemedicine and she has been trying to reassure me that I’m overreacting but it’s still hard. I will talk to a normal doctor Monday and ask them about these things but I’m sure even if they tell me everything is fine the OCD will just jump to something else."
657,My therapist told me to post on Reddit.,"So, I've got a big problem. It's a problem I've had since childhood and it's that I subconsciously and sometimes consciously hate my damn self. My mom said that even as a child I hated my self and was a big ""people-pleaser"". As the years have gone on and I've made nothing but mistakes out of my life, it's just not getting better. And I'm trying incredibly hard to rewire my own brain. I've been dealing with the mental health world since I was 13 and my mom found out about the self-harm. Now I am 27 with no degree, no husband, no kids, no accomplishments other than completing a few psychiatric holds. Every day I wonder if there will ever come a day when I don't feel this way. It's been so dark and so sad in my world for SO long and the idea of doing all of this ""mental health work"" for another 14 years is so daunting. I get angry and jealous of people who go their whole lives without ever having to deal with this. I don't know why I'm this way. Or why it has to interfere with even the most basic aspects of my life. All I know is at this point in time after all of the work I've put into trying to change my thinking, I NEED to know that one day it will all be worth it. Its like I literally want someone to look into their crystal ball at my future and tell me for a fact that it will all be okay. I know, it's ridiculous but it's what keeps me awake at night. It's in every prayer. All of my hope is gone and I need it back or I will not survive this."
658,My past is ruining my life. (Trigger warning. Abuse and sexual abuse),[removed]
659,Was last night a suicide attempt?,"I was having really bad urges to kill myself and was freaking out. I finally decided to take a bunch of sleeping meds. I remember thinking ""maybe I won't wake up"". I woke up today and felt like complete shit. I still want to hurt myself.

I know sleeping meds won't kill me but there was that thought, even though it was irrational. I have actual materials to kill myself, yet...whatever that was last night happened. As much as I hate to ask, was it technically a suicide attempt?"
660,"Never seen a professional, but I think I may need to.","For the past six years I’ve been struggling with very intense feelings of sadness. It’s an odd thing, for a few weeks to months I will feel completely hopeless and suicidal, but then I feel completely fine and happy for a few weeks to months. It feels like an endless cycle. The happy periods are incredibly happy to the point that I feel like I make very impulsive and irrational decisions without thinking about their effects on my life. I do not want to self diagnose, I have always just assumed that I suffered from depression, but recently there have been very extreme swings in my mental health. I’m scared that I may have bipolar disorder, but I’ve read that people with bpd cannot tell that they have it, so Im scared that I may seem like I’m trying to diagnose myself with an illness I don’t have, and I don’t want to seem like a dick. I’m scared to seek professional help because I have heard the worst things about medication and I’m so fucking scared that being put on meds will make me feel even worse than I already do. I’m just incredibly scared to seek help. I don’t know what to do at this point. It feels like I just have to suck it up and deal with it either way I go. It makes me feel helpless."

ive gotten so much mentally worse over the past few days im so stressed and derailed and feeling like dissociation is coming along i couldnt tell who i was or who i am i need help so badly

ive been avoiding taking antidepressants by pretending to and i dont know if im worse with or without them. all they did was make me gain 20 pounds and since off them i lost 20 pounds, i broke down yesterday for the first time in months. i cant tell anyone. i cant go anywhere. ive lied to my family that the antidepressants work, how will they react if they found out im 1. avoiding them and 2. they didnt work they would. i dont even know.

im so fucking lost im so fucking dead. my heart is bad from how frequently i have panicked. people ask me if im ok and i say im fine i cant vent to anyone anymore. i dont know where i can go.

i have online school now, i regret it partially because im extremely lonely. i only have a singular friend in high school and i worry theyre going to distance from me being gone. then i wont have any irl friends. i cannot vent to my partner. i do not want them worried and this is the first time theyre going to see me breaking down and i cant afford putting all my problems onto them. 

i just have no idea what to do, my face hurts from constantly having an angry expression out of the sheer amount of pain i am in right now. my mom asks whats wrong and i say nothing. im miserable. im in pain. i feel like im losing it mentally as the thoughts i experience arent normal or ok. words dont make sense. thinking isnt normal. was what i was doing good at all. my head hurts. my heart hurts. everything hurts so fucking badly.

im sorry if you read all this it was just a mash of words and i feel horribly alone just writing this ro myself."
663,I'm visiting my partner (long distance relationship) and his mental health is much worse than I thought.,"Let me (21 FtM) preface this by saying that I don't blame him (20 M) for not telling me, as his biggest problems have come from his parents not recognizing his negative emotions as being valid, so he has trouble talking about them, as well as the fact that anxiety is a hard thing to recognize that you have sometimes.

He used to tell me that he didn't have anxiety when we were both in school together and both of us dropped out. Me, for mental health decline and cognitive issues. Him, because he was losing interest, and his depression was worsening. 

Today I'm wearing the dunce cap a bit, but I'm not blaming myself. We went to Walmart and it's the happiest I've been in a long time because I myself am away from my abusive family for the first time since quarantine started and this was pretty much the first time we spent more than a few minutes out in public.

This is the point at which you should know I'm an ESTP. I was dancing around the store when nobody could see but him. I was pressing buttons on toys that lit up and made noise. I was talking to him (INFP/INTP I think?) about things loudly without a care in the world. He told me I was making him anxious (I have INSISTED that he do this because I knew it may be an issue. He was not being an ass.) I cooled down and pulled out my attitude of composure and I think it made him feel guilty. Again I do not see this as him suppressing me but I think he does, and I must have been really making him anxious for him to say something, because he doesn't like telling people they're making him uncomfortable. I really really understand this, because when my anxiety was not worse but manifesting itself differently when I was younger, I felt the same about people who acted exactly like I act now. 

When we got to the car he was agitated. He said it wasnt about me but I'm not sure. I asked him point blank what was wrong and he couldn't tell me. He didn't know what was upsetting him. When we got home he was worse and after I got out of the car(he had to park it in a very tight garage) I saw him headbanging in frustration. I did my best to calm him. I gave him a hug and asked if I was helping. I did my best but he still seems so agitated. I asked him to type out what he was feeling and what he noticed on his phone. He said it didn't help.

He feels like he cannot talk to anyone about his needs or desires. From the way he describes it, he is the person who holds his family together and he feels like he is expected to do so even though they have not really directly told him that. One of his parents told him that when he left for college having a smaller immediate family was nice, but that the wrong person was leaving and that he held things together. I'm sure it was meant to just be a compliment but he really seems to think about it a lot. He takes care of as many of the family's problems as he can and feels so trapped in that place as the family caregiver.

He feels so uncomfortable talking about what he wants because of the way his family has reacted to it. For example, he likes a certain set of collectables/toys and had immense trouble talking to me about his wanting them, when his birthday is a few weeks away, and he will not ask for ANYTHING. He is so terrified of his parents laughing or telling him it's stupid that he doesnt want them to know he's getting it. He seems to have an immense fear of being invalidated by his parents and I'm not sure how to help, especially because from what I've seen of them, they're wonderful supportive parents who want the best for their kids. Again, the way I see them could be skewed because of my own history of having awful parents. I don't have anything good to compare his to.

I have no idea what he wants ever because he's never had much and never wanted much so I ask about a lot of different things. I also have my own issues to recognize here as Ive always received gifts I didn't like and felt like I couldnt get rid of them. I wanna make sure he gets things he likes. We went through amazon and it stressed him out. He said it was because he would rather just people pick things out for him. I know this is a problem because people don't get him anything if he doesnt tell them what he wants. He asked for one thing for christmas last year and when the technology wasn't compatible with his laptop, it got returned and I don't think he really got anything else.

After typing about all the things he was feeling, he told me about the collectable he wanted. Well, he told me he wanted something but he feared the reaction so much that he couldnt tell me what it was. I made sure to tell him it was a big step he was taking in telling me and that if he felt comfortable we could pull it up online and look at it. By this point he was crying a little and shaking. He had trouble typing it in on the keyboard. After he pulled it up, he put my laptop behind him where I couldn't see it and asked me not to look at it until he left. We talked a bit more about how he needs to find a good therapist and I took him through some breathing exercises. 

I wanna be there for him every step of the way and do everything I possibly can for him because he's the love of my life and has done the exact same for me when things got bad.

He asked me to talk to his parents about his mental health as he felt it was extremely difficult to bring it up to them other than in passing. I gave his mom a lot of information and told her that I think he needs a lot of help asap. She seemed to listen to me and immediately bought some of my recommendation for an over the counter anxiety med.

He's supposed to be sleeping right now but is staying in the room above me and is walking around a lot for someone who is sleeping. I worry the stress and anxiety he expierices attempting to uphold the facade of a perfect son is breaking him. I can tell it's getting harder and harder for him to hide his emotions. 

I told him that we are gonna try to find him a therapist tomorrow. We are gonna look at some and their reviews and try to get him a good one off the bat, which I understand is taxing, but if I'm there to help, I've got much more energy to do important helpful thing for him than I do for myself. 

Any advice on anything else I can do? I'm worried for him. I'm only staying another week and then we likely wont see each other for a very long time, as he plans to move out of the country on his own. I worry a lot about him being on his own too. I had to badger him as much as I was willing to do to get him to brush his teeth and take a shower more than once a week. I'm scared he wont take care of himself and that things will get worse."

665,Untreated bipolar disorder. What would a doctor want to know about me? Will I need to be re-evaluated?,"My back story. My last year of senior high school I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I took an SSRI. Things did not get better. I got what seems to be a manic state. I was considering suicide and was hospitalized. I was diagnosed as bipolar and prescribed lithium and abilify. I got out of the hospital and refused to ever seek help for my mental health again. I was afraid of being hospitalized again. I have now gone almost a decade without seeking help. 

Will I need to be rediagnosed? What would a doctor want to do? 

Also, my current doctor does not have my info on my mental health prior. My former records appear to have been lost."
666,I really don't know if I should see a psychiatrist or if I don't actually need to,"I'm 23F. For kind of a while I've thought I may have some kind of mental health issue or disorder or something, but I've never been sure enough to try and seek out help for anything. The big reasons I think there's something wrong is I have a lot of symptoms that align with OCD and concentration problems. I do have a family history of mental illness/disorders, my mom had bipolar and I believe her mother had schizophrenia. 

For OCD, I have some I guess compulsions like checking that a door is locked multiple times every night and morning even if I never opened it because I'm afraid of my cats getting out or saying something specific every night before I go to sleep as a way to stop something bad happening. Some intrusive thoughts too that bother me sometimes.  

For concentration problems, I just have a lot of trouble concentrating at work and in class or even when watching tv and movies. Like at work if I'm doing something on the computer I usually do like 30 minutes of work and then get on my phone for a while, then repeat that all day. If I'm doing something hands-on or doing multiple things at once or talking to someone while working I usually don't have problems. I also lately have had a very hard time starting things, even fun things like reading a book I'm excited about or a new hobby project. Most days I just sleep in and then sit on my phone and consider it a win if I manage to just watch a tv show or play a bit of a video game. I feel like I don't have ADHD or anything like that because I don't think I had problems like this when I was younger, but I also have a terrible memory and don't really remember what I felt like during high school, let alone earlier than that. I feel like it could be a depression thing, though I don't really feel depressed, but I have some other things that may be because of depression, like over sleeping and a very low tolerance for frustration. 

The reason I've never gone to a doctor is that I just never feel like any of this is truly debilitating. I feel like it's gotten worse during the quarantine, because I have had so many problems actually doing anything, but most of the time I just feel fine I guess. Sometimes I think maybe I feel like it isn't that bad because it's my normal and I don't actually know what real normal is. But I am still worried that I'll go to a doctor and they'll say I don't actually have anything wrong or something. When I see other people talk about their experiences with OCD or depression I don't feel the same way, like it's not at the same level for me. So I wanted to see what other people think. With all of this, does it seem like enough to warrant going to see a psychiatrist?"
667,I need advice.,"I’m “seeing”, or having a Skype thing-y with my psychologist tomorrow. I can’t open up at all. I want to go on antidepressants for both anxiety issues (mainly OCD symptoms, but also general anxiety). I haven’t been happy for years, I’ve lost all my motivation to do anything at all. I haven’t been in school for weeks. I can’t deal with it anymore. I know it’ll all get worse during the winter, had suicidal thoughts last year. They got really bad, I even wrote a note.

I'm not looking for outside validation. (Or maybe I am, fuckit, who knows, who cares.)

I definitely am looking for acknowledgment. Maybe connection, if I'm so lucky.

I scroll through a ton of subreddits dedicated to mental health, both generic and various disorders. I try my best to validate everyone and let them know they're not alone, they matter, someone cares, someone (me) is here if they need...

A lot of my comments are ignored. I put a lot of thought and heart into my comments, and I notice that a lot of people posting for input don't actually respond to the people who respond to their post...

I understand that, though. It's not necessarily cool for them to do that but still, I get it. They're in the middle of traversing their own mountain.  And I feel for all the other people that put their hearts into comments and get ignored - I'm sorry, you all! That sucks, I'm sorry.

But here's where I'm messed up... I've put myself out there with a few posts that are basically ignored. I'd like to say it doesn't hurt but, it does... Why do the people who need help but don't respond get all the attention, but people like me who are actually here for the input are ignored?  I don't care if you wanna tell me I'm wrong, I'm open to the input... The only thing I don't want is silence.

I feel like my shit sense of self worth is proving itself right. Or else I'm just manifesting what's in me already.... Either way, I'd like for someone to call me out on it at minimum.

I already know what some of you are thinking. I'm already bracing for your comments.

But... Where are the kind people? Can I just get some kindness, please? 

I'm so sad from life. I just want some kindness. I just want some acknowledgment. I truly just want some gd kindness."

The phenomena is Vivid hallucination while awake usually dealing with preserved perspective and time diolation that lasts a few minutes we all described it as happening alot when we were younger ( I still experience it on occasion ) while not being a normal occurrence its not suprising if it happens.

I can’t do this for another year. I can’t. The thought of it makes me sick. I’m supposed to be living out the end of my teenage years- why did I wait to do the shit I wanted to before they were over?? What the fuck?? 

I’m 17, I’m supposed to go off to college next year, but I’m not doing that until I can really do it. I can’t. I’m lucky enough that I can take a gap year if I need to- but what if it gets worse? What if we fuck up again and have to stay isolated for another year, or two, or three??

682,How do I explain to friends/people in my life?,"I believe I have depression most likely anxiety, maybe I’m bipolar, I’m not sure. I know that sense I was young I’ve had suicidal thoughts and being in social settings can make me break out in give sometimes or feel overwhelmingly sad. I’ve worked on myself for years and am continuing to do so but still hav eh a lot more to work on.

Recently I was with a small group doing a game night type thing and I was doing well (most people think I’m a comfortable extrovert because I hide how I feel sometimes by over talking) but I felt a wave of sadness hit, sometimes I can’t stop it so I went into the bathroom and began to cry, I waiting until I looked slightly more normal and then went to try to return to the game but I couldn’t bring myself out of it. I left shortly after with little to know explanation and they saw that I was clearly upset, I know I seemed irritated when I left but I was mostly trying not to cry. 

They’re waiting to hear from me about what happened and I want to explain the truth but it worries me because I don’t want to be seen as off or have them feel like I’m some broken, walk on egg shells when around me kind of person. What are some ways I can explain these things without sounding odd? I know I wouldn’t view someone else that way but that’s only because I know what it’s like."

685,How is it that my mental health is any less valid because I'm a guy?,"Growing up, I was always told ""Men don't cry"" by my mother. I couldn't shed a tear.

I'm age 15 atm, and I'm now a bitter shell of who I used to be. I'm depressed, anxious, stressed, self harming and even suicidal. Society already ignores mental illnesses, ignores teen health after that, and ignores male teen health after that. Society has become so vile and twisted that women's rights are now being used as a weapon to remove men's rights. How many times have you thought about the occasions that a man can get kicked in the nuts and no one cares because it's presumed he ""deserved it""? How many times have women walked away simply because of gendered stereotypings? I'm expected to be not experience mental illnesses because 1. It's probably not real 2. It's not real in teenagers and 3. It can't exist in men, or is less dangerous in men? Bullshit. Honestly, it's over, okay? I'll make my voice heard in a few days by killing myself.

He ended the class with saying he was disappointed in us and that we should ""have a heart"".  I'm used to this though,or the majority of my school career I had instances were my teachers would be disappointed in my class and I. I don't know, from what I know about myself, it's from a lack of speaking up I guess? I want to speak up about things but there's always something inside of me stopping from doing so.

If you are someone who fits this description or if you know someone who does and are willing to talk about your experience, I would love to interview you! It is preferable that the interviewee is currently not struggling to cope with those adversities (must have the ability to discuss their recovery and resilience).

689,help with sleep problems,"i've been struggling with sleep problems for years. i'm constantly either tired or just partially out of tune with reality, and my sleep schedule is practically nonexistent. 

when i was still in school, it didn't matter how much i'd slept the night before -- i still found myself falling asleep whether with my head on my desk or while sitting up (even in the classes i loved). i'd occasionally fall asleep on the bus home, as well. and regardless of whether i'd fallen asleep in class, i'd usually end up falling asleep when i got home.

if i somehow manage to fall asleep at a decent time, i'll still end up sleeping for 12 hours or more. recently i had a solid three days where i slept for around 18 hours. but on the other hand, there are times that i go to bed at a regular time and i'm absolutely exhausted but i cannot sleep for my life. i've laid there before for 2+ hours, rarely moving, and giving up after finally checking the time. 

along with all this, i have waves of really bad nightmares, and i recently had one that's damaged my ability to sleep at night even further, leaving me constantly afraid to be downstairs alone late at night.

i've tried taking melatonin, i've tried fixing my sleep schedule (because sometimes my regular nighttime sleep will align itself DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY), and i don't know what to do.

i'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, if that matters. i have derealisation/depersonalisation as well. i'm not on any medication. my mom is diagnosed with hashimoto's hypothyroidism. is there a specific disorder or something that could be causing this bullcrap? my mom's just as bad with her sleep schedule, but i'm getting really tired of being told i'm not trying hard enough to fix my sleep."

Started to go to therapy. And in this Semester it payed off. I feel better than ever. It’s so amazing. But in the process, I stopped attending my classes. I had realized, that I don’t like my college and it doesn’t make me happy. But at the same time I am so close to my degree... My mind says, that it’s the only rational thing to finish it and my heart says just the thought of attending another day makes me sick. I don’t know what will happen and I don’t know what to do. But I know that I shouldn’t have any regrets. I learned so much about me in these last months and had such a good time after going through hell for so long. Maybe I could’ve handled all of this better and now I have to deal with the consequences. And I have to tell my parents... Damn. Wish me luck, guys! After all, I could really need it."

694,Escapism: Advice on how to start turning to healthy outlets?,"Hey all, I’ve been struggling a lot for years now with resorting to escapism as my defense mechanism. I tend to drink, over-spend, or just be self-destructive in order to avoid real life. It’s so much worse now because I’m being exposed to Covid daily at work, so I’m restricted to work and home on a sort of quarantine for an indefinite amount of time. When I drink, it feels pointless to only have a few. I end up suicidal every time I get drunk. I’ve been working (picking up way too many extra hours) to disallow myself the opportunity to become lonely or drink. I don’t know how to relax in my down time anymore. I just constantly want out of reality in some way or another.

Does anyone have tips on how to find fulfillment or peace without resorting to destructive behavior? I’m hoping to be able to afford some painting materials soon, and I find that relaxes me. I don’t have any other hobbies and am generally broke so I can’t invest in anything new. Any advice is greatly appreciated 💓! Thank you all in advance."
695,Everyone makes me feel depressed,"I don’t have many friends outside of the sport I play and I’m starting to realize why. I’m not an unlikeable person, I just don’t make social interaction with people too often on my own and when my parents yell at me for being in my room all day and not doing anything, it makes it worse. That’s why so many of the friendships I make are toxic. Lately, I’ve actually kind of been trying to get closer to friends that I’ve made outside of the people I have to deal with every day, but I’m seriously going to turn the dial up on that now knowing exactly what I’m doing wrong.

Also my parents. My dad is unfortunately a very overt narcissist and every time I try to stand up to him for how he treats me, I get laughed at by him, beat up, or yelled at. He’s pretty much treated me terrible my entire life and I’m sure that he does not care at all. He only occasionally pretends to care so he can stay in a relationship with my mother who has already tried to divorce him. I genuinely think that my father only sees me as something to help him and give him power and since I refuse to do so, I get the worst treatment out of my other 2 siblings. My mom just enables it and when I try to tell her I don’t like my dad, or that I hate when my mom purposely annoys me, she always plays victim.

I know the best thing I can do is control myself as I can’t control my environment, and I think it’s important that I say I try and I hope that whoever will read this trust me on that. However sometimes I feel incredibly hopeless and it feels like I can’t do anything because I’ll mess up. This is honestly the tip of the iceberg of problems I have going on in my head but definitely some of them main ones. I have a meeting with my therapist tomorrow and I want to open up to him about this stuff, but I freeze up a lot of the time when we talk for some reason. Fortunately I journal a lot of my thoughts and have a good idea of what I’m going to talk about and I’ll probably make a list. Anyways please help, bye."
696,How Do I deal with FOMA due to the covid 19," 

Hello, I am a freshman in college and I am getting to the point where online school is starting to bother me a lot. I always viewed that I would be able to learn more about myself and have new experiences around this time because I will be in college living away from my parents for the first time. Well all my classes ended up being online this year so it was a waste of 8000$ to spend on a dorm so i decided I should stay home.

This is starting to affect me mentally now because every once in a while I would be thinking about all the things I could be doing when I am in college and how free I would be. But now I feel like these experiences were robbed from me as if I lost the choice I had. I feel trapped in my house. I can not get my licence because covid closed the dmv licence test and my parents were stubborn AF these last 2 years.(they legit would not let me take the test in the dmv because they did not want to pay for insurance)

. Thinking about what I am missing out is tearing me apart in the inside time to time. I feel like I will never get the college experience I always thought I would and I will be stuck with my parents forever(I know this isn't true or I hope its not true but thats how I feel) .

Also when I do homework i don't enjoy doing I sometimes feel like I am getting tortured because unlike school I don't really have people I can go and talk to after I finish work to lighten my mood, I have to wait a till the evening until my friends come outside to feel a bit refreshed but until then I feel stuck at home with homework I hate doing.

I can't just ignore these feeling because that is just a temporary solution. What is a permanent way I can deal with the way I am feeling. I cant find the answer to this question my self because for the first time I have no control over my own problems."
697,Is it normal to be this distraught about an online friend?,"so i’ve had this friend for over 2 years i believe now. Despite having real life close friends, i feel like he and my other online friends are the only ones i can trust with my whole heart. He recently told me since school was starting he’d rarely be on. His computer is messed up too, so he’ll have to get a new one. Only way he can get a new one is with good grades, and he told me the expectation is too high for him and he usually fails. I’ve been struggling with this for hours now, it’s the only thing on my mind. I don’t want to be that selfish clingy friend, i really don’t. I told him i’m fine with whatever he chooses to do. But i don’t want to let him go. I feel like they’re the only ones keeping me stable. Is this normal?"
698,Did I fuck up?,"I had a friend that I love dearly. We’ve had a rocky friendship because she cut me off on multiple occasions for small things. She struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harm, and on top of that an emotionally abusive boyfriend. Around about the 4th time she cut me off, the person I was dating was diagnosed with bpd, which made me research it. I told her I couldn’t get mad at her because I felt like she might have BPD. She was diagnosed with depression so I feel like it could’ve been a misdiagnosis. We got into another fight where she cut me off because I told her to block her emotionally abusive ex. She went on a whole tirade on social media because when we were arguing I told her to go get screened for bpd/bipolar disorder. She claims I “used her mental health against her” but I was genuinely just saying that her cutting me off again is a sign. I could’ve said it better but idk did I fuck up?"

700,Feeling crushed by the world,"Until maybe about five years ago, I was generally optimistic. The world had its problems, deep-rooted and concerning, but on the whole, it seemed to be getting better.

I no longer feel that way. That’s probably as much me learning about the world as it is any particular step up in problems.

The people in power seem to not give a hoot for impending social, economic and in particular environmental crises. There are so many missed chances and opportunities for us not to be where we are. We seem to be lurching from one disaster to the next and it feels like there is a shelf life for the existence we now have.

I’m scared, and it never goes away. Coping strategies for this sense of general rather than personal despair (and I should emphasise, I do not feel suicidal) would be appreciated."
701,how should a family react to s*icdal thoughts?,"My parents and siblings have never been supportive even once in my life. They’ve always made it worse. I’ve been s*icdal since I was 14, I’m now 20 and at like my lowest point. I’ve attempted like 3 or 4 times in my life. I know that this is kinda my problem now that I’m an adult. But my family just calls me “crazy” they don’t help at all and it makes it worse. Like I was little attempting to commit and all they did was make me take a pregnancy test. The only thing supportive I’ve ever heard from my family relating to my mental health is that “I should go to church or that they will pray for me.” Which I don’t believe in that stuff like at all. Idk how my family is supposed to react to this kinda stuff but the fact that they never took me to get help as a teen and still don’t care now it makes me worse then I already do lol is this shitty of them or am I over reacting as they say"

She’s been seeming distant and she’s mentioned growing apart and going our separate ways. It wouldn’t be so bad except I don’t have other friends and she was there for me at my absolute worst. I don’t want to show my emotions and make her to feel guilty for leaving but she is a huge part of my life and it’s going to hurt like hell seeing her go. I don’t know what to do now.
705,"I'm afraid to say this because how ppl will react, but all the talk about white privilege and white guilt makes me want to end it all.","Im afraid to say this, because some ppl I know irl look at my reddit, but it needs to be said. (For those ppl please don't worry) I don't want ppl to think I'm racist for saying this, but I just don't know what to do. I am a white male and I feel like I will never be able to do enough to make people forgive me for what my race has done. I feel like the only way to make ppl happy is to kill myself because then their will be one less oppresser, however I read an article that said that suicide is also an example of white privilege. This keeps me alive. 
I just want to live in peace with others. I want to make friends with all ppl and stand up for all people and when social justice warriors blame everything on white ppl I just want to die.  I am tired of being judged because of my skin color, because I believe everyone is so much than their skin color. Sorry for rambling... no one will probably respond because no one probably cares. I feel hopeless."
706,Trying to understand hyperfixating,"So I just stumbled on the term “hyperfixating” &amp; Ive been trying to understand if maybe this is the word Ive been looking for? Ive been dealing with very intense obsessive thoughts on things such as movies as a whole or characters from them since I was a young kid. I mean, absolutely overboard on constantly thinking about a movie &amp; the time period &amp; I come up with a million questions that I take to Google for. Its usually absolutely useless knowledge, but I will constantly think about it for months. I usually lose sleep because my thoughts keep me up all night thinking about it. 

I’m curious if maybe Ive been saying obsessive, when in reality the word Ive been looking for is hyperfixating? If you hyperfixate, Im curious on what your experience &amp; take on it is. 

Ive been trying to convey to my dr &amp; family that I absolutely obsess over odd things for so long &amp; its all I can think about. All I hear is “it’s probably OCD” &amp; nothing gets done about it. “Oh just see a therapist &amp; they’ll teach you to stop naturally”—though therapists in my area are not taking new patients. Part of me thinks maybe the word “obsessive” just automatically makes my dr think OCD. Personally, I don’t think it is since its just a constant stream of obsessive thoughts. I don’t think anything negative like “oh if I don’t watch my movie tonight my grandmas going to pass away”. I also don’t have repetitive habits of checking the oven or anything. I just get into this mode where I need to know absolutely everything about a movie for no reason. I cant just enjoy a movie, I have to submerse myself into it for a long freaking time.  

I could very well be wrong on this term, &amp; my doctor could be absolutely right. I just don’t know that he’s fully understanding or taking it seriously. I’m just desperately trying to find the right words that I hope will soon lead to a correct diagnosis. The OCD one just isnt sitting right with me for many reasons. I’m really struggling with my obsessive thoughts &amp; I just want some sort of relief. I barely eat &amp; barely sleep because I get so caught up in my obsessions. I just want to make sure Im conveying my experience well enough to be able to get the proper diagnosis &amp; treatment in the end."
707,I got a cat today,"It's 4 am and I have work in the morning but I'm so very happy right now. I was in a really shitty place for a couple of years to the point of me not being able to take care of myself. I always thought I'd be stuck in that kinda of place forever. 

But I got a cat today. And it seems so simple but the work and effort it's taken to get her has been long and hard and sometimes it didn't seem worth it. But she's here cuddling on my bed, I have a living breathing cat I am now responsible for. And it doesn't feel like an enormous pressure to take care of her and get the things she needs. It was fun and exciting to  go to the store and get her supplies and then eventually get her. I'm looking forward to the years i'm going to have with her, and that's something that used to terrify me.

But I got a cat today. I'm lying in bed stroking her fur, and listening as her purrs mix with the cries of the cicadas outside and just soaking in the peacefulness of this hot, sticky summer night. I'm glad I stuck it out for as long as I did. 

I got a cat today."
708,"things aren't ""getting better.""","everyone always says ""things get better"" but all it's doing for me it getting worse.  


i know what people say, but words don't change anything snd i feel like i've just taken the big step down. i have anxiety and depression, which is common, but that doesn't make it good. i feel like i'm not ever going to get better. i know i should talk to a therpist, but im scared to tell my parents anything. i have good parents, bad mental health actually runs in our family. i'm not saying that's a good thing, i'm just trying to prove my parents would probably understand. but i still worry about things and overthink everything... and my depression is telling me i deserve this suffering and i shouldn't get help and i know that's not true but i can't help but think that way... but here's where the big step towards something even more awful than what i'm going through happens

i tried self harm.

i don't know how to explain it but i couldn't stop. i never bled or made a cut you could actually see, but still... i'm scared it'll get worse"
709,Fucking coronavirus! (29M Canada) long post warning.,"Fucking coronavirus! Before all this bullshit started my life was actually decent. I was working a good job, making good money, I had savings for the first time in my life (I’m 29), my credit was rebuilt after basically destroying it in my late teens and early twenties. I just got engaged and we were starting to plan a wedding.

For the first time in my life everything was going my way. All the hard work, struggle, and sacrifice finally paid off. Then here comes covid-Fucking-19 to shove a baseball bat wrapped in sandpaper straight up my ass without even much as spitting on it first. I got laid off from work in April and it was ok at first. We had thousands in savings for the wedding/rainy days, CERB was coming in like clockwork, and things were ok. 

Fast forward a couple of months later and apparently because the government fronted everyone $2000 right away they want that shit back. So for basically a month I only got half a payment and had to draw on my savings. Throw in a couple unexpected bills and the dog needing to go to the vet. Plus the government taking another $1000 to fully recover that $2000 advance in April and here we are. 

I’ve got $500 left to my name, CERB is over the first week of October, I don’t know when/if I’ll get my ei, and there’s no job prospects at all or any chance of returning to work by the end of the month. If I can’t find something by the end of this month I’m done. I’m going to have to move back to my home province on the other side of the country or be homeless in the one I’m living in. 

I know there are people out there in the same boat or in a much worse one. But I just really need to vent here. I’m so god damn stressed I can’t eat, I’m not sleeping, I’m legitimately at my wits end. I don’t want to move back home. Not like this, I wanted it to be on my own terms. Not forced to become I’m going to be homeless and broke if I don’t. Job prospects are even worse in my home province then they are where I’m to now. 

I just feel so hopeless and defeated everyday. I try to stay positive and strong for my fiancé. To be the rock she needs. But it’s just hard sometimes. I know I can talk to my fiancé but to be frank she isn’t a great person to talk to. She’ll either try and one up me or just say “I know it’s hard. But you got to hang In there”This is honestly the first time in my life if ever felt any kind of anxiety, depression, and even on the really dark days, suicidal. I always made the joke I’m worth more dead than alive. But because I’m not working and covered by my insurance Anymore I’m not worth a Fuckin cent lol. 

Fuck sakes I’d honestly give my left nut and first born for all this shit to be over and things go back to some form of the normal we had before. I really just want my life back and to stop feeling to god damn shitty all the time. But I guess until the vaccine is ready we’ll all be living through this drunken Whore show we call life."
710,I finally did it!,"I had my second appointment with a therapist today! I’m finally trying to take control of my anxiety! It’s going to be hard, and I’m already anxious about therapy...once again. We’re old friends. But yeah, I hate this anxiety and I want it to go away."
711,Regret shyness in high school,"I just find myself so pathetic. I grew up extremely shy in high school, didn’t really make good friends until my final 2 years. We’re now great friends. I feel like I’ve wasted my childhood/teen years because of this. I’m now 18, so I’ve left school and I’m now in the big bad world as people say. 

I just regret not being myself in school. I sat there all shy, people made fun of me for it. Kind of picked on me to try get a reaction. I think that made it even worse. Now that I’ve left school, I want to start being myself, more confident. But I’m worried that people will always think of me as the weird shy person from school. I know they probably will.

I’d kind of like to hear from people that were like this in school, and what it was like when they left. Did it get better? I suffer from anxiety and depression so I found it difficult in school."
712,Self harm as an only option (M17),"
I think that in the end for some reason my mind only goes towards assuming and believing that self harm is the one true way to get some relaxation from my feelings. 

I’m not saying that I am hurting myself. The truth is I used to cut my body almost every alternative day, and these cuts very deep they’ve left scars all over my back now and I always ensure that I try to cover my body at all times. And srsly speaking, it felt fucking great after I was done (I am not recommending anyone hurt themselves in any way shape or form no matter the reasons, just because I feel great doesn’t mean you should try it), it went to the point where I was addicted to it. Every time I felt upset or had some form of emotional low I immediately resorted to cutting. 

Regardless, I’m not hurting myself and it’s been a few months since I did so. However I’m getting these lows that you feel during a healing stage and my mind is moving towards self harm as more of a solution rather than gym, studies, games etc....And also there’s a limit to how much I can control myself before acting impulsively again by hurting myself. 

I just want someone’s advice. What did you do? What did you do to stop self harming and what did you do to ensure that you don’t get back into it again."
713,is it weird that i really hate my chest?,"i had an eating disorder, i still do in a way, i don't really act on my urges anymore but still feel dysmorphia from it. i'm a female, but i'm really uncomfortable with my chest. i think it's too big (even though they're on the smaller side?), i feel disgusting having them and i really just try to ignore that i have them if i can. 

is this a common thing with eating disorders or is this from something else?"
714,driving test anxiety,I am nervous to book my full lience because of my past test I did I failed my restricted 3 times and some of it was for silly reasons the driving test person failed me because a lady waved me through an intersection when she had the right of way so i went since she waved me through and he failed me now its time to book my full i am to scared to and I am worried I would fail it again what do i do do i book my full lience or do i leave it and stay on my restricted for life. I had another bad experience before my restricted lience to i had anxiety attacks and vomitting before my test my anxiety has improved so much and i feel a little bit more confident with life but am just scared to do my full.
715,Panic attack is driving me crazy,"I need help, I can't even breathe"
716,"One of the scariest mental Illnesses you may have never heard of before, and my experience with it","The mental illness is DP/DR otherwise known as depersonalization disorder, I thought I shared as I seriously think people should know more about it, just because its not nearly as known as thing's like OCD, schizophrenia etc.

Basically what it is is that its similar to psychosis, in that nothing feels real anymore, but without any voices in your head, or delusions. Its very scary though, it nearly feels like the ground below you doesn't exist and nor do you exist, and it feels like your dissapearing this has happened to me multiple times during one time, it was so bad that I was with my dad returning with my dad from therapy, that I got out of the car, and started attacking the car punching it with all my might, because the Depersonalization was so bad and was essentially freaking out because I was dissapearing.

Depersonalization is also really bad because in a way it can reform your identity when, you lose your sense of self. That when you do finally return back to normal, you arent the same anymore, and not nearly as motivated to do the things you used to like doing because your sense of self isn't entirely there.

It also leads to a decline in cognitive abilities during some days of dissciation it was so hard for me as to write a simple paragraph, as my sense of self and logic was so far off which can lead to alots of excessive procrastination as your essentially a zombie. 

Sometimes it can peaceful, as your worries are gone much of the time from you not having an identity, but more often than not its just plain destructive and scary.

For those that have ever done Psychedelics or had a bad trip, its essentially like that, and not knowing who you anymore, or where you are. But randomly throughout your day, the intensity of it varies but usually occurs when i think of something stressful."

718,Will it ever change?,"TW: mentions of suicide

I am currently sobbing at 2:30 AM, I have work in the morning and the reason I am crying is unknown. There is no reason that I am feeling so hopeless, and that just makes me feel more depressed. Can’t there be a reason? Can’t there ever be a reason for how sad I am? 

There isn’t a single point in my life that I can pinpoint where I was genuinely happy, I honestly think I was born this way. My plan was to kill myself by the time I turned 18, but then my best friend beat me to it. Now I feel like that isn’t an option and it sucks ass. The only thing repeating in my mind is “will it ever change?” because after 17 years, I am still miserable. I can’t take medication and I can’t take the easy way out, therapy doesn’t help.

724,"How to tell my doctor that I'm more than just ""sometimes depressed""","I have my next appointment with my psychiatrist soon. Everytime I talk to her I fail to explain how I really feel like and play it down in the terms of ""If I managed to get here, it's not that bad"". I'm not just depressed and hear some voices, I'm constantly tired and deassociate from my body and the world. If my body says no to a movement I can't overcome it. I experience the world as if I was watching it trough a tunnel from very far away and my perception of anything feels numb and blurried. I don't identify either with my body or with my thoughts. It's not even feeling like it is me who lives in this body. I can't follow simple instructions or learn anything as I'm kind of mentally blacking out every few minutes, seeing as how I'm stuck at driving school for over an year because hours of practice daily just vanish into a black void.

No matter how hard I try to explain it to my therapist and my psychiatrist, it's seems like they only understand it as over dramatic metaphor. No I'm fucking serious. Maybe I shouldn't reply with ""yes"" to ""You know it isn't real?"" to make my point clear? How does me knowing that voices in my head are not real suddenly makes the issue irrelevant though?

This is the last year my boss can put me into temporary employment. My work performance is pathetic because of my problems. When my contract ends in a few months I'm not gonna lie to them that it will suddenly become better after it hasn't improved in the last 5 years. If I loose this job I will be unemployed for a very long time, and as long my problems stay I won't be able to take on any similar position elsewhere without getting kicked out during trial."
725,Mommy and daddy and all other issues.,"
My parents were separated before I was born as they had already figured out they were no where near compatible. Naturally my mother began with custody of us. We lived on the east coast with her parents for a short period of time before moving to the Midwest. Once we got here we were generally watched by my grandmother. This was probably the best thing that ever happened to us as someone who was actually willing to make sure we were properly taken care of. I have memories waking up in the morning for school and going to get my mom and her just being gone. It happened a lot. When she didn’t leave she brought home creepy guys. I know what you’re thinking...no! No one molested us or anything like that. But these guys were assholes in general and boy was this uncomfortable. But it wouldn’t be long before my grandmothers advice would cause my mother to want to move back to the east coast. First move was easy. Now we had friends and someone to potentially take care of us. After my parents disputed child support my dad agreed to take custody of us. We were elated! We moved in with my father and a few months later he began dating someone from his job and asked us how we would feel if she lived with us with her kids.
Truthfully I remember being incredibly hesitant and saying no because I wasn’t comfortable. I was responded to with too bad. And it was. They all showed up and took over the house. That winter in the middle of the night my house burned down. I don’t know why this sits poorly with me. But I was the youngest of 4 children. And the last one to be woken up. The house was fully engulfed on my way out. We lived with my grandma after that pretty much indefinitely. I looked up to my father more than I could ever admit these days. He made constant promises he couldn’t stick to. It was incredibly depressing. And the worst part is id get my hopes up so high I would stare out the window all day long. Just to find out he wouldn’t come. Naturally I became a very angry kid and I told them both off. We never had a good relationship but I wanted my parents so badly it ruined me. Because they never wanted me.

Next chapter of my life my father had a good job on the road and I lived with grandma up until I was 15. This was the year my grandpa passed. Devastated my grandma moved to an assisted living facility. My sisters had all graduated and lived in my dads house. I resides in grandmas house. As an adult I think this probably the stupidest thing my father did. I was 15-18 living in a house by myself. My grandma had literally done everything for me so this was a huge shock. I don’t think a 15 year old should have to worry about making their own meals, shopping or laundry. But I was. And I was terrible at it. I was awful at making time. I was an irresponsible teenager left to figure it out. I could have dropped out of school and quit but I didn’t. I went to school with my dirty ass clothes every day actually. But soon graduation came and my step mother had been diagnosed with an injury. They had to come home and they immediately had the talk about my future and how it didn’t involve staying with them and they were done raising kids. 

I joined the military as it was the fastest thing to get me away from this place. This was a huge ass mistake. I enjoyed my experiences. And love my brothers and sister. But I got chosen as a firefighter in the Air Force. I made the best of it and did my time. And am dealing with repercussions of managing life at its most gruesome. Once my term was up my wife and our new baby to be headed home. Upon arriving my step mother had been severely hospitalized and unfortunately passed away very unexpectedly. Listening to her rasp to death is up there with the sounds that set me into a spiral. This death changed my father even further. He became irritable and incredibly aggressive. He often would stay up all hours of the night sending me page after page of hurtful messages how I’m a piece of crap. And I mean hurtful like things that if I’m saying to a loved one I’m never expecting to talk to him again. I’ve made a few attempts since but all go from civil to him degrading me very quickly. I don’t have time for that so these days I keep him blocked. 

After all this transpired my grandfather was diagnosed with sever dementia almost simultaneously with my moms cancer. She clearly needed help so I left my job and my house and almost all of my belongings to help her. My wife and I were treated like housekeepers. But she needed help so I shutup and just kept helping. I’m not going to go into a lot of detail but a fight broke out. My privacy was invaded by her husbands  camera that had recently been shifted to the bathroom right after my wife took a shower. As well as my lockbox being Pryed open. My guns were in that lockbox and my nephew of 9 was playing with my guns. I freaked out. My cancer ridden mother and I had a screaming match in the yard. She had got in my wives face which is insane considering she hardly opens her mouth especially in conflict. We drove back to Illinois on bad tires. And unfortunately I never spoke to my mom again. She took my sister and her family on a Disney cruise and failed to invite my daughter. This disgusts me as my 4 year old should not pay for my decisions.

My mother passed in December on Christmas  to which her whole new family sat around her. They all took turns telling me how messed up our fight was. It was terrible. Just over and over. Even her husband pulled me to the side and said look I’m still pretty pissed for that shit you pulled. This made my legs tremble and I just went completely numb emotionally. We listened to her until she stopped breathing which once again bothers me to no end. 
On top of this my moms funeral was in Maryland and I didn’t have the funds to get there. I asked my sister who was getting a ticket from our step dad. She said I would have to ask him myself. So Needless to say my pride got I the way. And I do regret it. My mom never really called regularly. We saw her once a year for a week and truthfully it was pretty miserable. Even in the military my family seemed to have forgotten I existed. So I figured her death wouldn’t really affect me. Obviously I’m wrong her death mixed with my unprocessed emotions and regrets is tearing me apart. On top of that I think my sister is having a mental break. Her and her husband are at the ends of their ropes wanting to separate. I feel irritability escalating and I’m terrified that the fucked up person I was before is being impacted and I’m going a little nuts. I’ve been snapping out on my kids and wife and don’t know why. I’m so tired of having to pick up these messes that I truly didn’t want to make and then asked to say sorry and take responsibility. But I’ve been trying to get them to take responsibility my whole life. I can’t imagine ever intentionally leaving my kid. This sounds like a giant pity party reading it but when I try to talk to my family it’s asked to be left in the past, or me apologize and I’m beginning to go crazy. 

I’m missing a lot here despite having included too much. I dont know where to start. But I haven’t processed shit since 2009. I don’t know what all had the capacity to effect me like this but I do know I want to fix it. I need to become a better father and that happens by getting this off my chest."
726,I still love her,"We were together for one year,  soon after our anniversary we broke up, it's been three months since we broke up and I still haven't made one step forward, she's hanging out with her friends and other guys, she's over me, I'm not, I think about her every single day, I cry for her every single day, I love her, I haven't been eating all that much, I feel weak and lonely, haven't had any friends to talk to so I'm venting here with you guys thank you for reading."
727,I'm not sure I can make it through school.,"I'm young, I know. Only starting my 2nd year of high school. Since middle school, I've been feeling extremely depressed... and recently, over the long break, I realized how school was suffocating me.

I was so happy over the break. Waking up when I pleased, completing art projects with ease, studying what I wanted, never being tired, free to operate my own schedule.

I was more social. My family told me multiple times how happy I seemed.

Then school began. I can barely wake up. The stress of having the assignments prevents me from doing them, which adds more stress, which prevents me from doing anything else.

I think the only thing I can do is drop out.

My mother refuses to talk about it. She says it's giving her too much stress — to the point of physical symptoms. She does have a long history of extreme stress and panic attacks.

God, I don't know what to do. I feel so empty, and it's been proven to me that it's due to school, whether it's the work or the teachers or the obligations or whatever it may be.

Don't tell me that it's just how the world is. I know, and I plan to either find a way around it — and if I can't, I'm out.

But now is not the time.

This isn't dire. I won't do anything to myself or others if I can't fix this right now. But I have to get out, somehow, as soon as possible."
728,I’m crying now. Why.,"(14f) I can’t really tell if I should talk to someone or if I’m just kinda overreacting. I can’t tell if I’m just being a fourteen year old girl that’s just getting hormonal— Tahts what my mom thought. 

whenever I’m alone. I cry. Or feel like crying. 

I’m not alone a lot, I share a room with my mom and brother in a cramped apartment. We just moved countries. I’m obviously not alone at school. Or or on the way there.

The only time I’m alone is when I’m showering and running. Both times I really just want to cry. 

I used to experience panic attacks and anxiety attacks at school because of stress. My dad used to have them when he was younger but now I can’t really talk to him about it, cause he isn’t here with me, and we grew apart a little. 

I havent had any attacks recently. I just feel really sad. The only time I feel happy is when I’m making jokes and people are laughing. 

I don’t really have a reason to point all my sadness at.

I don’t have any close friends. I love my brother but I can’t talk to my little brother abouta this shit. I have to be strong. I don’t like talking to my mom about it, she invalidates me by comparing her experiences. 

She grew up in a bit of a shitty family so I feel kinda invalid when I hear her stories.

I just feel like crying a lot. When I hear my dad’s voice, my friend’s voice. I’m not the type to cry easily. Never have been. Only cried once in front of my friends after knowing each other for over two years. 

I’m known as kinda quiet but funny. Artsy girl. I have confidence in my art and humor and smartness, just I feel incomplete. 

Do you guys know why people cry alone?"
729,I'm tired and feel like a failure,"I'm not really sure why I'm makign this post, I think I just need to vent.

I graduated last year with a degree in film that hasn't landed me any long-term work, and I've been struggling to get on my feet with it. I already know it was pointless to get a film degree, but when I realised this I was halfway through my degree and actually would've been better off finishing it.

I did have two short-term jobs in film that were fun, but I don't think I did a good job on them and I haven't been done any jobs since last October or November, since then I've been working full-time in a bar. I've been looking for other jobs to get out of bar work but with COVID there's very few secure jobs about. I've been searching for film jobs and apply when they come, but I either never hear back or get rejected (even from trainee positions or internships).

I'm slowly working on a screenplay when I have the time, and with that I'll hopefully make a film with it out of my own money to try and show off what I can do, but like I said it's a slow process.

Right now I'm sick and tired of being in this position of trying and looking and never getting anywhere. I always told myself if I couldn't get anything around a year after graduating I'd stop, but something's telling me to keep going but I don't know how. I just feel like a big failure and that I've wasted a lot of effort. Even when I visit my granny she'll refer to the film career as ""failed"" and despite knowing she doesn't realise it, it actually hurts a lot when she says it.

A lot of the time I just want to get in the car and disappear, get away from my situation and forget about how things are but that's obviously not possible. I know I'm probably just putting too much pressure on myself, but I'm fed up with not getting anywhere that I hoped I would have."

Theres no lonliness- I prefer being alone and feel tired when I'm around people for more than a few hours. Theres no sadness- I dont cry, I dont feel bad about myself or anything. Saying ""I'm going to kill myself"" just feels like stating a fact. I cant connect with the world around me, so I'm going to be leaving it when it inevitably becomes difficult to do the few things that keep me content."

733,What Parents Need To Know About Eating Disorders In The Time Of Covid-19," In July of 2020, [a new study](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/07/24/pandemicsurvey072420)  published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) confirmed what  many already knew: Covid-19 has contributed to a mental and behavioral  health crisis. With one in four parents reporting worsening mental  health, and one in seven reporting an increase in behavioral challenges  for their children, this is not an isolated problem."
734,"Why do I act and feel like a child, especially under stress?","I've read that this is associated with trouble during childhood, but I'm certain that my childhood was great! But now lately as I've spiraled back into depression and anxiety I've noticed myself acting like a lovesick child even when I'm just by myself and whenever I feel stress or any sort of negative emotion to cope. My parents validate me so I don't know where this child thing comes from. Any ideas where this comes from?"
735,Is it some kind of mental problems?,"Life's driving me crazy lately and I've noticed I'm becoming what I hated the most. I'm male, 18. A few years ealier I was the type of person that will quickly forget all the shits that happened at the end the day, I don't care what people say to me and just be free. Then puberty came, I started getting panic at all the yelling (even if it's not yelling at me, or maybe someone just peacefully talking to me with loud voice), I started making up stories to the stares people gave me. Though whatever happened, as long as I'm still myself, everything will be fine if I stay strong.

But I'm not strong, day by day suffering from all the fear, I started yelling, I don't repeat myself before going nuclear when someone didn't hear what I just said. The voices in my head keeps telling me to do stupid things I never thought of. But who knows if one day I'll do it because I can hear it louder overtime.

Some people said it's no big deal, but it's really dragging me down. I really hope this is only some kind of ""immature"" thoughts for my age, because I can see the more I try to improve the more I sink deeper into the quicksand.

P/s: Sorry for my bad english and bad formatting :("
736,Why do I sometimes forget that I exist?,"The title pretty much sums it up. 

I know it sounds weird, but about three or four times a week I will have this intense and kind of frightening realisation that I exist and I’m a real person, after which I have to spend a few minutes going over things and reacquainting myself with who I am. It’s essentially like I forget that I’m here, doing whatever it is that I’m that I’m doing at the time.

What causes this kind of thing? Should I be alarmed? Is this the right place to ask this kind of question?"
737,I feel like the entire government system that is meant to support me is a sham,"I’m sorry, I just need to vent.

About a year and a half ago I was transferred from the adolescents section of my mental health service into the young adult section. The adolescent section was brilliant, it turned my life around and helped me through so much, I was supported, understood, taken care of. 

Now you’d think that the same facility with the same upper management and the same people running the goddamned place would keep that standard all the way through right?

Well apparently not. The young adult ward treats 18-25 year olds. Yes we are adults, but we are mentally ill adults that need your help. The moment I was transferred I had to do everything in my own. All I was given was a Psycologist who is only concerned if my ADHD meds are working. And that’s it. 

I told him that I was doing bad. I told him that I needed extra support. I told him that I need that support soon. I’m not ok. I need help.

But no, all he does is give me two names of people he says have vacancies and sends me on my way. 

They do not have any space for me. No free space, no appointments. Nothing. He was wrong.

I am a person who’s day to day life is miserable. I have sever ADHD so remembering all the bullshit he expects me to is next to impossible. I’m extremely anxious so those goddamned phone calls I have to make only to get told “no, there are no free slots for 6 months” is awful.

This isn’t fair. I pay this man over €150 for 15 minutes of his time. The least he can do is give me the names of people who can actually treat me. I don’t need help in 6 months. I need help now.

It feels like it’s all just a ploy, a sham. I don’t want to live like this. I need their support, but it’s just not being given. I feel so failed. This isn’t right.

I’m sorry for ranting"
738,Question regarding legal pharmacy available medication for Eastern Europe,"I'm about to take my driving test (Eastern Europe) and unfortunately in my country it is mandatory for a police officer to stay next to me in the car as I do this. 

Having someone in uniform next to me for 30 minutes gives me the chills and I loose myself although I have never done anything wrong or against the law in my life.
It's just a phobia i can't control and although I know how to drive and all the traffic laws, rules when that guy is there I can't do anything right.

I already failed the exam once because of this and I want to pass this time around. 

QUESTION:
Is there anything that I can take before the exam that can help me just not freak out? Something that works. I feel all sorts of emotions. I feel hot I can't think straight my hands shake it's horrible.

Every year schools starts with armed intruder training and I have some past experiences with danger and death and finally this year I just can’t sit in a classroom all day and function normally, so I quit.  

I keep quitting cigarettes every night. Now I’ve made it 3 days.  I smoke Pot at night to help try and sleep.  I’m making small improvements.  I know I need a new career but most of my interests lie in directions that take me to corporate America and frankly have no interest in that.  

I’m in pain all day everyday from injuries and weight gain.  Whenever I try to lose weight or gain strength I’ll either hurt myself or find a reason to stop dieting over stressful situations.  

I want to be strong.  And giving up 80k job is strong, I think.  I won’t be able to buy my kids things, but they’ll have their home and neighbors they love.  And hopefully they’ll have an accessible father more often than I have been.  

This is the hardest moment: wanting, needing, and mentally preparing to make huge changes.  Sleeping is hard for me and generally wake up more exhausted.  Ty reddit for letting me dump this here."
744,I am completely overwhelmed and I don’t know how to process.,"This is kind of a long story so bear with me, I just need to write this out to vent and hopefully give me the help I need to just fall asleep for a while. Just a quick warning if you don’t like to hear about medical stuff or sick/dying pets/animals, maybe you should pass on reading this. 

A few months ago at the height of COVID in my state my father was in a really severe motorcycle accident and he completely shattered his femur in his leg and broke his clavicle as well. My dad has to have several surgeries from the accident but because of the pandemic I wasn’t allowed to visit or see him in the hospital for over 3 weeks. This was a really stressful time and my studies really took a nose dive. I am currently a college student and living at home to so all of my fathers care out of hospital fell squarely on my shoulders. It was incredibly difficult to take care of him because he is a 300+ lbs 6’+ tall man and I am a 5’4” small woman, and he wasn’t allowed to walk at all for over 4 months after the surgery. It was a lot of heavy lifting emotionally and physically. 

During those 4 months I had a little support from family members and friends but not much. My parents are divorced and my mom helped some during this time but my mom is a severe alcoholic so she didn’t help much. I also have a slightly younger brother who is already moved out of the house and refuses to speak to anyone in our family because he has his own mental health issues and he hates all of our guts. He completely abandoned me and refused to help at all with my dad... which really sucked to say the least. I was completely alone during this time in apart from a few close friends. 

My father was finally cleared to start walking again about a month ago and it looked like things were finally about to turn around. I started a new job, and I started graduate school as well, I was finally sort of happy again. But that’s when bad news struck 2 weeks ago and my dad broke his femur again just due to the bones being too weak and putting weight on them too soon. Additionally, the metal plate the surgeon put in his leg during the initial surgery 4 months ago completely broke in half. My dad needs surgery again and it’s going to be an even more intense surgery than the ones he’s had previously. 

On top of this one of my dogs (8ish years old) started to act really sick this past weekend and I had to take him into the vet. He was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and he didn’t have good odds. However the dog held stable for a few days and we brought him home last night. He seemed to be doing well but in the middle of the night last night he passed away from a heart attack or stroke or seizure or something and there was nothing we could do he went so quickly. I haven’t been able to sleep all night because I can’t stop thinking about my little baby boy and I haven’t slept much for the past few days either. 

My dad goes in to surgery tomorrow and I’m really scared that he is going to have complications and die. I know it’s unlikely but I can’t stop worrying about it. I haven’t struggled with suicidal thoughts in a long time but because of everything that’s happened these last two weeks it’s at the forefront of my mind. I know I won’t do anything while my dad is still around but I’m just exhausted, drained, overwhelmed, scared out of my mind, and I just want it all to go away. I just don’t know how to stop thinking the bad thoughts and worrying about my dad and feeling sad about my dog. It’s all too much feeling. I need it to stop. 

I don’t know. That’s it. It helped to type that out. Maybe I can fall asleep finally. 

TL;DR: Father with broken bones after accident needs more surgery, family pet died suddenly, and very little support from others."
745,I work in healthcare and don’t have an empathetic bone in my body,"I’ll try to make this as short and to the point as possible. Anyone that actually hears me out, thank you. 

My whole life I’ve been dead set on going into healthcare. The women in my family have always done some form of medical work and I was raised believing I won’t ever make money if I’m not in healthcare. I’m now almost 22, four thousand dollars in the hole to get an entry level license and working in an emergency room. I’m miserable. 

I hate taking care of people and listening to them whine. I don’t care how much pain they’re in or how sick, I feel burdened by taking care of them. I’ve know for awhile this isn’t a good fit for me and I should probably start looking at a different career but this morning something happened that really made me start to think maybe something is wrong with me. 

I’m an hour into my shift and we get a critical patient on my hall. As I go into the room to get a EKG I overhear the doctor and family talking about how they should do a DNR (do not resuscitate) as the guy most likely won’t live anyway. As they continue talking it finally comes out that this guy is actively dying and most likely won’t live out the week. Instead of feeling sorry for him and his family, I continue hooking up the EKG and all I can think about is how they’ll be a pain to deal with because of all the crying and they’ll most likely be super needy. 

I’m just kind of appalled at myself that someone is actively dying in front of me and I can’t even pretend to care. Though it still doesn’t change anything as far as even having any sympathy. Is there a possibility that there’s actually something wrong with me?

(Back ground on my mental health; I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have a bit of trauma as well and have PTSD. This just feels different/new)"
746,"I was attacked by a dog two weeks ago, and the aftermath is really affecting my mental health","I was invited to someone's house two weeks ago, they introduced me to their dog and all was good. 

About an hour later, the dog walked past in the garden, I petted it, and as I was turning away it snapped and bit my nose off.

I know it's only been two weeks, but I've had to undergo surgery (which I don't think has worked), and it's just seemed like the longest two weeks of my life.

I can't go to work because I work in a hospital, so face masks are required. I can't go for my morning run, because I can only indulge in light exercise. I can't just jump in the shower in the mornings because I need to separate hair and body washing. I can't even cry without caution when I'm feeling down because I can't wet the wound. 

Whenever I go out for a walk, people stare. People I know keep telling me I'm ""beautiful"", which is so kind, but reiterates the damage they see and reassurance they want to give.

I have such an amazing family/friends network through this, but I'm such a burdeon now. 

I haven't had what you'd call a ""carefree"" life. Various family members and friends have committed suicide, but it seems every time I'm coming out of grieving, something happens again. I try so hard to make the most of life, despite hardship. But I can't help feeling there's something out there that wants me to die. Something that continually makes life intollerable. 

I know things could be a lot worse, but I'm sure that ""a lot worse"" is coming my way at some point."

748,Anti-Depressants: they are good for mental health?," 

I know the tittle sounds like a New York Time article but well

Long ago, I was interested in anti-depressants and his effects on human livings, the most common thing to do was try it by myself, right?

My depression and how my life was started to make me cold and without emotions and I was tired of that, I never took anti-depressants before, I was a minor so I needed to ask my parents for it but they said I was exaggerating that I was young to have depression I was like YOU DUMBASS THING THERES NO AGE FOR DEPRESSION.

The time passed I go to several therapists but everything was always the same, same boring and depressing routine of every day, days and nights asking myself I will achieve true happiness someday?

Now, this is the future, I'm in the future, the crappy future, I'm still depressed, things go the same, it's been years since my depression started and I think it becomes part of me, it's stuck to me.

And here I am with the same thought of taking anti-depressants spinning on my head, Dammit

749,Anxiety took over my life,"I’m an 18 year old female and I’ve recently quit my job and stopped going to school because my anxiety has gotten so severe that I can’t leave my house anymore, or even function in general. I’ve lost most people in my life because I’ve become so distant, and I feel like my life has become pointless and meaningless. I’ve given up on seeing psychiatrists, and I’ve given up on medications as I’ve been on 14 different kinds over the years and nothing has helped. I don’t really know why I’m posting this but I’m pretty desperate at this point and I needed to vent to someone."

751,PSA- Make sure your doctor knows what form you take your medications in if they are refilling electronically,"Hey all, just wanted to share a little (big) mix up experience I had and try to save anyone else from having the same problem. I got my doctor to refill my antidepressant electronically (I called them and asked that they send it to the pharmacy). Because the form in which people take their meds is rarely on the physical prescription (mine wasn't, I have been taking this medication as capsules for about ten years now and I don't think it has ever been written as capsules on the script), there might be a mix up and you might get prescribed tablets instead because the online form requires it. 

Why I'm writing this- the med (a GENERIC, I might add) usually costs ~$10, now cost $400. That is not a typo. $400. 

And of course because it was technically the fault of my doctor, CVS wouldn't let me return it. 

So save yourself a panic attack (I hadn't had one since high school, this was my second ever) and just double check."
752,"""women are too sensitive""","I (female) started a new job a couple of months ago in my field of studies but in a position above what I was expecting, so the pressure is high. I also got accepted in an intensive bootcamp in IT/networking (100 out of 1800 candidates got selected). The stakes are high. Unrelated issue: Today I noticed the new glasses I bought that cost me almost 1 month salary (need special lens) were not fit well to my eyes and I broke down crying. The issue is gonna get fixed tomorrow but was a bit too much stress that I could bare and I couldnt stop crying. My fiance got mad at me because I cry for no reason and thats stupid. It pisses me off that he can be such a supportive person and such a d*ck depending on the issue. Been suffering with anxiety all my life (panic attacks from time to time since I was 11) and I still feel I dont have one single person in my life that understands me."
753,Rant - I hate medication.,"I am almost anti-psychiatry for myself at this point. Don't get my wrong, my psyc. doc. is a great caring person and wants the best for me, we just have different views. Things have been looking up for me compared to a month ago, but psyc. meds and all the shit I've been through trying to find the so far unattainable ""right combination"" has been hell and I have no will to continue playing ball. I am going to get off of everything I am taking eventually (and safely as possible). I loathe the daily dance around symptoms, unexpected crushing depression and being dependent on a pill to sleep. I never felt this bad before getting on meds. That's saying a lot because I have been through hard drug withdrawal which was terrible but doesn't hold a candle to this shit. I have no idea how long it will take me to fully recover from meds once I am able to be free of them. I'm not shitting on other people who successfully take medication, I personally am just fucking over it. I am semi-functional at best and no telling when I'll be able to fully adult again. I do a DBT workbook independently, take classes, talk to a therapist weekly and parent/run a household. Trying to take care of my mental health yet I despair the next wave of symptoms that frequently washes over me. I know I sound negative as fuck but it's how I feel at time and that's real."
754,"Help diagnose me, disconnected from subconscious emotions","Hey all, I feel I have neglected to figure out a side of myself that could be the detriment to many of my relationships.

Essentially I mostly feel emotion subconsciously, at least when I'm in a distinct moment that calls for an emotion. I'll drop a few examples below.

As a teenager we had a dog that I was inseparable from, she was sort of my secret therapy dog as I was bullied but didn't talk about it to my family. One week she got very sick and was likely gonna have to be put down (spoiler alert, she survived!) At night I remember distinctly trying to conjure tears, show some sort of emotion, but nothing would come up. Instead I hugged her I told her I loved her. I said this because though I felt completely numb, I knew logically, deep down it must be how I feel. Many years later when we did put her down, I was a broken mess. I mourned that dog for years.

Another example is later in life my mother told me and my brother she had cancer, albeit a less dangerous form but she did not play it off that way. As anyone would be, she was very nervous about it. When I first heard the news, I was expecting shock from myself, i expected a shooting tingle of terror down my spine, but in reality I felt nothing. In fact I soon became nervous and had to pretend to be terrified, I went and hugged her and comforted her while nervous like this. A month later she was having surgery and I stayed in the car for the first half of the operation to catch up on some sleep, I believe work kept me up, and I had the most simultaneously abstract yet lucid nightmare of floating above the operating table watching them hack her up. When I woke up I immediately went into the hospital waiting room to be with the rest of my family. The operation was a success btw.

A last quick example is that my fiance's favorite cousin had suddenly passed away and she was completely shocked and broken up about it. I comforted her but also couldn't conjure any authentic shock or sadness. The thing is I can reflect on this cousin of hers and feel sad but if I'm in the moment when something happens I feel nothing.

I don't like feeling fake; being neurotic and in my head all the time about emotions I don't feel. I'd like to know if this is common or if it sounds like anything diagnosible you folks have heard of. 

All this aside I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm trying to get tested for ADHD, if symptoms for those contribute to it.

Cheers!"
755,Psychiatrist and therapist?,"This might be a very stupid question, but i’ve been worrying about it. I already see a psychiatrist for medications, but I’ve been feeling like I need someone to talk to as well. Am I allowed, insurance wise, to see both a psychiatrist and a therapist at the same time? I want to continue seeing my psychiatrist."
756,How to widen my window of tolerance?,"This whole year has been way too much for me. Everything that has happened has been super traumatic and overwhelming, and it's made the little things in my life seem so, so much intolerable. Throw in some family drama and suddenly getting a full time job, and I'm literally crying over spilled milk. Having meltdowns at literally nothing, things I would have never found overwhelming before. 

I'm way, way beyond what I have the space to tolerate. My therapist called this my 'window of tolerance.' Well, I'm so far outside of my window that I can't even see it in the distance. Can someone give me some advice on how to make my window bigger? How to adjust to this insane new overwhelming situation? How to not let it all seep out over the rest of my life?

How do I stop feeling every moment that everything is too much?"
757,Telehealth Psychiatrist Appointment,"I got a call from my psychiatrist earlier, and we talked on the phone for at least 30 minutes. I told her I haven't taken my meds because I can't tolerate pills (stomach issue)...and she said that a certain psych med has a LIQUID form! I am VERY happy. Now I can take my meds like I am supposed to. She also told me that she has treated another person diagnosed with Pyromania!! Wow. I mean, I KNOW logically that I am not the only one (&lt;1% of the population is still \~3 million people) but to hear that she has actual experience is SO comforting. It was still hard talking about.   


The thing that got me is that I am able to say (out loud) the LONG name of my disorder: Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorder. I have a HARD time saying the real name of  what it is. I can type it fine (it is in my flair in fact) but I can't say it. I can sometimes say the shortened version, ONLY because it is the name of my favorite character (my Main) in Team Fortress 2, my favorite online game. That is actually what my son calls me when we are ""role-playing"" which we do sometimes. He is Medic and I am Pyro, our other sons are Soldier and Spy...and I do Heavy, Engie, Scout, DemoMan. Our daughter is (not willingly haha) Sniper and our eldest daughter is Ms. Pauliing. My hubby is Saxton Hale. So we just play sometimes. Well, she said this:  


Her: ""You can't say it, can you?""  


Me: No, I am sure you can see the long version in my chart.u'

Her: (I forget what she said before this) ...Yes, I can see it in the notes what you're talking about (the Pyromania)...the fire-setting, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So, she just basically confirmed that the shorter version IS in my chart. I don't know why this 

libothers me...this hasn't been a surprise to me for quite a LONG time now (I have accepted it pretty much completely) so why the hell does knowing that the actual disorder, Pyromania, is on paper make me so sad and uncomfortable? This is a good one for the psych but I never had the chance to ask her. Any thoughts on that? I need an armchair-psychiatrist here lol.  


  
Anyhow. I have to go to Program now. The psych will be there and said we can meet face to face for a few minutes so we know who each other is...that is nice. I haven't seen her yet so it will be nice to actually be in the same room as the person I have been talking with over the phone for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still depressed and wanting to cut...and now my urges are fucking driving me insane.

Fuck my life. I have to have a rare disorder that has no known effective treatment and no cure.

758,I Can't Stop Talking,"I have always been talkative. It runs in my family, mother and father. I am finding I can not stop. In group conversations on Zoom or at the market with people working in the bakery.  I find a way to fill the silence even if it's not there. I have been talking to myself more until pointed out by my wife or I notice after having gone on for a while. 

I know it's tied to some form of anxiety, living too much in my own head that I just bust out yapping. Self absorbed over nothing and everything. 

How do I work towards an awareness and effectively practice the art of shutting up?"

761,Depression and social media,"When I think about depression I think about people with no ambitions in life jst slowly dying away in their bed because they have no motivation to do anything. And suicidal etc. Well this is what depression was from personal experience.

But when people explain their “depression” to me. They seem to either have mild depression or jst off days which they class as depression. And complain that they’re not prioritised by the healthcare system in the UK even though they’ve been waiting for a long time to be seen by a professional. 

I know it’s unfair of me to say that it’s okay for ppl with milder symptoms to be of a lower priority, because I know ppl who are impulsive or have a history of suicidal attempts. Or even severe mental health issues that need more professional help than they do so their waiting isn’t a big of a deal. 

I think the general social media has messed up the severity of depression in its wake of enlightening them. More so now than ever before because if someone says they’re depressed ppl usually come up with oh “meditate” or “think positive thoughts” or “focus on the bright side” etc. And acc severely depressed ppl or mental health issue ppl come across as insane for self harming or neglecting to take care of themselves. Just my opinion tho."

No matter how well i stick to a diet, I don't lose weight or fat.  I feel shame about being seen by people I care about due to my weight, I feel like I cannot find love in my life because of my weight.  I am ashamed of my stomach, pectoral area, back, chin, and thighs and it completely occupies my entire level of self esteem.  As a result, I stress eat.  When I stress eat the problem gets worse.  I do not know how to get a hold of myself, and constantly look up the costs of surgeries I shouldn't have and cannot afford.  I despise working out and feeling exhausted (I do not get runners high, I do not get workout high, I do not feel like working out when I am high energy via prework out or energy drinks, all I get is a faster heart rate).  I feel completely stuck and unable to get out of this rut, and unable to lose weight, and unable to be happy.  I can't really find a helpline for this, and I'm having a serious self-hate anxiety crisis right now.  I feel hideous, obese, and like i will be forever unloved (by NON family members, do NOT try to console me that way please, i'm perfectly aware my parents love me fine).  Any resources available or kind words would be appreciated."

767,Ruining my relationship,"This is a very, very long one.

I just moved into a new studio apartment (One room with bed and kitchen with 1 ensuite bathroom) with my boyfriend for our secong year of university about 2 weeks ago. We've been together for about 1 1/2 years now, and before we met I was a tangled mess of mental health issues and substance abuse, and tried to commit suicide every couple of months or so. He's an amazing person and has been slowly helping to fix me with his kindness and compassion. Over the summer we tackled my drug addiction, which took a huge toll on our relationship and now we've moved into a new, small place where we're forced to be around each other 24/7 and I think he's near the end of his patience.

I struggled to pack up, but managed to throw all my stuff in the car just in time to not make us late moving in, and parents helped to dump it all in the place. I've been very anxious and stressed due to the whole situation, and my partners has been incredibly, incredibly stressed having to mostly organise it all himself. Anyway, we unpacked the general homely things together on the first day, and by the third day, my partner had unpacked and orgainsed all his stuff into the new home. It's now like 2 weeks and currently a bunch of my belingings are strewn all over the floor 'being organised' and making it difficult to get around the room. It's been like this for days, and I'm still not even close to being finished.

Every morning I pop to the pharmacy for medicine that makes me very, very sleepy then the rest of the day consists of me falling or almost falling asleep, wasting large quantities of time unnecessarily on the toilet, picking at my skin and generally dawdling. The one that pisses my partner off the most is when I spend 1-5 hours a day sitting in the only bathroom we have, ripping open infected scabs and sores on my breasts and poking/scratching/sniffing/picking them. It. Is. Disgusting. And it wastes a lot of time, damages my body, and kills my partners desire to get intimate with me. But now that there's a mess on the floor for me to clean, and a bunch of other chores to do/help with, which pisses him off even more, not to mention that he has to hold any need for the toilet in.

Whenever I do this, my partner gets very angry, depressed, frustrated and fed up with me, he tries to coerce me out, shouts at me etc out of frustration. I get very nervous and scared of shouting and feel very very very guilty for causing him these feelings and for being essentially useless and leaving him to do all the important things like bills and chores and leaving him to live in a tip when he's a very clean-loving person. But I just can't stop myself from doing it. No matter what the stakes are, the urge and the satisfaction I get are far too strong for me to fight and I don't know why. I don't understand why my brain won't let me be productive and happy. This whole situation is horrible, and I just feel so so awful and suicidal and like my bf doesn't even love me anymore and I just don't know what the fuck to do. I'm still waiting to be assigned a therapist, but that might take months..."

770,"“When this pandemic is over, I’m going to [insert thing you avoid now].”","I’m sharing this article because I think it flipped a switch in my brain that allowed me let go of some of the anxiety associated with the pandemic. I’m completely guilty of thinking “when this is over” thoughts, or making “when this is over” plans with my friends. I see how that can stop me from just enjoying life as it is, especially if there is no closure to this thing. Maybe you will also find it helpful.

[There Won’t Be a Clear End to the Pandemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/09/pandemic-over-end-how-will-we-know/616372/)

TLDR: the end of this pandemic will be a slow fade and Coronavirus will most likely never be eradicated. Best to mentally prepare for the new norm and don’t expect an overwhelming sense of closure. Stop telling yourself and others “when this is over I’m going to [insert thing you avoid now]”."

If I was fired I'm gonna lose this opportunity. It seems like I've left all my jobs on not the greatest note and I don't know why. I don't know if anyone would say they would rehire me. I do my job exactly how I'm instructed but I guess I still leave them on a bad note. I don't even call out a lot. I don't know who to blame.

I told my mom that I wanted to move to a place after I hopefully get a job. I said that it was cheaper and I wanted a change. I said that I’m happy where I am. She then said “ok but I heard it’s hard to get a job”. What does that mean? Why do my parents do this to me? Do parents emotionally support their kids? What is emotional support? Maybe I do get I don’t know. I sometimes wish I wasn’t so alone and had emotional support over financial support. I feel worthless, I’m ugly, hate myself, am embarrassed to be seen, scared to talk to people, incapable of doing anything, &amp; hate life so much.

I notice that I experience some pretty heavy duty brain fog and dizziness, I just feel really out of it. I am on medication (vyvanse) so I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. I’ve thought that maybe I’m suffering from some sort of deficiency or something but I’m not sure. I haven’t really talked to my doctor about this all that much, though I know I should. I have been know to masturbate excessively though, at minimum once a day. I have no guilt towards masturbating either, I’m not religious nor was it ever discouraged growing up. I have been doing it since I was like 9 though.

Any suggestions?

776,F(20) Memory resurfaced,"Hi, to preface this as a trigger warning this deals with sexual assault to a minor. I don't want to upset anyone, I just need to get this off my chest. 


So, to start off:
I have nothing diagnosed nor have I ever been in therapy or anything like that. I can barely recollect my childhood, up till 10 years old. 

Lately I've been working on myself, doing journaling, sitting with my feelings, etc. It was one moment during my work where I randomly remembered something. At first I thought I was imaging it, before asking my parents. 

I was 8 years old, playing on a trampoline in my backyard. I had no fence yet. It was raining, I was wearing a white t shirt that was very big on me and underwear. This is pretty normal in my household for younger children, we're Russian immigrants. 
I had a neighbor in his teens, who walked to my backyard and ushered me to the side of the house out of view of my mom and her friend from the window. 

I had no reason to distrust him. He was a good friend of my older sister. I run over to him, thinking he wanted to talk to me. Then he suddenly pins me against the wall and begins to french kiss me and touch my privates. (This is the only part I remembered.) 

My mom is definitely a momma bear. She filled me in on this bit. She saw me run off and immediately went after me. (I tended to get lost as a kid, so this was normal.) She saw my neighbor, and immediately took me into the house and went to his grandmother's. They talked, his grandmother profusely apologized, begged my mom not to press charges. 

My family discussed it. Before they could make a decision, the neighbor was taken to juvy for something else. So they dropped the idea. The neighbor ended up being in prison later on and the family moved away. 

I'm kind of hurt that charges weren't pressed but, my family and I don't really have faith in the system, especially regarding children. I just feel dirty and gross. I don't know how to describe everything else I'm feeling. My brain feels like it's not there and I'm on auto pilot. I'm trying hard to do self care. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this story made you upset. I've only told two people in my life who should know and I'm struggling with processing it."
777,Regection Sensitive Dysphoria?,I heard of this while I was asking for help on my Instagram. I have pretty much all of the symptoms except I don't have ADHD. Is that a requirement to be diagnosed?
778,Identity,"I wrecked my car two weeks ago &amp; I have been driving rental cars blowing through my savings. I work an hour and 20 minutes from my house 60+ hours a week, I’m in school full time and I miss my partner because we never see each other. I am a minimalist for mental health reasons (everybody in my family are hoarders) and I have noticed myself starting to buy a ton of stuff that I don’t need (food, decor). I feel like I am loosing myself trying to regain control and I don’t know what to do."
779,"I was diagnosed with aspergers at 10, I think I have ADHD too. Why can't I be normal.","I just can't focus. I forget when own train of thought constantly. I'm 17 and have no high school education. I just could not focus - trying to buckle down and do something - even articulating my own thoughts - feels like wading through quicksand. All I've done for the past four years is try to keep myself calm. I knew there was something more to my inability to focus than aspergers and anxiety.

Diagnosable or not I want something done about my concentration- I can't even do basic maths sometimes. I'm exhausted. All I can do is surf online, go out for a walk once a day, think of writing a story or making a youtube video, get depressed by not doing it, and repeat.

I don't want to be calm. I don't want be gifted (or differently wired if you want me to punch you) I want to live.

In junior high my my brother and the rest of my peers seemed an entire world away. They actually doing things. Not academically per se, but experiencing things. Finding interests, social lives, making mistakes, living life. And there I was in the common room - with a Kindle.

I don't know what to do anymore. I wrestled with loneliness and self worth for so long. This isn't the first time I've ranted about it.

I don't want to keep calm anymore. I just want to be happy."
780,Mental Health in Medicine,"This COVID-19 pandemic is putting a lot of strain in the mental health of our medical professionals, causing burnout and the tragic loss of Dr. Lorna Breen, an NYC ER doctor, by suicide in April.

Did you know that physicians have double the rate of suicide compared to the general population? Today is National Physician Suicide Awareness Day, a reminder that we must do more to support the mental health of physicians.

When 44% of physicians are burned out and 300+ physicians die by suicide every year, mental health should be a huge priority in the field of medicine. Instead we see a culture of silence, in which physicians keep their mental health struggles under the radar to escape scrutiny by licensing boards, residency programs, employers or even their peers, or when mental health issues may be seen as red flags by adcoms for those aspiring to enter the medical profession. Breaking this culture of silence is the first step in dismantling stigma.

That’s why it’s so important to share your story – Medical Minds Matter is a place where physicians and pre-med/medical students can share their mental health struggles with the option of staying anonymous because we want to include even those that are not willing to do so publicly. Follow our Instagram (@medical.minds.matter) or visit [www.medicalmindsmatter.org](http://www.medicalmindsmatter.org/) to learn more about this vital cause!"
781,Did anyone suffer from suicidal thoughts 24/7 nonstop for a very extended time (more than a year) and eventually got better?,"I’m at point where all I want is to die and the only thing holding me back is that it would destroy my family. I honestly don’t want to get better anymore. All I want is to disappear. Lately been having very clear and detailed dreams with dead family members in them that I’ve never had before. Maybe, just maybe it’s a sign that we will meet soon, although I don’t believe in afterlife and all that."
782,I need advice. It’s getting a little difficult to breathe.,"I’m an underage teen, and I’ve speculated having anxiety and depression for a while now. 


I thought I could cope on my own because it didn’t seem too serious, and I was probably just faking, but shit’s getting hard.


I tried to kill myself last June, and I got a trigger earlier this morning during online classes.


My chest is constantly hammering. My hobbies don’t make me happy anymore. Painting used to be an escape, some kind of vent for how I feel, but it’s not working anymore.


Recently, I’ve been feeling like taking risks. I’m scared of heights to death, but I wanted to go skydiving yesterday. I wanted to know what it was like to fall. I wanted to go motorcycle racing. I wanted to see how high I could fall off before I hurt myself. I want to do something that makes my heart beat even faster.


I want professional help, but I don’t know where to get it. My family told me it’s my fault I’m so miserable, and my friends can’t exactly do anything about this because we’re all underage.


I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like a dead end.


TLDR; things are getting really bad and I don’t know what to do."
783,There's something wrong with me,"When I was a teenager, any time I was under a high amount of stress, I would black out certain incidents and have no memory of them. I was told that I punched someone in my class for ""annoying me"" and I have no memory of doing it. I blacked out entire class periods, where my only memory was hearing the bell ring to start class, and what felt like 30 seconds later the bell rang again to end class. Realizing that I was backing out was so horrying to me, I ended up in therapy for almost 2 years because of it, and after I ended therapy I felt pretty okay. I've been out of high school for 8 years now, I've been married, had 2 kids, and divorced. During a bout of post partum depression I blacked out and somehow broke my phone, and had a few therapy sessions for that as well. It's been 6 years since my last black out. My father recently passed away, just a few weeks after I married my now husband, and my husband revealed to me this morning a few incidents that I have absolutely no memory of. I'm afraid that I'm having black outs again, and I can't afford therapy. I need help."
784,I have bipolar but there’s a big question mark over depression. I’m not trying to just join the “depression fad” I genuinely believe there’s more going on than manic episodes,"I have been in and out of the mental health system loads in the past. My manic episodes are very apparent. I am on meds for that. I haven’t spoken to the doctors about my feelings for a long time. It’s rare I have to see them. Usually only if I’m having a medication review or if I’ve gone manic. When I’ve spoken to them before I would often talk about how I feel like I lost my personality etc. I didn’t go through any trauma but I did sort of get emotionally distraught over specific events but I improved although that’s when the manic episodes started. For a while I noticed my social skills and my outgoingness went down. I feel like I’m not very motivated in life and nothing interests me. I also get introspective a lot where I’m trying to give myself feedback. I can be cynical a lot and I can function but I feel like I am really lazy. Most hobbies I get fed up of too. I know it’s probably only mild if anything. It’s not that I feel necessarily sad but I can relate to the “empty” feeling it can also be described as. Sometimes I feel like I got all the labels in the world. Some labels I have considered before are schizoid, adhd and social anxiety. My main problems are lack of confidence, motivation, rumination, avoidance, discipline, idleness, self loathing, this is obviously aside from the manic episodes. Has anyone got any ideas? Or is this normal for someone and either way how can I improve?"

I want to tell her this but I don't want to come across as selfish.

Also the friend moving in is a bit annoying, we don't get along too well, she recently got really pissed off at me and our friendship hasn't been the same since.

Ok bow onto the second thing, I just want to kill myself, I've told my school teachers that I'm having troubles with my mental health but they won't do anything unless I tell them I'm self harming or am having suicidal thoughts.

If I tell them I am self harming, which I am, my mun would literally disown me ffs.

I've been thinking I'm bipolar too, I have all the symptoms and everything seems to match up but it would also seem as though I have borderline personality disorder.

Should I tell my GP this?

i really want to be able to get better, but i’ve only ever gotten worse and worse. i asked my parents what to do and they told me to just pray, which might help. however, sometimes that’s not exactly what you want to hear. you know? 

i need to be able to go to school again, but i can’t even finish a single class most of the time. zoom meetings drain me so much, and i’m really trying my best here. nobody seems to think i am, though. my mom gets mad at me, and my dad asks me why i don’t try hard enough.

799,Should I see a therapist?,"So currently I'm in quarantine and I'm 20, taking classes online while at home with my parents (my school moved to almost entirely remote learning). Personally, I've never felt depressed or suicidal or anything. But I have had a lot of problems. Growing up, I never really had any friends or hung out with anybody outside of class. I didn't even know that people spent time hanging out until I was about 17. When I was younger (like middle school and beginning of high school), I had forced my self to ask out a few girls, all of which rejected me. This led to immense resentment towards women for a time period. Like I literally told people ""I hate women"" because that felt better than admitting I had no clue how to talk to girls. There were other changes as well, but not very important to this topic. I've also never had any good social skills for the most part. I tend to be really awkward most of the time, especially around girls. I had made up for this in very strange ways throughout my life. While in college, I tried to made friends but ended up ruining all my relationships by either saying something completely inappropriate or just not gaining any respect from others. I have decent grades/ career prospects but have no social contacts or connections. I've never had a religion and have little meaning in life other than working out. Up until just before quarantine, I began to see some change. I actually got up the confidence to talk to a girl at a party and ended up kissing her. I tried to make amends with some people I had previously wronged and also got a Tinder. Then, quarantine hit and all of this changed. I haven't talked to hardly anybody my age in a while, making quarantine very difficult on me personally. Our school also is likely going to extend remote learning to take up next semester. Don't really have any way of talking to people now. Was wondering if anybody had any advice, or thinks therapy would work."
800,Constantly in a Fog?,"I'm sure I'm not alone in this, during this crazy time, but this is a familiar feeling to me. 

I grew up in a church-heavy home as a pastor's kid - one of those situations where even if you're not okay, you have to be okay for the sake of an image. For most of my life I believed I was totally fine, completely okay, happy, and my family was essentially the ""model"" family. 

I dealt with heavy guilt, crippling anxiety/panic attacks, and stress all my adolescent years and pretended it was never there. My family saw it a few times, but at the time it was smoothed over with church-related phrases and the idea that I should turn to God rather than getting some help. Please don't misunderstand, I still consider myself religious and love my religion, but that was a toxic church environment that I broke away from. When I went to college, it reached a breaking point.

Finally, I moved out on my own after graduating and hoped to stimulate healthy habits in my life through some separation and independence from my family. Now, I just feel so lost. 

I feel as though I have lost all joy from things. I'm constantly focused on others and I can't even remember if there are things I was passionate about for me. I have no idea what I love to do or have any desire to do those things.

And the whole time, I feel guilty for not doing those unknown ""things."" There are many days that I don't recognize myself in the mirror and I'll take a video of myself and rewatch and have no idea who that person is. 

This part of my anxiety, fog-riddled brain is new. Or maybe it's just that being out of school and working from home full-time with a pandemic on the loose is giving me way too much time to dwell on the things I never nurtured before.

Either way, I wanted to post something to see if I'm going crazy or it's not just me.

TLDR: Anxiety-cursed 22 year old is losing touch with herself and feels like she's in a fog constantly. What can I do?"
801,Mental Illness and Physical Disability,"Hello, I am student writing a senior paper on the stigma of mental illness and physical disability. I have  had depression, anxiety, and OCD for the longest time and always wondered why mental illness and physical disability are stigmatized differently. I do have a couple of speculations, but would love to get an outside opinion on this matter.

802,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Ever since I stopped talking to a certain someone, I have been experiencing heart aches daily, I had been sad, I even can't feel attracted to people I go on dates with. That person of course, will never forgive me and won't talk to me. So, I feel like punishing myself yet I don't know how or what to do. I am too scared to harm myself. I just wanna talk because I'm so lonely without that person though all we ever were was just online friends."
803,Voices and Anxiety.,"I am a voice hearer, Bipolar 1, PTSD sufferer. So i want to ask the voice hearers of the group or people struggling with something similar. How do you reality test? Do you come back to your breath? I feel my feet in my shoes. I have a constant reoccurring hallucinations that I am dead or dying. I get my blood checked every week and that is pretty grounding. What do you do? Reality testing is so important. CBD oil also works wonders. If you wondering what this fear of death is called their is actually a DSM term for it “Cotard Delusions” if you suffer from something similar post a comment in the box below and maybe we could help each other."

805,How to get my mom to understand and where to get help?,"It’s a long story of what happen to me but I had a traumatic brain injury when around 13 years ago when I was a kid and it injured all other parts of my body aswell. I am 24 now and I have pretty bad short term memory and problems concentrating since then and really bad anxiety and social problems and depression. I started therapy a few months ago and I guess it’s been helping with my depression but my anxiety is still bad and I still have bad memory problems. I tried college a few years but couldn’t get past math. My mom always tells me I don’t try hard enough, and that’s why I fail and have bad memory. She makes fun of me all the the and says mean shit and tries to make me feel guilty about stuff like saying if she does I will feel bad for whatever it is at the time. She always tell me my therapist is an idiot and doesn’t have kids so she must not have kids. I don’t know how to make my memory better, it’s mostly short term problems and I can’t concentrate on more than one things or my mind sorta goes blank and I can’t remember either when I try to remember the other thing. I went to get an mri and they said my brain looks fine compared to whatever other scans I had only thing I have is a bulged disk in my neck which I don’t think is caused my memory problems. I don’t really know what to do or how to help my self. I just need some advice."

I got discharged today from hospital after being admitted 6 weeks ago for trying to take my own life, which left me on life support for 2 days prior to my admission. 

I’m not really sure if it’s the right sub to post it, but I’m feeling really intense emotions right now of sadness &amp; feeling alone. 

Being in a ward environment for 6 weeks with nurses/staff &amp; so many nice patients to talk to everyday, I just feel like I’m going to miss that close contact so much and that I’m going to spend my days feeling so alone. 

I know from experience that these are probably just highly intense, but short lived thoughts &amp; feelings, I will probably be okay by the end of the weekend, hopefully:)

812,The insanity that comes with not finishing anything,"Hello all :) I am new to this sub, but glad I have found it, and figured I would ask a question I have been mulling over for the past couple of weeks. 

What you need to know: I have been seeing my therapist for over a year now, I am on anti-depressants, and I have diagnosed OCD, generalized anxiety, and depression.

Question: I struggle to finish just about anything, and its driving me insane. I absolutely hate it, and this has mostly gone on since I experienced the worst death in my life 3 years ago. I am not actively grieving anymore, but I used to be able to sit and become absorbed in a book, and then finish it in just a day or two. I would play a game straight through. I was would binge my favorite tv series. 

Now? I have to do multiple things. I can't sit and watch tv/movies. It drives my husband nuts, but I am getting up every few minutes to go do something, or take care of something. It really takes me about an hour to settle out of these habits.   


If I am reading or playing a game, I have an eraser I consistently and almost constantly rub, but I also have to stop every 5-10 minutes to look at my phone or do something else.   


I've read 9 books this year. 9. That is an all-time low for me. I used to be able to get through 30-50 a year. I ALWAYS had a book with me.   


I DO try to push through these habits, but then my mind wanders. I try to finish a book series, and I'm bored by book 3 and have to move on to something else. I typically bounce from book to book, sometimes reading between 2-3 at a time. This is going to sound bad, but the only time I was able to really push through a task was when I was on painkillers from surgery. I can't even relax on my lunch breaks - I have to go to the Y and go swim, or go walk, or run some errands. I've maybe sat through ONE lunch break since December.

Does anyone else experience something similar? If so, how did you combat this type of habit/behavior?"

814,My vitiligo makes me feel really self conscious,"I’ve always been a socially awkward as a child and still have that part of me in my teenage years. As a child i barely had any friends and hated being seen with no friends. I eventually grew out most of it in freshman year of high school and thats when my vitiligo started to spread. Over the years of high-school i began to gain more confidence and improved my social skills. But over quarantine my Vitiligo spread significantly so its really easy to see my Vitiligo on my face and body. Im really self consious about my Vitiligo and people in my family talk about it casually to my other family members or their friends and i really hate that. I feel like im an outcast to my classmates as im short (5’3) and have a Vitiligo. My confidence has been affected by my Vitiligo as i try to hide it with clothes that cover my body. I feel like my Vitiligo affects me socially and when people bring my Vitiligo up i get my a bit offended and try to change the subject. I really want to not be affected by my Vitiligo and just to be more confident like i have it and just not care about me having it. How can i be more confident and not let my self consciousness get better of me?

haha sorry this was long but i had to get it all out"
815,Is this bad or am I just overthinking?,"I have had Suicidal thoughts from like 2015 to 2017, but all that has bettered now. On the other Hand though, i have started to get panic attacks for the last 6 Months. i have always had weird ticks, like winking and counting steps, and everything always has to be either an even number that is somehow related to the number 24

so I am not quite sure whether I am being an over thinker, but it hasn´t been going too well the last years and since I feel like I will only bother friends and don´t want them to feel bad, that's why I'm writing this.

I have had Suicidal thoughts from like 2015 to 2017, but all that has bettered now. On the other Hand though, i have started to get panic attacks for the last 6 Months. i have always had weird ticks, like winking and counting steps, and everything always has to be either an even number that is somehow related to the number 24, but I guess I can live with that, only sometimes they get really bad, but never in the same situations as the panic attacks. Those have never had a reason or trigger, they just come out of nowhere. I don't even know if they are panic attacks, as I said I never open up and am kind of the confident extrovert in my friends group. Additionally my circulatory system has always had problems and I´ll start to shiver out of nowhere, but always when something worries me. I have a Cat and when i see him everything is okay again, but since its my families cat I don´t get to see him too often.

The quarantine has not bettered the situation, my panic attacks become more and more regular events and I am starting to feel like my room is a prison. Usually I meet with friends to ignore my ""problems"", but recently I have had a panic attack while two friends where with me, and I since haven´t really met anybody. I don't want anyone to worry, since honestly my Life has been great and I  have good education, just got accepted into uni and life in a good neighborhood, have friends and a Band. But it just keeps getting worse and I don´t want to fall back into the suicide thoughts.

Is this bad? I have never been to a doctor because of all that, but is it bad enough that I should go? Or do anything about it.

Also, excuse my bad English, it is not my native language."

819,Our Role in Recovery,"[ReChanneling](https://rechanneling.org)

The fact that we are not accountable for the childhood/adolescent exploitation that led to our ‘mental’ dysfunction does not absolve us of the adult responsibility to do something about it.

Many of us avoid learning about the causes and symptoms of our disorder as if ignoring it will make it go away. When we see evidence that the traits and characterizations of the disorder match our own, it somehow makes it more concrete, more real. *It makes us accountable*. Although all the relevant data is readily available from credible sources, including the National Institute of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, remaining uninformed perceptually abrogates responsibility.

When something is broken, it is deconstructed to analyze the problem. We isolate the components and acquaint ourselves with their objectives. Equal effort is required for the brokenness in us. We must study the traits and symptoms of our disorder, and recognize how they affect our thoughts and behaviors. For us to have any chance at recovery, we need to know what we are recovering from. Replacing or repairing defects is fruitless without knowing what those defects are and how they function. Before a football team faces their opponent, they watch hours of film, review stats, and practice. If an actor wishes to give a good performance, it is prudent to learn the character’s lines before getting on stage. Our disorder is our enemy; it is unhealthy, and it hurts us. Our deliberate ignorance is denial, and that is a deal-breaker. Our disorder will continue to impact our emotional wellbeing and quality of life until we recognize, accept, and confront it.

Recovery-remission is a psychological construct. The revelation we are not responsible for the disorder sets the foundation for recovery. Understanding that we alone are the agents of change begins the construct. Counselors and programs provide the blueprint, but we erect the edifice. The disease model tells us what is wrong with us. We do not need to hear that. Our disorder is not something that can be excised like a tumor, so what is the point of telling us what is wrong with us? The wellness model’s focus and by extension, positive psychology and other optimistic approaches, is on our virtues and strengths.

One group of psychologists describes recovery as “people (re-) engaging in their life on the basis of their own goals and strengths, and finding meaning and purpose through constructing and reclaiming a valued identity and valued social roles.” [\[i\]](https://robertmullenca.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=359&amp;action=edit#_edn1) Enduring recovery grounds itself on our knowledge of our disorder and the implementation of our character strengths and virtues to recover from it."
820,I got help the same day somebody in my town ended his life,"I had been suicidal on and off for 4 years. Yesterday I got help. Well, last night a kid in the same town as me ended his life. Im really upset that I was able to get help, but he wasn't able to. I would've been fine waiting one more day before I got help if it meant I could've saved someone else's life."

823,I'm worried about a work colleague.,"There's a girl at my work that I'm pretty close with, she tells me most things. But I obviously have no idea what goes on at her home and behind closed doors. She's 24. She has been in a relationship with this guy for about 4 years, he always has no money, as he spends it on drugs and alcohol. She does do drugs, nothing serious just weed or the odd psychedelic. She's not a heavy drug user by any means. She's told me she doesn't even like them and only does it because her bf does. She came in to work the other day after getting back from a weekend away with her boyfriend. She told me they had both had a huge argument and she left him. According to her, her boyfriend got drunk and was going through her phone reading all her messages to other guys, including messages to me. They were nothing bad at all, just normal conversation stuff but he clearly seems over protective and doesn't like her talking to other guys. Then she showed me a bunch of bruises on her arms and on her back. She insisted her boyfriend didn't do it intentionally. And he just pushed her away as she was trying to get her phone back when he was going through it. I personally don't believe this, as the bruises were all over he arms. I didn't believe it for one second. I said to her ""it doesn't matter if he did it intentionally or not, you're still covered in bruises"". As she was defending his actions. I caught her crying by herself on a lunch break. But I left her alone, as she had just got out of a 4 year relationship, and I felt she just wanted some space. I did made it clear to her though later that day, that I was always there if she needed anything and I was just a phone call away.

She wasn't taking the break up well. She told me they had arguments in the past, and broke up multiple times. But they always made up and got back together. This time though she said it's different. She told me life is too short, and it's not a healthy relationship and it's over for good now. Due to the bruises her family have been supporting her, telling her she's doing the right thing ending it. Everyone has been trying to be as supportive as they can, including myself. Yesterday she was fine, I was talking to her for hours, she was acting like nothing was wrong. But today, she didn't show up to work and phoned in sick. Then she started messaging another one of my work colleagues that she's letting everyone down, and that she doesn't see the point in living. And was saying multiple times she wanted to just kill herself. Which is well out of character for her. She is usually a really strong, confident individual. She told this other work colleague not to tell anyone. But due to what she was saying, the other work colleague told me as I'm the only other person close to her. So she doesn't know that I know she's been saying she wants to kill herself. This other work colleague went straight to her house and was with her for a couple of hours. I told them to keep me updated on her. They told me she had been up all night drinking and had now gone to bed, and for me not to worry. I sent her a DM saying ""hope everything is ok, I'm free all day if you need anything, just let me know"". As I wasn't supposed to know anything. I made it seem like I was just concerned for her not showing up to work. She replied back about 4hours later saying. ""Sorry, I've just woke up, not been feeling to good. I'll talk to you tomorrow at work"". 

That's the situation right now. I'm just stressing out and feeling helpless. My thoughts are that this now ex boyfriend has been very controlling and she is terrified of taking that step to actually leaving him. Like I said at the start, I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, and I have no idea what he could be saying to her in private DM's. But for her to start saying she hates her life and wants to die. Is so out of the norm for her. She was drunk tbh, but I personally can't ignore someone when they say things that due to stuff that's happened in my life. I want to be there for her as it's heart breaking seeing her suffering so much as she has a heart of gold and wouldn't hurt a fly. She always worries about others before herself. And I think in this case that's her downfall. She needs to think about herself and sort her own life out. I don't want to keep asking her if she is ok, and the same old stuff. As that could be more annoying. I've told her twice now in the last couple of days that I'm always just a phone call away. I'm not great with things like this. I just wanted to know if anyone knows the best thing I could do for her in this situation. As I feel this isn't just her getting over a break up. I feel like there may be more happening behind closed doors that I don't know about with her now ex boyfriend."
824,Today you made a cornflakes melted chocolate treat and I want to talk you through it,"While your Father is upstairs and Mother out for a walk you hastily unwrap some free mini chocolates you managed to sneak into the house via your bra from someone's birthday at work. You have the TV blaring so no tell tale wrapper crinkles give you away. The microwave is out back but you make sure to check your back and catch it way before it beeps. Cornflakes are more difficult but you manage. You know every point at which the kitchen door creaks and cough over it, you know every creaky floor board and avoid them with practised ease. You manage to mix up your concoction and think success! But your Mother is keying at the door, a common tactic, coming back in to ""retrieve her phone"" the one that she left with already in her hand in the first place. You hastily shove the bowl in the back freezer and pretend to make tea. She does her sweep, unhappily satisfied for the moment and heads out again. 

You manage to sneak back barefoot and measure each step. You eat in the dark with the freezer light the only thing illuminating your face like a racoon out the bin. Hasty spoonfuls painfully churning with the gnawing sense of panic at the pit of your stomach. You suddenly think what a terrible idea this all was. You were doing so well with your diet and this is all too reminiscent of your teenage binges. Ears sharp, eyes trying to make out any distant movement like your life depends on it. 

You think to yourself this can't be normal, this can't be life. But you remember you're a 27 year old graduate who was supposed to have the world as your oyster. Only your once bright mind fizzled in the thick smog like darkness. All the ""why can't you bes"" the ""if onlys"" a rising shrieking cacophony of silent agony. You long to be 11 again and full of blissfully ignorant potential. But you're tired, worked 50 hours and ate too many god damn salad leaves this week. You just want one thing, one treat to yourself. You did good, hit your targets and stuck to bloody broccoli. You think tomorrow is a new day, one blip doesn't ruin everything. You hear footsteps and come to violently, in a blind panic you dump the rest in the bin, hastily cleaning the bowl with boiling water even though it scaulds you. 

Heart thudding you make sure everything is in it's right place. Because you got that sought after poorly paid industry job because you're ""detail orientated"". Only your employers don't know you're accurate because there's a crawling beneath the skin of your neck that makes you check a document exactly twenty times. They don't know you're so perceptive because you got used to reading a room as a matter of mental survival. 
But you managed it, you got off scot free! You sit down huddled away behind a closed door relishing the moments because of a dictorian ""open door policy"". You watch cartoons on mute because you're still a child inside, maybe you even sleep with a bear in secret. You just want something to hold on to. 
Suddenly you remember that the bins are checked. 
The cornflakes gurgle uncomfortably in your gut.
Your eyes are wide."
825,Reoccurring memories &amp; intrusive thoughts,"I have a never ending feeling of embarrassment, guilt and self-hatred, and I’m not sure if it’s “normal” anymore. My constant feeling of embarrassment stems from suddenly remembering old memories at random times, which leads to self hatred and guilt in a way. These memories are mostly me doing something with a negative consequence, usually something small  (other more serious things also do come to mind) and insignificant things. Usually these small stupid memories are exaggerated in my mind but when more serious things appear I feel more upset. This is also accompanied with intrusive thoughts. 

These flashbacks and other factors did cause depression for me for several years, with two years ago being suicidal. While I do have anxiety and understand that I’m working through my depression and feeling as if I’m out of it, I cannot work out what this is and why it happens.

These flashbacks happen at random times, make me feel uncomfortable, angry and upset. When it happens I usually start squeezing myself/hands, fidgeting etc. I do fidget a lot on a daily basis and these things also happen when I feel suddenly at unease or anxious. Another horrible coping mechanism is picking at my skin, usually my nails, face and shoulders. Again - this all happens at times when there’s no need to feel this way, yet I do and my mind drives me there. I’ve been dealing with this since I was 7 and I just want to be free."
826,I’m Not happy with myself,"I’m a 22 y.o female and I have two beautiful children and an amazing fiancée. I’m in school for something I enjoy, I have an associates in something else practical, I’ve been through a lot more than most my age and I feel like I have a pretty fair grip on life and reality. 
But I’m not happy with myself. I never have been. I spent years of my child hood dealing with emotional abuse that was never owned up too and I don’t think ever will be. So I know that probably has a lot to do with my constant mindset of self hatred and unhappiness. I look in the mirror every single day and hate every bit of what I see. Objectively I can say “I know I’m not an unattractive person” but my eyes tell me something else. Objectively I can say “I know I’m not overweight even though I definitely could lose 10 lbs and be happier with myself” but I delete every picture of myself and hate the way I look in everything I wear. I hate going out in public because people will look at me and surely think “yuck”. I wanted to join the military or be a firefighter and instead I’m a stay at home mom. And while I appreciate the importance of what I am doing in raising children....I’m unhappy. I spent years telling myself I was a bad person. And that everything bad that happened to me was God punishing me for not being a good enough Christian, was payback for having an opinion as a teenager, was just the cards I was dealt in life because of how shitty of a human being I was inside and out. I occasionally have days where these thoughts aren’t so loud. But they are still always there. On my bad days I don’t eat because I think maybe I could just starve myself into being happy. On my bad days I hate being a mom. On my bad days I want to run away and never come back. On my bad days I lay on the couch all day and can’t see the point in anything I’m doing because what does it matter I’m failing at it anyway. I know this is probably a lot of people who also struggle but ... it always feels so personal to me because it feels like a huge hole right in the middle of my chest. Literally. Idk why I’m posting here, probably because I don’t have anyone I know on here and I’m really tired of just keeping it to myself. When I tell other people they just tell me it’s normal to feel the way I do. I don’t feel normal."
827,Everything is boring,"I think this is the flair that fits best.

First off, I’m 12 (year 8) so there isn’t much I can personally do to improve my situation that I know of. I feel very out of control in life, everything is boring. There is nothing to look forward to in life anymore. I don’t have any drive to do things I like, like drawing or playing vr.
My life is just, wake up, go to school, come back.
I don’t know if this is depression because Ik it’s a stereotype that all teens claim they’re depressed. I just don’t really se a point to anything. If nothings gonna change then I’m just doing the same things for years until I grow up. If I really am depressed or going into depression, I am sensible enough to know that despite any urges I might get later on, I do NOT want to self harm or kill myself. I am very logical and I am also atheist so I think even if my life is boring, if I killed myself it just stops so I might as well just go along with whatever life has. Also if I ended up self harming which I am scared about. I have dealt with two of my friends self harming and don’t want to put them through the stress that I went through helping them.

I really don’t know what to do but if I end up dead in a year imma be pissed.
I don’t know wether these are signs or I’m just looking to far into this but I don’t want to feel like this and I am sensible enough to ask for help (at least online) when I start to feel like this.

I don’t know wether I need help or if this is just the stereotype depression that all teens get, so please let me know if I should get help because Ik people on the outside looking in will be able to make better decisions than me, especially since they will be older.

Thank you and I can go more in depth in the comments if I need to."

829,Very sad about lost memories from ECT,"I'd like to preface this post by saying: do not tell me I made a bad decision with my treatment. Do not tell me that ECT is primitive or it shouldn't exist. Keep it to yourself. 

I'm not often sad because of my memory damage from electroconvulsive therapy because it gave me my life back. 70+ sessions and it's the only reason I'm still here, functional. It actually saved my life and I would tell anyone who was in my exact situation that it's a good idea for them to try (especially because 95% of people getting ECT don't need many sessions at all, only around 10. I was getting it on a maintenance basis which is relatively rare, and the only reason my memory damage is so extreme. Also most people use a less intense form of the procedure that has fewer side effects.) 

But I was reading about autobiographical memories for my psych class and I cried for the first time over my memory loss. The textbook was describing how memories of your life make you who you are and... I just have lost so much. I just recently learned that I went to my highschool graduation. A lot of my childhood is gone. 

ECT was sooooo worth it, I wouldn't have ANY memories if I was dead. I have lived to be an adult in University with a loving girlfriend and an obsession with chess. But... Goddammit, have I lost sight of my original self? 

Not that that necessarily is a bad thing because I hated myself so much, but I now have accepted that those feelings were unwarranted. 

I know this: I am now a new version of myself who is alive and creating NEW memories to define who I am, and that's a miracle from my perspective! But... I'm still sad... all these experiences and facts about myself gone into the ether :( 

Again, nothing is wrong about ECT. You know what the risks are going into it, it can work miraculously, and it's pretty rare for anyone to get as many sessions that I have. I'm a pro ECT advocate. But still, I'm sad."
830,How can I get my older sister help I believe she has Paranoid Schizophrenia for many years,"My older sister is in her late 40s, since she was young she had mental health issues but my father refused to get her mental help because he claims they will poison her with meds.

He said just pray, turns out my father has signs of a person with paranoia and narcissism, he believes my mom was cheating she has no friends because he told her they will brainwash her to cheat and she never cheated or flirted with any man and yet he was the one always flirting with women and with a perverted mind, basically whatever he did he thought others were doing too but pretend he never did them and accused others. So we think my sister got her mental illness from my fathers side.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it got worse we took her to the store and she slapped a young teen girls phone saying dont you ever film me delete that now who is spying on me. 

She also thinks our neighbors are spying on her when they are fixing their house and hammering outdoors she will go outside even 100 times in 30 minutes, one time she started throwing cans over the fence and bottles at night at our neighbors and I caught her she did it 2 am.

She used to go to those psychiatrist or hospitals but never tells them the truth, so they couldn't diagnose her she will lie and say she is just depressed or sad, or that someone yelled at her she never tells them she hallucinates, hears voices or thinks people are spying and filming her

one time my sister tried to catch her in the act and film her so we could show the psychiatrist that she has paranoid schizophrenia so she could get help and medication but she yelled super loud and chased my sister and demanded she stop and delete the video, it was a video of her going in our yard climbing a ladder to spy on our neighbors.

Our father is old and still alert and sharp and he controls everything he tries to shame us and say if something happens to your sister it is your fault, if they give her meds and she dies its on your hands, he tries to guilt trip us he did this for the past 20 years and he said its against the law to put someone in a mental health clinic he will make things up. He said you have no money they will charge you 50 thousand to keep her in a therapy.etc

WE never had any solid social life because when we were younger our sister would spy on us, all my girlfriends got scared off because of her, she would find their number and tell them are you spying on me and they said they couldn't be with me anymore cause of my crazy sister the worst one is when I was engaged I never took my girlfriend t meet my family because of my crazy sister and father, she finally met my family and I told my mom not to break my sister because I was scared she would act up and she did, she gave my fiance a dirty look and then later a month later she called my fiance cell phone and said die you B and whore and all these things saying she was spying on her.

Her parents told her to leave me because if we had kids our kids would have mental illness like my sister. 

Today was bad when she yelled at some woman saying do you know so and so and tell her to stop filming me and spying on me.

It sucks, what can I do, how can I get her help, I live in California is there anyway to get my sister help?"
831,How do you get out of a mental block?,It's only my 4th day of online classes junior year and I already feel defeated overwhelmed and stumped they threw so much work at us all at once and I don't know how to handle it I feel like crying.Too much to do in little time.
832,Just looking for some advice,"So, my girlfriend has several emotional/mental disorders (most intense being bipolar disorder and OCD) that tend to put her through severely negative mood swings. She'll often say she feels hopeless about our future, that she thinks these feelings will never change even if her environment does (she comes from an abusive, somewhat physically and very emotionally, household. We're planning to have her move in with me), and that she cant stop thinking of mutilating her body. I know she's in control of herself enough to not act upon these urges, and I don't think that this is an urgent issue or anything. She's always had these problems, and her grip on them has been improving tremendously since we've started giving her emotional health and environment the attention and care it needs. We're working on getting her a therapist, who will obviously be better suited than me to support her in this regard, I'm just not sure what can be done to combat these mood swings right now, if anything. It's difficult hearing her say she feels like everything we're working for won't be for anything, even if I know that it's not and that she's only feeling that way in the moment. 
If anybody has some advice on combatting severe mood swings, please share. I know these things can be very different for different people, and the last thing I want to do is use the wrong approach to support her with something this severe, but. Yknow, just any thoughts or ideas would be better than nothing."
833,"whenever i can’t do anything, i have a breakdown","      earlier today i wanted to draw someone but didn’t know where to start and got really frustrated. i then tore out all of my drawings in my sketchbook and went around my room putting things away because i thought i didn’t deserve a personality. I deleted the book i was writing too. i made everything gray because i hated color at that moment and didn’t want anything to do with uniqueness. afterward everything came flooding back and i cried for 10 minutes. i feel like i’m falling apart and i’m going to snap again.
     these last few weeks have been rough too. i don’t feel like doing any hobbies like i used to. i never draw or play video games. I just sit around and watch youtube until i have to go to bed. I usually rewatch videos i’ve already seen too. everything just floods out at one moment and i can’t stop. i destroy things or put away things i love and cherish. i constantly think that everything i’m doing isn’t good enough or it won’t help me when i’m older.
   i constantly do this and today it only got worse."
834,Repost: Telehealth appt earlier today,"I messed up while trying to edit, so I will just do a repost (SORRY!!)

I talked to my psych, and basically she is going to be looking into getting me on a liquid form of one of the psych meds so I can take it more easily. I have stomach issues and pills don't agree with me for the most part. I only take the pill for my stomach issue (irony?) and Tylenol, only if I am dying and can't stand whatever pain I am having. So yay for being able to take my meds.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, the rest of my post was stupid and pointless. The psych admitted that Pyromania was actually in my charts, something I had been wondering about for a while now. Well, found out there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever as to what my diagnosis is. I feel both relieved (I know and have known what it is for a while now but hearing it from a professional helped) and extremely sad. Never in 10000000000000000000 years would I have guessed that at 49 years old I would be in a group of people that is very very small. This is so misunderstood, hard to treat (therapy and meds yeah, but they are not proven at all to be effective and the person needs to WANT to change, which I do not), and just not acceptable to society because of the inherent danger involved. I am a pariah already in my neighborhood...we have moved and people here in the new place still look at me sideways. I had been on the news and in the papers, and people here have a long memory for shit like that.  


Anyway, that is it. Program was boring as fuck today. I just had NO patience for sitting there listening to someo

ne drone on and on about shit that I really didn't give two fucks about. I feel so annoyed and agitated now and I don't know why. The people in my Program hadn't done anything wrong. I am just in a shit mood, I guess. I need to burn something but guess what...that is an UNHEALTHY COPING MECHANISM...for fuck's sake...it is the only thing that truly makes me feel better.  


See ya later guys. I don't expect anything from this. It is just mostly a vent, I suppose. Or just sharing...whatever the fuck you wanna call it. I have to go rest. Program wiped me out and I am physically exhausted and emotionally/mentally in pain. Bai."
835,Please help,"I have struggled with adhd ,major depressive disorder with psychotic features , and severe panic disorder. I was diagnosed at 13 , and I am now 21 . My mental illnesses have both gotten worse over time . For the last 2 years I have been taking 2mg of xanax every day because my panic attacks have gotten so bad I can barely function . I do not have the classic symptoms of a panic attack , instead I fully disassociate and derealize . Being at work is EXTREMELY difficult even though my job isn't demanding and I spend 9 hours a day alone. Atleast once a week I get home from work and have a breakdown because it's too much.  I feel like im losing hope that things will get better , in fact they just keep getting worse . When I turned 19 I started experiencing hypomanic episodes . My primary care doctor believes I am bipolar and was diagnosed incorrectly at such a young age because I am now at the point where mania manifests . I have been trying to find a psychiatrist (Illinois state insurance makes it difficult) , and every counselor i have seen does not help. I can barely get myself out of the house and cannot afford to do text/call counseling even though that would work so much better for me. When I am at home working my side job (I do Scentsy) , I feel ok. I have tried so many coping mechanisms and NOTHING works. I have contemplated quitting my job in order to get the mental health help I need , but I have to have money to pay bills.. so I feel very trapped . Any advice on ANYTHING would be so helpful ."
836,Therapy,"Does anyone know of any resources I can use for therapy? I’ve been trying to seek a therapist through my insurance but sadly the only options are for those who a chronically suicidal. I am not suicidal, rather I fear the prolonged effects of me not addressing the night terrors, panics, and mental unresponsiveness that I have been experiencing lately. I had some trauma as a kid with my mother being abusive and my father being distant and out of reach when I needed help and at the time it hurt but I didn’t really have any severe mental issues but since moving out and being on my own constantly, I’ve grown back into having night terrors (I had them very frequently as a child) and panic attacks. Whenever I seek help, I am told no because I am not suicidal and I cannot afford to pay 75-150 per hour for a session, so I’m really in a jam with this. I have been told by the screening psychiatrist that I may have ptsd and that I appear to be on the spectrum for catatonic schizophrenia. I am looking for any online resources or anything in the inland empire of Southern California. Does anyone have any recommendations please? Thank you for taking time to read this."
837,The Urge to Hurt someone,"I don’t knows what wrong with me.

Sometimes I have the urge to hurt people, it’ll be something like a push or a punch to the arm. 

But I took it too far today.

I grabbed my friend and pushed him in the floor.I did it too hard and he cried. (He was fine)

I feel like complete shit. What’s wrong with me?

It sounds stupid, but when someone annoys me/gets me angry.

I want to kill them.

I’ll think about for the entire day. And it’s makes me smile.

It’s sadistic as fuck."

But today, I took it too far. I grabbed my friend and pushed him onto the floor.
(The floor was grass, I wasn’t actually trying to hurt him)

He fell and started to cry. 

I crouched by him and tried to make him laugh and profusely apologised to him.

I feel like shit as he’s a really nice guy.

By “urge” I mean my arms will feel some sort of sensation, and I’ll get a boost of energy."
840,Why do I feel like I have so many serious health/medical issues?,"I am 15. weigh 200lbs and I an a male (I am fat and am going to lose weight).For some reason, I feel so scared that I have really bad health/medical issues like a brain tumour or heart disease. I search my symptoms and it only seems to make to make it worse. I feel like I won’t live past 20 yet I know I will. Its really hard to describe. 

I figured that this is the best place to put this as its sounds like more of an anxiety problem than an actual physical problem.

I figured it may help if I added my age, weight and gender. Let me know if I’m wrong.

Don’t worry about being “too harsh” about my weight. I’m going to be healthy by this time next year! (I hope)."
841,My friend has anorexia and the only way I can contact them is via text. Is there anything else I can do to help?,"My friend was recently put into a hospital and diagnosed with anorexia. I can only text them, but I want to help. I told them that they can always talk to me if they need to, but I honestly don't know if that's enough. I can't visit them in the hospital for semi-obvious reasons. Is there something else I can do?"
842,Should I seek out further diagnosis/change meds/try going to therapy again?,"(21F) I've only just calmed down from a panic attack which lasted around 45 mins consisting of sudden outbursts, me calming down then freaking out again, feeling numb, going back and forth then silently crying. I rock back and forth to comfort myself, squeeze my eyes tight and hold my head. I walk about for a bit, curling into myself then sit down and breathe heavy to calm myself.

I keep thinking there's something else wrong with me. I've been diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression but it feels deeper than that? I also experience extreme derealisation (24/7) and I'm believing more and more that nothing is real it's all in my head, I feel heavily suicidal sometimes and I thought it was gone but I feel worse again

I also don't see things clearly if that makes sense?? Like I feel as though I daydream constantly, I see things in front of me but not CLEARLY. I feel so far in my head it's so hard to concentrate

I've done a few online tests for schitzophrenia, BPD, autism etc (I'm not self-diagnosing I'm just trying to figure out my mind), and I'm probably just overthinking it as I've been called a hypochondriact but I don't think I am ok

846,I'm So Frustrated With Myself,"I'm so upset with myself right now and I need to let it out.

I have been a procrastinator my whole life. It's really screwed me over. I'm in my mid-twenties now and I'm still suffering from mental health issues but I've pushed off seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist because, as mentioned above, I procrastinate for everything in my life.

Recently, my mother had enough and called a psychologist for me and told me I had to go. I was furious. After sitting for a while though, I realized I wasn't mad at her, I was mad at myself for not making the call I **knew** I had to make. I was (still am) mad at myself for being so dependent at my age. My friends are married and I have to have mommy call the doctors for me.

That was around two months ago. Since then, me and my therapist have made some great strides in getting my life on track. We came to the conclusion that I need to see a psychiatrist. I've always known I have untreated ADD. My parents are foreigners who are against any medication unless it's life threatening so I never got treated for it, making me suffer through my whole schooling experience. He also said I am showing signs of depression. He said the D word. That's taboo in my culture. Medication is a bigger taboo. We discussed and decided that my life can only get better than what it is now, so I might as well do it. My therapist says it will help me a lot! I'm kind of excited at the prospect of not being as miserable as I am now.

After being told that, what do you think I did??? I procrastinated **AGAIN!!!** Why? Because screw me that's why. 

After waiting ages and enlisting my older brother to be on top of me, I finally make the call. The next appointment they have available is in a month and a half. Awesome! Finally on my way to fixing my issues.

My appointment was yesterday in the morning at 9:30. I have an alarm for 7:30 that I use for work. I wake up and realize that I woke up *way too early* for my appointment and go back to sleep. I wake up an hour later. The doctor is 17 minutes away from my house. That means I have to leave the house by 9:10 and I should be fine. Decide for some reason to take a shower even though I already took a shower the night before. The crap+shower lasts until 9:00. Since I didn't prepare (see above where I said I procrastinate) I had to search for my insurance card to make sure I bring it. That's until 9:15. Finally get to the doctors office around 9:26 and I need to park. Their parking lot charges **$30:00** for freaking parking. My cheap a$$ says hell no and look for parking around the area. I finally find parking at 9:45. I call my doctor on my way to the office RUNNING. 

It's too late. 

They wont see me. 

I have to reschedule for an appointment in a month from now. I have to wait another month.

Why did I have to wake up too late. Why did I have to take forever to get ready even though I knew I was in a rush? I was at the finish line, why did I have to shoot myself in the leg?? Why am I like this? Why do I do this to myself? 

TDLR: F\*ck my life"
847,Looking For Advice for Healthy Coping for Fall/Winter Depression,"Hi this is my first post here I’m writing on mobile so I apologize if the format isn’t great.
I (21F) recently stopped smoking weed after using it to cope with depression for 2 and a half years of almost everyday use. I have been trying to come up with healthy coping and distractions as the fall is coming and I usually fall into seasonal depression also due to some hard memories that took place in the Fall and Winter. 
I have nothing against weed smokers or anyone who uses it everyday whether it’s for coping or just recreational fun. For me though, I quit after a few really paranoid highs that I had. I never had those feelings before until probably July this year and I haven’t smoked since the beginning of August probably. I tried smaller amounts here and there and in different surroundings but it really just doesn’t do what it used to do to help me. I’ve spoken with my therapist and she has recommended a medical card so that I may find a strain that is perfect for me and I do believe that’s possible, but for right now because I quit after doing it nonstop for 2+ years, I don’t think getting that perfect strain and continuing is in my best interest at the moment. 
Fall is kind of hard for me. September kicks it off by having the birthday’s of two of my friends who passed away too young. One (E) was due to a situation influenced by alcohol, and one (B) was actually an overdose on fentanyl. B actually also overdosed on christmas eve two years ago, and I got the call while I was at work, it absolutely destroyed me as I had reconnected with him one month prior after we didn’t get along for almost 3 years. The last thing he ever said to me was that he had to hurry and leave because he needed to go meet his dealer. The place I worked also matters because I was working in the same place, same room when I got the call that my grandmother had passed away. To me it all just connects. September is also the anniversary of my friend’s family member who died in a tragic accident also way too young. This year I received a hoodie for him, but it still fucks with me because I drive the road he died on every single day to get to work. 
Right now my mom is having health issues, and my other grandma is in the hospital with horrible cancer. I also have outside influences bothering me such as a family member’s ex girlfriend who has been harassing my family for months, as well as someone who did something really awful to me who got a court ordered protective order on me when I spoke out about it. Fall is also one of the hardest times because I used to work for 2 different haunted houses when I was younger, one of these was protecting a pedophile who assaulted multiple friends I had. Seeing these come up in my social media memories with photos of him before we knew absolutely sucks. The cold air reminds me of standing around the bonfire with all of these shitty people at the haunted house, and how I wish I would’ve never even gone there. These things really have had an impact on me and I’m trying so hard to not let them into my mind as I have acknowledged the deaths, and the court situation and have done my best to accept what has happened and moved on. I have an amazing fiancé but she works 5 days a week until night time most days. I also have two cats who I love every much. I am not suicidal and don’t have thoughts of hurting myself, It’s more so that when I get home after working all day, I often find myself laying on my couch thinking about these things. 
 
I am looking for some new hobby ideas, possibly some funny movies or shows to watch. Ideas of how to distract myself from these bad memories and feelings. I’ve been spending time watching Avatar the Last Airbender but finished it, and I’m about to finish the Legend of Korra so I’d love some ideas for similar shows or movies as those make me really happy. I also really enjoy video games, I play Skyrim and the Sims 4 a lot while my cats cuddle next to me. I think I’m really just trying to (pre)prepare myself for the feelings that come back this time of year every year. And with Covid, it’s hard to go be around my friends and go out and do things. If you guys have some ideas or advice for me that would be so helpful. 

TL;DR I’m worried that my seasonal depression is going to come back very bad this year due to past memories and traumas and want advice and ideas on how to distract myself and cope. 

Thank you guys in advance ❤️"
848,don’t want to be here anymore,"i’ve been psychiatrically disabled since childhood (legally designated on entering adulthood). all signs point to the likelihood that my life will continue to like this, as i have had the same basic set of symptoms increasing in severity with every successive year since the age of 5. i also am diagnosed with BPD, which rolls together into my anorexia/bulimia diagnoses, and those two set the stage for the panic attacks and dissociation to get really bad, which then sets up self-harming behaviors (cutting, hitting, burning, etc.) just so i can feel anything. after that whole roughly-linear cycle has occurred once, i usually have a resulting depressive episode, replete with loaded-gun-in-mouth suicidal gestures (though they may fall more under the category of rehearsals, as the majority of the time they occurred i would not let anyone know after.) which then sends me back into hopelessness, thereby starting the cycle over again. in addition to that whole thing, i also don’t leave the house for fear of being assaulted again. aside from being severely mentally ill, i’m transgender (MtF, and let me tell you what a joy that’s been...) 

a couple of years ago, i was physically assaulted in an experience which everyone to whom i’ve described it has reflected back to me was a hate crime (i didn’t report it to the police or anyone. i went home and sobbed, it literally didn’t even occur to me that i should report it.) PTSD dx with the other things.

also diagnosed with TBI from the literally dozens of concussions i’ve given myself over the years, because while i’ve been beaten up (and also raped by a former partner) due to being queer and physically not intimidating, i have somewhat ironically never thrown a punch or hit anyone. except myself, i’m the only one who’s not off-limits. i’m the only safe target, both ethically and practically.

everything is just too hard. my life looks like a hole. reading is too hard. playing video games is too hard, let alone doing the more challenging things that i really used to enjoy like hiking and playing music. eating hurts, like it causes my stomach severe, 8 or 9 out of 10 pain. to the point it has made me pass out or have consciousness fade more than once. from things like salads, or simple sandwiches or rice bowls. literally anything. restricting and bingeing and purging ruined my stomach. it’s hard to stay above underweight and all my efforts to do so result in the aforementioned type of pain.

i don’t really believe i’m justified at all in wanting to die. but everything hurts emotionally all the time to a level that feels constantly unbearable and impossible to ignore. it has for almost 25 years — i’ll be 30 next June. it’s prevented me from having almost any kind of a life at all.

it was always hard but since the assault it’s just become impossible. i’m unable to work or participate in life (i’ve volunteered quite a bit in the past with some organizations that helped drug addicts/alcoholics and also briefly with some that specialized in recycling building supplies, and that type of work is literally the best thing for me. but since two years ago, my symptoms have become too severe and i run the risk of having a full on panic attack or psychotic episode in public.) i can usually bring myself to at least play video games in the first half of the day, but the constantly swirling thoughts of needing to die just get exhausting. usually at this point i’m in bed crying or just dissociated much of the day. smoking a lot of weed, cigarettes. half hoping the smoking gives me a blood clot due to the estrogen so i can just be spared having to struggle with the decision.

tried getting professional help this summer. went to a treatment center for eating disorders and dual-diagnosis mental health issues. they assured me they were super trans friendly and my pronouns wouldn’t be a problem. turned out i was misgendered a dozen times by their staff in the first three days. it was fairly traumatic, considering the main thing driving my self-destructive compulsions at this point is the fact that i *don’t* pass well and that i was targeted for physical violence specifically because i’ve had such a difficult time transitioning — i started late even though i knew before i was even in 1st grade. (did i mention my mom literally laughed in my face and said “no you’re not!” when i told her i was bisexual as a 12 year old? or that my mom and dad kicked me out of the house with 4 hours’ notice when i told them i couldn’t suppress my need to transition anymore?) i don’t pass because my parents are bigots. i was socialized as a male and all the signs of being trans as early as age 3-4, like wearing my mom’s dresses, all got ignored. instead of being helped with transitioning or at least accepted for who i was, i was literally sent to a Freudian, queer-hating therapist who explained to me in front of my parents that my interest in wearing women’s clothing made me a fetishist and a pervert. some trans kids get supportive parents. some of us get... whatever the fuck you’d call what i experienced. i couldn’t even accept that i was trans until i was 26, and i didn’t start E until 27. and then i stopped because 9 months into it a guy came up to me while i was waiting at the bus stop with my groceries and pulled a Clockwork Orange on me, complete with terrifying “are you
scared?” before he started beating the shit out of me.

i honestly just want out. i called the mental health hotline in my area a bunch of times. told them i was basically practicing to kill myself with my gun. they said that because i didn’t have a plan, i wouldn’t qualify for admittance. which... like... i literally don’t even know what to say to that. maybe just fuck Oregon’s healthcare system. i had the dang thing in my mouth again last night. and don’t think it’s the gun — before i got a gun, it was nooses. cutting my arm open. driving my car head-on into a tree going 65. taking 40 xanax. every time i miraculously survived. like... the paramedics at the crash site said they’d never seen a crash that bad without blood everywhere. i walked away with a simple ankle fracture and some cuts and bruises. so i finally said “fuck it, next time i’d really like it to work” and got the gun. #america.

i’m actually not committed to suicide. it may sound like it just because i’m forced to live with these thoughts so many hours every single day. but I actually gave the trigger lock keys to my partner last night. i’m really trying to be responsible. that’s why i tried getting help. just... the help didn’t help. nothing has helped, and i’ve tried everything short of ECT (which has been recommended to me several times over the years.)

anyone with some advice? sympathy? kind words? ideas for attainable/low-cost bucket list items? sorry to waste your time. please don’t judge me too harshly."

850,Fuck everything and everyone,"I had some problems in the past. I mostly left them behind, but sometimes ""my brain isn't very nice to me"".

Let's just say it like that: One moment I'm fine, talking to friends and family. The next I get a bad feeling, have to get air and can't talk to anyone. Or even worse. I just loose all sympathy with everyone and I get really really angry.

And for those who say: why's that venting?
BC I'm just going to rant stuff that mostly doesnt fit togheter. So fuck it.

Sometimes I just hate everything and everyone, like fuck it. If you piss me off just a little bit more, I might gonna break your nose.

851,"I can't bring myself to attend online classes, and that makes me feel miserable","I don't know how to explain this, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.
I haven't been able to attend normal classes regularly since the start of high school (2016?).
I've always studied by myself at home as my school allows me to do so with my psychiatrist's diagnosis/certificate (idk, I'm not a native English speaker and I can't think straight right now).
Tbh I don't feel like I'm privileged, and that's totally fine with as I would hate to be more special than my classmates. But I do feel like I get treated unfairly by some of my teachers sometimes... For example, I got a bad grade by my Literature teacher even though I had studied really really hard for that exam. Of course, I didn't expect a 10/10 or anything like that, really.. But a 5/10 was just unfair imo, as my teacher had given the same grade to another student in the past who had completely frozen up during an oral exam, and refused to answer any questions about the test. But I digress...
I can't attend online classes, physically and emotionally. It's too much. Every time I think about it, I get nauseous, my heart rate becomes fast, my throat tightens up and it feels like I can't breathe.
I haven't attended one single online class yet and I can't picture myself doing it as the thought makes me want to hurt myself.
And when I try to picture it, I can only compare the feeling to claustrophobia.
I feel trapped within the four walls of my room, and I can't move. I can't escape. It's dark and cold. I'm lonely but not alone. Everybody is judging me.
I know that it's all in my head but it's greatly affecting my everyday mood.
My meds seem to not to be working anymore, if they ever did..."

I can sit for long periods of times with envious thoughts about other people who, on the surface level, seem to have it better than me.

I sound pretty terrible (I sure do imo) and I want to escape these thought patterns. I've tried to make gratitude lists but it doesn't seem to work.

854,Having a strong to go wilderness and become no one.,"Hi everyone, whenever I get close to some ""smart"" device my brain, my rhythm gets fucked up. I cannot function and do any of my responsibilities. The problem is I am a CS student.

I'm currently living alone and I have no family and this covid thing distanced me from my (new) friends. I was working to build a new life instead I have become an Internet addict.

I cannot function, I cannot bring order to my life. All I want is go to nature but my brain is hell of a busy with school while doing other stupid stuff creating this meaningless stress loop.

I really need a eli5 guide, I don't know wtf. is happening and why I cannot handle this addiction.

Any advice will be much appreciated"

856,I didn't let my anxiety and obsessive thoughts control me this time.,"I pretty mentally fragile which I hate and does effect me terribly sometimes. Anxiety,depression,obsessive/addictive (ocd?), hypochondria, and just being overly sensitive. This I got anxious over someone's opinion on something I like and wanted to check everything I could about them. But I didn't! I just let it go and moved. It was pretty hard though but hopefully i'll forget about it soon."
857,Hey :),[removed]
858,I've decided to get an appointment,"I have finally built up enough courage to book an appointment with my GP, I'm still worried. I dont know how a first appointment works or what I do but, I'm hoping to get it verified for next fortnight.

I'm just terrified... Is that normal?

Am I being unreasonable?

I dunno, I just needed to vent a tiny bit. Thanks for reading anyway, to the first step of my journey."
859,My brother googled he wants to kill me,"I’m 22F, and he’s 14.

So I’ll admit, right off the bat, I shouldn’t have been snooping on his phone. And I wouldn’t say I was snooping, but I guess it qualifies as that. Im not going into details, but he said something was possible that I firmly believe is not. I didn’t know where my phone was, so I grabbed his, knowing the password, and Safari was already open. Are you openly acknowledge this is wrong. However, I do also know that, without this snooping, my family would not have discovered what I found. In the search bar, he had typed Are you openly acknowledge this is wrong. However, I do also know that, without this snooping, my family would not have discovered what I found. In the search bar, he had typed “I want to kill my sister.” Naturally, I was immediately alarmed and confronted him. He made something up about it being related to a meeting, so I asked him to show me. He scrolled for a good while and gave me some unrelated white chicks meme. I saw right through it, and ask him to give it to me straight. He immediately started hyperventilating in saying he has depression. I myself suffer from depression and anxiety among other things, and my family has never seen nor heard about this or any signs of this. This was all a lot to take in a very short amount of time. I didn’t react well. My parents are currently mad at me for reacting antagonistically. I’ll admit, I got carried away and jumped the gun, saying things like how I don’t feel safe in the house. I have some very disturbing intrusive thoughts, but I’ve never dealt with anything like this. This is very out of the blue.

Right now, I don’t know what to do. I openly see a therapist, and mental health isn’t taboo at all in my home. My mom used to be a therapist. I recognize now I’m probably not in danger. He’s a little bit of an odd kid. He’s very much into theater, has mostly female friends, and keeps to himself in the house, mostly playing computer games. None of these are really odd attributes, but I know he’s a little different. That said, I need help understanding this. I left house to walk for a while to cool off, and I don’t know what to expect when I get back. I’m sure I’m safe, but this was honestly alarming. My parents are also concerned, but they were more down my throat about snooping and jumping to conclusions and freaking out. I don’t know what to make of all this. Maybe just some new perspective would help."
860,Why can’t I laugh anymore?,I used to laugh a lot when I was younger but now I am 24 and rarely things make me laugh. I used to be able to laugh at myself and life and being all gay but I can’t do anything anymore. Do I have an underlying depression? I thought maybe it’s because I don’t like my smile that’s why I don’t laugh but I feel like there’s something deeper to it.
861,I'm pretty sure that nobody wants me here,"I live in a house with 5 people. All of these people I consider friends but I'm not particularly close to any of them. One of them is my ex who I'm still occasionally sleeping with and another is his childhood friend who he occasionally sleeps with. All in all, its a hard situation because I have to navigate seeing her going into his room and coming out at night but on top of that, I'm pretty sure that nobody would be upset if I decided to move out. I think a lot of them would actually be relieved. 

Now, I'm not saying that these people hate me. I just know that nobody ever asks me to do anything with them. Nobody asks me how my day was unless I ask them first. A lot of them have said that I'm making my ex's depression worse by being around him. He says he's ok with me here and I for the most part like our arrangement but I can't seem to shake the overwhelming loneliness that I constantly feel. I have nobody of my own, no friends just to myself. Nobody has the same interests and I can exist in my room for hours without anyone blinking an eye. Nobody asks for my company and I constantly feel like I'm forcing them to do things when I ask for theirs. I just want someone to be excited for my presence. I want to not feel like I'm constantly bugging people and begging them to interact with me."
862,Buspar only?,"Has anyone ever just taken buspar for anxiety? I'm currently on 7.5 mg of buspar, twice a day with 150 mg of wellbutrin. Buspar was added to the Wellbutrin a couple weeks ago. I've been on Wellbutrin for a month and a half and my anxiety is at an all time high. I keep hoping it will get better, but it hasn't seemed to. I've read that Wellbutrin can increase anxiety so my thought was getting rid of the Wellbutrin and staying on Buspar? I didnt really feel depressed when I started wellbutrin- just anxious about literally everything. I might switch back to Zoloft even though it absolutely kills my sex drive, but if it helps me feel better -- it seems like an appropriate trade off. Will I need to taper off Wellbutrin since I've only been on it for a month and a half?  Thanks for the help!"
863,"Feeling down, need to get this out.","So I’ve always had issues with anxiety and depression ever since I was a kid. I tried medicine(busprar) for awhile but was not a fan so I’ve basically just kind of been dealing with the random mood swings that pop up when things get real hard.

It seems to have gotten quite a bit worse with the birth of my son around 2 years ago... stuff that would stress me out before on maybe a 3/10 is now almost always a 10/10... and lately it seems like I’m having very rough days just out of the blue...

Out of the blue as in I’ll got days without feeling this way then one day I’ll just be fixated on it. The worst part about all of this is I feel like I have absolutely nowhere to turn to with these thoughts and feelings because my wife has a lot of stuff going on... my dads brother killed himself, I don’t want to worry my mom, and I can’t post in one of these reddit or Facebook groups without worrying if someone is gonna report my stuff and end with a wellness check or something.

I just need to vent bro’s, shit has been feeling really rocky lately and I don’t know how to stop feeling this way, driving me insane."

I am only 21 years old, and while I have had stressful, demanding roles prior to where I am now, this one is the hardest to manage. I joined the United States Air Force 3 years ago, right before I turned 19 years old. When I was still underage, I was caught drinking and was immediately disciplined. I was told it would not ruin my career, and so far it looks like they were telling me the truth, however I am not exactly going to roll the dice and find out the hard way that I was wrong. For context's sake I will elaborate about. In my line of work, you test every couple of years for the next rank, following your performance report. Your performance report can obviously weight you very heavily upward, or downward. I working the hardest I possibly can, I am grinding for an upward pointing performance report, and then I am going to study like my life depends on it. It is safe to say I want this, however I feel like that I spend so much time just trying to manage my time that I cannot enjoy the little downtime I get at night, it feels like the whole purpose is defeated, and it is driving me mad."

870,Suffering,Anxiety
871,Started new antidepressants and they’ve only made me angrier at life,"I (19F) recently started Mirtazapine 15mg and they’ve been doing their thing, side effects mostly.

They’re a black box prescription, so I’m not at all surprised the side effects have come on. I mentally don’t feel better in any way, they’ve made me resent being alive at all. I feel like I’m gaining weight to my already full-figure, which has made me feel more disgusting. I also get frustrated when my family does so much as have conversations with me.

I live with my mom, her BD, and my two younger siblings. I’m unable to move out for both financial and mental health reasons, and that thought makes me feel worse about myself. I feel stupid for not having a job anymore. I can’t mentally bring myself to acquire one due to the pandemic in fear that I will spread it to others. I know I can’t really control those concerns I have, but my oldest younger sibling (13M) picks me apart for it, making fun of my mental illnesses daily. It deteriorates my mood for the day and makes me feel terrible. My mother’s only advice is “Just ignore it and don’t bring it up”. I very seldom talk about it, and other times, he just somehow suddenly makes it the main topic of any random conversation. I also can’t just ignore it as it’s been ingrained in my mind that I’m worthless for it.

My antidepressants make me scream inside when any of this happens. I just want to run away and die. I can’t take being around my mother anymore, either. Being an adult living with a parent is easier said than done, and I learned that immediately when I turned 18, even though it was definitely difficult before that. I don’t have my father or any father figure in my life, so moving in with one is out of the question.

I gained 100lbs since I dropped out of high school in 2017 due to heavy depression and am haunted by it. I can’t go in public, not even to the grocery store. I have fears that old classmates will see me and how much weight I’ve gained and just forever now view me that way. I was quite small in high school.

Idk, kinda random and all over the place, but I just feel like shit. I have a therapist and psychiatrist, so they know how regular this is for me, but it’s hitting pretty hard today."
872,I just heard this amazing thing about toxic positivity,"&gt;We define toxic positivity as the excessive and ineffective overgeneralization of a happy, optimistic state across all situations. The process of toxic positivity results in the denial, minimization, and invalidation of the authentic human emotional experience.\*

It's so easy to feel like you have a problem or you're broken or you're doing something wrong when you're not happy. Like it's your fault and it's not ok. Learning about the concept of toxic positivity helped a bit, but this interaction I heard just sort of blew my mind wide open:

Somebody asked a singer I like how he ""finds time to be happy when he's constantly singing songs that need so much sad emotion."" This was his answer:

“I’m not very happy to be honest with you, but I think that happiness is this destination that we’re taught is so important. I think that happiness is great, and is nice and it’s good to have moments of happiness and joy. **\[But\] I think the constant pursuit of happiness teaches us that when you’re not happy, you’re wrong, and you’re not wrong, you’re just alive.**”

It didn't solve my problems or make my depression go away, but it did make me feel a little bit better. Sometimes (often) I'm not happy, and that's ok.

873,ANYONE A THERAPIST OR CAN HELP?,"NEED A THERAPIST , Help

Hello 21m here, i have been zoning out alot, feel numb and not engaged . Don't have a therapist near my region. I have been dealing with anxiety/ stress/ disassociation/ i left weed 1/2 years ago which triggered my anxiety. Right now, i feel disassociated / numb, idk if its depression or something else. Went through a rough breakup  for a month, patched up a week ago but i feel like this

Really need someone to talk to, if anyone's a therapist/ qualified or could help, please step up and provideme a few mins of your time. Thankyou"
874,HELP!,"HELP ME OUT!

What is this feeling? Can someone explain, Help?

Hey guys 21 m here help me out

Can someone explain me what this is, 

I feel on autopilot all the time for the past 10-20 days. I don't feel anything much. I do feel really depressed or my emotions suppressed,  I sometimes  feel like what's happening around me feels so unreal or just weird. Like i'll be laughing and talking but in within a moment i feel numb. 

But more importantly this feeling is what I don't understand, i am zoned out alot, i am doing things normally and suddenly realise i have been zoned out or i feel like i just got out of zoning out, and before i know it i am  again zoning out, like it happens constantly i guess, even right now maybe

And this feeling like I'm talking to someone, (i can hardly keep up the convo, I've noticed i forget things while I'm speaking in a long sentence) . So i'm talking to someone, normally it appears normal , maybe cause I'm speaking in autopilot, and after speaking I walk away  and when i think or look back , I'm like did i just have the convo? Felt so weird, like did i or not? I clearly remember i did, but I don't feel it, and this is not just with talking to people but with everything else. Like i drive which suddenly feels  overwhelming and I suddenly reach my destination,  or even the smallest things, like I'm in the washroom doing my business i come out and sit and feel like did i just go or not? Like i did go, but it feels weird like I didn't feel it

GUYS PLEASE HELP ME EXPLAIN THIS I HAVE BEEN FEELING THIS FOR THE LAST 10-20 days. 

I had a breakup for month which was really stressful, i was in a toxic relationship where we fought physically too but always made up, holding on to the breakup was painful cause i kept going to her and got rejected so came home feeling numb couple of times. And cried alot too, didn't sleep properly for a week(4/5 hours) , which actually triggered this , and i had left weed, 1/2 years ago which triggered a bit of anxiety. I have patched up now and things are great but i've been experiencing this and feel totally numb even around her. which is really disappointing cause I don't feel engaged i want to engage. I don't feel engaged with my environment too, things get slightly better for a few hours and really foggy or disoriented at times. 

PLEASE HELP ME OUT GUYS"
875,My voice keeps reminding me of what I forgot,"This has happened me a lot for the past year or so. It's a bit worrying but also really helpful and practical. I've googled a bit but didn't find anything. 

So, for instance, I walk into a room and forget what I was going to do. Classic. But then I unknowingly  say ""phone"" to myself, and after a few seconds I remember that I was going to charge my phone. 

What the hell is that? This happens pretty often. Never sentences, only keywords, but always spot on. Every time I, kind of jokingly, say ""thank you"" because it seriously feels like another person is speaking through my mouth. 

Am I going schizophrenic or something? It's not like I'm hearing voices, having grand delusions, etc. 

Could it be a left/right hemisphere thing? Anybody else having this?

I have bipolar II by the way. Might be useful information :)"
876,Can anyone relate to these experiences that I’ve struggled with most of my life but can’t classify?,"I (30 f) struggled a lot all my life and been given different answers by various doctors. So I was wondering if someone could relate to these experiences and that has been diagnosed.

• Socially awkward all my life- after age 20 lost the ability to make new friends or retain old ones. While many friends have naturally forgotten me I still have a lot of love for all of them, even people that were my friends 10-15 years ago. My brain just doesn’t get the concept of ‘keeping in touch’.

• Suffered from severe depression and full blown anxiety attacks between ages 16-23. At 23 I got medication for some months that pulled me out of the dark period.

• I have undertaken many tough challenges study and career wise because I like learning which has led to great career and financial growth. However, the anxiety I have faced in each of these endeavors has been debilitating. And people have been largely unforgiving because they mistake my severe anxiety (not making eye contact, not saying hello, not socializing, isolating myself) as being snooty.

• I have always enjoyed doing and learning new things alone (reading about various subjects, learning a new language, playing music, drawing). I’m not super intelligent by any means. I just like exploring different things and never stick to just one thing, I’m always dabbling and jumping around).

• I also shift around in my seat a lot and can’t sit easy during meetings and it’s hard to form sentences without branching into a hundred directions before coming to the main point.

In 2013 I was diagnosed with BPD. In 2019-20 when I did therapy for a year for work anxiety, my therapist said I didn’t show any BPD symptoms.
I suspect anxiety and ADHD but my therapist or psychiatrist never delved into this.

It’s hard to understand myself and my life sometimes. Would love to see if any of this sounds relatable to someone."

879,Close to losing it and cutting again.,"Dear Reddit,  iim currently going through a really nasty break up where he (m25) had blocked me on everything (f29). He spent most of the relationship being clingy and loving and then it switched one day. Just like a fuse blew and he was cold and mean and would snap at me for the smallest things. He told me there's was nothing good about me and that I'm a try hard, selfish, fake, a liar etc...   after telling me he doesn't know how he feels and treating me like a stranger for 2 days while my grandfather was in hospital and going downhill, I told him it was over and the first words out of his mouth were ""really, your doing this to me now after I said I'd stay with you"", I hung up on him. I've been depressed for a fee months because of him.  I messaged  a week later on Tuesday to ask if we could talk things out because No wanted some closure So I could move on and he told me to njot try and get him back and told me he was fine with it. He was so cruel. Now all that's going on in my head is that I should have tried harder and not broken up with him. My chance for happiness is gone forever. I messed up so badly and it's all my fault. I'm not coping at all. I want to cry all the time. I want to start cutting again just to get a little relief. I'm so desperate.. I can't stop thinking how much I wish I hadn't have left him. Maybe things would have been different if I tried harder. I am in a really bad place right now and if anyone has some advice on coping then I'd be grateful.   I also have OCD,bpd, depression and anxiety. Currently laying in bed wishing I would die.

880,I might have different personas ?,"I always had little to big problems but my responses always been different. I thought i was usual like everyone, turns out i am not. My family is scared of me by jokes they’re reminding me stuff i did but don’t really remember such as stabbing my arm with a pencil,every night sleeping with a butcher knife,almost making my brother blind...But lately i started to notice my own reactions. All of my behaviours are extreme I started to think I developed different personalities i can count four for now. Sometimes i am super sweet,positive,feminine, emotional also have high empathy. In other hand i turn into dominant female like imposing my thoughts,leader,successful but less emotions with less empathy. Then there’s a manly figure lacks feminine behaviours usually dominant, cold but keeps an eye on the girls even my clothing style changes this times I don’t feel a lot emotion but i feel high urge to impress the woman around me. And last behaviours i have is basically fucked up. My ego goes high to the point where i believe i can destroy anything. This behaviours comes up with: Zero empathy, lacks emotions even sadness and anger, ambitious, dangerous,defensive,protective towards myself but enjoys a lot like always happy and careless. In these situations i am afraid i can murder someone and just walk away. These are the ones i can count for now. Why i believe i am developing personas? Well after doing something either nice or bad when my other behaviour kicks in i am getting angry or depressed and some of my sides hate the others or trying to protect others. I don’t know what to do i am afraid of medication, i am afraid of losing the emotions i live through them but i am afraid of the host being either a weakling or a psychopath. I used to think i was mad but i am fitting in society perfectly. I don’t know what to do or how to start. I am suffering and getting more and more dangerous as i keep hatred towards someone.

Please. If your feeling down, find a friend, find a person you can talk to. But I guess remember we all have our moments and try to hang on  till tomorrow and it's a new day.

I'm also trapped in this situation I'm currently in which facilitates the abuse having to live with my abuser for a desperate reason.

What the hell is going on with me?! A sudden conversion reaction? I am having issues with locus of control probably. 

My question is since I can't reach out to any psychology professionals IRL at the moment due to my home situation and COVID is there any way I can work on reducing this stutter myself? What is the crux of working on it- just trying to keep things as low stress as I can?

I can tell my depression is getting bad again because I'm spending endless hours on social media, thinking about SI, and dissociating but my biggest indication is that I'm sleeping way too much again.

My alarm usually goes off at 7am but I always go back to sleep and before I know it, it's 1pm. Then I can barely make it past 10pm. I'm still pretty functional and I want to do things and get things done even though I don't feel fulfilled and am mainly operating on autopilot.

891,A theory that drives me crazy,"In struggling with addiction and mental health I've noticed a pattern. I always go back to the need to feel satisfaction. 

I usually wake up every morning and go, ""There's no way today is going to be a good day unless I ....."" or ""I have to do..... to feel okay today.""

Today I made a theory. Everyone lives their life on a schedule right? It could be pretty basic—sleep, work, repeat. But what if I said that people who do what I do and struggle to stay alive and battle addiction see right through that? In my head, my day can't be normal without breaking routine. Maybe all this time I've been trying to escape the routine but I didn't know how to show it. I expressed it through addictions and mental instability. 

To take that a step further- I believe the reason I was suicidal was because I was tired of the routine and I couldn't live the routine anymore. And somewhere somehow- someone is playing mindgames on us (I'll let you be the judge of that.) 

If I continue these battles with myself then I dont know how much longer I can be here. 

Look I'm not trying to glorify suicide or addiction in any way. I'm just trying to express an idea so please don't twist my words."

893,extreme anti social traits in egypt?,"** put in mind that this is a long ass post and my wording maybe be completely straight to the point because language gaps may differ, I live in Egypt, but would REALLY appreciate opinions and thoughts on this, basically, shit became heavy ** 





The thought of becoming someone I always knew was the true me is a scary one, I genuinely tried to change what I knew for a fact was deep down, I hate stupidity the most, I never truly cared about anyone’s feelings unless it’s for a benefit that’s coming afterwards, and even that is just for show
 



I come from a relatively “high social statued” family, but I never really cared about a specific person’s status, all I “cared” about is a person’s ability to think, even if its “limited” due to whatever circumstances they’ve been living through, but their the ability to be able to freely think has got nothing to do with whatever “education” or school you’ve gone to
 



I never shredded a genuine tear towards anyone, I only cared about myself, I had close people dying, but never really felt sad
 



I had an extremely weird childhood, I’m used to be attracted into physically hurting anything, I didn’t have the concept of getting hurt back, and when that “concept” was carved into my, at that time small mind, I started using my brain a little, and made sure I wouldn’t get hurt back whenever I hurt whatever living being there is
 



I always was able to differentiate what was right and what was wrong, but never at that time was able to tell why, I just knew that I’d get “punished” if I did anything wrong, so I had to always act up good in order to get what I wanted, and always had to avoid whatever was considered wrong in order to steer away from unnecessary trouble
 



Grew up a little and started to get curious about the human psychology, body language, eyes, voice tone, and basically everything along those lines, loved and really enjoyed acting up depending on how you’re feeling and could easily make you subconsciously uncomfortable, scared, or loved, depending on what benefit I’m getting out of you
 



Started abusing drugs since a really young age, I basically tried everything, and even most of the really uncommon drugs, and started mixing a shit ton of medicine even, went to a dozen rehab centers, was always diagnosed as merely being an addict and antisocial, my family and especially parents, are not even able to comprehend what personality disorders are, so they basically self-diagnosed me as autistic, using the simplest terms ever due to their “limited” knowledge of mental illnesses and personality disorders, and I’m far as an autistic person is, I always enjoyed being social but it always depends on what benefit that comes with it, the thrill of being wholesome is basically a feeling I literally can’t get enough of, I feel that way by exploiting whatever your body language indicates
 



currently, I don’t particularly enjoy physically hurting someone, but I have no problems with it either, and I wouldn’t really do it because then, law enforcement would be involved, basically I just to try stray away from that, I wouldn’t really call you out by swearing, I basically only enjoy dismantling someone’s mental state by showing how obviously “superior” I am by wording out what your thoughts are, I can easily get the “higher ground” no matter who you are, never really met anyone who’s actually able to escape from such manipulative schemes, I started doing it for fun even, not just for the benefit coming afterwards, I build up lies and actually, its become relatively easy to be able to keep up with the lies built, and remember whom I told this specific lie to even, I just love to see how different people would react to different “colors” and personalities I have on stock, I can easily change colors depending on who you are, but I always am one step above
 



I tried to keep myself of thinking that I’m psychopathic, because I always found people assuming they are, are actually infuriating and downright cringe worthy, also straight up calling myself that, “cringes” me down to my damn spine, so I literally tried myself stay away from such thought
 



And one of them reasons that kept me holding myself up of such thought is that, there was this just one time that I actually fell in love, and we were together for 3 years approx, and when we broke up, I hated it, cause injustice was involved, family related issues due to the fact we both are Egyptians and live in the middle east, during that point, I always thought I hated it because we broke up and basically we both were in love, but when I deeply think about it, all I despised was the fact that it was completely unfair, breaking up cause of family related issues, yes I cheated, and sometimes got intoxicated and shit talked her, but the fact such “injustice” was involved makes me absolutely detest such ways of thinking, I already realize cheating and unnecessary shit talking is wrong, but I basically can’t even truly feel it (even currently as I am sober), and when I even deeply think about it even more, I only loved the affection given to me by her, not her personally, I really loved the attention given to me by someone who I knew for a fact absolutely adores me, I wanted to give her the world, basically so merely I can continue on feeling such “wholesomeness”
 



Nothing I hate more than stupidity, and if there was a way to handle whatever shit, I’ll do that, I’ll automatically label you as dumb if you’ve done little to no thinking towards basically anything you’ll be doing, and that literally gives me a push to act up and get whatever benefit I can from you and completely exploit you (those thoughts and acts come to me smoothly and completely natural), ill most definitely really enjoy dismantling your very mental state, by showing how much “better” I am, as long as I’m not breaking laws and not doing stupid shit that would label me as irrational then anything ethical could go out the window
 



I always hated the fact I’d personally call myself smart, or even subconsciously thinking so, cause that just “gives off” those anti social traits I have if that makes sense anyways (despised the fact I’d call myself smart cuz it cringes me), also really despised whatever and whoever is “cringeworthy”, especially those acting like they’ve got mental problems and act upon that fact, I’d gladly make it real and really would enjoy seeing you get mentally hurt cause of your own actions and your own acts (don’t even think about acting mentally “sick” and show me yourself cuz I’ll easily label you as looking for attention, and I’ll act up upon that fact), but at the same time, those whom are really suffering from whatever mental illnesses, i can literally always be there, and fix whatever issues your specific illness resulted in, and already there are ton of people’s feeling so much better and thanking me too much for what I’ve done (you’re too good to be true, is often said to me)
 



Took me approx 6 months to learn a third language merely because I wanted to join a community’s specific main language to understand and comprehend how culture and language “affects people psychologically”
Found myself really into that, so took me  another two years to learn other multiple languages, merely because of such fact, I don’t do shit that would bore me, I started having international calls and not just texting and writing posts online, so I can also comprehend how tones differ from languages to another, started listening to issues at first and then started “fixing” them later on, I wouldn’t go around talking about whatever if I don’t have enough knowledge towards such subject, and if I really had to, I’ll try to understand as much as possible and ask a lot of questions without sounding like a complete dick, be it a business or anything academical or whatever
 



People calling me really smart is a daily occurrence, and I love it in contrast of how I personally think about calling myself so
 



I’m not feeling particularly sad nor happy, I’m basically feeling really empty unless I’m around people
 




I’ve got pets, dogs and cats, I don’t really have any particular affection towards them, but I just love doting to whatever is smaller than me, I genuinely smile when they do cute shit and always wanting to give them the world, I sometimes have some “grade A” meat, which is basically really expensive in my country, but I’d still give them lots of it, but at the same time, I honestly don’t really think I’d be against physically hurting them, but I just don’t do it cause they’re cute (if that even makes sense), but whenever I see posts of people hurting animals or witness it with my own eyes, I’d get really annoyed, not cause of them poor animals, cause the people doing it look pretty stupid, might sound pretty hypocrite to other people, because I personally seem to have no problems with it, basically just hating the people doing it
 



I love to talk about politics and religion and basically whatever that requires a lot of thinking, and if I’m at some point became a man of “power”, I’d have no problems and whatsoever applying “drastic” measures towards anyone who’s stupid for the sake of whatever country or district I’d be in charge of
 



I don’t particularly “enjoy” watching people dying or whatever blood-gore related videos or witnessing something in real, or any of those stereotypical anti-social disorder traits I might have is affiliated with, but I still have no problems seeing it either, exactly the same as watching cute cat videos for example, and even applying it towards whoever is a reason for such error, be it a country or a company or anything man-workers related companies/districts
 



Went to a dozen psychiatrists, therapists and psychologists, but in my country, none would even consider the fact I’d be having one or multiple of those anti-social traits and could easily lie to their faces, if I wanted a specific prescribed medicine, they wouldn’t even have realized they’ve been lied to, the most they could come up with is affiliating my drug abuse with their “final” decision and diagnose, cause in Egypt, most of those going through them, are addicts fixing their issues and ex addicts fixing previous problems resulted by them abusing drugs at some point
 



And by tying the fact I went to dozen rehab centers and my “personality”, “it’s just issues resulted by your previous drug problems” is all I get
 



And my family aren’t any better, even more simple than those psychologists here in Egypt, diagnosing me as being “inhuman” or an “asshole”, if those are medical terms and diagnoses even
 



I’m relatively physically “appealing” by most standards, and it makes it even easier talking and manipulating whoever is a next “victim”, getting basically anything I want with just talking to people





*I tried to word it out as simple as possible so it could easily be understood, some words that were used such as “cringe” for example is simply because I don’t really know what words to use in their place in order to cross thoughts*"
894,Boyfriend Spent 4 Hours Taking With Therapist This Week When He Scheduled And Paid For One. Boundary Question?,"So my boyfriend (33 m) has some serious abandonment issues that manifest in pretty ugly ways. He’s finally in therapy at my ultimatum. Basically I had to tell him “I can’t live like this, either you need to stop talking about going to therapy and working on yourself and start actually doing it, or I can’t be in this relationship.” So he’s finally going, and I think it’s helping a little. In theory I should be delighted? 

The thing is, having been in a lot of therapy myself, I feel like my therapists always has really clear boundaries. His therapist is about our age, recently finished her studies, and only charges $35 a session which is amazing. He was scheduled for a one hour session with her yesterday but it lasted for two hours, and he also spent another two hours on the phone with her unscheduled and unpaid. She’s the wife of a coworker of his (kind of his boss’s wife, I guess) which makes it a little complicated. Is this weird?

Like don’t get me wrong! I feel like it’s helping him gain some insight into his negative behaviors and I’m glad. But is this level of extra time normal? I can’t help but feel like it’s off somehow. Like a failure to set and maintain boundaries I guess? At $35 for four hours of her time, she’s making like $8.75 an hour and gave up two evenings of her week. I don’t see how that’s sustainable for her either. 

Am I overthinking this?"
895,How do you ask for help?,My mental health has been quite bad for a few years now and a while back I tried talking to my parents about it (im still in highschool) and they just yelled at me about it and said it was my fault. Since then I’ve been too scared to ask for help from anyone else but I think I need it? I just don’t know who to go to or how to ask/ bring it up
896,Mental health treatment is a right,"i really hate how the republicans are defunding medicaid and medicare (biggest payers of mental health services in the US), as well as reducing funding for substance abuse and mental health services. As a result, more people go untreated, which often leads to homelessness or suicide. Anybody who thinks mental health treatment isn't a right obviously hasn't struggled with a severe mental illness."

899,Therapist Broke Up with Me,"Finding a new therapist **sucks!** I finally found an *angel* of a psychologist in my area 7 months ago &amp; I have been making incredible progress understanding myself and my emotions. But yesterday she announced she needs to reduce her caseload due to some personal health issues. The news hit me like a break up, and I feel unwanted and untrusting. 

Now I'm back to square one - although I understand (and **fully** empathize) with her situation, I have abandonment sensitivities and feel that I will be worried my next therapist may leave as well. 

If anyone has gone through something similar feel free to share your story or provide support :)

900,Last night I cut myself,"Last night a cut myself, it’s been a thought i’ve had for some time. It bleed more than I had anticipated. I used a razor and did it in my kitchen. There was no intention of killing myself. Just wanted to release the pain. There has been a constant gnawing thought to cut myself for a while now. Yesterday, I had an excruciating head ache and just had a terrible day in general, and in a moment of desperation I did it. I slit my left hand from pinky to thumb. After bleeding for a while, I wrapped it in gauss and went to bed. It was a nice sensation at first but now it’s just pain, nothing but more pain on top of what I was already feeling.

Today I can honestly say I regret it. It was selfish. I am currently seeking real help and wanted to share this with you."
901,How to move out from home with 25 when I can't live by myself?,"I think I'm too old for living at home and I'm extremely annoyed by the existence of my family. But despite my lack for love towards them the truth is: If they wouldn't be constantly supporting me, everything would fall apart. I know this because I tried, ended up in mental hospital and having health issues because I stopped eating due to the lack of energy to make or buy food on my own. Right now even my families help is failing as I'm sleeping 20 out of 24 hours and can't go to work anymore. My boss is dealing with my bullshit for a few years now, but after this year's performance I'm sure to be unemployed next year, especially as they can't give me another limited contract anymore. There are signs of liver failure after multiple tests, so there could be a different reason than depression for my tiredness, but since I'm trying to get help since a decade now it really doesn't matter if my body is failing now. I would be glad to die due organs giving up on me. Pro of loosing my job would be that I could finally get my driving license. (I'm working during the times they give lessons, so I never went there for over an year now.) I could have the possibility of getting supervised living if I move to a place I don't want to, but that would be limited to an year and requires me to get an apartment there on my own first and I have no idea how I should do that. And since I have to consider that I can't afford that in the near future it would be a risk that drags me down even further."

904,"If you're a DID/OSDD system and have a psychotic disorder, how do you tell what voices are from which thing? (i.e. external vs internal voices).","Not seeking medical advice. Many signs point to DID or OSDD, but I've also been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. I have a little girl that's in my head with me (headmate?) But she doesn't come out very often. But, I also have other voices. When I have a psychotic episode, the voices are on the outside as if someone is talking to me from the real world, and it's unintelligible whispering, unlike the voices on the ""inside"" that create what my therapist calls ""conflicting dialogue""."
905,I don't know what's wrong with me??,I don't know what's going on with me but I go through these long patches where I'm so so so sad and lonely and feel like there's nobody out there who gets me and just feel so isolated. (trigger warning:suicide)I think about dying constantly like I'd be in my car and my brain would envision  the diff ways I could lose my life and it'd give me some twisted sense of serenity??? Then there's the normal patches that sometimes last a week where I feel like I'm okay in life and am coping okay with my college work and am super happy with my friends and so satisfied but the dark part always always returns and my heart keeps hurting I just don't know what to do. I can't reach out to someone irl bc idw to seem like an attention seeker and I don't want to trouble others with my problems. I don't know what to do anymore I can't keep living like this does anyone know wtf is happening? Does anyone else go thru this?? Is this normal?
906,Sleep,"So, I think my sleep schedule is fucked. But Idk to what extent.. I can tell it's bad, but idk if it is worth talking about or if I should just leave it be... (And I also wonder if there is a name for this)

If this matters, my schedule has been this way for a little over a year 

I don't sleep much. I go to sleep around 1-2 am (usually, I also sometimes go to sleep later or don't sleep at all) and wake up around 6am (on school days) and between 7-8am (weekends)

I wake up, see what time it is, read my daily manga and then just take a nap. Around 12pm I wake up again and go downstairs to eat (if my parents tell me to, I don't eat if I can avoid it) and then go back to take a nap. Wake up for dinner and then take a nap again. But around 10pm, my mind is... I wouldn't say ""awake"", but I hate it, I will start blaming myself for a lot of things and it keeps me awake all night again, and then it starts all over...

On school days it's a bit different, I then try to stay awake but eventually fall asleep in every class I have


Anyone else that has this? I first thought it wasn't that bad, but I can tell this probably isn't normal, but Idk what to do?"

909,"I usually don’t quote songs, but this part of Mansion from NF really describes how I feel.","So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built the safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear and not come back
And I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside so stop watching
I'm not coming to the door so stop knocking, stop knocking
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the wall down ain't solving the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's living in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious he never did
He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in the position it's either sit here and let him win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking?
I don't know anymore"
910,Completely paralysed by fear of failure,"Over the past 6 months I've noticed myself stagnating and procrastinating to the point I can't produce anything at all. I quit my job as a result of a belief I wasnt going to be able to do anything in my job. Now I'm trying to look into various next steps and am already finding myself only getting a fraction of the way in and quitting. Even things like volunteering, I get to the point of enquiries then no further.  I've taken leave from work before on a fit note, but this time I just broke.

My therapist hasn't been great over the past 6 weeks so I'm waiting on a list for another.

I feel completely stuck. People have consistently told me how ""good I am"" in the field I'm in but I inherently have no faith in myself. I'm talking myself out of absolutely everything to the point I'm now unemployed.

I feel the threat of bankruptcy, ruining relationships isn't even enough to spur myself into action. I feel completely defeated. I'm so adverse to risk even ""just do it / small steps"" feels too risky.

Any advice on how to get out of this is appreciated, particularly anybody whose made it out the other side."
911,I feel like I’m on autopilot,"I feel like I’m detached from myself sometimes, there serious where I feel like I’m still dreaming as I carry out my daily tasks and I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not. I feel intense depression, and when I do genuinely laugh as soon as it dies down I feel that same empty numb feeling."
912,"My 20 year old friend acts like she’s a child still, I’m worried about her.","She has been a friend since elementary school. We’ve never truly been close (I used to find her really annoying and just put up with her because I wanted to be nice) but in the last few years of high school I really got to know her more. I’ve always known that she acted a bit more childish than the rest of my age group. We’re in college now and we live far away but whenever I meet up with her and our mutual friends I can tell she hasn’t really changed. 

She always gets abnormally excited for movies targeted to children, her birthday, and other things you’d expect children to be excited for. Those things always stood out to me but I just assumed she was a really happy person and I didn’t want to take that from her. In the last year of high school, I learned that her mother brushes her hair still (she has never really had well-groomed hair, it’s normally pretty greasy) and that she will cry sometimes because it hurts. I also learned that her mother bathed her up until her early/mid teens. We once went to a summer camp when we were younger and she didn’t shower once because she felt uncomfortable since her mother always helps her.

During senior trip of my high school year, her mother called at one point when we (my friends and I) were all just hanging out in the hotel. Her mom made oddly sexual comments and I was very surprised since I honestly thought she might not even know what sex was. I was shocked because I’m a fairly open person but I would NEVER talk to my mom about some of the things they were casually discussing (anal sex being one of them). She (my friend) had made a few strange/uncomfortable sexual jokes in the past but they seemed so off-character and awkward that I just brushed them off. After that incident I noticed a few times when she’d make kind of messed up sexual jokes and my friends and I would share “wtf” looks and tell her that’s not funny. 

She has never been gifted academically. She’s an amazing student and has great study habits (I wish I could get myself to try as hard as she does), but her writing and speaking has always come across as similar to someone in a much younger age group. 

As far as I am aware though, she’s never been diagnosed with anything. It’s not my business anyways, I’m aware of that and I feel awful even writing this out. If she does have some sort of diagnosis it’s none of my business. I only am writing this because I’m curious and have always wondered why it is that she acts SOO much younger than our age group. Part of me really worried that her parents have infantilized and coddled her so much that she’s still in that sort of mindset. 

I worry about their household in general. Her mother has a strange obsession with Edward Cullen from Twilight and has posters of him everywhere in her bedroom and her dad has a similar obsession with some female celebrity. The parents bedroom smells like beer. The house overall is VERY cluttered and messy. 

Anyways, I apologize for the long post. I could go on and on and on about things I’ve noticed but it’s not important. These are the first and more important things that have come to mind. I was wondering what you all thought might be the case here. Again, I know it’s not even my business, I just worry about her. I can’t imagine her living on her own as an adult."
913,Are my friends shit or i am?,My friends ignore me sometimes and I feel lonely again. My old friends they were real shit and once i leave from that old toxic friends i was more confident and a little more happy after some time. I feel like is a vicious circle and i don't understand
914,Impact of growing up poor on anxiety,"When I was growing up, my mother never owned a home. More often than not didn't even really rent. For the first ten years of my life, we shared a room. I'm not from a developing country, I'm from one of the richest countries in the world so that's not the norm. When I went to college I worked really hard to never have to go through that again. To be precise I worked overnights as a mcdonald's manager during college. When I was a kid if I got sick and needed the Dr... My mother often couldn't afford it- there was never any spare money. 

I took an opportunity to live in a different country for six months and do something that makes me happy, but pays terribly. It is enough, but doesn't give much wiggle room. I am living with other people my age, essentially volunteering and being given a stipend. This is the first time in my life that it's not as simple as work more hours etc. And it's the first time since I was a child that an unexpected cost would not be able to be covered. 

I'm really struggling with this. I'm really struggling with people who want to do communal dinners etc but then work out to be a lot of my weekly budget. It's making my anxiety go crazy. I don't feel in control of my finances. I can't not do it because then it's only me not. And i want to. I don't want to seem cheap either and it's a word that has been mentioned.  It's just I want to have financial control. I don't feel anyone understands me. Even those previously working minimum wage... They like to say they understand and say this whilst always then saying that they can just go home and wait for the next opportunity, that they won't degrade themselves for minimum wage. Meanwhile... I don't even have a home, not even a family one to go back to. My mam is still renting a room. Henceforth any savings I have are really important to get me back on my feet after this. I can't afford to dip into my bank account, I really rely on the stipend. A lot of the others have parents covering a phone bill or just straight up depositing money. 

I'm feeling like by my age, mid 20s, this stuff shouldn't matter... Like I thought class wouldn't be so prevalent. I'm feeling really uncomfortable. Really anxious about this. Worse thing is when I do find someone with a similar background to me I get on better with them... but I'm still an outsider because my mother worked really hard to make sure I was educated and I just graduated from a good college etc. 

Just wondering if anyone else felt the same. Like class never goes away. Like the poverty you experience growing up has such a profound impact on mental health? Like no one understands. 

Tldr, I feel like the poverty I experienced growing up is having a huge effect on how I handle finances now and my anxiety. Anxious about seeming cheap when in reality I just come from a poor background and don't have family to rely on."
915,How do I go about getting help,"I’m 21, and finally in a situation where I can get help. I can afford it (within reason), and I live independently so I can go and do what’s best for me without a second opinion. Mainly what I’m looking for at the moment is diagnosis. I have sneaking suspicions of what I have but I would like to be sure so that I can proceed with getting all of the help that I need. Who do I make an appointments with? Who do I need to go see to get a diagnosis? I have to ask my GP to refer me, and I’ve never went about this before."
916,You shouldn't love your family just because you have to,"Not every family is the same. My family is shit, most of them. For example one of them is a pedo, one od them faked being kidnapped and asked for money in exchange even when his sister had nowhere to go and my biological grandmother abandoned my aunts and my mom and had the audacity to say you have to call me grandma. And thats why I hate parents that obligate their children to love their family. I personally think that they have to gain love and respect. Do you have a fucked up family too?"

But after having a medical incident in the pandemic and having been driven out of workforce I can't sleep at night.

Even when I have interviews lined up and a job lined ahead.

I still get anxiety attacks, I was jobless I couldnt sleep and had a palpitating heart. I now have a job and I still cant sleep.

Fuck it, I am having suicidal thoughts. No no things are going well but still it isnt going asay.


I am not lying.

I might sound incoherent here but trust me I am smart. This is not how I normally talk. But i cant help it.

Why? Always I think

What is going wrong?? What is going wrong??? What is going wrong???


Nothing is going wrong, every problem is solved, I am joining a decent paying firm and I have nothing to complain.


But I still can't stop, I still can't stop.


I always have this fear something is going wrong.


My Anxiety qas from CTTH and CTTH is gone, but I still frel the same.

Is it really anxiety or just something else?

Everything is fine, so why do I feel like this."
921,Listening is a Supower Power,"One question I’ve been asking my friends for fun lately is, “If you had the superpower to heal anyone of anything, would you charge money to use it?”

It’s a fun question because people respond differently based on where they’re coming from. Some answer with a quick “No” because they feel it’s unethical to charge for an ability that they were born with. Plus it’s really difficult to put a price on healing someone of a terminal illness.

Others want more information such as:

* Does the superpower take a toll on you?
* How long does it take to heal someone?
* Is it something you can develop?

But what if I told you that we were all born with a supower power? And what if all this superpower needs to grow is to be practiced like a muscle?

# Listening is a Super Power

After four years getting trained as Pastoral Counselor and two years as a therapist, I’ve come to the conclusion that listening is an incredible super power. It has given me supernatural abilities of insight and has allowed me to do some incredible things such as:

* Bring clarity to overwhelming and chaotic situations.
* “Read people’s minds” by looking past what people say and getting to what they mean.
* Help heal people emotionally and make them feel less lonely.

In Korean, there is a word to describe this super power: Nunchi(눈치). Nunchi refers to the art, skill, and ability of listening and gauging another person’s mood. A highly developed sense of Nunchi requires high emotional intelligence and is crucial to thriving in [high-context communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) collectivistic cultures.

In order to turn the latent ability of listening into a super power, an active stance must be taken. This means actively identifying the subtext of what a person is saying. It involves incorporating a person’s cultural/personal/societal background. It involves allowing the other person to validate whether the insights that you are gleaning is accurate. It even considers a person’s body language.

Notice how this is different from passive listening where you simply take in what the person says with minimal response or reaction.

Once you obtain this super power, it can be applied to nearly all aspects of life. Listening can help you build closer relationships with your friends. It can help you better understand how to approach your boss at work depending on their current stress level. It can make you a better communicator and teacher as you are able to call out universal human truths. It can even help you diffuse arguments by identifying what the root of the problem is.

# My Mom’s Nunchi

When I was around 5 or 6 years old, I went to go shoe shopping with my mom. It was a frustrating experience because I tried on several pairs but none of them seemed to fit. I even tried using those old school metal shoe measuring devices to find the exact size I should try. But for some reason, they all were really tight around the sides of my foot.

📷

After trying the sixth pair I asked one of the shoe store helpers, “How come none of the shoes fit me?”

“Because you have wide feet,” she said.

“My son doesn’t have wide feet! He has normal feet!” my mom yelled in anger. She quickly grabbed my hand and stormed out of the store.

When we got back home, I ran up to my room and shut the door. I sat on my bed thinking about what happened because for some reason I was feeling sad. I thought maybe there was something wrong with me because I had wide feet. Eventually I came out of my room and went to go talk to my mom who was making dinner.

“Umma(엄마). Do I have wide feet?” I asked quietly while looking down at the floor.

My mom stopped preparing the salad, looked at me, and smiled at me. She had been patiently waiting because she knew that this question was coming.

“Andrew. Your feet are like tree trunks. The wider they are, the firmer you’ll stand,” she said.

“Okay,” I said with a huge smile on my face and ran back upstairs to play with my leggo’s.

When I think back to that memory, I realize now that my mom had incredible nunchi. As soon as that shoe helper said that I had wide feet, she saw the confused look on my face and knew right away how it would affect me. When she heard the tone of my voice in the kitchen and saw me looking down at the floor, her nunchi immediately told her that I was feeling sensitive and different.

My mom knew that I was feeling sad even before I did and it felt like a super power to me. Not only did it help her “read my mind,” but she was also able to encourage me to embrace my differences and not be ashamed of them because of it.

Next week, we’ll dive into some practical steps of how you can develop your own listening skills and turn them into a super power.

922,Depressed boyfriend,"Hi Reddit,

My boyfriend is depressed and looking for some advice.

Here is some background: I myself have somewhat recently got out of a big depressive/anxiety episode and am taking antidepressants to keep myself in that good spot and I’m really thankful that I’m doing better. Within the past year I have lost my career and took up a job at 40% less pay and took some time on unemployment during that transition. A few months after I lost my career, my boyfriend got laid off from his job and also had to take about the same pay cut on his new job. Just as he was starting the new job, covid hit. Luckily he is able to work from home but I had to go back on unemployment for a couple months and now luckily I’m working again. 

Work has now stabilized for both of us but we are noticing a hit on our budgets and haven’t been able to do a whole lot of activities away from home. Recently within the last few months I noticed my boyfriend has lost his drive. At the beginning of the year we were both obese and while I have worked at losing weight, he hasn’t. All he wants to do is play video games and call himself a fat loser. Hes falling behind on cleaning and doesn’t care and our relationship has taken a hit physically and emotionally. He’s upset he lost his job in January and he’s upset he doesn’t have many friends. His support system is mostly me and his parents and brother, a couple of my friends and his friends are almost only online so he could use some people to hang out in person with. 

I find he is dependent on me for social life with friends. I do love having him around my friends but I also don’t want to be the one responsible for his social life. I have talked to him about his mental health and where he’s at quite a bit. We have discussed multiple times he should be getting into therapy and may want to consider antidepressants and he agrees he should do this. Our latest talk, I asked him where he’s at because he hasn’t made any changes to help himself and he admitted he doesn’t have interest in doing so.

I’m really frustrated because I know what depression is like and i want to help but but he needs to be making those steps no matter how small and he just won’t. I have pushed him as much as I can be he needs to be the one to make change. I don’t know what else I can do at this point and would appreciate some help."
923,Anxiety during interviews?,"I’m currently applying for graduate roles, and many of the application processes require a video interview stage. Before I take them, I actually feel quite relaxed as I’m used to doing them. However, when I start talking, particularly for extended periods, I begin to start feeling very lightheaded and my heart starts to race. It really throws me off and makes me think ‘WTF am I saying?!’ 

This is becoming a big issue because I’m applying for very competitive roles. As soon as I begin to feel anxious, it completely throws off my thought process and I struggle to come up with ideas or remember significant and helpful things for the interview. 

It’s strange because mentally I don’t feel anxious at all, particularly before the interviews. It seems to manifest itself almost entirely physically. 

Has anyone got any useful techniques that they use in these scenarios to help keep them focused and relaxed?"
924,Really insecure and have low self esteem...and sometimes i wanna kill myself,"I said sometimes cause theres a voice in the back of my head telling me if i do my family gonna be sad and my dog aint gonna know where i went. That depresses me but kinda stops me but the feeling comes back and i wanna know how to overcome this. I've also gotten so insecure to the point wherd sometimes im scared to talk and i've started to distance myself from my friends cause i always have this voice in my head telling me they hate me and well...getting kinda annoying so just wanted to know what i could do to like stop these thoughts...


(sry for like no punctuation i got alot of work to do so was rushing a little)"
925,I have PTSD and there was a shooting just outside my apartment last night. I feel confused as how to process this or feel.,"I have PTSD from nearly nonstop abuse throughout most of my life. In my 20s I got involved in a lot of negative situations as I was hoping that eventually one of these situations would kill me (like when a guy but a Desert Eagle to my head when I stepped through a door to buy drugs) but I also was involved in slightly more traumatic moments where I wasn’t up to no good but things when sideways anyway (like when I went with two girls to Navy Pier at night only to watch a gang of 20 put a guy in ICU and jump us). There are loads of these moments and I’ve probably been involved in 5-6 incidents involving guns. 

Last night I was playing Resident Evil when suddenly I heard a “pop.” When you live in the city, even a midwestern city, you have to assume shootings are going to happen and this summer we’ve had a so called epidemic of shootings; it’s just a thing that’s gonna happen. But then I hear “pop pop” and now I know it isn’t fireworks, or a car backfiring... and then I hear “POP POP POP POP POP” and I hit the floor.

I immediately texted my girlfriend that I loved her. I wedged myself into the molding in my apartment because it’s harder to see me, but I have giant picture windows and even though the view is obscured I had all the lights on, so I can’t move to somewhere safer and I can’t get to my AK-47. I felt “pinned down” and didn’t know what to do. I usually handle these things really well but not this time. I was almost hyperventilating, I wanted to cry but couldn’t, I was making major mistakes when trying to call the police by typing “police” into my contacts instead of 911 and then dialing 611 twice because I was so nervous. 

I finally got through, I explained what I heard, I told the operator that I didn’t need the cops to contact me afterward and they said they were sending a car. I sat in that obscured position for 20 minutes. When I finally moved I literally almost shit myself and was surprised that was a real thing. 

Now I don’t know how to feel. I’m really bothered but... I don’t know how to convey that. I keep trying, I have no difficulty expressing myself usually, but I feel like everyone is underplaying this. This has really shaken me up but... what do I even do? I’ve gotta send some stuff out this afternoon, I’m going to see my girlfriend tonight, and we’re visiting her dad this weekend. I want all those things, and she’s very very supportive, but I was already struggling with depression and now I feel like doing nothing at all. I’ll end up doing this stuff, and I’ll be glad I did, but I don’t know how to deal with this. 

I don’t know what to do, I’m so lost."
926,I want to die so bad,I don't know what to do I don't know what's wrong with me but every waking moment all I can think about is how bad I want to die. I can't take my own life but I just want tsomething to kill me I'm so sick of this I can't
927,"Stuck in a mentally toxic/abusive home while suffering from chronic illness, and my only escape from it seems on the verge of a breakup","Above is basically the TL;DR.
I have a rare illness that has fucked up my life for at least half a decade, and because of it I have never been able to move out of my toxic parents house, and won’t be able to for at least two years, as surgery seems like the only treatment. My parents don’t give much of a shit about COVID, they aren’t completely far gone, they wear masks to stores but not to the family gatherings that seem to happen every week. Because of that it’s been harder to see my boyfriend of over half a year, as we don’t want to risk spread. We both love each other a lot, but with the long distance artificially created by the pandemic, we only get to see each other once a month, and I’m not sure how much longer things can keep going like this. Love can only take us so far

I feel like I’ve finally hit the breaking point today. I had a bad flare up with my illness last night/this morning, and I just woke up and learned that I won’t be able to visit his house this weekend. I’ll still be able to see him, but I won’t even be able to get that escape. I honestly don’t know if I’m strong enough to make it through this. I’m not a suicidal person, but I really don’t know how much more of this I can take. I want to live to my 90s, get married, have kids, enjoy life and all that good shit. But I’m starting to think that isn’t something I can have anymore. There’s a pretty high chance I’ll never recover from what I’ve got, despite being lucky enough to have quality care. I really, truly, desperately want to live, but I’m really beginning to wonder if ending my life will be like putting down an old dog, despite me only being in my early 20s.

I’m desperate, I need any advice I can get, sorry for the long post"
928,Who here has experienced mental health stigma in the medical community? (vent / poll),[removed]
929,"Suggestion methods on how to treat someone suffering from ""domestic violence"", ""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"", ""Hypomania"" &amp; ""Bipolar disorder"".","So there's a friend of mine (F-17). we've known eachother for 5 years now. it's 7/8 months since we've become intimate with each other for her to express her inner thoughts, problems, family and internal conflicts ...

In this timespan, I think she suffers from those mental disorders aside from the periodic verbal/physical violence she receives from her family, mostly the father. I know none of the members are truly at fault here; cause of the society we live in and most of our people suffer from some kind of depression and mental disorders. I also suppose it's the sensitivity of the teen period that's giving rise to these thoughts and behaviors and maybe time will heal things on its own. 

I posted this here cause I'm no Psychiatrist and handling her has also influenced on my mental situation. there are times when she starts a deep conversation about her situation and I become overwhelmed by it. At the moment don't know anything to do in my power but that doesn't mean I will stop doing what needs to be done to improve her situation. 

Any thoughts, suggestions, mindful hints, personal experiences regarding treating these people would be much appreciated."
930,I can’t stop getting bullied,I’ve been bullied for almost a year now and this is my bully story can you please help anyway you can so today at school I was bullied like usual and this is what happens so the first thing that happend is that my bully spat on me and keeps on dragging and slapping me and it’s not just him it’s more people like yesterday a group of 10 people hanged up on me luckily my friends Levi and Connor protected me from them can you please give me advise on how to stop this
931,Send love to everyone that's suferring alone,Jist Goodluck :)
932,I had a thought...,"I was thinking about how excited I am that my Program will start an hour earlier than it has been (so instead of 3 hours we will have 4) and how this is a positive move in the direction of opening it back up 5 days a week. I realized something kind of distressing though. I am excited about this and I love going to Program because when I am there, I don't have to pretend to be ok. I am allowed to be depressed (not saying they just let me mope all day--we do have to participate in the classes/groups and they do one on one counseling if you need it) and I am allowed to be a mentally ill pyromaniac. In other words, I don't have to hide who I am when I am there...I can express myself and talk about the things that bother me like my urges and the anxiety that plagues me, along with the crushing depression if I so choose. If I don't want to talk, I don't have to talk. I know they will still be there if I need them. I don't worry about being judged. I carry two lighters in my pocket, and they don't see that as particularly healthy, given my love for all things combustible ha ha, but they understand that it is a comfort thing instead. It makes me feel better to have them and I have been behaving myself anyhow. I don't feel the need to use the lighters, especially indoors. If I were to have an overly strong urge to use it, and I have, I find ways of diffusing that situation fast so it doesn't escalate into me burning down the building. I can always turn the lighters in to the staff if I feel unsafe with them.  


Anyhow, that is all I have to say. This is distressing for me because it made me realize how fucked up my life is outside that protective bubble of Program. I am constantly pretending that I am ok...so no one sees the pain...so no one can tell me to get over it and that I have no right to feel that way. This has happened all my life, and I have gotten so good at covering up the intense pain I feel every single day. Yes, I have a relatively nice life--a family, a nice place to live, enough food to eat--but those things don't negate how I feel inside--a loser, stupid, worthless, and fucked up beyond repair (FUBAR). I am curiously not feeling the urge to kill myself though. I have realized how much pain my family would feel if I did do it, and I don't want to ever put them through that. My going to prison had almost broken my hubby. He is just starting to get back to his ""normal"" self, 9 months later. So I can't escape...and I am in tremendous pain...which I can't do much about except talk about it. Meds help, but not a whole lot so far.  


That is fucked up.

Thanks for reading. If you have any advice/kind words for me, I would appreciate them."

935,"I decided to get help, but have no idea how to find a good therapist","I've dealt with depression on and off my whole life, since I was maybe 5? Anyway, I'm going through a bad bout. It hasn't been this bad in years. Normally it's just there in the background, keeping away any motivation to do anything. The past couple weeks, it's gotten worse to the point that I'm suicidal again.

I know I need help, and I know that entails seeing a therapist, but I have no idea where to start. I've heard that a good therapist is amazing, but the wrong therapist can make for a horrible experience. I'm also LGBTQ+ so I'd need someone who is understanding and supportive of that side of my life.

I have a list of providers covered by my insurance (I live in Tennessee), but you can't really tell much from a list of names. How do I go about finding the ""right"" therapist?"
936,Good news and bad news,"A week ago I told my school Counselor about my depression and anxiety and finally got an actual counselor. However after this, I began to get more pronounced symptoms of anxiety like nausea and mental breakdowns. Could talking to my counselor have caused more problems?"
937,PTSD?,"Is this a common symptom of ptsd. 
Over the weekend I was speaking about past family trauma and I recalled a memory of my mom grabbing me and shaking my arms until picking me up and almost pulling both out of the socket. I grew up in a not so great environment, even though my family loves me, my mom was an alcoholic with a violent streak. 

She did this to me quite frequently but this particular night I cannot get out of my mind. 

Later the day that I recalled that memory I had a sort of episode in which I forgot where I was, I thought I was back in my home and in front of both of my college roommates I screamed and chucked a water bottle at the wall. In the moment I genuinely believed I was back in my childhood home and my mom was shaking and hitting me. 

Is this a symptom of PTSD? Is there something I can do to keep this from happening again I was extremely embarrassed and broke my clean streak from self harm. 

I couldn’t get the feeling or image of my mom shaking me out of my head for days."
938,Again,"It happened again.
We had math and there was just me and a classmate and the teacher cuz the others had some meet up or something then we three learned some new math things business blablabla..
And later we just started to talk about future and then she asked me what do YOU want to in life 
Cuz I always said that my dad/mom wants me to be Something like a nurse or do some finance job(don’t know the name in English)

And I don’t I controlled myself but then when it got deeper my tears just came out I just cried like a loser(I’m mean my tears just rolled down and I tried to stop it so bad) 
And I don’t know why this shit happens these days I’m so mad and embarrassed of myself

940,"Odd obsession, I hate owing money in any way","I can't stand owing money even to big companies.  I pay bills as soon as I get them, often I will pay balances before a statement is even posted.

942,How to build a healthy relationship with a mentally ill parent?,"A little background about me: I am an only child raised by a single mom. Father has always been absent, he left us when I was only 8 months old. We don't contact each other so he's basically a stranger to me. I think I met him only twice or thrice.

My mom was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, and anger management issues. She's been taking medication since her college days.

Growing up, I've always known that something's wrong with my family set up. My childhood memories are mostly about my mom yelling, breaking things, having hallucinations, crying herself to sleep, or staying in bed 24/7. I even witnessed her harming herself and visited her in a psychiatric facility where she was once admitted. That image still haunts me today... She's always been unwell and I was aware of that.

I don't know if it's the problematic environment I grew up into, plus the controlling and overprotective parenting style of my mom, but I grew up VERY distant to my family members. My family makes me uncomfortable. I'm usually friendly and bubbly outside and with friends but totally cold and unaffectionate at home.

My mom is getting old and she only has me. I want to try working on our relationship and be a good child. I find it really hard to show affection to my family but I'm willing to try. But where do I start? How do I find the patience and understanding to deal with her? How can I fix a broken household?"

944,I have been seeing things out of the corner of my eye,About a week ago I admitted myself into a mental hospital. I only ended up staying one night and leaving “against medical advice” because it just wasn’t a good place and everyone was treated poorly. That night I had a really hard time sleeping and spent most of that night staring at the moon and stars out the window. As I was doing this I saw something run across the floor by my bed. I figured it was probably a mouse or I was just tired but ever since I left I’ve been seeing things out of the corner of my eye every once in a while. Usually it’s just like dark shapes and I can’t make anything out but yesterday I was standing at the end of my bed going through my purse and I saw a head pop out from under my bed. It was so real I had to make sure no one was under there. What could be causing this?
945,Do I have any mental illness?,"Hello everybody!

Its been a long time, that I have these symptoms. It’s hard to me to concentrate, when my friends are telling stories its hard to focus on it and sometimes i cant listen, because Im thinking about other things or i just look around and sont listen. I need to force myselft to focus and listen to them. 
Also its hard for me to read. I always want to read something and im always trying to take any book and start reading, but when i start it, its hard to read the one page quickly, i need to read it many times to “understand”.
Besides, I have problem to make decision quickly, simply to say ots hard to choose what food i want when im in grocery store, sometimes i imagine each food taste and then i choose which i want more at that moment. Its hard to choose clothes too and so on. 
Also i have problem memorizing something, sometimes i forgot many things. When i watch tv series if i dont watch them everyday sometimes i forgot  things that i should have remembered. And i need to remind. Also during watching movie or anything sometimes i need extra time to understand whats someone is saying, even if its in my language that i speak everyday. 

Im little scared, becase its problem for me and its makes me unconfortable in everyday life. 

If you ever had like that or if you know whats with me pls give me advices.

Thank you so much in advance."

Suicide has been a thought at the back of my mind for a while and I feel like that's all I have. My relationship with my partner is draining me. I used to love this man with all my heart and now I don't even know who he is. I can't seem to do much of anything right in his eyes. I lost 2 babies, and I grieve them everyday. I'd give anything in the world to be able to hold them. I have no energy for anything, I feel like I'm falling apart. I feel like it doesn't matter how loud I scream, nobody will hear me. I lost what little comfort I had with the world. I feel sick. All I want more than anything is to feel like I'm doing a good job in someone's eyes. I'm so tired. I'm giving up and i have no energy to try anymore. I think I'm coming to an end, and I know my partner and my family won't miss me. I just can't do this.

950,Diagnoses and drs not doing them?,"ETA: he’s a psychiatrist and a neurologist. He’s sending me to a psychotherapist also in his office.  

Okay so I went to see a new psychotherapist. It was the most help I’ve had in a long time, but he mentioned he doesn’t do diagnoses?? Has anyone else heard of this?  My entire life I was told I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. When I told him this he seemed... dismissive? And told me it’s all a spectrum and he doesn’t like actual specific diagnoses? Labels make life easier for me so they mean a lot to me, I know not as much as they should but they do. But I brought up my fear of possibly being autistic as well, and he instantly tossed it off and said I was communicating and showing emotions so I couldn’t have it. He said all autism was was not understanding humor, not communicating, and not responding with emotions. But I’ve never heard such BS???? Any thoughts? Has anyone else’s psychiatrist done no diagnoses? I feel confused and lost."

I became more socially withdrawn and pushing people away from me. Now I feel detached even from the closet people to me, that makes me very scared and lonely. I fear it’s only going to get worse, I’m pushing myself to get my life together but it doesn’t seem to be working.
my value system and way of thinking is so different than people around me. i’m gay, non-religious and quite a liberal in one of the most conservative societies on earth. I feel like there’s no place for me here and going abroad to a western country is my salvation. but i’m very intimidated and fearful of failure to succeed there and ruin the little bit of life I have left here.

954,Suicidal thoughts gone?,[removed]
955,When you call someone an abuser?,"Hello, I just found myself over here. I usually avoid reddit because it’s so triggering for me but I have a hard time avoiding it because there seems to be good subreddits for my hobbies/interests. Anyways..... I’m struggling with a mom who feels like an abuser but I think is a genuinely nice person outside of family life. She’s very hard on me, my bother, and my step-dad but very passive and a good communicator around other people.
I struggle so much with what to think all the time. I’m constantly seeing every possible angle and point of view for everything in my life. Like just this morning I almost got t-boned pulling out of my driveway on a 25mph road by a guy going at least 40mph who then pulled around me and kept going while honking. Obviously a giant jerk, in the wrong, endangering others, right? But then my brain is like “well I’ve been upset in the road before. He probably is late for work and has something going on at home and me blindly pulling out in front of him and then proceeding to go the speed limit was just too much.” And then my brain goes even stupider places like how do I even know I SHOULD follow the rules of the road? WhAt If SoCiEtY iS aN iLlUsIoN?
So basically, I never trust any of my thoughts or opinions no matter how much I feel I’m in the right. I spend a lot of time being afraid of things I can’t control and being upset that I can’t control them. Idk pretty obvious that I’ve got some deep seeded issues, I think. Like 90% of the time when I’m talking about my issues with my therapist, it goes back to my mom. Is she my abuser? Is it her fault? Should I blame her to anyone besides myself and my therapist? It doesn’t seem productive to blame..... I’m just so tired of her trying to control my life. *I* want control! I’m 25!!! I want to move out and be happy and independent! I want to have friends and chose my own family and be part of a community. I spend so much time anxious and afraid I can’t work enough because of it to afford to move out. I feel so trapped. A couple of my high school friends suggested just pick up and disappear basically but there’s sooooo many unknowns and dangers to that. I have Generalized Anxiety disorder, possible PTSD from some shit that happened in college..... idk what to do. I want to own my own life and I want it to be as pleasant and fear-free as can be expected in life"
956,My mind is blank with nothing but the thoughts of suicide.,I’m sick of depression. I’m sick of mania. I’m sick of ptsd. I’m sick of anxiety. I’m sick of body dysmenorrhea. I’m sick of eating. I’m sick of thinking. I’m sick of doing. I’m sick of self care. I’m sick of school. I’m sick of having no friends to talk to. I’m sick of being alone. I’m sick of being broke. I’m sick of being bored. I’m sick of being jealous. I’m sick of being unmotivated. I’m sick of being stupid. I’m sick of not being listened to. I’m sick of not having the right support. I’m sick of the public. I’m sick of my pills. I’m sick of therapy. I’m sick of hospitalization. I’m sick of the living. I’m done. I’m just fucking done. Done.
957,Sometimes I wonder why my bf loves me,"I'm a depressed and anxious mess, never had a stranger love me before. It feels weird at times knowing that some cares for me.

We've known each other for a year now, in a relationship for 9 months, and doing long distance currently (it's been 2 months now).

We knew that our relationship would have ended since I was moving countries and that we had no future. We always said we'll remain friends and then one day hopefully try again.

But something changed. 2 weeks before me leaving he admitted that he wants to give long distance a try. He has been thinking about it for a while now but he was scared of saying it.

And here I am right now, thousands of kilometers away still in the relationship."
958,breakup is making me want to do things that i know i shouldn’t.,"my breakup wasn’t even a week ago(we lasted two years) and my body hates me for it. we’ve been texting a bit because he knows how hard it is for me since i’m extremely sensitive. since the breakup, we haven’t gone 24 hours without texting to check up on each other. whenever we’re not texting i feel so sick. my stomach makes me gag and i feel like puking. when we are texting, everything around me disappears and i feel like i’m loved again. 

while we were together i had very suicidal thoughts and extremely hard days where i’d just hurt myself and be sad for a week nonstop. now it feels worse and i don’t actually want to do it, i just want to be someone different. i don’t want to feel everything as much as i do, i want to be happy and not have the root of my happiness in someone who will leave my life soon. there’s been a few people trying to be there for me but the second i tell them about the suicidal thoughts they end the conversation. i don’t mean that in a rude way, i respect them. but i just want to get help. in order to get help i need to help myself first but i don’t know where to even start. i don’t know what makes me happy, i haven’t even left my house in months due to covid."
959,Is it bad that I am 22 and likely have untreated ADD?,"I’ve suspected since I was a teenager that I have ADD (not very hyperactive). I’ve never gone to a professional about it. It doesn’t help that mental health in my country is very stigmatized, but it’s also about my motivation to get help. I know the dangers of self-diagnosing and I’m not trying to act as smart as psychiatrists, but my symptoms are quite noticeable to the point that if it’s not ADD, it must be something worse. However, my symptoms are not as bad as in other people and I’ve graduated HS and now university with average grades. It’s very hard for me to stay concentrated though. I am not productive at all, lack motivation to do anything productive, but when shit hits the fan I manage to not fail. My point here is that my situation is not as dire, but definitely not optimal. Also, I’ve never tried self-medicating (other than nicotine and weed lol, but not with the intention of medicating), so it’s not like I am looking for an excuse with my self-diagnosis. I am planning on getting professional help before the end of the year. 

I was reading about how detrimental ADD and ADHD are, and it made me a little anxious about myself. What I want to know is, did I fuck up by not treating or looking into it early on? Are there permanent or long lasting consequences that I’ve incurred by ignoring it? I’m just worried that I basically fucked myself up emotionally/mentally, and that I could have been a much better person now if I had treated it.  I don’t think I have issues other than anxiety/depression though, and I seem to be a chill, likable guy, so I don’t believe my situation is as bad as others. Once I get professional help, will I be able to be my optimal self, or have I “impeded” that potential? Lastly, will that help “fix” me, or will I always somewhat struggle with concentration, motivation, forgetfulness, unproductiveness, etc?"
960,Was it rape? (Content warning),"I was molested as a child. I don't even know when it started and I'm afraid that it might have been happening to me before I could form memories.

He put his organ in my mouth and then another guy put it in me (I have no idea which hole). Obvi I was a child and I complied to a certain age until i realized it was wrong and I distanced myself.

My question is if child molestation is considered rape? I know it might be a stupid question but I'm genuinely confused. Like when I tell people I was raped, am I lying or using the term incorrectly?

I've heard that rape is when one is forced to do it and no consent is given. Even though they never asked me for my consent, I still followed along (until i realized what they were doing to me was wrong). I was honestly just an oblivious child. I eventually removed myself from the situation and they even threatened me if I didn't comply."
961,I feel like my last option is being admitted to the hospital but I’m scared and need advice,"I hope I’m posting this in the right subreddit. If not, I’m sorry about that.

My mental health has been horrible for years. I mainly deal with anxiety, depression and some extreme intrusive thoughts, but recently it’s gotten way worse. I don’t feel connected to reality anymore - sometimes Im completely apathetic, I struggle to form and maintain emotional bonds, I used to be very empathetic but sometimes i just don’t feel that either, there’s moments where I can barely feel anything physically (such as the cold). I feel like I’m watching my life in a tv. Almost like it’s already over even though I know it’s not. I’m hyper fixated on death, I’m scared of it but also considering it the only option at this point. It feels like everything around me is fake sometimes - including people. It’s horrible, I feel like I’m going crazy and I don’t know what to do about it anymore.
On the other hand, sometimes it’s like I’m hyper aware; I get highly affected by the smallest of things (mainly noise, but also groups of people and bright lights). It makes me irritable, anxious, even angry sometimes. I’ve also relapsed on self harm due to this. I’ve gotten more impulsive. I don’t feel like I’m myself anymore. I don’t know what the f**k is wrong with me and it’s honestly terrifying

I think going to the hospital Is my final option to avoid doing something rash, but I’m scared I’ll get kicked out of school, which is the only thing I love about my life right now. What if people don’t believe that it’s not my school that’s causing it? What if I get kicked out for absence or grades? If I leave my school it’ll get worse. But if I don’t do something it’ll also get worse.

I have a therapist but talking to my parents isn’t an option if that matters here. I’m not on meds at the moment and haven’t been since July (atomoxetine for ADD)

Sorry if this is a mess. I’m exhausted and needed to get it out. Thank you for reading it."
962,who do you guys wish understood your brain,"if you could have anybody in your life walk in your shoes for one day and deal with all the shit you have to deal with surrounding your MH,  who would it be and why?

mine would probably be my friends. sometimes they think im clingy or paranoid or too sensitive.. all products of depression anxiety and ADHD. if they understood it was out of my control maybe they'd be more understanding of my personality."
963,Everything is fucking pointless.,   .
964,My parents take my mental health apart,"After being in a constant low for two years, i found a way to escape it(by moving in with a family abroad) but my parents won’t allow it. I’m 15 and the country i’m living in, in addition to the school i’m going to has more than just a negative impact on my mental health. Throughout my childhood i recall to have had some traumatic experiences and because of bullying i believe my mental health started to crumble years ago but i didnt tell my parents or anyone, because they never believe anything, calling me overly dramatic and believing that i fake ANYTHING i am feeling(medical and mental conditions). A few weeks ago, a friend’s family offered me to move in with them and go to school there as they noticed another low of mine and through careful asking actually managed to get something out of me. They suggested for me to open up to my parents about my mental state, but sadly that turned out to be a mistake. Not only did my parents not believe me, but they accused me of putting them into a bad light and showed complete negligence to the fact that i never opened up before because of fear of this exact reaction, saying that i was lying before so i probably i’m lying now too. This severely pulled me down and i started self harming, something i have never done before. My suicidal thoughts became much more prominent, in the sense of me not being able to do nothing as my mind wanders off into scenarios where i always end up dead. I set myself a time limit, saying that if by that day i don’t surely know i’ll be gone from here i’m killing myself. I’m being totally honest that i dont think i deserve any better than that. I wont be missed and everyone will have one problem less to deal with. My parents won’t listen, whatever i do or whatever i tell them. I feel unheard. And no, i cant wait till im 18. Because my life is hell. 3 years in hell is not something i’m willing to take up. I dont even know why i’m writing this. Maybe i just need to be heard idk."
965,I'm crying alone in the car in the middle of a car park,"Everything is going wrong. Everyone thinks I've got the whole world at my feet and I've got everything planned but it's a lie and everything is too loud and heavy and I feel so numb. I want a normal brain, but I can't remember what it was like to have a normal brain before everything went wrong a few years ago. It won't stop. I need everything to stop. I'm so numb and heavy and empty inside my head. I need it to stop. How do I stop this please? I need to stop. Help."
966,I decided to stay alive,"It was hard. Really the end of this year was the worst. I just want to see were things go and right now it's not all that great and boring. Anxiety is still a little high but not as bad as before. I just wanto get through is all ready.

I decided not use the happy flair sense it's not really a celebration for me or anything it was just a decision."
967,My class is putting me under a lot of mental distress and I’m not sure how to handle it. Any advice?,"Hello, 

I’m currently working full time and go to school part time with only 1 class. I’m taking microbiology which is a 5 unit class. I’ve been going to school this past year and I haven’t had problems in my other class up until this one. I feel like the professor is very incompetent in teaching and goes off tangents a lot. She doesn’t finish lecturing in lecture hours and uses our lab time to finish her lectures. Her tests have nothing to do with what she teaches and because it’s online she doesn’t bother teaching lab but she gives us online simulation labs which are more advanced than the course itself. We are expected to have a lab test with 2 months worth of lab but we don’t have much direction on how to study for it. I’m struggling to figure out how to balance my schedule while being in this single class because she gives us so much work to the point we don’t even have time for studying. I’m dedicating 20 hours or so a week in this class and I’m working on completing some of the work she gives during work. The more work I do, the more I get piled with even more work and can’t find any time to study. I stay up all night doing the work. It’s taking a toll on me mentally and I’m starting to have a lot of tension headaches and trouble concentrating. Any advice on how to go about this?"
968,I’m 31 years old and I don’t laugh or smile as often as I used to when I was younger.,Life kind of messed things up. How do I start laughing and smiling more often? Its kind of depressing. How do I rekindle my sense of humor?
969,I relapsed after 2 years,"I’ve been wanting to self harm ever since I stopped, and the only reason I stopped was because I’m terrified of my mom finding it and mentally abusing me over it. That was the only thing keeping me from doing it all the time. Then a few days ago everything just became too much. All I needed was sorrow worse than the fear to tip me over.

It was such a sucky day. I can’t remember most of it I probably blocked it out, but I remember refusing to admit it was a sucky day because I wanted to stay positive. I remember my eating disorder was making me feel bad. I was stressed from school, stressed from my job too, and I had to go into work that day. I was triggered over seeing one of my ex boyfriends, then I found out my abusive ex boyfriend had been stalking me for 7 months and had a panic attack because I thought I got away from him and didn’t even want to or felt safe leaving the house. But I had to go to work, then I got there for an hour and someone told me I can go home because they messed up the schedule again, which happens all the time. And practically forced myself to get dressed and drive there, only to stay for an hour.  Then I got home and realized I forgot my tips (and my coworkers will just steal it if you leave them). So I asked my mom if I could go back and get them because I texted my coworker and she ignored me (which happened last time I messaged someone after a shift change for the same reason and she claimed there were no tips). So my mom said she’d take me up there, then suddenly changed her mind and started yelling at me for being stupid for wanting to go get my tips. I told her she didn’t have to yell and I got up and went to my room, and my mom did what she always does and follows me to my room laughing because she likes to chase me when I’m trying to get away from her, then got mad when I tried to shut her out. And wouldn’t leave me alone. Then she left and said I don’t need to “take out my anger” on her. I just broke down in my room and cut everywhere. I couldn’t handle it. I don’t even remember it. I used to only cut my wrists but next thing I knew there were cuts on my wrists, fingers, hips, thighs, ankles, feet. Everything hurt, it felt like I was laying in glass. And now I’m hiding it from my mom. Yay"
970,"I Don't Really Know Why I'm Even Working On My Hobby, And That Scares Me (19M)",
971,I feel like I'll end up alone.,"I'm a moderately anti-social introvert. My family consists of me, my mom and dad. I have a sister who left the family when I was 15. I have friends. I have a bunch of friends whom I've been friends with for over 5-10 years now. And they care about me. I haven't really lost friends over the years as most anti-social introverts do (I guess).

I have really good relationship with my parents but I don't know how long they'll be around. I'm not particularly close with any of my cousins. I don't have any cousins of my age. Most of them are older but that's not a problem. I have always spent time with my friends and never really cared about cousins. Actually it's not that I've never tried to be close with my cousins. I did. But they have very different interests. I'm rather geeky and somewhat nerdy which none of them are. We couldn't connect. 

I'm 21 years old. For past 1 year I've been overthinking what will happen after 10 years. Who will be around? My friends probably won't leave but they have family, siblings, cousins and all that. I'll be a loser.

I'm not an emotional person at all. Most of my friends call me 'robot'. But this thought has been haunting me for a year now. I have a close friend who also doesn't have any sibling and isn't much close with his family but he doesn't seem to care. But why the f this keeps spinning inside my brain!

I have borderline personality disorder which sometimes make me go paranoid if somebody acts like they would leave. But I'm emotionally strong enough that when I realize that it's happening due to the disorder, I can distract myself.

I have no idea what's causing this. I've been so insecure lately thinking about all these. What should I do? Is there any term in psychology regarding this?"
972,Is daydreaming being someone that I'm not bad?,"Since I was very young (12 years old) I’ve been daydreaming with a different life that I have. The thing is that the life I’m daydreaming about is not mine, it’s someone else’s. I had never asked myself that question in all the time I've been daydreaming; What worried me a lot was what I found on the internet, things like it was a disorder and that it was wrong if you did it often( my case).

I have many characters in my daydreams which I interpret differently if the situation requires it. Daydreaming doesn’t influence the way I study or the way I work, I always do things on time. Nevertheless my question still bothers me. Do I have some kind of mental disorder? Or should I see a psychologist? 

Any comment regarding this issue can help me a lot. Thank you for your time!"
973,I'm starting to feel extremely self-conscious about myself.,"Recently Ive been feeling extremely self-conscious about myself and have been feeling a lot of anxiety and sadness. Everything that i do i criticize. I feel like i am a weird person for the way i dress, the music i listen to, the things i am into, etc. I feel like everyone at my work place thinks of me a certain way and, i feel like everyone thinks of me in a certain way in general. I look at myself from an outside point of view and think i am weird, cringe, disgusting or whatever it is.  I look at other people and see the things they like to do and the things they are into and i think I'm weird for liking things. I tore down everything on my wall because i thought it was cringe, Ive deleted and changed my Instagram several times because i think I'm weird. I was always the kid trying to fit in, in school. I dressed a certain way because everyone else dressed that way, and i did things because i was just trying to fit in. Even tho i had my own friend group in HS, i knew everyone thought of me in just a weird / negative way. I'm starting to hate myself because of the way i am and the things i like. I feel like I'm tearing my personality apart just so i can be ""normal"". I just want to be normal. For anyone who wonders I'm a male and just recently graduated high school a few months ago. Thank you to whoever reads this."
974,Just relapsed after 2 months of being clean form self harm,"These past couple of days have been rather busy, deleted my messaging app, cut ties with 2 girls and a boy I was going out with, relapsed on self-harm, stopped taking my anti depressants, stopped talking to all the friends I had left, and am currently contemplating suicide, LIFE'S GOOD!"
975,Issues with what I say,I went to work today and my stepdad took me there and he went out and did work and he and I do not have the best of relationship and my mom said not to make noise going in the house because he was resting and I said why is it not to make noise when I worked same amount of time he did and she said no one is making noise to disturb you and then he heard me that stuff I said he heard it and I feel bad and can tell he is probably mad because my mom said what you said was real smooth by the way and I said I am guessing he heard and she told me he did hear me say that stuff about him
976,I'm a new-ish software developer and I want to help people improve their Mental Health,"Hi everyone, I'm a recent from a Software Engineering boot camp grad. It's been tough finding a job so I'm looking to improve my skills and boost my portfolio, while helping other people at a time where there are so many reasons to be depressed, stressed, scared, etc. I decided to build a website to help people improve their mental wellness. 

Since I am not an expert in Mental Health Support, I was wondering if any of you kind people can help provide me with content and/or features that would be most beneficial for people who are struggling with their mental health? I was thinking of making an interactive interface that would ask a series of questions to the user and return resources to best help them given their specific situation. 

I can't wait to hear your suggestions!"
977,"Dear OCD, Anxiety &amp; Depression.","Open long letter to these bitches.

Friday Sept 18, 2020

Dear OCD, Anxiety &amp; Depression,

How kind of you all for joining me today for this meeting and for always being there for me, for the good times and the bad times actually. How sweet of y’all for thinking of me, thank you. Truly.

OCD, The Ring Leader,

You make me feel lost. You leave me lost actually-everyday, without fail. Gotta give it to you though-you play very well in your favorite torturous game with me. You know how to string me up to think that I am in control and then bring me down in the same swift eloquent movement to remind me the I am not. HA! Jokes on me right? Must be fun to be able to sit and watch as I spiral down into a million pieces.

You’re that friend that everyone wishes they had because they think you’ll be there to be honest when needed but then quickly realize you’re that clingy, annoying friend that over shares and wish could go away on vacation more often (like Anxiety and Depression do once in a while.) But lemme tell you, you’re definitely that clingy, annoying, over sharing friend.. Did I mention you’re loud too? No, like… You’re SO fucking loud! We get it, you’re talking-we hear you-no need to keep repeating yourself. Trust me- I heard you the first time.

Anxiety, The Lil’ Bitch,

You make me feel helpless. And it’s all because you like to listen to the asshole of a friend, OCD. You listen. Like a lot. You listen to every word and the craziest part is that you believe everything they say too-like you actually believe it all. How?! And instead of sticking it through with me, you listen and then share with me and leave me alone with a chest full of fire and with hands and feet that cannot even move. Must be nice to be able to start a fire and run away when you can’t handle the flame.

Your presence is well known and received when you enter the room. I mean there’s no way of ignoring you. OCD is loud- but damn bitch-your voice is soooo fucking high pitched. Would be nice if you’d tone it down at times. Sometimes you’re kind enough to be quiet though-I’ll give you some credit. But you’re still there… You’re quiet but then you think its fun for a quick surprise and physically attack me instead. Sheesh there’s no winning with you! Now that I think of it-you’re mean! You rile me up for the fight and then end up personally beating me down yourself. You leave me dry and hurt the next day. Literally-you leave me in bed for days because my body hurts from your special appearance. What a bully.

Depression, The Zombie,

You make me feel nothing and everything and nothing and everything time and time again. There are times that I think you’re my friend-believe it or not. Then there are times I am reminded that…well..you’re not. I don’t blame you though. It’s not your fault. You are a victim of the others as much as I am-they’re pretty powerful, no? However you have learned to play their game too-I see you-your trying to survive too. I’m learning with you but in the meantime in between time…

You do fool me into thinking you are here to protect me and then there are times that I remember its just for your convenience…because of them. You protect me when you feel the need to block out memories so that I do not feel but then you fall into their trap and play the game to happily bring up other memories to play back for me days and weeks at a time on repeat.

As you sit with me in silence and stare like a zombie waiting for my response, I always sit and stare back with the hope you’ll give me a little dance one day instead.

\---

I hate you all and I love you all, all at the same time.

I hate you all for changing me because I was never like this before. But I love you and thank you for joining me on this growing new journey of mine of self discovery and for challenging me.

I hate you for the days and nights of discouragement and fear. But I thank you for teaching me to sit and analyze the why’s.

I hate you for teaching me how to keep things to myself to damn well but I thank you for overwhelming so much at times where I am forced to speak-i know not all episodes are to hurt me but rather to teach me…I’d like to think you three aren’t too evil.

I hate you for what you have done to my parents. I hate you for making my parents feel they need to check on me all the time. To see if I’ve eaten or slept the sufficient amount of hours. I hate you for the tension you built between us without giving them a chance to understand. But I thank you because now we are stronger than ever and because of you I had to learn to communicate with them better.

I hate you for what you have done and continue do to me and my partner at times when you create tension, fears, confusion, frustrations and anger. But I love you and thank you for forcing and allowing us the space to learn about each other and communicate better with a bit more patience.

I hate when you leave me for dead in bed. I hate you for leaving me as a numb walking vessel. But I thank you for reminding me to be kinder and slow down afterwords.

I have accepted that you three will be with me always. I have learned to be civil and humble with you all.

I feel you are me and I am you and that…is ok.

I wave my white flag to you today and always.

\-j."
978,Just a question,After being anxious for so long or having intense anxiety for while it feel out of place or weird to try and be positive again for anyone else?
979,I can’t help stop smiling when I cry. anyone else??,"I don’t know if this is normal or not because there were like no results when I was googling but basically whenever I’m telling someone about something that hurt me or being raw with my feelings I always start sobbing but I’m smiling the whole time

I think I have a problem with repressing my emotions or something I don’t know what it is. I don’t let myself feel negative things very often so whenever I do talk about it with someone I immediately start crying like it all just boils over

I feel really creepy when it happens lol like I will be sitting with my friend and she asks about my abuse or something and I will start smiling when I’m talking but at the same time tears are like uncontrollably flowing and I’m sobbing the whole time

I don’t know what this is?? I try not to do it but I cant. I just want to know if this is normal because I really didn’t find like any results"
980,I think I'm too sensitive and I really don't like it,"If someone insults me, makes fun of me or I see something I don't like, it stays on my mind for ages even if it was just something small and it kills me entire mood. Last night J was on a gaming app for the game Werewolf and I did something wrong because I was tired, so everyone started making fun of me and saying I was stupid, it seemed like they were insulting me a little too much and taking the game too far but I should've just shrugged it off. After it though it stayed on my mind and I kept thinking about how annoying the people were. This has happened a lot, occurrences on the internet where people who don't know me have said something to me and although I don't know them and their comments shouldn't affect me, it stays on my mind and I start getting annoyed about someone I don't know and have never even seen in my life.

I deleted the app and I make sure not to comment on posts on social media. I make sure to not interact with strangers in case of the smallest conflict. I want to be able to shrug things of easily, I know I shouldn't care about random people on the internet but I do and I don't know why. I don't talk to too many people, I'm mostly indoors all day, I only really have one real life friend who I see weekly and a few internet friends. Maybe the reason strangers on the internet affect me is because I don't talk to many people as it is. I just want to be normal and not care about what people say.

Oh also, when I start thinking of small occurrences that happended, I think it makes me start working and it causes me to think about bigger things that happened in the past with people not liking me and making fun of me. I want to stop feeling bad about what irrelevant people have to say about me :)"
981,everything is setting my off crying,"i’m constantly on the edge, i’m never stable and my family doesn’t understand.

any little dispute or pressure and i’m crying or shouting and this isn’t like me at all.

i see a therapist and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but it all just seems too much at the moment.

with starting back at school, coronavirus and the rest i just can’t cope."
982,Counting my breath," 

Hello

First off I just wanted to say I have O.c.d

And I do all kind of ticks but I can control them

but there is one that leaves me suicide thoughts

my brain keep counting my breath whenever i have nothing to do

this sometimes appears then it goes away after a month or so it suddenly comes

therapy doesn't help because all they do is give me anti-depressants and tell me things to do that

don't solve the problem

my mom doesn't want me to go there she thinks my problem isn't a big thing

and gets sad whenever i talk about having ticks so i often don't tell her cause she cant help

I just want to know how to stop this counting

i really want to kill myself bc of this

pls help"
983,What is happening to me?,[removed]
984,How I became Stable In Three Months,"
Three months ago I had my first mental breakdown at work. All of the stress from my job added up, and when I tried to get sober, I wasn’t able to handle reality. Feeling overwhelmed I decided that suicide was an acceptable way out.
I quit my job, and my friends managed to get me out of my head, yet I was still unstable. Life went on, and I was miserable; until my girlfriend at the time tried to convince me to seek help. Until that point, I was able to ignore my psyche issues, and when the person I loved pointed them out, that mirror was broken. I was unstable, and now I was being forced to deal with all of my life’s problems. Needless to say, I relapsed and got suicidal, so I did what I thought made sense. I broke up with my girlfriend of three years, and burned the strongest friendship I had. Within a day, I managed to completely separate myself from everyone that supported me. I picked my night, and had my plan. No one knew, no one was going to know, I was acting completely normal, and it was going to stay that way. Then I saw a post on reddit, that said “last week i dropped lsd instead of killing myself” and my cousin offered to trip with me that night. I had a good time for all of two hours, before I was hit by a rampage of emotions, that decimated me completely. I was completely conscious of my bipolar episode happening. I could remember the traumas of my past that I had managed to suppress. The feeling of going from manic hysteria, to hyper depressive, to suicidal, to breakdown crying, to uncontrollable laughter is one I will never forget. The extremes of those emotions, mixed with the perception lsd offered me, allowed me to see all of the small things that  were consciously insignificant, but subconsciously present. I was now perceptive of my demons, and I had total understanding of my emotional problems. A lot happened that night, the culmination of which was the meeting of my savior, a girl I had known of, and had gone to high school with who showed up at my house to check on me after seeing my bipolar episode on my snapchat. I had just broken up with the love of my life, and was in a manic state. And in that emotional vulnerability, I latched onto this girl completely and totally, and the kicker was, she was as fucked in the head as I was, and was very into lsd as well. Fast forward a week, we had tripped together basically every day, taking more and more lsd, trying to get that same feeling as before, but in an effort to rewire my brain, or understand it better. This girl, who was unstable, latched onto me, the same way. Our first week of knowing each other, we spent over 100 hours together. We were sleeping over, and supporting each other, and things were good. And then she got stable, and she realized that she wasn’t going to be able to be in love with me. And that killed me. And I gave up, and that night was my only ever bad-bad trip. After that day, I saw a psychiatrist, and got diagnosed with major depression, an anxiety disorder, and a personality disorder; and was prescribed ssri’s and anxiety meds. And then, this girl, who i had totally fallen for, who understood how my head worked, and who didn’t feel the same, didn’t just give up on me. She was the first person to ever stay around without manipulating me, she had options and she was choosing to hang with me, simply because she liked me for who I was. That feeling, that self-awareness of that fact, that I did nothing wrong in the relationship, and that it was literally just her heart saying things wouldn’t work out. For the first time maybe ever, I had an adult relationship, with someone that i trusted, was comfortable with, and that understood me. That was the first time I ever became conscious of love. I realized my problem with relationships stemmed from my addiction to sex which ultimately dominated every aspect of every relationship up until that point. My personality disorder manifests as an addict, and it has control of my impulses and compulsions. Likely, it was created in response to my sexual trauma, and instead of creating panic, I became obsessed. Ultimately, by the time high school had come around it had manifested fully as an addiction. Every action I took was to fuel the only thing that still made me feel anything, and I started to figure out the best way to do that. My personality disorder gives me a sixth sense of sorts for trauma. So I found emotionally damaged girls, girls with trauma, girls who had dealt with abuse, and mental illness, and Iatched onto them. The cycle has gone the same in every relationship Ive had. It starts with the sole intention to have sex, and in pursuing that, I give total unconditional love, and support, and these girls become attached while they are emotionally vulnerable, and then because of constant support, they become stable. The first girl I did this to, it took a year, and then she realized that she didn’t feel the same way when she wasn’t emotionally distraught, and was no longer interested in a sexual relationship. The addict took control, and she got hurt. I didn’t have a name for the dissociative state I was in, and was raised to not use my compulsions as an excuse. So to me, I blamed myself wholly, and totally, which is fair, but not quite the whole story. I was aware of my demon at that point. My addiction. And I became self aware of it when I not only lost the only person I cared about most, but traumatized for the rest of her life concurrently. I couldn’t deal with that reality. That was what drove me to suicide for the first time. I was fully manic, feeling despair, and experiencing total hopelessness, I took pills until I died. I woke up in a puddle of vomit. I didn’t see a doctor, I got in the shower, and cleaned myself. I was a failure at everything, including suicide. I gave up, and existed for my addiction. And that self destructive cycle, of love, and loss, became predictable. That predictability is what drove my final hopelessness, and ultimately is what drove me to finally do better. That predictability is what made me break up with most recent girlfriend (3 years), in that we were falling apart, and I didn’t want to wait for her to move on from me. When I didn’t try to kill myself the night I did lsd for the first time, I realized that the cycle wasn’t set in stone, and that I could change it. Then I did. Instead of letting the relationship implode, causing irreparable damage, we separated while we could still work on things in the future. I determined I needed to fix myself first, and so I started my conquest for happiness. The thoughts of suicide never go away, the obsession never goes away, the compulsion never goes away, but I am giving everything I have to kill my addiction. In the last three months I have had 3 suicidal episodes, 2 bouts of self harm, countless panic attacks, developed an eating disorder, lost most of my friends, lost hope, and given up. The kicker is, the girl who showed up that night, my savior, has stood by my side through all of it. Even after she realized she wasn’t in love with me. She is my best friend, and my lifeline, and I realized that the way I felt with my other relationships, that overwhelming feeling in my heart, was my addiction manifesting. The feeling I felt from this new girl, the unconditional support, the level of trust, and respect ultimately has led me to realize what love truly is. In the last three months, I have worked on fixing my relationship with my ex-girlfriend, patched up my relationship with my ex-best friend, started a support group for suicidal people, started college, reconnected with my brother, and have been improving myself every day. Five days ago, I thought I was stable. Four days ago one of the kids I have been helping gave me his final goodbye. I was the only one to get it, and I couldn’t handle that. I connected with this kid, he supported me, and i supported him, it didn’t matter our history, it was unconditional. Thats what I needed, I think it’s what he needed, and I know it wasn’t my fault. So to deal with that fact, that I did nothing wrong, I ignored it. Three days ago, I stopped a suicide. Two days ago I started seeking to help people unconditionally. Yesterday, his death hit me. On my way to school. I cried for over an hour. I told more people my story, than I have ever told in my life. And I know now that I am totally stable. I lost someone that I loved, and I made it through. 

If there is any advice I can give to anyone that is suicidal out there, it’s this: 

-Don’t let yourself feel hopeless, anxiety is fine, sadness is fine, depression is fine, they are all normal, and you can cope with them. Hopelessness is what gets you fucking killed.
-The number one thing I can tell you to do is find a way out of your head. Find whatever it is in the world that breaks those manic cyclical thoughts.  Then hold onto it with all you have. 
-Talk to people that understand you
-Find whatever little things make you happy and hold onto them with everything you are. For me it’s those I love, and sunrises. Never in a million years did I think sunrises would make me feel happy, but here I am, and I haven’t missed one in three months.

Sorry about the long post, just have been trying to word this for three months. Please have a good day, and try to find your peace."

986,How can I get rid of my anger I can't live this way forever..,"I feel like I have so many good reasons to be angry, but  I realise it's not productive or good for me at all. I've been angry my whole life, due to being misunderstood really and having a serious untreated mental illness (which is thankfully being treated now). I'm not violent or dangerous in my anger, it's mostly something I express alone. I'm angry mainly because of the way the world is right now, the way people get mistreated constantly, the way people are just blatantly ignorant and refuse too consider any other perspectives. I'm angry at myself for being a NEET that has never done anything that ever mattered in my short existence. I feel like i've wasted my entire life so far. 

I'm angry that my problems were not taken seriously for such a long time, and I often think where I could be in life by now if things didn't escalate to this point and I was treated 10 years ago. Lots of stuff I read on the internet makes me really upset and disappointed in humanity, but I can't just ignore it, I have to know. I want to let go of my anger but how the fuck can I do that when I feel so strongly about these things. I feel like the world is just an awful place, and I wish I could fix it but I can't do anything at all. I'm so tired of the amount of hate, the lack of acceptance everything. This probably comes of a bit cringe maybe but I have to express the way I feel. I want to change and let go but I can't, I don't know how. It's like all I have ever known is anger, fuck I feel angry just typing this, I don't want to be angry anymore I want to be happy."

988,To the people who have found therapists they like...,"How did you find your therapist? Did you try other therapists before choosing this one? Do you feel like your therapy sessions are “productive” and work intensive or more like a friendly conversation? Do you think there are good and bad therapists, or do you think you get into what you put out of it?

I have been in and out of therapy with different therapists my entire life. I have had four therapists in the last five years and while I’ve absolutely made progress with some of them, none of them have really been what I wanted. I always feel like we spend a lot more time doing friendly small talk than we do actually working on problems. I want to spend therapy doing intense work and getting better, and it’s frustrating to pay $60 a week for what can feel like a conversation with a friend. I am wondering if maybe my expectations are the issue."
989,should i tell my parents how i feel,my parents are just ~bad~ and have caused a lot of trauma in my childhood and are continuing to do so every single day. they know my mental health is very very poor especially rn but they continue to make everyday so so so exhausting for me. i’m not in a situation to move out and i don’t have anyone to stay with long term so I have to live with them but every day i hear that i’m not wanted at home. idk whether to continue to hole up in my room and just push through their hurtful words until i can move out and be happier or should i genuinely talk to them about how i feel and the fact that i’m borderline su*cidal? has anyone had any experience telling their parents stuff like this and how did it go 🥺
990,21 (M) ex-boyfriend appears to be avoiding talking to me because I had mental health issues 22 (F),"What do you do about an ex that broke up with you due to mental health issues? PTSD from sexual assault, depression, and miscarriage combination. Couldn't stop crying, the therapist was bad, and I felt like my ex wouldn't listen to me when I tried to tell him there was something wrong with me. My personality had completely changed not by choice. He broke up with me during a panic attack and ghosted me for 3 months. He came back into my life sweetly with a song he wrote for me. He didn't know about the miscarriage so I told him, and now he won't talk. I sent him a considerate message yesterday that I'm trying to be empathetic and understanding of how he might be feeling the past month and finding out about the miscarriage that happened in March in August when he finally decided to stop ghosting me, but I need him to communicate with me regarding what would be healthy for him. He keeps unfriending me and then friending me. Very confused. I need his empathy too right now. It feels like an additional slap in the face after the panic attack break-up. Why did he come back if he won't pick up my calls or meet to have a mature conversation about what happened in our relationship? I just want the guy I was with a year ago back. He's acting so cold when last year he was so supportive. "
991,I feel ungrateful for dreading the visit to my parents?? What's wrong with me?,"I am fine when I initially plan it but I dread going to visit my parents. My parents have done everything for me financially and I feel so guilty for feeling like this. They have always protected me made me center of their world. 

I live with my SO and little kid now but whenever I am visiting my parents I dread it. It feels like I will throw up and I want to cancel but I know it will be hurtful since they are expecting to see me. 

I haven't visited for 3 months already because of this feeling and also because they argued the last time I saw them when I visited after 1-2 months. 

After that I just wanted to go home.

 I made an excuse everytime for the past 3 months to not visit them.

I feel so guilty. I don't know whats wrong with me?

I grew up with my dad being out of the picture for many years because of work. till I was a teen and then all I remember is my parents fighting, blaming each other.

Whether they were together or separated all i remember is arguing, yelling, picking fights with each other, taunting each other. And whenever one got a chance alone the other talked shit behind their back and they still do whenever they see me. 

And it drains me. I can't deal with it. Growing up and even now when I dread happiness. Whenever I get too happy I remind myself that I will get punished or something will happen to ruin it. 

New year's, birthdays, holidays I anticipate all of them with a little fear in the back of my head that something will go wrong. My SO makes sure usually that nothing happens and does a very good job at distracting me from those thoughts. 

But the thought of spending a weekend over at their house is making me nauseous. I can't drive due to my leg injury recently and my SO can't drop me because of work and everything else so my dad will pick me up. And being inside a car with him for 4 hours is making me feel not good.

I feel like for all the years they have financially helped me and made sure I lacked nothing I am being ungrateful for acting like this. 

Is this normal?? Does anyone else feel like this? I feel like an ungrateful being for acting like this. I should be grateful for everything they do or did for me...why am I like this?"
992,My Life Feels So Empty Sometimes (19M),"I’m currently lying in bed right now like I’ve been doing on and off all day long. I don’t have any schoolwork that needs to be done urgently, and I don’t have to go to my job today. I should be happy with all my free time, but I feel absolutely awful. I don’t have any sort of hobby or project that I can bring myself to work out. Even my fantasy writing hobby, which I thought would make me feel motivated, feels like such a chore right now that I don’t even know if I should keep going on with it.

994,The small stuff,"Sometimes it really is the small things that you need to flip your mood straight back around.

I had a huge argument with my 3 month old baby girl's dad last Wednesday and ever since we haven't been seeing eye to eye. She's been going to his house but we've barely spoke. There is still a lot of feelings lingering from both of us but we both have to do a lot of growing as people.

Ever since I've been feeling less than amazing. My depression has dug its heels in and refused to budge. I've slept excessive amounts and been really unmotivated. My bullet journal has had nothing but migrated or uncompleted tasks and even what I have managed to achieve has been the small things I've felt able to do.

I've had clothes piling up in my room for over a week now that has just seemed like an almighty task that I've never got round to. 

Today I've cleared the pile and can see that part of my floor again. The task that felt so unachievable so much effort and work has finally been completed and honestly it's a huge weight off. 

Finally feeling more positive and ready to face the day tomorrow.

For anyone feeling stuck in a hard place right now just take it day by day. Do the small and achievable things and don't sweat what you can't do. You'll get there it just takes time😁"

I can't handle being near windows or anything that feels open or crowded and leaving the house feels god damn horrifying, it has really affected my ability to got to school and work. I've had it on my chest building up for years but i still feel too scared to tell them because i really didn't want to make them upset or ruin their own  sense of safety, yet I  also want to do something about it  to get better and i feel a bit lost about what i should do."
997,"Please help me, I dont know what to do, and nobody would understand.","I obsess constantly of the thought of mass murder, and particularly targeting the female gender, all I can think about sometimes is how itd be if I could get a hold of a female, and put my hands around her neck, and choke her until her eyes rolled into the back of her head, and watch her kick and struggle, I get the urge to make women suffer. 

It's not even a sexual thing, I sometimes self harm myself while watching pornography, that way I can just spite the female, that they dont arouse me sexually anymore, that I'd rather be in pain than be attracted to them. 

Everywhere I go, I feel like women can hear my thoughts, I feel like they always treat me with hostility, always, they always roll their eyes when I speak, always look at me and cringe, I just genuinely with every fiber of my being, hate women. 

Idk what to do, sometimes i really really want to cause women suffering and pain, just like what my whole lonely life has been, but than, sometimes I really don't mind women, and they seem nice to me... 

But than, another female acting as if I'm disgusting, just for me existing, just for me breathing, why do women feel so entitled to treat men so horribly? 

Idk what to do, I get sexual urges and sometimes I just want to go out, hunt down a female, and force her. There would be nothing she could do, and in the end I could shoot myself, just to show the world how pointless life is. Life doesn't matter, life doesn't mean anything. The world revolves around women basically. And i hate them. 

I just want to be normal, is suicide the only answer?"
998,"Autism, black/white thinking,","Hi,

I'm not native English so In advance sorry for my bad grammar.

Maybe it's a bit of venting as well but my mind is just.. crashing or something. Can't even find a word to explain.

A lot of times I get overwhelmed by things and it really feels like my brain crashing when people say different things about the same situation.

I have a problem with my foot for over 8 weeks now. I love walking (I did a lot). But the last 8 weeks I can't walk. Went to a doctor after about two weeks, send to hospital for photos, nothing to see, two weeks later again to doctor, hospital, photos. And then they did see something. So they put plaster(? Really don't know the english word for it sorry) on it. After two weeks they called.  I still wasnt able to use my foot.  So another two weeks (untikl today) and today was the removal and again photos they said two weeks ago.
So today at the hospital they first diddnt want to make pictures. My brain crashed, luckely somebody was with me, and then they did make pictures.   The woman that made the picture said something like there was still something wrong. Back to the other person it was 'ok' nothing wrong.  She also mentiond that on the other picture (from 4 weeks ago) they diddnt see anything.  
In the hospital my brain just stopped working and I hate it. I can't handle the different information over and over 'you can walk but stop if it hurts'. I said that then I can't walk.  But i should be able to.  What pain is the point to stop walking if you can't put any weight on your foot? I don't get it.
So went home. 6 hours later the hospital called me.   Now they see something on todays picture but don't know what. So I will get a scan. Because I'm still in a lot off pain.

But how to deal with all this? I'm still in discussion about having autism(I have it but accepting is a hard thing). I really only can see black or white.  So there is something wrong or nothing.  So if they see there is nothing I can't feel pain. I should stop complaning and just walk. And there is something on the pictures or not. I really don't get it why it depends on who is watching at the picture.

I'm suicidal for a very long time. Walking helped me most of the time and now I havent really been outside in 8 weeks. I really hate my life. I can't deal with everybody saying something different. And most Of the time the opposite. 
In therapy i'm talking about my past but I shouldnt it was wrong. I need to keep my mouth shut.

I really don't know what to do anymore and everybody is making everything worse by saying different things all the time. It's feels like I need to make a list of what people think so I know how to act around those people and be like a puppet or something"

1000,I broke down yesterday.,"Ok so this is my first post on here. Im a junior majoring in Civil Engineering. The last two years I had my struggles here and ther like everyone, but at the end I managed to keep all my grades as As and Bs. 

This semester Im taking the same number of classes but something is different. I took my first test a week ago, and I had prepared for it so well. During the exam I seemed to not recognize some problems, and the ones I did recognize, I made silly mistakes like forgetting a sign or integrating instead of differentiating. Point is, I was shook, my hands were shaking and I blanked out on a lot of the stuff I had studied. 

I had my second exam of the semester today, different class though. I again, studied for it, and solved yhe practice exam easily. And the professor had said that we should only look at HWs and the PT. On the test today, he put a twist in one of the problems, and neither I nor anybody in my group of friends, most of which have As and Bs the past semesters, could figure it out. And it was not surprising to find out the rest of our classmates couldnt figure it out easier. 

Yesterday I broke down. I started crying uncontrollably out of nowhere. I am shook, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever, I do not trust a single answer that I write down, I feel like I my mental health is crumbling. 

I deal with stress in the worst ways, I pull my hair out, sometimes I beat myself mentally and physically, and I constantly blame myself for everything that goes wrong in my life. I know this is not healthy, and I am trying to change but it takes time. This is something only my best friend knows about but I am sharing it to get it off my chest. 

For the first time in my college career I feel like I have no control over my future or graduation whatsoever. 

I automatically jumped to the conclusion that I might not graduate, and that I would let myself and my family down and all the time and money would go to waste, and its a toxic mindset. 


I know there is always a way out, and that all success comes with pain, but I dont want the way I deal with that pain to destroy me mentally. 

Any advice would really help at this time. Thank you"

1003,Brain Damage,"Hi guys...I've never posted anything here before, or even considered it really, but sometimes stuff just gets to be too much and I needed somewhere to unload. Thank you so much to anyone who's listening. 

I just...can't believe what has happened in my life. What I've done to myself, and it honestly seems to hopeless. I've lost everything about who I was. Growing up through my first few years of college, I was always pretty socially awkward, but the one thing I had going for me was that I was pretty damn smart. I never really appreciated this, just kind of lived it, not really understanding how much of a blessing it is to be so conscious and alive, let alone effortlessly right and adaptive like I was. 

Then I started smoking weed. And kept doing it, a lot, for a few years. And then wasted away at home after college with mental health problems born, most likely, from the weed's damage, for another few years. Now I can't even move from one idea to the next without great strain. I can't find the present moment, or see what I'm looking at, to save my life. My memory, once instantaneous and essentially perfect, is now non-existent. I pause to think when doing unbelievably basic things like sorting laundry or paying with card at a register. I feel so distinctly why weed can lead to schizophrenia -- total disintegration from any constant sense of reality, living only in the feelings of each moment with almost no memory or connection with others past or present. I will find myself doing things that I can only describe, in the most self-referential and clinical terms, as retarded. Even after months of devoting essentially my entire life to regrowing my brain with reading, writing, etc., the changes are noticeable, but so too are the things that aren't changing -- basic structural deficiencies, I think, that are probably permanent. And it's not depression that's causing it. I've been on and off meds, and re-worked my psychology as much as possible to center my life and emotional well being around growth so that I'm not constantly depressed by what happened and my current state. High periods are obviously more functional than low, but the range is consistently abysmal. If this were just a case of becoming less smart, I would be able to get over it. But I threw away everything around which I was built, my mind, my consciousness, my self. A lot of it probably forever. 

As someone with borderline Aspergers, my mind was the only thing keeping me functional and competent in society. Now...I'm absolutely broken in every way, and that's no exaggeration.  Even after years of trying to get over it all, the regret and anguish over the life I gave up, for the one I now have before me, is often more than I can bear. 

Thanks for listening, anyone who is. One day at a time."
1004,"My mom says my BPD/Mental state needs to get better ""or else""","So for backstory/context: I have anxiety disorder, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder, and this week a chat with my therapist revealed I fit into more than enough of the 9 traits of BPD that he is helping me get a ""proper"" assessment, but that's just for the legal stuff. I know I have it, or at the very least I can't deny I have these symptoms that stack up to this logical conclusion. I've been pretty sure about this for almost a year now, but I suppose I was too ashamed and scared to ask my therapist. Not because he's not great or anything, just because there are some things that are embarrassing about BPD. I'm not trying to self-diagnose, but I can at least say with certainty those symptoms are present.   
\- Also, I should note at the moment I live at home with my older brother, older sister, and mother in a rather small but ""cozy"" house. I haven't gone out for a walk or anything because my family is all vulnerable and I worry.   
\- Final thing to mention: Everyone in my family has OCD and some degree of anxiety/depression, so you'd expect they all understand mental struggle.   


Anyway, four days ago my mom and I sat down to discuss how exhausted she is dealing with me. She says I yell and cuss too much, my anger is ridiculously short-fused, and I don't have much regard for myself. I agreed and told her what conclusion I had come to and how I was seeking help (at this time waiting for my appointment with the prior mentioned therapist) but that I couldn't just change for her. It's not something I can flip a switch on or off for, but God, wouldn't that be a blessing? She warned me that if I lashed out again, she was ""done"".   


Yesterday, after two days of bottling up everything in an attempt not to upset my mother, my sister and I had a discussion about her personal qualms and we apparently raised our voices though there wasn't any screaming, my brother verified we raised our voices but we didn't get into a fight. He was in the living room as well, so he wasn't eavesdropping we were just all three in the living room. My mom suddenly came storming out of her bedroom shouting ""I can hear you both and you're stressing me out!"" and cut my sister and I off. Now she(sister) and I are even more at odds as we were cut off and she refuses to talk anymore.   


This morning I woke up and was literally immediately sat down by my mom to discuss how I was ""back at square one"". I asked her if she expected me to just change over night and she said that if I didn't, she wasn't going to put up with me anymore. I needed to stop or else. I'll admit my fuse is short, I'll admit my OCD has been getting worse during the pandemic, but I also am internalizing my emotions as best I can to avoid this threatening finality from my mom. I asked her what she was going to do, if it was some threat like she was going to give me an ultimatum, but she just said ""I never threatened you, don't put words in my mouth."" I was shocked at this response because ""I'm done with you"" and ""or else"" are threatening in nature, albeit not outright threats.   


Now don't get me wrong, I'm hell to live with sometimes. I understand that, and after talking to my therapist I also understand that considering what we've come to conclude, I can accept now that I'm not on the same level as my other family members in terms of my emotional state. I know they don't understand that nothing is personal, they don't understand that despite the constant fighting I don't enjoy drama, and I'm scared to tell them of the way I'll hide in my room and scratch up my arms to redirect my mental pain. Also yes, I did tell my therapist this, and we discussed various coping mechanisms to try and stop this. I'm not suicidal, by that I mean I don't want to die, but I do believe I'm just a source of stress with no merit. There's a quote from the song ""Reasons To Stay"" that can explain it in simple words: ""I don't wanna die, just don't wanna live."" I've tried to explain to my mom that if she just gives up on me, I'm terrified of what my mind will do. In the past I've thought about actually killing myself, but I resolved that I have my mother that loves me, and I wouldn't hurt her by doing something so permanent.   


However, my mom has in these talks (3 now) each time said she is done, it needs to change or else, and has also commented this last time that I'm not on the lease for our house so she can force me to leave at any point she feels. This. Is. Terrifying. People with BPD or something similar will understand how terrifying it is to be told you're going to be tossed aside if you can't turn off your behavior. As I said, my mom has kept me alive. I'm genuinely scared that if she gives up on me I won't be able to reason myself out of doing something I'll regret. I get a panic attack every time she says one of those three things, and it only elevates my behavior, which makes her angrier, which makes me more scared.   


I need some advice. I have a clinic, but it's a really crappy place. My case manager changes at least two times a month as they're constantly coming and going, there's only 2 therapists in the entire clinic, only 3 people who can prescribe medication, and I've really been considering trying to find somewhere better. But during the pandemic I don't want to have to go in for a consultation or anything which would be required to be taken on by a new place.   
So, I'm trying to find a way to at least pretend I'm doing better, but yes I realize how completely unhealthy and harmful that is. But I feel like lying and locking myself in my room is the best way to never lash out and cause her to just snap. I'm petrified, and despite my many attempts to explain I can't just change on a dime, she insists that she shouldn't have to deal with my behavior anymore. I don't know what to do. Sorry this was a bit of a rant, I just... feel so alone and scared."
1005,I need some help,"Some background; I've been dealing with some mild to severe depression over the past month and a half. I went to my doctor and he prescribed me antidepressants to last until my psychiatrist appointment. My meds have run out and my appointment is only on Wednesday. 

As of today and as of writing this I'm feeling the lowest of lows I've felt in a few weeks. I no longer want to be alive, am having suicidal thoughts and thoughts of cutting. The last time I cut was 5-6 years ago. I don't think I'll go back to it but it's a gnawing thought in my brain to make me think it will make me feel better.

I'm trying to be strong and not cave into anything as my appointment is so soon and I've made it this far already. I'm just really struggling to level my head enough to even go sleep for the night. Any simple words of advice would be appreciated. It's just been a really rough time."
1006,How to Help/Talk to someone you barely know?,"Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I have no idea where else I could. If this post isn't appropriate here please tell me and redirect me to a subreddit where it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't about me but someone else. One week ago I got a friend request on Facebook from this guy I went to high school with; we weren't friends but we had some classes together. Anyway, I accepted it and I'm kind of worried. I was snoopy on his page and I've seen some post he has written; ""God, I'm so fucking sick of this life..."" and ""Fuck my life.. I never thought I could feel this all alone still, after moving back with the family"", he has said more but I don't want to write out everything.

From what I read he has two kids and the *^(baby mama)* isn't letting him see or talk to his children. I guess also that she calls the cops and Children's Aid Society on him all the time - just cause he wants to see his kids? I don't know the whole story, so yeah it shouldn't be my problem but I care, like I don't believe anyone should be unhappy with their life. Especially him though, he has two young kids and I don't want them to lose their dad - my brother lost his dad to mental illness, so I know what it's like from the child's point of view, my brother has been different ever since. 

Is there anything I could do? Yeah I could message him but he'll probably tell me to ""mine my own business"" or read it and not respond. It's hard, I don't know what to do cause I barely know him, like we probably never had a conversation before, is it going to look weird if I just start talking to him and asking if everything is okay? I don't want to see one day that he ended his life, I would feel so horrible cause I could've said something. He's 24, still very young and it's sad to see that he just wants to end it all. I do also have depression (major depressive disorder - what my psychiatrist diagnosed me with"" so maybe I don't know what I'm doing.."
1007,Has anyone else self isolated because they couldn’t handle any judgement or frowned on themselves so much?,"I have been isolated for most of the last couple years. Apart from my family and a select few friends, I really avoided people. I really hated myself for a while and felt like people frowned on me. I still frown on myself, just not as much as I used to. I still feel like most people frown on me, despite not talking to them for years or having a specific bad experience with them. I don’t know why I can’t shake these feelings. I used to be very active on social media growing up. Now, I barely post anything. Does anyone else struggle with anything similar?"
1008,What can I do? Ive been having bad anxiety and have been really paranoid lately and I want to get mental health help but I'm afraid ill get kicked out if I do since I'm an adult im in the United States,Any advice helps
1009,I don't want to be on medication anymore,"Does anyone have experience with going off of psych medication? 

I have been on meds for 6 years and I have made a lot of progress on my mental health--I used to self harm several times every day for years, been in and out of pysch hospitals, that kind of thing, and now I'm almost 4 years free of self harm, haven't been to a psych hospital for 2.5 years (I consider it more like 3.5 years since the last one was caused by a TBI) and I'm generally stable, with normal depressive episodes and anxiety but nothing I can't handle. 

So I really want to go off meds. But I want to understand first what I'm getting into. I know everyone is unique, but I'm curious like...how much harder is it to handle depressive episodes and daily stressors without meds? I barely remember a time before meds since I'm still pretty young. What do you wish you knew before going off meds? Anything that surprised you?

Not honestly sure if this is the best place to ask so let me know if there's a better place, please!"

1011,Just need some help,"So i guess i will start off by saying 2020 has been kicking my ass. It wasn't to bad until about 3 months  ago when i horrible chain of events all started to happen:

1. A friend i was very close with in high school committed suicide. That one messed with me a bit but after a week or so of grieving i came to accept it.
2. A week later my wife and i  got into a argument and she admitted she wasn't sure if she wanted to stay in the marriage anymore. this one took me off my feet and i didn't see it coming. we sat down and talked about it for awhile. I don't know what i would do without her. 
3. 1 more week passes and i get a call from my dad at 9pm which is very unusual for me to call me anytime after 6pm. He was calling to let me know that my 20 year old sister died and they were claiming it was complications to pregnancy. she was 8 months ago and they were not able to save the baby ether. 

After all this took place i sat around and didn't know what to do for a month or so. I am completely lost because usually when i am going thru stuff my wife is by my side. she is there but is dealing with her feeling of resentment towards me. I understand all the issues we argued about and admit that i was wrong in all aspects. But its rough when the one person that has always been your rock is gone. 

Yesterday i went and saw a therapist to figure out what i can do to fix everything that is going on. we sat there and talked for about 35 mins when she looked at me and told me as much as she wants to help she thinks that i need a higher level of help. she then recommended me to the crisis center at our local hospital. 

today i went into said center after setting up a baby sitter for my kids since my wife was working. They were kind of helpful but didn't really do anything since there crisis stabilization unit was disbanded. all they did was set me up with a list of psychologists that i could get ahold of. i called every single one on the list and the closest i was able to get was nov 28th. I am trying to hold out till and see about getting on some meds as i have a long family history of depression, anxiety and bipolar. i just want to feel normal again and have a happy family as both me and my wife come from broken homes and i truly love her and would do anything to make her happy again"
1012,Getting all my feelings down,"Basically, you know that metaphor, light at the end of the tunnel? I guess you could say I’ve kind of fallen over.

I’ve never had many friends, so I don’t really have anyone to talk to. 

I really want to make a change in the world, I either want to become a writer or a microbiologist (curing diseases and all that). But I guess I’m impatient, I want to do something now but I don’t know what.

1015,Types Of Mental Health Problems,"Hey there all! Massive massive apologies for not posting yesterday on this sub, I was extremely busy! 

Today is the 18th day of **Suicide Prevention Month** and for some of you, you are new to the Mental Health. It’s unfortunate that you’re here with us, but at the same time, I am more than confident to say that you’ll learn many different things while lurking on the sub. With Mental Health, there are many different types of Mental Health. Down below, I’ll be naming each one of them. If you’re experiencing one of these, don’t be ashamed or afraid to speak out and receive the support you need and deserve. 

Learning just a few brief things about Mental Health problems is able to help you feel a lot more freely and more confident about listening and talking. Here are a few examples or types of Mental Health problems:

- Anxiety/Panic Attacks
- Depression
- Eating Disorder
- Bipolar Disorder
- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
- Psychosis
- Schizophrenia 
- Personality Disorder
- PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)
- Schizoaffective Disorder
- Suicidal Feelings
- Self-Harming

**Anxiety/Panic Attacks**

For example, when you feel stressed, tense, worried about something, feeling uneasy or scared. 

**Depression**

A very low mood. This can affect someone for a very long time, in which it would also affect their everyday life. 

**Eating Disorder**

Unhealthy thoughts, behaviour or feelings around food. 

**Bipolar Disorder**

When your mood can shift from extreme periods of low (depressed) to high (manic) moods. In the past, Bipolar Disorder was called “Manic Disorder”. 

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**

Also known as OCD, is a diagnosis that is given to someone who experiences compulsive behaviour and obsessive thoughts. 

**Psychosis**

When a person perceives or sees the world in a different way or fashion than anybody else. For example, what the person experiences, views and believes in things. 

**Schizophrenia**

Affects the way a person is able to think. 

**Personality Disorder** 

Personality Disorder can affect how a person copes with day to day life, how they manage relationships and how they behave and feel. 

**PTSD**

PTSD is a diagnosis that is given to people who have developed symptoms (a certain set) that followed a traumatic event. 

**Schizoaffective Disorder**

It’s able to affect a person’s mood and how they behave and their thoughts. 

**Suicidal Feelings**

When someone’s has been thinking about or has intentions of taking one’s own life. 

**Self-Harm**

When someone purposefully hurts themselves, in order to cope with emotional distress. 

If you have or are currently dealing with one of these problems, don’t be afraid to PM and I’ll be more than happy to offer you more informations on these. As I once said, don’t be afraid to speak out, don’t be ashamed. In fact, it’s the complete opposite, by coming out, it will show the strength you have inside of you that you’re willing to get the help and support that you need. 

Stay strong, keep pushing through and keep fighting. 

We all believe in you."
1016,Best medication recommendations,I have ADD/Depression/PTSD &amp; anxiety. I’ve been taking phentermine from my own research and it helps maintain my mood at a calm level. But it’s a weight loss pill and to get it I’ve been scamming the system. So any prescription  recommendations?
1017,How do you handle having one or more therapy/psychiatris/Dr's appointments in a week while working full time?,"For people struggling like me who need a fair amount of mental health support, how do you balance having at least one appointment a week (at different times each week) with your work or school life? I feel bad telling my boss that I have one or more Dr's appointments per week? I know that my mental sanity should have priority over my work life but it's also difficult to keep needing to take time off when there's projects that need to be finished (that need to be worked on during normal 8-5 hours)

I'm just looking for your stories or advice or whatever you want to offer on how you handle or suggest handling things"
1018,I cant take it anymore,"Am i only one whos ocd compulsions are comming to life? Like my ocd told me to not step on the leaf or I will get hurt few minutes later I have fallen and hit my leg baldy.Second time was when I didnt do my prayer my ocd told me if I dont do the prayer I will go to hell and First youtube video on recommended was ""you are going to hell"" it crepped shit out of me oh god I cant take this anymore I want to live normal life is if too much to ask for"
1019,is it healthy for me to keep myself from crying or just generally feeling hopeless?,for context i have OCD and i do this because for are the moments in which my OCD has the most power
1020,My mom is mentally abusing me and I need to get out (22f),"For years she has been mentally abusing me. I can never go to her about ANYTHING cuz she tells me all the time that she doesn’t care about how I feel so that automatically makes me think “well if I tell her shit, she’s not gonna care or just get nasty about it”. I only stayed at home with her cuz she is saying I don’t need to go and spend rent as long im going to school. So that’s what I’ve been doing. But there are so many times where she likes to blame me for everything even tho I’m always distant from her.I distance myself for this reason. She also jumps into conclusion about things without letting me explain. No matter how I try, the nastier she gets and tells me she’s always right. I tell her “why do you keep takin ur word over mine? You don’t know for sure- that’s why I’m explaining what’s going on.” But it’s hopeless. She said even if I didn’t do it, calling me nasty names and nasty scenarios about me and believing stuff I didn’t do, I should ignore it and let her believe that. That doesn’t make sense to me but I also don’t want her to think I’m like that. She has said she will beat me if I don’t apologize. I know you’re probably thinking why I haven’t left. Well, I honestly thought I can just brush it off but it keeps getting worse and worse...I have a friend I can stay with but I can’t take all my things with me cuz I know my mom will try to stop me from leaving. Also, she may destroy all my things (all my things are paid for by me) when I leave. I want to leave with stuff I need rn and come back to get the rest of my things on Monday while she’s at work. I can’t tell if I’m in the wrong but I’m mentally exhausted and feel like I need to get out."
1021,I’ve started having physical tics or stims,"I don’t really know how it started. I’m 20 and I was diagnosed with adhd when I was 11 but my parents never did anything to help me. Mom had a bit of a phobia of doctors and medicine so I was sort of left on my own. I’ve always had repetitive things I’d do without realizing: my leg jittering, tugging on hair, biting at fingers until they became scarred over. But recently my life has become extremely unbalanced and stressful. When my life started getting chaotic I started noticing involuntary twitches and things that I think are tics or stims? I’m kinda at a lost here so I don’t really know what to call them. 

Some of the things I’ve started having is head twitches. My head will jerk to the side randomly and it’s too fast to catch myself and stop. It happens more when I’m thinking about it. 

This weird thing with my hands. When i am stressed I raise my arm up to head height and my hand will flap back and forth rapidly. Like I’m trying to shake off the stress or agitation. I usually stop myself when I notice I’ve started doing it. It’s usually only my right hand but If I’m particularly stressed or grossed out I find myself doing with with both hands. According to my mom I did something like this when I was really young but stopped. 

I’ve become hyper focused on phrases or words. It’s not like Tourette’s where I have to say it. It’s just... words that I find myself muttering to myself randomly when I’m overstimulated or dealing with shit. Weirdly, it’s the word “captain” over and over. And the phrase, “high my names Bruno (my name)” just completely at random. It’s a weird mix of me wanting to say it and not wanting to. And when I’m really overwhelmed or having a panic attack I look like a loon because I’ll just say this stuff over and over. 

I looked it up and apparently this is a sign of autism but I know I don’t have that. But I do have sensory issues where if there’s too much to see and hear and touch I start shutting down and get extremely agitated. Sometimes when I’m really overstimulated I start to like, become distant and my eyes will be blown wide. When I’m out with friends or visiting my parents they know to look out for me suddenly becoming a ghost and my steps get all staggered. 

Is this normal??? What is all this? I have no clue and it’s really concerning how this just came out of nowhere and it’s getting worse for me."
1022,Stuck in limbo,"Seriously stuck between days of feeling motivated and making every effort to help myself and then days of honestly just giving up on everything.

Its causing havoc with everything and idk how to stop it. I lost 10lbs while in a good period of life, I started walking and I was feeling less anxiety and actually hopefully for my future. Now, the past couple weeks I've been back into bad habits of self harm and despair, I've spent money I shouldn't on crap and I've lost the habit of walking and I'm just very irritable and can't get enjoyment from anything.

I'm on antidepressants and beta blockers, I have no clue if they're working at this point 🤷‍♀️

Anyone else feel this?"
1023,What would you say is most important for good mental health in my situation ?,"When i was 27 I went insane and diagnosed with bipolar and as part of a healing exercise I guess I moved to 5 other countries or ran away from it all.

I'm on top of my mental health and feel as good as I did it my early 20s and I'm 36 now 

I have been offered a job in Northern England close to family... potentially may have a job offer in another country or i could move back to London where most of my friends are.

I associated london with the disintegration of my mental health so avoided it like the plague until a few nights ago i had a dream about an old friend and the love I have for my friends and the old life I lived came rushing back and now i feel like i need to move back so started applying for jobs.

So i have 3 potential life possabilities.

1 job close to family in northern england 

2 move abroad again see and experience things few people get the chance to but live a socially isolating life.

3 return to London and reconnect with old friends and reclaim my old life which was amazing prior to going insane.

What do you think is best ? The only thing that puts me off about london is my mental disintegration happened at work resulting in my suing my employer for discriminstion when they sacked me because of it resulting in a settlement signing an NDA and multiple people being fired so my name is mud there and any job there may be difficult and if i succeed what happened will likely trickle back in gossip into any job that I get there and potentially ruin it/ cause stress.

So what should i do?"

1025,music hurts so good since starting new medication,Good music makes me so emotional. I guess its the dissonance.
1026,"I think I'm getting early signs of something, like dementia","To preface, I'm 31 and am in good health. Eat healthy, sleep really well, exercise. I've never been worried about something serious until the last few months. 

Information just drops out of my head lately. I mix things up almost comically. I went to Starbucks today and when I got to the counter I said ""Hi how can I help you?"" Like why?

I'm getting worried. I drop things, forget things, forget names of people I work with every morning. When I drop things it's like I forgot it was in my hand for some reason. 

I make mistakes at work and sometimes customers aren't as angry as they are confused. Like.. ""my order was just lettuce and cheese.""

I'm trying freaking hard, but it's like I have huge patches in my brain where information is just lost. I'm trying to schedule an apt with a CBT, but like what, get on medication and that's that? I don't want to drug myself to fix this and I'm worried I have severe brain damage. 

Now for the dark part:

From like age 2 to 16 I would repeatedly beat my head on hard surfaces, especially bad when I was a toddler. Lots of damage to the front of my head I'm assuming. It was something I did about every day until I was put on hardcore tranquilizers and enrolled into therapy. 

I'm just worried. I don't like that my brain is always going to be broken. I have an amazing life, but lately it's been making me more and more depressed. I don't want to like another forty years with this bum brain. I just let down everyone around me. 

I've been thinking of assisted suicide because the pain of this loss of brain function, disappointing people, always disappointing people.. it's too much. 

I don't know what to do. But I don't like this because it's more than I can handle, feeling my brain slip away from me. 

Drugs, more therapy.. rinse and repeat.. not enough drugs, the wrong drugs.. I'm poor and can't afford drugs and therapy. I've been poetically a nihilist for so long, tried stuffing my guts into his stomach after a rock fall.. heard him say ""I'm okay, I am dying bro."" Maybe it's my turn. I don't like not having full capacity of my brain functions and I'm scared."

1028,Why do I get so emotionally attached to tv shows so easily? Whats wrong with me?,"For the past year or so Ive been having this reoccurring problem and Im so tired of it. I first recall feeling it about 2 years ago during my 7 day Christmas break in high school. Every I watched one of the Harry Potter movies and next day I would watch the next one. For that week I was completely immersed in that world. I felt like I was part of it. I was ""in"" Hogwarts. Then the week ended and I had to go back to my real school. But I dont why i was extremely sad. I cried before going to sleep for a couple nights. I felt like I was leaving that world. Then I would find a TV series or an anime and get so emotionally invested and immersed in it that when I finish it I need multiple weeks if not a month at least to recover emotionally and be able to watch another show. The time it hit me the hardest by far was when I watch Avatar the Last Airbender throughout quarantine this summer. Literally finishing it the DAY BEFORE I restarted school last month. Its been a month I still feel sad thinking back on it. Missing the world and most of all those characters. Its always been the characters I get the most attached to. When I finish the show I feel like im loosing those friends. This happens virtually every time I finish a show. Granted sometimes its less bad then others but I'm so tired of it. I know its pathetic but if anyone has advice I would appreciate it."
1029,I’m worried about the future,"Today I found out I might be being made redundant from my job. Although I have savings and wanted to eventually leave where I was, I wanted to do it on my own terms.

Now I’m worried about what happens next. What will I do? The job wasn’t exactly something I could turn into a career but it allowed me to live comfortably. 

My mental health hasn’t been great this week and today’s news has made me feeling even worse. 

I have friends and family I can talk to, but at the moment I feel a black cloud of sadness creeping over me."
1030,Is it normal to feel tired 24/7?,"I sleep roughly 9 to 10 hours a night, a little longer than normal i know. I'm not a morning person at all and do evening shifts at work, get home late and lay in late. I've struggled with severe depression more than once, but i thought i'd gotten over it for the most part with the help of meds. I got so much better i felt i didn't need the meds anymore and stopped using them. 

But since my first spout of depression way back when in like 2014, no matter how much sleep i get i never really feel ""awake"". I feel mentally and physically exhausted literally 24/7, no matter how much sleep i get, i feel like i haven't slept in weeks. Is this just lingering symptoms of depression or...?"
1031,[18m] Depression due to injury,"I have had very sad events when I was younger. I might have been depressed for half of my life. 
2 years ago I started powerlifting and was really good at it. It was one of the few things that I loved. It was a meaning I have found in a meaningless life, looking forward to my training even on rest days. 

I got injured and it seems bad. I will go to a different doctor. This is not the topic. 

I feel injured, I feel worthless and I feel like I am crippled. I feel like an injured race horse who needs to get shot (I am not suicidal)."
1032,Help me with a phobia..,"Being afraid of the dark or the night is nyctophobia, but in my case its not really that. I am afraid of nights. Not beacuse its dark or ghosts ans stuff. Im afraid that if anything goes wrong, anybody in my friends or family falls seriously ill or has an accident, there will be no help cause its night, everybody is asleep and everything is closed.
Sometimes my anxiety gets worse in the night. Some uninvited thought starts playing in my head and I keep Making it worse with over thinking.
I can't sleep at all. The anxiety keeps fading with the rising sun and the light outside. With the thought of every one is awake and there will be help if necessary. Also Thinking about my mom helps too.
I'm a full grown adult. Currently in quarantine with my family. I'm concerned about my future. And all the situations making me very anxious and having slepless nights no matter how much tired I am.

Some suggestions would be nice."
1033,Geting of zoloft at 50mg,"Got off at 50mg

Hi all,

So Ive beme on zoloft for 4 years at 200mg. 3ish months ago, I went down to 150, 100, and then 50 for 3 weeks and finally quit a week ago. It was going good until yesterday where I got pretty bad anxiety. Before the medication, the only anxiety I had was some social, like participating in class, but that was it. Im not sure what to do. Should I do 25mg then quit? Or should I wait it out? Also, what are some ways to wait it out like coping?

I was NEVER like this. I pick up my phone, better wash my hands. Opened a cabinet, better wash my hands. Picked up the tv remote, better wash my hands. Pressed the power button on my Air conditioner, better wash my hands.

Even after washing my hands, i dont wanna touch the faucet knob. This really REALLY getting outta hand. What couldve caused this 2 years ago?? My hands are SUPER flaky bc i keep washing off my natural oils and im getting rashes.

1039,What should I do?,"Reddit is a terrible place to confide in people, but I have no other choice. I’m a 5th year student at a small university, studying for a dual degree in Computer Information Systems and a Master of Business Administration. I also happen to have a very high G.P.A. (3.89) after four full years of undergrad. I also was invited to a business honors society this spring. Things seem good right? Unfortunately, I don’t believe they are. See, I’m a terrible test taker. I have a very hard time sitting down to read a textbook, and even if I do, I am almost never able to absorb any of the material. This has caused me to cheat on some online exams/quizzes by doing things such as using the textbook or sometimes referring to Chegg Study or Quizlet for answers/to check my answers. By doing so, I was somehow able to pass some of my hardest courses. 

When it comes to my other work (discussions, essays, and projects) all of the work is my own and I have never cheated on these assignments. However, knowing that I have cheated in some proportion makes me feel immensely guilty. I have noticed that I do not remember nearly anything I have learned in my classes (save for a few). I have concluded that this must be because I have not absorbed the material that I was supposed to read about and additionally sometimes cheated on in online quizzes/tests in order to maintain my high G.P.A. I worry that when I graduate I will be thrust into a workforce that expects me to know my stuff, and when I can’t do that, I will be screwed.

Now I can’t help but feel that I should confess to occasionally cheating in some of my courses. In doing so, I would likely be kicked out of my school and be forced to pay back the incredible amount of loans I have without a sustainable job. I have worked so hard in my courses on assignments other than quizzes and tests that if I were to lose the chance to graduate with high honors and get an excellent job after all this work, I would have nothing left to live for. At this point in my life, with no girlfriend or expectation of finding love in my life, few friends, and a lack of skills to get a good job, I would have no choice but to end it. I know that the right thing to do would be to confess, but doing so would cause me to lose everything, leading to my inevitable demise. So I don’t know what to do."
1040,Follow-up: Seeking professional guidance for an online support group I've made!,"  
This post is a follow-up to my previous post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/itm4xn/anyone\_interested\_in\_and\_able\_to\_participate\_in\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/itm4xn/anyone_interested_in_and_able_to_participate_in_a/)

As one who has felt for a long time that I have no effective support group IRL, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own. I've now made a discord group to serve as a communication hub for what I hope will become a real support group. What makes this group different, however, is that meetups take place in apps which allow for members to attend either on their computers or with virtual reality headsets. 

I am seeking professional guidance or advice on how best to keep the suport group activity healthy and organized. VR hardware is not necessary, only access to a PC which can run Steam applications. If anyone is interested in joining the group, volunteering to help, or just seeing what its about, here is the link to the discord:   
[https://discord.com/channels/756338302830903458/756383656959934594](https://discord.com/channels/756338302830903458/756383656959934594)

I am still getting some things figured out and set up, but I am also committed to making sure the members of my group get the best help I can acquire for them. Though I've been educating myself on some academic studies and clinical exercises in positive psychology, I'm not a mental health professional and realize unmoderated activity can cause more harm than good, so I very much appreciate any advice or resources if you have any for me! Thank you for your time :)"
1041,My best friend wants to commit suicide and I don't know what to do because I can't find any reason to live either.,"(Sorry if it's long, I'd appreciate it if you read it in all but I'll make a summary at the end in case you don't want to read it all)

This is being a shitty year.  I have always been a person with very low self-esteem and I’m ridiculous and I feel very bad being around others because they see that I’m stupid.
 Despite all this I have always been very joyful and everyone thinks that I am very happy.

At the beginning of this year I began to feel very bad and I began to wish I had not been born, the world completely lost its sense.  everything is unfair, dark and evil, and I don't understand how human beings can be so cruel and I feel very stupid because things that have nothing to do with me hurt me very deeply.

When the quarantine began here in Spain, I had a terrible time, the months that we were locked up at home I spent all day without leaving my room and I began to distance myself a lot from my friends.  I wasn't talking to them and I thought they’d be better without me.  Those months I couldn't even hear my own voice and when I cried I had to put on my headphones with music because it made me sick to listen to myself.

At the end of April I found out from another friend that my best friend was having a bad time and she and that she didn't want to tell me anything about that, and in the middle of the following month my best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide and that her parents had sent her to the emergency psychiatrist and that she was going to  go to the psychologist.
 I couldn't see her because we were in quarantine and I was incredibly afraid that she would die and that I couldn't do anything, I spent weeks crying every day.

 The days went by and I finally could see her and although she was bad it seemed that in time she would recover.  I felt very guilty and very stupid and I thought I was a shitty friend and that she deserved to have better friends.

Two weeks before ”selectividad” (university entrance exams) my parents divorced.  It was a very unexpected blow because everything seemed fine.  I have spent these months near to my mother because she is so sad, and my father does not speak to me almost anything, it seems that he forgot that he has children.  Sometimes I think that he has never loved me.

 Less than a month ago my grandfather died, I saw him sick and more and more sunken, until he died.  This also affected my mother a lot because he was her father.
 Despite all this I know that my mother will be fine because she is going to the psychologist and little by little I see her better.

 I feel nothing when I meet my friends and I have been selfharming for months to calm my pain.  I keep thinking that everyone secretly dislikes me even though they are nice to me.

 Today my best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide.  It is hard for me to tell her to try to be strong and fight again because I understand what it’s to be so exhausted that you just want to end it all, I am not able to tell her anything so that she understands that life is worth living because I do not find the meaning of life either, I am incapable  to honestly tell her that cutting is wrong because I can't stop doing it myself and I don't understand why.




 [SUMMARY AND END]
 I am an insecure person and I feel stupid around others, this year my best friend is suffering from depression and I have not been able to help her, my parents got divorced, my grandfather has died, I am selfharming after three years  without doing so and i have been having suicidal thoughts for months.
 Best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide and I haven't been able to tell her anything because I can't find a reason not to do it either.

 Now she is in the emergency psychiatrist because I managed to convince her to tell her parents, but she is sure that she is going to do it and I know that she will die because I am stupid and I have never been able to help her.
 She needs a friend who is not a problem anymore, someone who can really help her, not me.
 She is my reason to live and I am not able to do anything now, I feel useless, stupid, garbage!  For this and for everything.

 I need some advice to help her because I don't know what to do !!!!"
1042,I am worried about my friend,My friend is very stressed and has horrible nightmares. I have gone to therapy and it has helped me with my emotional problems and has helped me with coping skills for stress. I have suggested she goes to therapy. She said she would be an inconvenience to her family if she went/suggested the idea. I want her to be happy and not have so much anxiety... can I get any advice for my friend?
1043,Britain may go into a second lockdown. I loath this country.,"So many years wasted away. I thought I was getting my life back, but no. COVID offered the perfect opportunity for my country to embody everything I despise: Infantilization, bureaucracy - the exact mindset thats kept me captive. 'im sorry dear, you'll have to take it up with the council. I want control. I want to be in control."
1044,Is my little sister schizophrenic,[removed]
1045,Quitting weed so far feels like one of the best decisions I have made in the last decade of my life,"So a little background: Im 26M, and Ive had depression since I was in high school. I remember being really tired in class and just sleeping all the time,  having little friends and the ones that were with me I usually pushed away in some form. A lot of this stems from being sexually assaulted when I was young by someone in my family. I harbored so much love for her and it felt like a full on relationship. Being the same age we were always with each other, going out to malls, being at home, going to school together. Most of my childhood is tied to this person and I cant even say we had bad times. 
And because of what happened, to this day she feels like an ex to me and I unfortunately still harbor hate in my heart because of it.

As I grew older I realized the love I had for this person was ""fake love"", and it sent me on a long downward path: I could not be emotionally intimate with almost anyone, friends, teachers, girls, family,  etc.

In junior year cooking class, I met H. H was close friends with my one friend Mitch whom I met through my other friend Kel. I forget how the conversation went but I remember there being a field trip to the food convention and H and I just discovered mutual friends with Mitch, and he mentioned them smoking weed. Curious, I inquired but told them I never smoked weed, but was opened to it. The next thing I knew, I was hitting a water bottle with a tin foil bowl on the mouthpiece, and from then on, I was a full on stoner. I never forget trying to brace myself on a support pillar putting in eyedrops, cause I couldnt lift my head upwards without swaying.

From then on there, I smoked a ton with Mitch. I made friends with some swimmer dudes and we started to smoke as well...every connection I made involved smoking weed, and all the previous connections I made were severed with the sober ones. Pot dictated who I was to hang with, what Im doing, where my money is going. Im not saying pot will do that to you, Im not stupid and I still support legalization.

Because of my past and my depression, weed was a great outlet. When you have a million voices in your head, its perfect to drown out the two voices I did hear: The one that was me tha told me Im useless, and the one that was hers that told me I wasnt good enough for her.

I honestly dont remember having a T break longer than 3 days. Ive had maybe 2 full on breaks, both within the last 3 years, but those lasted maybe 3 weeks at most? Only brought on because I literally spent thousands of dollars on weed, weed pipes, gas masks, screens, lighters, squares, kratom, hookahs, whatever I could do to that encmhanced my weed smoking experience. This went on since junior year to about around last week. Imagine, being high more than you are sober in the last decade. Like im talking probably 70% high, 30% sober in the last decade (for my jobs). Around 2015-2016 I started to hang out with my pot dealer in his trap house, and I wont lie, It was fucking fun. Smoking weed all day, buying weed from him, getting into mushrooms, etc. I could smoke cigarettes indoors and even though I was the all day stoner, it was nothing compared to whippit boy, or Rev DMT, or Methadone Mary (all nicknames, I dont feel like giving out names). My life was engulfed around not just weed, but drugs in general. Im glad I stuck to weed, shrooms, nicotine, kratom, otherwise I most likely would be dead.

I fell out with every one from my drug life around 2 years ago, and I only just decided to quit cold turkey last week. Im not gonna lie, I feel the most motivated Ive ever been, even though my sleep is REALLY fucked up right now. I feel like my sociability is up. I feel like anger doesnt hit me like it used to. Most importantly, It made me realize how much I killed my singing voice (I really really hope I can get that back). How much I was an asshole to others.  How I blamed others for beingdicks to me when it was really my lack of communication skills. I feel completely liberated for the first time in a decade.

Im being realistic here: I dont think I will go cold turkey, but I need to treat it like I do alcohol, which is like maybe once or twice a month. Even then, I want to stay cold turkey until at least Thanksgiving. I need to learn to live again without the high, and so far, I am thoroughly enjoying it.

Dont ever let your headspace get in the way of what you really need in life, because our brains do such a spectacular job of getting what it wants rather than what we need. Look at yourself, and ask yourself how bad you want to be who you want to be in life. I know I will one day fall back into a depressive mood, but the one thing Im trying to make sure of is that I dont make that as an excuse to smoke weed. 

Yall are worth more than some fucking plant."
1046,my journey through madness,https://www.myjourneythroughmadnessuk.tumblr.com
1047,Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness,"As somebody who has called a suicide hotline at least 6 times in the past, none of the operators were helpful. At that point, I gave up calling those hotlines. These people are not trained mental health professionals so they don't really know what to say. They are just trained to listen and answer with ""I'm sorry you are going through that"" and ""Do you think there's anything you could do to lessen those thoughts""? and ""It must be so hard for you"" and ""Do you have a plan?"". It's literally the same phrases every time. So goddamn repetitive and predictable. If I wanted to hear those phrases over and over, I would literally type them in Siri or something. Basically, they just want to offer you some sympathy. People who are actually suicidal don't want your sympathy."
1048,My lack of emphaty and anger issues.,"Since I was a kid, I have been taught that I should try and feel what the person in front of me feels and I was told to put myself in the place of others and stuff. I never really gave a shit about the person in front of me as long as it didn't affect me in a bad way. This year in May, my grandfather who I loved a lot passed away. I went to his funeral, didn't shed a single tear until the priest had kinda forced the family members including me into hugging or kissing the dead body of his (Orthodox Christianity is fucked up). I didn't visit him because he was dead actually, I visited him because he was dying and when I heard that he died I didn't cry. I was like ""eh"". Then I drinked and forced myself to cry while listening to some music on spotify.  


I was pretty violent and vulgar during elementary school. I had to change schools twice. I pulled a knife on a kid the first time, and I hit a wall with a chair the second time. I got into fights during middle school and high school and I don't regret anything I have done. I don't regret beating a kid with a stick, I don't regret hitting the head of a kid against the wall. Until middle school like seventh or eight grade, I did not shake before stuff like this happened. After middle school though, I started to shake when I got nervous or excited. It was around the time I tried to suppress my anger and emotions. I had lots of times where I punched the doors of the toilet cabins during middle school and high school because I was angry. Now, I am better at supressing my anger but I am afraid I might have outbursts again. I am just trying not to socialize in order to avoid these outbursts. I don't regret the outbursts or I am not afraid of them and of what I could do but I am afraid of the consequences.   


I also cannot get enough sleep. I have this feeling of discomfort at night. It's as if something is bugging me and doesn't let me sleep. What I try in order to fix my sleep is to stay awake the whole night and day and then sleep the next night. This usually works for a few days and maybe for a few weeks but eventually I will go back where I started. I will go back where something is bugging my head at night.  


Something is clearly different with me. I choose not to visit a therapist because of their bullshit such as ""breathe slowly"" or ""count to 30"" or whatever. If you guys have any idea of what my ""problem"" might be, that would be nice to know."
1049,"truly BELIEVING I had dissociative identity disorder (DID, or multiple personalities), but I didn't.","I guess I'm writing this for a few reasons. 

1. I want to know if others can relate to my story
2. I want to know if there is some type of syndrome for what I'm describing, or if it's just coping in my own way
3. Spreading awareness of something that isn't talked about

So I'll start off by telling you that I have experienced severe and prolonged trauma and different types of trauma that contributed to a clinical diagnoses of C-PTSD.

The long-term trauma left me in a dark, lonely, desperate place. I was seeking help but the help I needed was not readily available. We can talk about getting someone to call hotlines all day long but there is unfortunately a lack in the mental health services offered and accessible  to everyone. Even with my family's good insurance, it was near impossible to get long-term treatment covered even when I was chronically suicidal. To stay past 30 days in a treatment center means coughing up $30,000+ per month of additional stay. WITH insurance. At the state I was in, I needed at LEAST a 90 day stay, and could not afford more than 45. I left too early. To then return 2 more times. Hospitalized 3 separate times in between for suicidal ideation. 

Without the help I needed I sought help from, yes, the internet. I was looking for validation and acceptance. Hope.

I landed on a youtube video of someone who has DID. My brain was foggy and I was desperate, like I said. I convinced myself that I empathize and relate so much to her story that I must, too, have this disorder. I made up people in my head and made up conversations we ""had"". I spoke about my ""experience"", TRULY believing myself. I did not lie on purpose. I was delusional. I was so dissociated and foggy at this point that I would cling to anything that had an ""answer"" to my suffering. So I went down that rabbit hole. 

I should also mention that due to the trauma, and a failed suicide attempt, I went into a two month period of psychosis before I even went to my first treatment center. I was also heavily using marijuana as another attempt to cope. 

Now, 2 years, 3 treatment centers, and 3 hospitalizations later, I am 6 months sober, I recognize that I do not, in fact, have a dissociative disorder, and I was simply seeking anything I could find to cope at the time. I am in a great place. I haven't had a suicidal thought in 6 months. Reiki was the catalyst to my healing, curiously enough. And now I am quite obsessed with spirituality (while also mindful that I tend to adapt things as an identity when I get too obsessed).

I have thought about the possibility of BPD, but I no longer fit any of the acting out or attention seeking behavior. Could it all come down to just trauma and substance abuse? Or is there a specific name to what I have been going through? Not seeking a diagnosis, maybe just some guidance.

Thanks"
1050,Struggling to do work,"I’m constantly tired, stressed, and rarely motivated. Now I have 3 hours and 59 minutes to finish 4 or 5 assignments, all for one class.

I’ve been stressed but I don’t want to do it out of stress or sadness (I mostly feel numb,) I want to feel this and I want to feel something. I’ve had thoughts like this before but I use sex as a coping mechanism, not usually something like this and I don’t like the thoughts I‘m having. this isn’t something I want to tell my therapist. what can I do? can anyone relate?"
1052,i don’t know what to do...,"i just opened my email for the first time in a while and wow i have some emails from teachers and i just noticed them now. i’ve been putting off school; the term started nearly a month ago and the most i’ve done is about two pages of notes for one subject, psychology. it just feels like it’s holding me back... i can’t stand it. i wish i had the motivation. i have ideas for stories and i like writing. i would be interested in doing acting too but i think i might have social anxiety and i know this sounds dramatic but it sometimes feels like it’s too late for that. i know it’s not true but you know. it feels as if i have to be ready to start uni in two-ish years BUT i would have to have actual experience in acting if i want to be let in otherwise they’d sooner accept a donkey. but anyway forget about that

i feel like i want to talk about the stuff i’ve written about in my posts over the past few months. my first one was here on r/mentalhealth and it was titled “i don’t know”. then after that things went whauUiJjJkIkkajajAAAA. i discovered r/scrupulosity and started being active there too. in april and july there was so much stuff that made me miserable that i spoke of there. i feel kind of messed up but i also feel like i’m secretly an attention-seeker or just trying to find excuses to run away from stuff like school and i’m somehow not noticing that.

on wednesday i think it was, oh and last week too, i was playing roblox and made a few friends, it was just nice light-hearted fun and :,,,)))

i feel like i want a break from school but idk if i need it... and if i did take one, what if it just turns into me not going back and pursuing something else?

a few days ago i just cried idk i felt worthless and thought about my stories and how i might never amount to anything and honestly idk if i was being serious but yeah. idk i’ve kind of become desensitised to self-deprecating talk so i just randomly say “i hate myself” but it doesn’t mean anything but does it? ugh yeah idk"
1053,I feel like the only way to be at peace is to die,"Nothing is getting better and I feel myself deteriorating.

i’m just so stagnant and alone. every day is the same, i don’t even leave my room most days because my classes are online. everyone seems to have friends and i don’t know how they did it. i get eager for the weekend not because it means i’ll have time to hang out and have fun with people but because i’ll have time to lay in bed and throw myself a pity party because everyone’s out and having fun while there’s no one here i could even consider an acquaintance. i cycle through the same 5 apps every friday night and feel sorry for myself and it’s still the best part of my week.

there’s not even anyone to talk to about it. i have no one here. i don’t even think it’s because of COVID limitations. my school has strict rules to keep our cases low (such as not allowing people in your dorm, no one can have a roommate) but it’s still possible to have friends, i just don’t have any. even if we didn’t have socially limiting rules and if we weren’t in a pandemic i feel like i would still be so alone because i don’t know how people made friends. i had the best friends in the world back home and they all went to the same school so it’s not like the group is split up, it’s that it’s completely intact and i’m just not there. 

i literally have no one. my room is a dump. i’m not eating. i haven’t seen anyone in days. and there’s nothing i can do about it. i’m so alone and so hopeless. there’s just no way out of this. please help. how do people meet people how did i ever even make friends before god damn it 

it just seems impossible please help"

We manged  to recover from this financinal crisis and now we can afford buying decent food but my past is still haunting me, because of my past im now obsessed with food i think about food most of the time and when I feel hungry I get a panic attack because it reminds me of the hunger in the past so I lose my mind and I feel suicidal and desperate.

Now I don’t have contact to anyone since I just couldn’t text anyone back anymore, I couldn’t go out to parties I had nothing to talk about.
I sit Infront of my pc and if a friend tries to reach out to me I hate it, I ignore it or find an accuse to not go.
Is this normal depression?
The world feels so different to me now, I feel sick and light sensitive all the time.
I’m so confused bc I don’t feel totally depressed, I get up in the morning, make breakfast and then I just sit Infront of my pc, I cry only sometimes, but I live in misery.
Why don’t I want my friends or the outside world?

I can’t find my voice to ask for help. So I guess this is the next best thing, asking people I don’t know to help me get through something when I don’t even have an idea of what tomorrow is going to look like.

I don’t have any extremely unattractive features and my social skills are decent, so why isn’t anyone interested in me? Is there some sort of secret everyone else knows that I don’t?

Let me be clear that I am not monetized or selling anything. Just wanna help :)"
1063,I cannot stand my job anymore,
1064,How do I get myself to open up to my psychiatrist?,"I've had 4 sessions with my psychiatrist in the past two months, each session was around 45 minutes - 1 hour and I still don't know what mental health issues I'm dealing with. 80% is just silence because every time he asks me a question I give one-word answers.

I was already diagnosed with anxiety a couple of years ago by another psychiatrist. This new psychiatrist thinks it's more complex than just anxiety and it'll take some more sessions to diagnose me properly. He also told me to see a psychologist because only meds will not help me. 

I want to get better and want him to be able to help me but to do this I need to open up to him and be honest about the thoughts in my head, the things I do, etc. I just don't know how. 
I can talk easily with other doctors but when it comes to mental health professionals... idk what happens to me. 

Does anyone have any tips? Also, I think I might have ADHD because I have a lot of the symptoms, should I mention this to him or is it disrespectful and considered self-diagnosis?"
1065,When I sit down to do work/study my anxiety and depression gets 10 times worse. But after 5 minutes it goes away. Why?,"Anyone else? It seems like my demons scream in my ears and bring up every ugly emotions. Then after 5 min they give up and it gets easier.



Why?"
1066,Anger/Anxiety Management,"Hi guys. I currently am diagnosed with OCD (more about obsessive thoughts than compulsive actions), and bipolar disorder. That being said the bipolar aspect had just manifested in the past year while I've been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin. They are currently taking me off Zoloft to go on Aripiprazole 50mg (I was in 100 mg Zoloft, sometimes 150). 

I also smoke sativa and indica fairly regularly. Like two to three bowls a day. That being said I have noticed while I've been slowly weaning off the one med to get on the other that not only am I losing weight, I also am experiencing alot of side effects like naseau, depression, sudden bouts of mania and anger, extreme hair trigger out bursts, and general being an ass sometimes. This wasn't how I was 2 weeks ago. 

So I went into my doc, here in Swansboro NC. He's been seeing me for about 2 years. Well it was later when I stopped in about 40 min from closing. They said go to the ER. I said the ER?! And risk COVID? I just want to know if this is normal and if I should stick with my new meds (only been on them one day). It takes 2 weeks I know. And because my state doesn't allow marijuana usage, I can't really get help in the regard of his it interacts. But I know for a fact I'm better in herb than not. 

Anyway, as a husband and father I need to get this anger and mania under control because my wife said I'm like jekyll and hyde. I was so happy and had way less anger. If any! Help please guys. And btw I for off zoloft because my wife said she noticed I had extreme highs and lows and I needed evening out."

1068,Feeling strange after a nervous breakdown,"Yesterday i had a nervous breakdown. It was so painful and intense. I had it before but this one was the most intense one. Anyway, since i had the last one i've been feeling weird. I can't really explain it, i feel so balanced and strong, (wtf?) like nothing happened. I'm way too chill, or maybe i'm just so numb. It's hard to understand how i feel. Is this normal? I just find it weird because i'm usually depressed and i rarely feel something different"

1070,A little rooftop revelation I had while watching the stars...,"So this is quite the diamond in the rough revelation but fuck it felt great. So I feel like I'm in the same boat as everyone else right now because of COVID, I'm distanced from everyone I care about. I'm about to fail a semester's worth of engineering classes, as far as relationships go, anyone I meet in person that I'd love to be in a relationship with either friend-zones me or I friend-zone them. 80% of the people I considered close friends I rarely make an effort to see because we're only distant friends now at best. But as I'm watching the stars with my knees digging into the chimney so I don't slip off, I realized how much I loved my friends. Not even the group of close friends I mentioned earlier, but the friends I see less than that. The ones that I look forward to seeing, but neither of us make an effort to see each other. I'm talking about the real ones. The ones that you just get along with. You may not hang out all the time, and that's fine. Honestly I don't even want that. I'm just looking forward to the next time we do. Because the really cool thing is this, I'm doing my thing (maybe terribly but I still am), and they're doing their thing. We couldn't do that if we saw each other all the time, but we're all progressing through life the way we want to, and that's really fucking cool.

End note, please don't message me about this or anything. I just thought it's a POV some people could use, because I really needed this. 

Post end note: with your own situation it's good to notice the difference between my situation and yours, but use those differences constructively if you do."

1072,"My friend really needs help, but it's feeling...impossible","My friend (22, lives in Delaware) is going through a lot. He has been having some scary health scares but can't go to the hospital because his healthcare is crazy expensive. His dad has cancer so he lives with him and tries to help as much as he can. He works under the table with a very labor intensive job that he hates and sometimes works 60 hours a week (more or less). He didn't graduate high school, even though he did the full 4 years. This was because the system screwed up and told him he couldn't graduate because of a book he failed to get or return even though he tried to right the wrong (basically told him on the graduation day btw). It was really messed up, and his dad is trying to get him to sue. He knows he can go to adult school to get his diploma but he can't afford it. He also has depression, which is 100% understandable, and social anxiety. Because of his anxiety, he won't go to the DMV to get his license which makes things harder. He doesn't have a girlfriend (I don't think he's ever had one) and it bothers him a bit. I forgot to mention that he is an alcoholic. He won't admit it but he drinks almost every single day, and he drinks till he's very drunk. He obviously does it to try and forget about everything that's going on. Also, just to top everything off, he and his family don't qualify for Medicaid anymore (I forgot the reason, but he wasn't happy about it). I can't just talk to him and tell him it'll be okay, I know how this works. He won't feel better until he finds solutions and he's only getting worse. And it's not like he can afford a therapist. Hell, I'm over seas as well so there's nothing I can really do. Please, give me some advice for him. How can he make money? What can help him? I don't know what he can do.."
1073,Scared.,I watched a video on Schizophrenia and it said if I feel uncomfortable during the video I should contact someone. I felt very uncomfortable during the video and was wondering if I should be worried. I also suffer from severe anxiety so idk if it’s just all in my head. Pls help
1074,Why does too much happiness make me sad?,"I have some favorite youtubers i always watch, and their content always makes me happy, but yet at the same time i hate watching their videos because it always makes me feel horrible. ill also find a song i *really* like but feel like crap listening to it or every time im reminded of it. ill hang out with someone and have a great time then feel terrible later and wish i never went out. the best way i can describe the feeling i get is just too much emotion? its so overwhelming that i get panic attacks. i have depression if thats an important point."
1075,Should I tell my friend I think she has a mental illness?,"I have a friend who has struggled with her mental health. Last year some friends and I helped her get to an ER to prevent a suicide attempt. Without giving too many details, after doing some reading I feel she may have BPD or another disorder. I am no doctor and I feel like it would be rude and/or triggering to send her articles pertaining to the disorder and suggest that she checks the boxes so to speak. 

She has a therapist and is seeking to find a psychiatrist, but shares with me that she’s still afraid to get one because she doesn’t want a diagnosis of a mental illness. How can I help without overstepping? My main goal is to help her get in contact with the right resources so that she can have a better quality of life."
1076,Blankness,"Out of no where I just go blank and feel completely empty. I’ll be talking to someone and having a nice conversation or something and then it just happens and my whole mood changes. After it happens I feel blank and have no clue what to say or do and just feels like I’m just ~there~ (if that makes any sense at all, I don’t know how to explain it). I’ve been experiencing stuff like this but it’s been getting worse and I don’t have any explanation to why it happens or what it is. Does anyone else experience this or know what it is and how I can stop it?"
1077,How does one start therapy?,"America. Everytime I start looking for therapists or psychiatrists or even Nurses I get absolutely overwhelmed. Then I begin to doubt myself, I convince myself that my feelings aren't severe enough for therapy. Then I let anxiety ruin more things for me. Its a never ending cycle. Any advice on how to begin? Im not sure if I want to try medication yet, or if its even needed, should I try a councilor? Maybe a psychologist or a psychiatrist?"
1078,I can read people,"No idea where this belongs so imma just post this wherever, if it doesn’t belong you can ban it or something.
Now to the actual subject, 
I don’t mean to brag or nothing but I can actually read people, like when someone tries to hide anything from me I instantly notice it, when someone tries hiding their emotions from me I may not be able to tell which they try and hide but I instantly realise something’s amiss.
This mostly causes problems in my social interactions since basically everyone is hiding something and I feel the longing to find out what it is, other people don’t like that and I don’t like the fact that they feel they have to hide parts of their personality/emotions from me.
I’m smart enough to know when I did something that affected someone negatively yet I’m not socially apt enough to realise what I could have done differently.
Until a few months ago I was a hardcore pothead and dulled my senses, partially for that reason and partially because that was the only way I could suffer some people in my life, however I’ve now been clean for a per longed period of time and my mind is Cristal clear and sharp enough to cut diamond.
It may sound arrogant as hell but I would give my left nut to be as dumb and dull as most people, just smart enough to interact with other people without making them feel uncomfortable/worthless or making me feel as if I were surrounded by a bunch of bonobos who somehow managed to string together a plethora of words wich somehow qualify as a language.
It’s really kinda fucked to be smart enough to realise how messed up you are, yet not socially apt enough to know how not to be.
I’ve contemplated suicide for several years now and the only thing really keeping me from it is the love for my mother I feel in the shrivelled piece of meat some people might curse a heart:"
1079,My house is unlivable and I have nowhere to go,My step dad got really bad into drinking and ended up losing his job and causing us to go bankrupt. He’s been miserable to be around ever since. He constantly blames me for everything and calls me lazy when I have 2 jobs and he only has a part time job but is supposed to be supporting the household. Every day I’m being verbally and mentally abused and it’s getting to the point to where I’m only at my house at night and even then it’s hard. I don’t really have anywhere I could stay at besides my grandmothers but I don’t want to bring her covid. I’m considering living out of my car maybe getting another job for just a bit and try to save up for an apartment
1080,Someone to Talk To,"I can’t even think straight right now, much less place on a catchy title to lure all you lovely people to talk to me. I’m just not feeling like the best right now. In fact, this is one of the worst days I’m experiencing and nothing even happened today. It’s definitely the major depression and anxiety. I just really need someone to talk to. May it be to distract me and tell me about their day or to just listen to me talk about all these mixed up feelings. Thank you. I hope you’re all doing well ♥️"
1081,My teen went INTO a gas station and bought a candy bar.,I’m terrified of us getting COVID-19. We have been isolating and not entering buildings for months. I found out he had gone to the gas station when I saw some change on his desk and asked about it. I’ve been shaking all over and uncontrollably crying. How can I overcome these thoughts of terror and doom? Deep breathing is not helping much.

1083,Possible mental illness. what do you think I have? 25M,[removed]
1084,Marrying in less than three weeks and don’t know if it’s the right thing to do,"This is going to be a long story so be prepared if you wanna know how this ends.

Me (M/24), her (F/22)

We both know each other from childhood and our parents are relatively good friends themselves. Our first encounters I don’t remember, but she does. 
What I remember is we met randomly on the same vacation site (I was alone, she was with her family.) I was 18 she was 16. We just met us once and since she was with her family they invited me to explore the place together. 
After that, we didn’t see or hear from each other for about a year. But keep in mind, that I had already fallen for her. 
After a year or so I managed to find her number and texted her. We talked about how we lost connection after our childhood and talked a lot about my school, what she was doing and family business. Turns out, we were our “first loves”.

The first time was really great we were having a wonderful time. Due to cultural factors and personal beliefs we didn’t (or couldn’t) meet for almost a year into our relationship. 

In that one year we texted, I found out that she has a rather dominant character which I lacked. But it was okay, I guess. 

Now kind of a backstory to her:

She’s an only child. She grew up in a relatively wealthy household. 

She told me about her mother who was diagnosed with diabetes (idk if type 1 or 2, it’s the worse one.) since her pregnancy with her. Problem is, that her mother wouldn’t look out for herself, neither would she take the prescribed insulin, making her some kind of “nurse” since her early childhood. 

She still faces the consequences like panic attacks, some symptoms relatable to PTSD and so on. There are days, where the most little noise in the house would startle her and checking in on her mother. 

Her father is the kind of “I earn the money, keep track of the bureaucratic work in the house, that’s all I can/will do”.

That’s all about her so far.

Backstory of mine:

I’m the first and oldest and only male child of 4 of my parents. Our financial situation has always been crippling due to my fathers gambling addiction. My fathers absence at all times (he was only at home to sleep or to eat) led me to being some kind of father figure to my younger siblings. Even today my mom tells me that I am more of a father to the kids and more of a husband to her than he will ever be.

I graduated from high school the time we met and planned on going to college to become a teacher. Since my mom and I were practically alone raising the children, I am really left with none friends due to not leaving the house or engage socially in any way. 
I always had struggles making or maintaining friendships. 

The time I first went to college, my grandfather got diagnosed with pancreas cancer, which totally threw me off. I couldn’t follow in class, couldn’t even stay in the students dorm I rented. ( college town wasn’t far away from home.)
Which ultimately let to me failing every class and later on leaving. 

After half a year of jobbing and applying to new colleges I tried my luck again. 
But this time I got problems with my kidneys which had to be treated stationary in a hospital. Again; not attended classes, failed courses. 
Yet I am still engaged with college and trying my best to finish it by the end of 2021. 

Now; the marriage part.

We engaged a year ago. My father, who now doesn’t gamble as much as before, said from the beginning that he won’t be a financial help due to his debts of approx 10k€. My mother told me that the wedding had to be planned for 2022 if she was going to be able to afford it. I am working as far as my studies enable it to support her. 

Her parents were okay with it at the beginning but are now pushing for it to take place in 2021’s spring. 

Her mother, whom she is really invested in, is always talking about how short of a life she has left and how she wants to see her in “safe hands” before she dies. 

This has let to her supporting her parents and building pressure in me and my family. This pressure is tearing my mother financially and psychologically away, since she works double time now. 

Her dominant character has become even stronger since that. If I slightly say sth another than her opinion, I’m the dumb one, the one who never gets something done and the one not caring for her thoughts. Even if it’s like “somebody said X” and I say “well, maybe they didn’t mean it that harsh like you picked it up to be.” This kind of conversation leads to a discussion in 99% of the cases, resulting in days of little to none conversation between us even if I text her sth like good morning. 

In the last past weeks, she said things that shouldn’t be said in a relationship that’s aiming towards marriage. 

She said “if I didn’t care for what the people said or if I didn’t think my mother would be really sad, I would already have ended all the planing and this relationship.”
She said that she doesn’t want to be married and only does it for her mother’s sake. 

After these weeks I’m not even able to look in her eyes without thinking about her words. 

And I, myself, am not a man enough to say “oh really? Ok than I’ll do the decision for you and end it right here.” 

I really do love her, but I see her becoming a person that I cannot live a whole life together. 

But like I said, I’m not man enough to end it. She had enough trouble and sadness through her life and I don’t want to be a reason for more of it. 

We went out today and booked our place for the party, but idk man.. it doesn’t feel right. 

The fact that we are together for six years is frightening; leaving a person that became your life for your young adult years, or marrying someone that you thought you knew for six years? 

I am really in a shitty place for now... 

She constantly reminds me of what kind of a poor life (financially) we are going to have since my studies aren’t finished and I’m earning none to little money. 
That also puts me in a place where I can’t even say anything against her parents since they said that they will take care of our rent and supplies if necessary until I get my bachelor. 

The reminder of a “poor life” is such a burden on me that I even thought of leaving college to start a vocational training just to earn money.

But even that wasn’t good enough for her. 

She tells me to finish my studies but also complains every given chance about our future situation. 

“I’ll be embarrassed to the people” “i can’t even look into my parents eyes since I vouched for you” “I don’t know if you are the right man to be my husband” 
These are things I constantly hear from her. 

That + seeing my mother work her ass off + helping out to get the kids needs + her parents pressure are tearing me apart.

I’d really like to end all of this by saying no, but as I mentioned above currently I’m willing to sabotage my own life and future for her sake.

Even that will result in a insult like “I didn’t ask it of you” or “if you’re that unhappy you shouldn’t have done it”. BUT IF I DONT I AM THE ASSHOLE. 

I really don’t want her to suffer more than she already has, that’s probably why I’ll say yes at the wedding and wish and pray for things to get better than worse. 

That’s the end. If you read till now, I really appreciate it. 

I just needed a place to vent for a bit, since I don’t want my mother to know my concerns after all her hard work and sacrifice and can’t tell my sister (19) bc I don’t want to be a burden to her even if it’s just in her thoughts. 

I really feel stolen of my dignity as a male, really feel stolen of my “best years”, really feel FUCKING betrayed not only by her but most of myself for not being able to stop all of this. 

I’ll end this post with an inspirational quote as a wish to make things better and give you, the people who read all of this stuff, and me, the dumb one, hope for the future.

“The darkest time of the night is right before the sun rises.”

Even the most disturbing and worst nights and with the sun rising. What remains are the scars. But I wish, for you and I, is to be able to look at those scars and say “it was really worth the suffering.”

Have a good night/day, wherever you are reading this."
1085,I have a crush on someone and it makes me cringe thinking about it and talking about it with other people.,I dont know if its normal so I'm asking for help.
1086,I’m not okay,"You know, I’ll probably be one of those people who scream for a bit, then shut up. 

I don’t know what’s real anymore. I know that reality isn’t changing. I also know that my mind is going crazy. Sometimes I can’t tell if it’s just me in my head. It can’t be DID. That doesn’t make sense. It’s not schizophrenia because I only ever hear the voices in my own head. They feel like my thoughts, but from not me. I can’t explain it. It’s not multiples. 

I can’t focus. Too many competing thoughts. I have to, though. I have work to do. I can’t fail another class. Working on a bachelors degree. I probably won’t be able to pass. Haha. Love a good double meaning. What? Shut up. You know, he doesn’t ever have much to offer but the occasional, “shut up!” Quite rude, really. Just trying to think here. 

Is it psychosis? Probably. Don’t try to diagnose me if anyone actually reads this. 

I’m probably just lying to myself about myself and that I’m actually fine, just stick in multiple layers of internal lies. 

I’m gonna post this mess. I’m sorry for anyone who is disturbed by it. I guess we just needed to vent a bit. 

Cheers."
1087,"Is it natural for the mind to fall onto the last thing you watched or saw if it was somebody’s face, whilst moving onto something completely different and unrelated when you close your eyes?",Felt unnerving and was just curious.
1088,no idea why i look for things I know will make me upset,like when i see a post about LGBTQIA+ stuff I go in it bc i am part of the community but i also scroll to the bottom and let myself get hurt by the mean things people comment even though i would have never seen them if i never scrolled down. anyone else do this? i wanna find out why i do this

I am a mass of contradictions as a person. I love being around people, but am better getting into a topic of conversation one – on – one than in a massive group. Superficial conversation and flitting from group to group at a drinks reception, for example, is something that I find difficult. There is so much going on in the world and in all of our lives. What’s the point in exchanging phony pleasantries!?

1090,Porn is becoming an escape for me and it’s confusing me about my sexuality! Please help!,"
I’m a 17 year old bisexual male. I’m attracted to men, and while my attraction for women is much less intense sexually, I’m still attracted to them sexually. 

For a while now, I’ve been watching gay porn exclusively. At first it was because I was actually horny, sometimes that still is the case, but now it’s just an escape....

I’m not even in the mood 90% of the time I start watching it, I’m just stressed out or bored. My erection is hardly an erection and when I put my mind on anything else other than the porn, It goes soft. I also try to make it last as long as possible before ejaculating because it’s the excitement I crave, not the orgasm 

Now I can’t get turned on by straight porn anymore. It’s only gay porn that my brain seems to want. I’ll start watching porn and then my brain thinks “why watch straight porn when you could watch gay porn”. 
It was not like this before, and now this just feels unhealthy and it’s also confusing me about my sexuality. 

I feel gross every time I finish, and that might also be the anxiety and stigma that comes with watching gay porn. The porn I watch has also become less and less normal (nothing illegal or anything like that) it’s just less conventional domination type porn. Usually when I watch the weirder stuff, it’s when I’m not actually horny and just want excitement, that’s also when I feel the most guilty after ejaculating. 

I have other hobbies and interests, I don’t know why this is taking over my life. How can I get back to normal? What does this say about me? Am I fully gay and not bisexual? I’m so stressed out right now."
1091,Just broke up with bf of 5 years. I’m gutted and have no desire to try in life anymore,"What the title says. I just got laid off as well, and I’ve been working nonstop at a new job that wants me to give my all and I just can’t. I’m adjusting to a new schedule and work 6 days in a row this week. I relapsed and started self harming again. It feels like life requires more of me than I’m able to give and have no desire to try anymore. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living life. I’m miserable. Went out for my friends birthday, and had a couple drinks. One of my friends offered to talk if I needed it and I broke down...in public. I thought I needed to get out of the house because I’ve been isolating a whole lot, but now I regret ever going. I hate this life. Any advice that would help me keep going would be appreciated. Thank you to anyone that read all this."
1092,"mom(49F) isn’t always helpful, i’m (18F) more comfortable with my dad(49M) than her","I’m a first year college student (18F).   I’ve been in a rough spot for the last few days and decided to drive home (about 30 to 40 minutes away) so I wouldn’t be cooped up in my dorm the entire weekend.  Most of the things that have been negatively affecting me are just related to me trying to adjust to college, and me trying to handle the workload for one class.  

I was sitting on the couch with my mom (49F) when I sighed and said, “I’m burned out.”

My mom goes off on how if I want to quit college she’d be fine as long as I went to the community college or get a job.  It ended upsetting me a bit and I almost cried.

When I said that I was burned out, I meant that I was tired and needed sleep.  I did not mean it to mean “I might drop out of college”

Before I went to bed, she said she wanted to talk about how I’ve been doing mentally tomorrow.  

I love my mom and I appreciate the support.  But sometimes she assumes the worst of things and blows it out of proportion.  Sometimes talking to her about my mental health feels like an interrogation.  I know her intentions are good but sometimes she isn’t very helpful.

I’ve told her once that something she did wasn’t helpful and my mom went off on how I don’t appreciate what she does and that she’s just trying to help.  

I really do appreciate the support from her.  But when I try to tell her “hey this wasn’t helpful, can you do this instead” she gets defensive.  

I find it easier to talk with my dad (49M) about my mental health.  I feel like I can be more open with him.  I kinda feel bad that I’m more comfortable talking with my dad than my mom.  I’m a girl, I feel like I should be more comfortable with my mom.  I know I’m not obligated to.  But I can’t help but feel a bit guilty for being closer to my dad.

TL;DR:  My (18F) mom (49F) sometimes blows my mental health problems out of proportion.  I’m not always very comfortable talking about my mental health with her.  How do I tell her that something she said wasn’t helpful without her getting defensive?  Is it bad that I feel guilty for being more comfortable with my dad (49M) than my mom?"
1093,I need to be honest for once,"I don’t have anybody I can talk to so I thought why not here. I am literally so exhausted. I don’t care to be alive anymore. Anytime I see the news or a television show or even just people around me (except for my boyfriend) I seem to just tune into the bad. And the bad is definitely there. I just feel like everything sucks and humans are literally the worst, so why live? I daydream and fantasize about peace in death. Anytime I brought this up to other people I was called selfish. I’ve attempted numerous times and once in the hospital my preacher told me I was going to hell for it. There’s literally no point to anything. I can’t please anyone let alone myself. I hate it here ugh. If you read this please unread it. I’m sorry you wasted your time on this. Ffs"
1094,"Really want to find a word for ""everyone seems fine with gory stuff on TV but my brain is like yikes that was awful let me play you that image on repeat 30 times a day until you want to die.""",It's awful. I don't understand how people do it. Most people just watch something and move on.
1095,i’m just frustrated,"I just love being friends with a few people and those friends are all part of a friend group without you.

1096,Feeling like I’m in the Truman Show?,Ive been stuck with this thought for years: I feel like my life is some kind of movie and everything that happens to me is staged. What is it? And how do I deal with it?
1097,Does this sound like a manic episode? Diagnosed bipolar but have always doubted my diagnosis,"I know I have a mental disorder. Just not sure if it is bipolar disorder. I have been diagnosed with it. But I always doubt my diagnosis. I know I get sad. I just have trouble recognizing a manic episode.

So I recall a moment in my life that should have been more obviously a red flag, I have had several red flags but this one comes to mind most prominently at the moment. 

I was at a point inmy life, like many times, I was acting argumentative with people and just acting hyper and bizarre. I knew my behavior was costing me my job. At the time I was reading a lot of Aliester Crowley. I took a knife and carved a big pentagram into my stomach and began praying to not lose my job. A couple days later I hopped on a train and left almost everything behind to begin a new job in a new city with little to no plan. 

1. Obvious self harm
2. Seems rather delusional and psychotic

Is this an example of a manic episode or does it sound like something else.

Sorry if this sounds crazy.

PS not asking for a diagnosis. I have one. I just not sure if this sounds like what is considered a manic phase."

1099,breaking up with long distance,"Hi everyone, me (M21) and my ex girlfriend (F19) have ended things. Well she ended things a week ago and it’s been the hardest week of my life. I keep breaking down and keep crying and keep wanting to disappear and jus feeling like shit and oversleeping and everything. God bless her soul, she has not blocked me and she still takes care of me by talking to me when I need her and telling me to eat when I don’t want to. I don’t know how to get over her. She wanted to end things because it was getting too hard for her and she had been having family problems and she was overwhelmed. I, meanwhile live by myself with my family thousands of miles away and don’t really have someone I can talk to or cry to. I would really like some advice on how to be happier with myself and just how to get over someone that is so hard to get over? Thank you everyone."
1100,I really don’t want to be here anymore.,"I just found out a friend who I confessed my feelings to is in a relationship after telling me she never wanted to be with anybody.

Never thought I’d be so I’m not even sure on the word devestated maybe over a woman. 
Honestly thought there would be a chance because I was so happy where I was with her and did everything I could to make her happy. 

My life fucking sucks and I don’t see the point anymore, all I ever get is rejected in every sense"
1101,How do you learn to live with the knowledge you'll never meet your potential because of the mistake you made?,"When I was younger I made a lot of decisions I wouldn't make now, but until a few years ago I think all of those decisions made a lot of sense, given how I understood the world at the time, and I could entirely rationalize them as the best decisions I could have made at the time.

Over the last few years I have made a series of decisions and mistakes in my personal life and in my career that were just flat out stupid moves. Stupid at the time, and stupid looking back. I hate myself for it. My lifelong career dreams are...very far away, or completely thwarted now. I have to readjust and adapt to what I have in front of me. But I will resent myself for a long time. And it is difficult to keep going considering how much of my effort and striving in the past seems to have been for nothing. How does one cope?"

1103,I've been internally angery since I was a kid,"I was abused pretty severely growing up. My parents have calmed down now (and gave me other means of abuse like verbal after hitting me didn't work so well after being double their size now) but I can't stop being angry on the inside. I don't get mad at things. I don't express much emotion honestly. But deep deep down. I'm internally angry. Like I took my emotions placed them deep down in a locked box and they seep out once in a while. I can remember the last time I cried. I think it was 12 years ago when I was 11. I actually can't even when I feel hella sad. 

Like is there a word for this? Emotional detachment? I feel like a robot unable to truly care about anything unless it pisses me off. Which I keep inside and never respond to because that's what I've learned works."

1105,I was going to start actually venting to friends but I don't want to look like a copy cat,"I posted a week or two ago about some issues I had been having, and It was brought to my attention that what I was feeling was Depersonalization and or dissociation. 

I didn't know how to handle it so I was going to try and be open/ vulnerable for once so I could talk to my friends about it. It took about a week but I was finally read to talk. That was until my friend started telling us about how she felt her body wasn't hers and how she felt like ""a ghost"". 

I knew what she was describing. It was what I felt almost every day. I gave her my advice on grounding techniques and she was feeling better within a few hours. But I wasn't, the techniques I use help me feel *More* connected but still I'm not all there. 

I want to talk to them about this. Ask them their opinion on it or ask them what I should do about it. But I can't now. It will look like I'm just trying to one up or copy the first friend. So now idk what to do bc it's getting a little worse... My memory has been slipping more often. I forget if I had done daily routines and time lines of events during that day are take more effort to recall, they are foggy and time slips past me in a way that is ***Extremely uncomfortable***, I hate it. 

Btw I am in no way blaming the first Friend for venting about this!!! I'm glad she did, it was probably scary for her and I'm glad she trusts us enough to turn to us when she needs help :)"
1106,Roommate help,"Hi, I have a roommate who is having a fairly tough time. A little background, he’s a refugee who resettled to the United States about five years ago. He’s been having delusions with concerns of people who might kill him or steal his identity. Some of these concerns have come up over the last several months, but my other roommates and myself thought it was a language / understanding of American laws issue. 

Over the last few days he has moved much deeper into the delusion and has certainly raised flags where I am concerned for his health. Yesterday one of my roommates found him with a knife on the couch crying and stuck in a loop about how his life has been destroyed. We called the suicide hotline without much success. Afterwards we called the psychiatric hotline and they indicated they can admit him if he comes to the hospital, if he willingly will go with parametric in the ambulance, or the police can forcibly remove him. We very much want to avoid the police taking him away as that is very clearly one of his huge concerns.

After his breakdown yesterday, he left the house and didn’t return last night. He came back tonight, and we have been trying to get him to willingly go to the hospital, but we have had no success. 

Does anyone have advice that might help us help him that doesn’t involve the police. I’m incredibly concerned if the police come the story will escalate and be a national headline that I don’t want to read."

1108,I Can't Stand Losing,"I can tolerate most things and few things really 'get to me.' Except for losing. I've never been on a sports team but I've spent most of the free time in my life playing video games and, despite that, I've never gotten used to losing. Not even repetitive loss, just losing once is enough to tick me off. It's never caused me to break anything and or do anything serious, I'll just slam against my desk once or curse under my breathe, but it's still obviously not a great feeling to have when you're doing one of your most common hobbies. So what's best to do so I can tolerate losing?"
1109,What if I started reaching out - but reaching out is 'abnormal' to my character?,"I'm feeling kind of lonely and isolated from other people, but in the period before Covid, I was not at all actively reaching out or socializing or initiating in my relationships. I'm not sure how to deal with this - it's a strange bag of reluctance to reach out to others for the sake of my own (idk why I've labelled 'selfish' to this whole thing) well-being. I also feel remorse(? or is it guilt) for not making the first impression of being the talkative, sociable one. Btw, it's not who I am, but I feel the need to become that. 

Wouldn't people think it's a bit ""out-of-character' for me to suddenly start reaching out to them out of the blue? Idk, but it feels like I'm suddenly flipping out or malfunctioning if I did that. 

Honestly, I need you guys to help me. Would you freak out or get suspicious if someone in your relationship circle who never initiates started initiating or trying to reach out to you?"
1110,How to deal with bipolar ll,"
Hi. I need help. I’m a 22 year old male and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year. I’m taking my meds and I’m going to weekly therapy, but I’m still feeling suicidal. I even was put into a mental hospital for 4 months and I’m still feeling the same. I’m suicidal, I’m depressed, and when I’m hypo manic i feel like I’m going insane. I’ve done everything in my power to keep fighting for my life, but I’m losing Hope day by day. Is there anyone else out there that has this mental illness? Is there anyway i can take all this pain away? 
 
 I don’t want to have another suicide attempt, but I’m getting to the point where i don’t want to fight anymore and i don’t want to suffer anymore. I’ve tried almost every kind of depression med that’s out there but none of them seem to help. If anyone else has bipolar or bipolar 2 please let me know what med or meds have help you. Please i don’t want to be like this anymore"

1114,Worries about starting meds,"I've been struggling with my mental health for a while now and its just tiring. Therapy has been okay for me, but I've been more and more curious about seeing a psychiatrist. I'm, and I'm not sure of the exact word, maybe passively suicidal? The thought floats around my head for most of the day and I catalog ways I could do it, but my guilt keeps me here. I'd feel absolutely horrible if I did that to my family and friends, even though I might want to. One of the big things I keep hearing about meds is that they can make you numb/mellow. I worry that if I started them I'd lose the feelings that keep me here. Is this the case? Should I be considering meds at all while I'm like this? Would I be aware enough to know I need to be prescribed something else? I'm just not sure how it all works/how I'd go about it and could use some advice."

1118,"Incest nightmare, generations deep","My story goes like this. I was molested by a close friend of the family at 3-4 yrs old.  I started having behavior problems. I don’t remember them all. Than at 8-9yrs old was molested by my sister.  I never told anyone one till I started dating my first husband. He told me she was just experimenting. It was always in the back of my mind. It never left me. Many many things happened to me along the way. Most importantly because of behavioral issues my Father abandoned me at 14 he was too busy fucking different women to deal with me. Now in this time as a child I had heard the grown ups talking about a female cousin that the Mother of that said child had been molested by her father at a very young age. All the family labeled her as crazy and was told to stay away from her. At this time none of mine was never revealed. I had many issues like drugs/alcohol. So I was labeled a druggie and talked about amongst the family  at this time noone knew of my molestations. My family was fanatical about religion hell fire and brimstone which I always rejected so I was made to feel ashamed I was labeled as a irredeemable niece and cousin.  Now I am 63 and just found out that the whole family has incest. Fathers molesting daughters brothers molesting sisters sisters molesting sisters grandmother molesting son grandfather molesting children   Daughter’s and daughter in laws being schooled to recieve sex from husbands regardless of their feelings and if they wanted it. I know that this sickness runs deep. Their is atm only 3 of us willing to tell the story but we know there are many more. I need serious couciling. I have not exhibited those type of behaviors but suffered from ocd, addiction,low self esteem, abandonment issues   Ive been to counciling and I hv been sober for over 10 yrs. Thru all these new revolutions I do not want to drink so this is a good thing. But I am physically sick to my stomach over this. Omg I am so ashamed to be related to these fucking sick peoples. They used religion as a way to control the family  From what the 2 cousins have come up with so far indicates that this has been happening for generations. I did before this revelation confront my sister she hung up on me and haven’t spoken sense. They meaning both my brother and sister disowned me from the family.  Now I relies that this was a blessing.  This is a horrific nightmare. I guess my question would be should I confront whats left of the aunts and uncles."

1122,I'm spiraling and don't know what to do...,"I've always struggled with a depression my entire life I would say but I dont know im not really sure. I've never really spoken to anybody about my true mental struggles i mean I wouldn't even know where to start. I have so much baggage and pressure weighing me down I feel like I'm constantly to seek everybody's approval for my benefit so I can feel something like i did something right. But in doing so im crushing my soul I can feel it, it's like my heart shrinks. I dont understand why I crave it so badly I dont know why I want to please others its kindness is nothing these days its taken for granted. Im taken for granted constantly and im tired of it. Ive become such a sad person catering to others in hopes of happiness and peaceful because i can't find it inside of myself. Ive tried asking for help i told the consular I've cut myself and she choose to focus on my grades and send me to someone else to address those feelings. She tried to get me started in a program outside of school.while this was going on the consular called my dad and told him he was disappointed that I didn't feel comfortable talking to him about my feelings because some of it is because of (him he used to be a coke addict while i was growing up). He tried to comply with therapy until the insurance didn't cover it so we dropped it and never talked about it again. That was almost two years ago and ever since then I've been suppressed and overwhelmed by my strong bouts of mixed emotions the intensity is draining. I'm trying to live as best as I can but I feel im living a split life. I'm trying to become a better me i suppose but I know it isn't what I long i long for enternal peace. I'm young but not old enough to seek help myself and my parents aren't willing i don't know what to do i mean I can't really talk to my friends because ive become isolated and no longer have a strong bond so I don't want to bother them. And when I go to my religious boyfriend he tells to just calm down during my eating and that I just need to stop thinking. If I could stop thinking or even slow them down I would at any cost. He thinks I'm okay as of now but I'm reality im fighting a cold and brutal battle inside im suffering and tormented i don't know what to do the only option is the radical option i feared but lately it's been a reoccurring thought. Is there anything I can do at this point? Can I salvage myself  i desire it.

If you find this at all thank you."
1123,I Don't Know How Much More I can Take,"CW: Mentions of suicide, suicidal thoughts, etc.

So recently things with life have quite honestly been hell. A lot of it stems from the ongoing pandemic and the way it's impacted my life and it's been the main reason that my issues such as depression and anxiety have been worsening rapidly. I stay up later (until 3 or 4 in the morning on average), sleep in more and waste my day away being unproductive. I skip meals and snack more, don't talk to my friends as much, and all in all just feel alone. It doesn't help that I'm going to college during all of this as well. Junior year so far has been me walking to class alone, sitting in a class that I don't feel motivated for or feel rewarded for working on, and walking back to my car alone since I rarely see any of my friends. Then I drive my 25 minute commute to the radio playing whatever my spotify playlist decides to play next. Sometimes I think about just driving into a oncoming semi and just finishing everything there. I used to not think of these things as often but recently I haven't been able to avoid them. I'm always drowning in homework because I'm not motivated to do it when it's assigned or I forget about it since I'm already stressed over a different class, I didn't even think that taking a semester off was an option until my dad told me that now would have been a good time to do so (fuck me I wish I would have). I just, I don't feel like anything I'm doing anymore has meaning, value, like it's worth it. I never think about my future unless it's a suicidal thought of me putting a bullet into my teeth. I just really don't know how much more I can take. And things are only going to get busier since my major (education) requires me to complete 60 hours of field observation and my professor only signed me up for 2 hours a week, meaning I have to talk to the person in charge and hope there's more spots that I can fill that don't sacrifice my dinner time, which is the only time I really see my family during the day. I just wanna give up. I want all of it to end and I just want to be at peace. If that means taking next semester off, trying to find more help (my usual counseling sessions on campus are unavailable due to coronavirus concerns), or simply finding a way to end myself, I really don't know anymore. I just want something or someone to cut me a break, cause I don't feel like I've got much going for me as of right now. If you got this far thanks for reading, hope you're doing well and staying safe during this craziness. Take it easy everyone"
1124,Do I need help?,"First off I'd like to apologize if I posted this in the wrong place. Please delete this if it's not appropriate.

Recently I've been feeling kind of weird and I'm not sure if I need help and, if I do, where to turn to get it. When I was a kid I had a kind of not great childhood. My father is a recovering addict (over 14 years sober thankfully) so, despite being a genuinely loving father, he wasn't around for a lot of my childhood. Most of my early memories of him were either in halfway houses, him fighting with my mother, or seeing him and his then girlfriend (a great lady who had a large hand in making me who I am today) for a weekend or two a month. My mother is a really unpleasant person who treated my sister and myself pretty badly when we were growing up (highlights include telling me to drop out of school when I was 10 because I was just ""too dumb for it"", telling me that my Father died on Christmas because she was mad about something, and letting me know that, if it came down to it, she would put me up for adoption to stay in her current relationship). I know these things are pretty bad but the thing is it never really bothered me in the past. My older sister more or less took care of me as a kid and my father got clean shortly after I turned 13 so from that point on I was in a relativity stable and loving household. Lately though I've been finding myself dwelling on my childhood and I don't really know why. As far as I'm concerned I didn't have it half as bad as the people around me, I honestly feel bad kinda bad about even posting this here as it seems pretty insignificant compared to the other posts, and I've long since stopped feeling angry (or really much of anything) at my mother. I broke off contact with her a while ago when it came to light that she had begun to use drugs.vDoing this was not hard for me to do in fact if It didn't hurt at all and it still doesn't. I don't know why I'm feeling this way or why it's happening now (I'm in my late 20's for reference with a college degree, great friends, a good job, and I've always felt mentally ""stable"") and I'm not really sure if it's normal and I just need to feel with it or if it's an issue I need to address.  I thought I was past this, or more precisely, that other then a few things (fear of conflict and a lowish self worth) that most of this stuff just hadn't affected me. I've already talked to my sister about this stuff but I'm still stuck on it and I'm not sure what to do to move past it. I'm not sure if I need to see a professional about it and figured you I could use some advise or maybe that just typing this all out would do the trick and move me past it.

Sorry if this was kinda of rambling and thanks for taking the time to read it. I appreciate any advise!"
1125,Tifu by getting jelous at the gym,So ive been going to the gym for about 3 years now. Im not very good and everyone assumes im a beginner all the time. I go because I have a lot of energy and if I dont I lose my mind with my problem at home (the gym is my bandaid of sorts).

1128,Mental Block,"Because of some trauma from a few years back, I've sorta become a pacifist. The problem is that I can't defend myself anymore. Even when I was attacked a few months ago and could not bring myself to even throw a punch in defense of myself. I just shut down and accepted it. No fear of death or pain or well being. Just thought, ""I wonder if I'll die"" and dissociated from it. I used to be able to handle myself in a fight, but now I'm totally useless. My cousin has me go places with her when she's going to a bad side of town because she believes I'd keep her safe, and I really want to, but I'm afraid that I'd choke up and fail to keep her safe. 

I tried joining an MMA gym, and I'm tough enough to take as many punches as anybody can throw, but when I try to throw one back, my body pulls back and makes it real hard to follow through. It's either my arm goes weak (or like there's somebody holding my arms back when I swing) and refuses to give a real punch, or my arm is fine but my body pulls away not allowing my punch to make contact. I keep getting my ass kicked. You'd think that enough fat lips would convince me to step up and be okay with it, but nope. 

It feels like my nerves are burnt out. I feel nothing in the moment. I don't get adrenaline pumping like everyone else does. I don't get scared when I'm getting beat. I don't even particularly feel the pain. There's no sense of self preservation or self defense. It's like the longer I'm wearing the gloves staring at the guy across from me, the more I start to shut down. It doesn't feel real.

What do I do?"
1129,I've had a terrible feeling for the past week. (22F) (Possible TW),"Hello fellow Redditors, 22F who suffers with anxiety and depression here.
For the past week, I've had this terrible feeling. I feel like I'm just kind of numb and floating through life and space without a purpose. I've never hurt myself or thought about ending my life, but I'd much rather just not live anymore. If I could disappear into thin air I'd be so much happier. I really just want to be anywhere else but here whether it be a different state, country, planet, whatever. I just don't want to be *here*. This feeling sucks and I feel like I have absolutely no one to help me out of this funk. Could it have something to do with my anxiety and depression or something else entirely??"
1130,I just want to be like the other guys,"None of this is anyones fault but my own.

So I was at the gym, and Ive been going for 3 year but everyone sees me and thinks im a beginner because I have so little body awareness (i spent the good majority of my life dissaociated). I'm a trans guy (I pass) and im almost two years on T, but despite going to the gym and lifting for 3 years, im not very strong. Im like 140 lbs and bench 140 lbs. At least two times a week someone will ask me if I need help. I usually let them help but it hurts me because I feel like I should know how to do things by now. 

Since ive been getting a little better, i figured id venture out and try a little boxing.

I thought it was so cool because no one else did it, and I thought well ""hey this is neat! Even though im not as strong as the other guys, at least im kind of okay at this and its pretty fun."" 
I even bought myself some gloves for my birthday.

Well today four other guys were at the punching bags and they were doing really good! And I thought wow!! Cool! It hurt because I wanted to have my own thing but I understood and that was okay. But then they started giving me advice which I mean, its a good thing to do, but I'm already so harsh on myself. I just wanted something I could be kinda good at myself. They never left me alone and started boxing next to me and I caught them glancing over at what I was doing and it felt like they were judging me. And maybe they had good intentions but all anyone ever does is judge me. I stopped. 

I got hurt and I thought I could do something else no one did; rolls and handstands (which im usually okay at). Well after doing way more than I normally do i ended up landing on my neck and spraining it. I couldnt move for a moment but then I got up did one last cartwheel (i was not about to let anyone see me weak) and then drove home. Im now collapsed on my bed unable to move.


I'd KILL to just be a normal guy and have normal strength and not look like im a scrawny 16 years old. I would slam myself into the wall everyday five times a day to just be a normal guy. Im crushed. I dont want to box anymore. 

Im going back to the gym first thing tomorrow to practice until im better. I just wish I had thicker skin. Ive been crying for three hours. 

Writing about my emotions makes me want to vomit. I hate all of this and I hate myself."

1132,I posted a picture,"Hey everyone. Yesterday I finally built up the courage to take a picture of myself, and I posted it!! That last time I did that was in May :).

1133,Reality Check,[https://psynaesthesia.blogspot.com/2020/09/ZUKO.html](https://psynaesthesia.blogspot.com/2020/09/ZUKO.html)
1134,It feels like I'm in the wrong world.,"For as long as I can remember I've been severely depressed and nihilistic. I was raised in a very christian household, and from the get I was skeptical. I never told my parents about that part lol.

Most of my life has been spent playing videogames and watching YouTube, with the occasional anime. All of it is escapism. I have no close friends, and a few who try but don't get far. 

I know from some experiences we'll say, that I'm schizoaffective. It runs in my family on my mother's side.

I'm currently in my third semester of college, and I'm about to get kicked out. I'm failing all of my classes again, for the third time and they've had enough.
I know I'm not the only one but still, doesn't it feel like the world is just so empty? I know it only makes sense I would feel this way, having no friends, emotionally abusive parents, a selfish little brother.

I'm just tired of pretending I'm okay, just to hide away in my room for days at a time, watching everything fall apart and everyone drift away.

The world is such a joke. No wonder everyone's losing their collective shits. There's nothing left to fight for anymore. If you're happy, it's not enough. If you're sad, you'll kill to be happy.

What's the point anyways. I don't understand at all."
1135,Help me,"A friend of a friend of mine seems to be suffering from some form of schizophrenia over the past couple of years. As far as I am aware she has been able to keep on top of it up until about a month ago (could be longer my friend doesn't live in the same town as us anymore and they aren't as close as they once were so I'm unsure) as she has stopped taking her medication. She has been living alone in her family's house for some years now as her parents have split and literally live as far away from each other as is humanly possible on this Earth and neither seems to want anything to do with her and her mental problems. As is probably common with schizophrenics, she has creeped out most of her friends and doesn't seem to have any close enough to help her. She's convinced the government and her neighbors are trying to kill her and is often wandering the streets being confrontation with random people in the street. An acquaintance who lives near her paid her a visit as she wasn't answering any phone calls or texts and was being very strange on social media. She let her in and had her bags packed by the door preparing to travel to the West Coast (we live on the East Coast) where she has no family and apparently has no where to stay when she gets there. 

I think that's enough details for you to help me.
How do we make her get the help she clearly needs before she does something of harm to her or someone else? Any suggestions y'all have would be of great help.

Thanks"

1137,Today was not my day...,"It’s one thing after another with bad stuff happening.

I feel like I’m chasing for hope that isn’t there.

I want to reach out to friends but I feel like a burden to everyone and I don’t want them to think I need there help.

I can’t act like everything is fine when it isn’t so that’s why I haven’t been talking to my friends, I don’t want to ruin someone’s mood/day with my life drama.
At this point I don’t know when I can share my actual feelings with them."
1138,Husband breakdown,"So my husband came home late tonight (10PM) after a very long day of work. He was acting irritated, said it was work related. I suggested a shower to help him relax. He agrees and gets in. 

Eventually I hear the water turn off and what sounds like really loud breathing. I went in, and he is sobbing. Like full on. He went out into the living room and was wailing. I’ll be honest, it scared the shit out of me and I’m only marginally calmer now. I convinced him to go into the bedroom at least to avoid waking the baby, and he did, but full on wailing loudly for two hours. I thought someone died, he was so upset. He said he misses his parents, and mumbled some other things I couldn’t hear. Said he had been crying in his work vehicle for an hour before coming in. Then listened to someone reading Revelation and Timothy from the bible aloud on his phone. I rubbed his back and held him, got him water and food, and just sat with him. He’s quiet now, he just went into the living room by himself and seems a little calmer. 

I’m freaked out to be honest but trying not to show it. I think he should probably have an appointment with a mental health professional, since he is clearly having a hard time right now. Obviously right this second is not the best time to bring this up, but when he is feeling a little more recovered, maybe tomorrow, I think I need to bring the topic up. Anything I should keep in mind? Do/don’t do? Thoughts?"
1139,Paranoia,"Alright, now I would not say that I am paranoid, but I've talked to some people that say that something is wrong with me. The most basic thing I is using 1 earbud (woah. Super exiting). Normally I do this while I am at home. When I am at my living room, I use 1 earbud unless my family is around me. When in bed, at any time, I use 1 earbud to make sure I don't miss out on any noises or anything weird. If I do hear any noises I start to get, well, paranoid (that's the word right) and start to think about what it could've been. Was it someone breaking in? A ghost making noises? A possible homeless guy doing weird stuff in my house? I don't know but I cannot recall the last time that I used both of my earbuds while watching anything that wasn't at my home. Sorry if this isn't worded right. I am also sorry if I am wasting anyone's time. Am I paranoid? Do I have small paranoia?"
1140,I curse people out if they wake me up,"I wake up irritationally angry and frustrated. As in, I'll metaphorically bite your head off if you dare wake me up before I'm supposed to. I tell, I curse, and I scream. After I wake up, I'm hit with what I said and then I go apologize to whoever had the unfortunate job of waking me up.

I don't like that I do this, and I really want to stop. In the mornings, it's like I become a whole different person and I just lash out at anyone nearby. I have literally no control over it. I barely remember it until I wake up and vaguely remember shouting at someone. I become really cruel when I do this. I shout. I threaten. I curse them out. I have a really mean, nasty voice and I'm just a completely asshole. I have no control over this. It's like I wake up and it's immediately the hulk. 

I'm diagnosed with manic-depressive, so maybe it comes along with aggression. 

After I wake up, I feel immediately bad and regretful that I did this, but I don't know how to stop. Is there a way to wake up normally without shouting at anyone?"

before my sisters birthday which was september 11, my ex took advantage of me once again and raped me. september 16 a co-worker who i was getting close with texted me about killing her self and i have not been able to reach her. i called the crisis hotline, but they did all they could. on september 17 which is my mother’s birthday i was involved in a near-fatal car crash. i’ve been through so much in life from being sexually abused and growing up in a pernicious environment. i feel like giving up all the time, but i’m seriously thanking GOD that i’m still alive. as bad as i would like to kill myself, i just can’t see myself doing something as selfish as that is."

1148,I’m so stressed I feel like I’m going to die,"I don’t mean it as a joke either, I seriously feel like my organs are going to start failing.

I’m 22, a senior in college, and ungodly stressed. I’m taking 18 credits, I’m the president of 2 big rso’s and I have an internship right now. 

It feels like I have 2 full time jobs, and I’m a full time student.

Honestly, I feel like I’d be able to handle this, but I have a friend who won’t stop coming to my house for weeks at a time, and he’s just rude to me the whole time and doesn’t leave. I live in a very very tiny one room house, and he trashes it and is annoying. 

He dropped out of school, has no job, and just sits around all day.

He finally left today and I was so happy to have my house back, but now another friend can’t go home and needs a place to stay. I’m the only person she knows who would be able to take her in, so now she’s at my tiny house. 

It’s terrible, I mean it’s so tiny we have to share a bed, and there’s nowhere to get away at. I’m working on stuff 12 hours a day, then I have to be berated by someone in my own house when I’m free because then I have to do what they want to do.

I can’t do it anymore, I might actually kill myself.

Shouted at. I have been mistreated in some ways and although I am so much better now and healthy, I have this fear of hospital and medical staff unfortunately. I feel I cannot trust them. I feel like I haven’t been understood because my problems weren’t big enough for people to understand why I did what I did. I have this panic in my body/ anxiety whenever I drive past hospital or have to visit health centre. 
It makes me so sad that in today’s day and age people are still being judged for mental health and judged if their problems are deemed not big enough to feel the way they feel."

And I’m “not mature” for my age yea I know I’m gonna be 18 on October23 
I’m sorry."
1152,Living with crippling profectionism sucks!,"I have been a profectionistic procrastinator every since I can remember. School has been really hard for me not because I don't understand the material, but because I don't believe I understand the material. I often leave homework undone or half done and sometimes even redone because I'm worried that it's not good enough and this of course weighs heavily on my grades. But when I am tasked with doing a test in class and forced to put the petal to the metal most of the time I pass with flying colors.
 I wish someone would sit down with me every week and say ""hey these are the things that need to be done and this is how you are to complete those things"" but the real world (college) does not work like that and so I fight alone against my mind that tells me that I can't do the homework, that because I can't do the homework I will fail, and because I already know I will fail then there no hope because I'm a failure. 
Ive noticed that the way I respond to these thoughts is a pattern. At first I will hammer away at all of my classes (in anticipation of the thoughts), then the doubt and dread come in, then I motivate myself and push through. There always a start to my worries and a relief from my worries. 
That being said school is hard for me and sometimes I just am so tired I barely manage to trauge through all the mess. That is my state of mind right now, tired. 
Have any of you been through this and if so how did you overcome it?"
1153,I can't control my anger and it's fueling my poor mental health,"The 22 years I've existed it seems I've constantly struggled with mental health issues especially controlling my anger. I will say I don't get angry around friends or in public and even if I get frustrated I can keep it internal. However, whenever I'm alone at home I can never seem to control it when it comes up, mostly from videogames. 

It seems that if things aren't going well such as not performing in a game or someone being toxic I get really frustrated/angry and lose my temper. No matter what methods I try such as breathing slower, counting to 10, or even just trying to reason with myself and convince myself its not worth getting upset about, nothing works and if anything it makes it worse. For some reason, it makes me more frustrated and angry when I can't control the anger and that I'm childish for having to walk my self through breathing exercises and things that were taught to me as an elementary school student. So if I can't follow these steps to calm myself down, and either way I reach some sort of anger peak what do I do? 

The main issue with my temper and rage is that it has caused me both financial and physical damage. From what I can remember I've punched countless holes in walls, broken at least $1000 worth of xbox, playstation, and game cube controllers, 3-4 laptops, and 3-4 gaming headsets. I also, when I'm really angry to the point of what feels like pure primal rage, I will bite or hit parts of my body. I don't know why I've developed this habit or if I got it from something but I really am scared I might do irreparable damage at some point. My hands are already constantly sore from playing video games a lot and one of the places I do the most damage is the part of the hand that's in between the thumb and the wrist. I'll bite as hard as I can on that part of my hand which unfortunately afterwards makes me feel better, almost like I've relieved some of that anger. Alternatively, I'll punch my legs or back of my head or use a controller. I'm really scared that one day I'll get so angry I'll hit my head more than I should or just completely loose it and not think about how much force I'm putting into a swing and really damage a part of my self.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an easy solution would be to just 'avoid what makes me angry'. In theory yeah that would work but frankly almost anything can annoy or frustrate me when I'm doing something alone. Especially the things I enjoy doing the most. Like I said earlier I play a lot of videogames and tend to take them seriously, which is also something I could fix. Regardless, I play a lot of super smash brothers, and when I am just having an off day or whatever else could be rubbing me the wrong way I almost always lose it. When that happens I tend to avoid playing smash because I just don't want to deal with my temper. This happens in a lot of games now, even something as casual as minecraft or fall guys. Its sometimes like I don't want to do anything because I don't want to deal with being frustrated or angry and it seems that no matter what I try to do I will have to confront my rage and I just really don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, after all is said and done and I've had my childish tantrum over something trivial I almost always feel defeated and depressed which makes everything worse. The other competitor in the never-ending fight to make me miserable. Especially if I break something expensive, I'll feel depressed for days on end. I'm a loser that can't deal with their childish anger and I annoy and scare my family as well. I really don't want to deal with any of these emotions any more. I hate the depression, anger and hopelessness that comes as well because it feels like nothing and no one is able to help. I don't know what to do, who to talk to, anything. I've gone to therapy for the last 10 years or so and have seen little to no results. Talking to family or friends provides no advice that resonates with me. I'm lost and tired and just want some answers to this pathetic issue, something to click that resonates. I feel like im asking for some magic cure-all and in a particular sense, I guess I am. I come to realize that the only one who can help me is my self. However, I fail to be capable to help my self work through these issues. So that being said if I can't help myself who can? I apologize for asking for so much but right now I could use any advice, any thoughts, anything that could potentially be the words I need to hear. I really don't know what else to do or where to go."
1154,I hate the fact that I’ll never be enough,"No matter how much I try to put myself together, nothing helps. I know I can get plastic surgery and I’m planning on getting rhinoplasty anyways, but what if it’s not enough and I wasted my money looking worse than I already do? I hate that I look like an ugly child. I look younger than my age so people don’t really take me seriously. I’ve been stressing over my looks ever since I was 4 and I’m sick of it. It’s torture at this point knowing that there’s always going to be someone that’s better than me or prettier than me. I honestly want to die because I’m basically worthless and people are always going to mistreat me unprovoked over my looks. I hate living everyday feeling this way about myself because by how many people have shown disdain for me, they must be right."
1155,Forgetting and hazy memories,"Hello, I think that I might have a problem and I'm wondering if someone might know what's up with that.


So a month ago I had a car accident which almost was deadly. To not make it too long, I got hit by a car, ended up with few bruises, but I was close to dying, it was a matter of being one second slower.


I noticed that my memories from this day became really blurred and hazy and lost their details really quickly. Just few hours later I had troubles telling what exactly happened. I've heard that it might just be because of trauma, so I didn't bother, just kinda wished that I could see recording of the accident to know how right me memories are.


Fast forward to a week ago, I met for the first time with my boyfriend, we're in ldr and I love him a lot, he's my first partner. I had the greatest days in my life, I don't remember being so happy ever. But we had to say goodbye.


It was on Wednesday. Now, just few days later, I noticed that my precious memories are getting hazy and losing their details. I'm having troubles remembering how did I lose my virginity with him, I remember only few details. It's like if each memory was a paint of different color, but my brain mixed all of them into this chaotic stain.


I'm scared, I don't want to lose those memories. I don't know what's happening. Is it normal? Is my brain trying to protect me from emotional damage (saying goodbye was extremely hurtful) by making me not remember this happiness? I didn't get any brain damage during accident, that's sure, but I never had it before it. I'm also very dizzy lately too while this is happening.


I'm sorry if I'm a bit chaotic, I'd be thankful for any help."

1162,How to live with what I think is ptsd?,"So long story short, I'm a 29M, when I was 18 I had a really bad breakup with my first gf after 2 years together, it took me several years to get over it. At 23 I met my current gf and now we have 2 kids that I love more than anything.

A little more than a week ago I was on Facebook at work, and even through she blocked me years ago, I came across my ex profile (friend of a friend), since then it's like I was gone 10 years in the past, like it happened yesterday.

It's been a week and it's not going away, I check mist of ptsd symptoms, it's becoming hard to work and my gf don't know what to do, I told her I wasn't well but I don't know how to explain it to her, I'm afraid it will hurt her.

The obvious thing to do is to go to a therapist but I don't know how, I'm crying just writing this, how can I speak about it to someone I never saw before?

1163,Good night,"I tell myself that I’ve been doing so well. I’ve been taking medication for a month now and I don’t really know if it’s working. It probably is cause I don’t feel as much fatigue. But I still can’t sleep. It helped but it also made me realize that there are things that can’t be changed just by taking some prescription drugs. I feel really lost when I have this realization. Funny thing is I feel like it’s harder to cry now too. I don’t even feel sad now, I just feel depressed. I know I can’t trust my thoughts whenever I’m having an episode. But my thoughts always make sense, like all the bad thoughts I have make sense and they are logical. How everyone probably hates me, how they probably already know I’m pathetic and depressed no matter how hard I try to hide it. how I’ll probably end up being no one doing nothing in the future. I skipped a night’s sleep just so I could sleep at a normal time and hopefully have everything adjusted and I end up staying up till morning the night right after. I hate that I have come to write something like this too cause it always seems like a last resort that does something but really nothing. I guess fuck positivity for now and I’ll probably just go right back to normal tomorrow. There are only choices, what else can you tell yourself."
1164,bad mental health. please help.,"so, i’ve been suffering really bad from depersonalisation and bad anxiety for around 3 months now. before this bad spell, i was at my happiest and felt amazing - i was so happy, mostly anxiety free (i did have bad flare ups and intrusive thoughts every now and then but i was just SO happy and care free). i had a panic attack about death 3 months ago and since then, my mental health has taken a downstairs spiral. 

basically, these three months started off with being scared of dying. what happens when we die? omg one day i’m not going to be here! - it would make me feel so hot and flustered, so dizzy, and not be able to breathe. this started this depersonalisation feeling, which hasn’t left since. i’ve managed the thoughts of dying now - i’ve kind of came to terms of it and try and not let it affect me. however, when i do think of it, i feel very hot and panicky but can calm myself down quite quickly. which is good. 

the new thing im worrying about is going insane. getting psychosis and schizophrenia. this is genuinely making me PANIC. this is because ive been researching a lot about my anxiety, reading forums, people’s stories, etc. my biggest fear is now losing my mind, losing my touch on reality. i read something that said ‘you wouldn’t know if you were going insane or had schizophrenia, people with anxiety are too in touch with their emotions’ - so now i’ve started to feel extremely paranoid. i cant even explain it. i’m paranoid that i ‘don’t know how i’m feeling’ even though i do. i clearly do. but i just feel so detached and physically sick constantly, because i am SO worried about getting this. i sometimes even throw up because of this. like, i’ve read about schizophrenia and it’s like ‘you think people are watching you, and are out to get you, your family are gonna kill you etc’ - i’ve never felt this way. but now my mind is going into overdrive and i think i’m making myself feel this way. when i feel particularly anxious, every sound i hear triggers me, my family talking makes me feel really hyper aware, i just feel so hyper aware and panicked. i just can’t calm down, it’s like a constant panic attack and im terrified. i just want to feel normal and not have racing thoughts all of the time. my biggest fear is ending up in a psych hospital or trapped away forever. i just don’t want to go insane or crazy or get psychosis or  schizophrenia. how do i stop?!?? am i ok? ☹️"
1165,No caption,"After dealing with so much this past year, I’ve always questioned why life is so hard. I can’t even explain how I feel. It’s not like I’m homeless or starving, I’m just so mentally tired. I hate the fact that my brain decides to torture me this way. I hate how I’m not doing anything with my life or enjoy what I used to because I have no motivation. I feel empty. I’ve contemplated on just ending everything but I also don’t wanna die. Why do I have to live here and suffer when I never asked to be born?? Why do I have to fight through the struggle, just to live a 9 to 5 lifestyle. 

I was born Christian so when I feel like ending it all, I can’t help but think of Hell. It really makes me hate God for being “the Almighty” but couldn’t save his people from this torture? Why am I being punished when I never got the option to choose to be born?? Now the only option is to live through this torture or be tortured for eternity.

And while I'm not suicidal, I have been thinking a lot about death. You know, how would I kill myself? What would I write in my note? Etc.

It's kinda became my first response to stuff. Having a bad day? Why not kill yourself? Worried about something? Kill yourself. Argued with your parents?

You COULD just kill yourself.

I would never actually do it, but these thought worry me a little. I really want to see someone. Should I get tell my mom? I don't want her to over react."

1170,Feeling lost and hopeless,"Feeling hopeless

I know I won’t feel like this forever but I’m so scared that I will. 
I always look at the “what ifs?”. 
I feel very hopeless at the minute and like nothings going right. 
Everyone I know is off to university and gets to make friends and start their life but I’ve been forced to take a gap year. 
I don’t want to wait a year until I get to move out and study it feels so long away. 
I constantly feel anxious and worried and it feels like all my friends don’t make an effort with me anymore. And I’m scared my girlfriend will do the same, I don’t want her to leave me or forget about me even tho she’s moving closer to me because she’s going to uni and she said she will never leave me. She has also done a lot of things to prove to me she will always love etc but I’m always scared. 
I’ve recently referred myself to therapy and so it’s just more waiting around until I get to speak to a therapist and so I guess this is another way to vent my problems and try to understand them. 
I feel very lost, I’m the type of person that likes everything to be set in stone, and it doesn’t feel like that anymore."

I was hoping to that some of you could share your experience (or point me in the direction well researched articles) of how exercise has had a positive impact on you and your mental health.

Thank you in advance!"
1175,I did a terrible thing and I don't know what to do,"i don't even know how to start 
sorry for my not-so-good english

when I'm on school it's easier to forget about it but when I'm home by myself that keeps going on my mind
It's even harder because the way I acted with that person was not good and I couldn't see it 

I feel like I corrupted that person's happiness, but I can't do anything to make things different. I was different back then, but things happening on my home and my loses through the years made me colder about losing someone, but this time I know it's entirely my fault.

I want to do something about this but I don't think that person even wants to talk with me. What can I do?..."

1177,Controversial opinion: suicide can be completely rational and not having it legalized is immoral,"I can never share my views on suicide anywhere IRL, even mental health support groups, because people are so tied to the dogmatic belief that life=good, in every situation, for every person. All advice towards suicidal people is based on the assumtion that we secretly want to be alive and the ideation is like...a devil whispering in our ears, or something, rather than a long-thought-out decision. The only thing that's stopped me over the years is an evolutionary holdover, a animalistic survival instinct. Don't act like theres any deeper meaning. And stop valuing quantity of life over quality."

1180,I learned that breathing techniques help you deal with stress and anxiety. Here is a summary of my pre-research,"I’m a random guy who runs a business from home and dealing with stress during the day. Half a year ago I started a diary. It changed a way I think about myself and “woke me up” in some way.

It made me open to trying other “free tools” that are popping up here and there on the internet. The only thing I miss is support from others who do/learn something similar. But we can connect and share our experience.

**Breathwork**

There is emergency breathwork you can do to calm down. Once you feel overwhelmed try to extend your breath for 7 seconds and then release it for another 7 seconds. Your body goes to the parasympathetic nervous system that is responsible for the body's rest \[1\]. And your heart rate gets down. Use this in a stressful situation or if you go to sleep after the hard day.

But we need something more powerful to deal with regular stress.

There are many variations of breathwork. You may know about pranayama (yoga practice) or holotropic breathing. In general, breathwork is a process when you isolate your breath from any physical activity and do only it to push your body above previous oxygen limits.

**The Wim Hof Method**

I learned about the Wim Hof Method by watching the Joe Rogan Experience podcast \[2\]. This technique consists of three rounds. You do deep breathe for 40 times and hold it for as long as you can’t. Then you release, inhale and do one more hold for 15 seconds. That’s round one. There is even a video where Wim Hof guides you \[3\].

Laird Hamilton shared a story behind the method \[4\]. He said Wim Hof’s technique is a derivative of a Himalayan breathing technique called “Tummo”. It was developed by monks to keep their body temperature in the right condition in a cold environment.

Mister Hof says breathing is about changing chemistry.  “When you saturate cells with more oxygen then you typically need, your body stores it. And your body’s chemistry becomes alkaline. That enables control of all the body systems — immune, endocrine, lymphatic, vascular, etc.” 

“Oxygen influences the body’s chemistry by balancing it in affected areas. Scientists agree with me, doing psychotherapy is not enough to reduce stress. You should also work on your chemistry” \[5\].

There are some scientific papers behind the method \[6\]. Which makes it even more interesting to try.

**Let’s connect and run an independent study**

I would love to share my results and get data from others. How did we feel before that? What experience we had by using the method? How did it change us? And so on. 

I encourage those of you, who also deal with anxiety/stress or have problems with sleep. Let’s connect and run an independent study on the breathwork.

1181,I wanna kill myself,[removed]
1182,Is this rather harmless OCD worth seeing a therapist?,"Hello friends. To get to the point: Since I forgot to lock the bathroom door of a restaurant and a girl walked in on me (I had finished, but it was still a shock), I started to check every lock twice, or three or four times. Since my cat jumped out of the window, I check the windows twice or more times, too. I also lock the car three or four times on average. 
I check if I closed the locker in the riding stable, which means I have to walk about threw minutes, even tho I checked it double when I closed it in the first place, to prevent me from going unnecessarily. I KNOW that I locked it, but I can't do anything about it.
As well as I know that I closed the gate to the meadow, but I still turn back to look after ~twenty seconds. At least only one time.
It's nothing that bothers me too much, except for the fact that I manage to be too late or don't catch the train or have to hurry like hell. Not always, just sometimes, but it'd be preventable. 
I managed to stop checking more than twice if the bathroom door is closed. I even manage to check only one time, or not at all, but then I am extremely anxious when I'm sitting on the toilet.
What fuels this obsessive behaviour is 1. my shitty memory - but I also check if I KNOW and REMEMBER that everythings fine - and 2. paranoia. What if the cat jumps out of the window again? What if someone steals the car? What if the horses escape? What if. 
But even tho I know what's the problem, I can't stop. Well, sometimes, with enough force, but then I am extremely anxious. I should have checked, I think. I forgot it this time, I think. Maybe I am not too late then, but I am not concentrated. 

Still, for me, that doesn't seem as if it was worth talking to a therapist. Just something I had to figure out how to get rid of. But now I am starting college and ask myself it it's worth it missing the train, coming too late, maybe even to exams or interviews for internships, just because I feel unbothered enough not to see a therapist. 
Problem is, my insurrance would only pay if I have a proper diagnosis. Does such rather harmless OCD count? 

(Funfact: I am arguing w myself rn if I should go check whether I locked the locker. I did. But my ass wants to go look anyway.)"
1183,The Me Too cases have taken a toll on my mental health,"Online world is getting crazier day by day. The Me Too movement started of great, with actual harrasers getting outed, but later it changed into lynch mob. I saw countless testimony where a person was branded as a sexual harraser and molester just because an anonymous account posted something anonymously. Even after two years, people who were absolved of the charges are facing the brunt with random people going back and posting old links before their absolution claiming them to be sexual predator.

All it takes to ruin someone's life is one post. Just one post. No one cares about the other side of the story. I read testimony of countless people who approved of actions at that moment, but later they changed their view so they branded the other person as a molester. It has been used to settle political and personal scores now. Anyone can ruin anyone's life."
1184,(F21) Getting out of a toxic relationship online,"(This port has some bdsm-y themes in it, I hope I can post that here! )

I've been in a toxic relationship with a 'dominant' man online for a little over two years now, on and off. 
 
It started when I was 19 (and he was 27). Back then I was curious about the online bdsm community and thought I'd try it out myself. We met online, we were both looking for the same thing and we got along pretty well. 

The problems started because he had a tendency to ghost me constantly. He'd just stop replying in the middle of a conversation and then disappear for weeks - which would result in me getting unreasonably upset and I'd end up bombarding him with texts till he replied. (Which is very unusual for me, I don't show this behaviour with literally anyone else) 

This cycle would keep repeating and each time he would promise a 'fresh start' and talk about how attached he was to me, how he wanted a 'relationship' with me etcetc. And I would just stick around like an idiot. 

It would end up feeling like he only used me to get nudes from me, that's the only time he showed real interest. We would have times of normal, fun chatting too but it was usually cut short because he'd be 'busy' so he'd just stop replying. He used to act oblivious about it initially but the more I called him out on it the more pissed off his reactions used to be and he'd call me crazy for bombarding him and ranting like a 'bitch'. 

One time I completely spiralled out of control and got really toxic when he ghosted me for months. I ended up finding an insta page of his dog he told me about (which was very creepy of me to do) - but the account was run by a woman and she was definitely his girlfriend at some stage because her insta had a picture of them in a relationship. 

I'm still not entirely sure if they're in a relationship together but I don't understand why they'd get a dog together otherwise? I even asked him about it straight up because I felt terrible for stalking him like I did. His response was, obviously, that it was none of my business, that he was done revealing any more details of his life to me and that he's saying he isn't in a relationship so I should take his word for it and shut up. (There was a big possiblity he was in a relationship otherwise too - because we've never even spoken on the phone, he rarely took pictures for me, and he disappeares after his false promises)

Anyway we moved past that because I had to 'make it up to him' by sending him nudes (like I'm some object) but then the cycle would start again. The toxicity would get worse every time and keep building up - I started to give him missed calls and more text bombardments when I knew he was avoiding me. 
Right now we've ended it completely - we've both blocked each other on all our chat apps. 


Is there any way I can figure out why I did all this and got so attached?
Have I been completely unreasonable and creepy in how I've acted? When I look at it objectively, I think it's all been really fucked up and I've been used and objectified and I've been awful as well. 
It's like I hate him but I still want to go back to that relationship. It was so frustrating because anytime I'd vent about how upset he made me he'd just ignore it or call me crazy. This unfeeling attitude would make my ranting worse because it's like he didn't care for me at all. 

Why am I still in a state where I blame myself for this going wrong and still give him so much value? Why do I still crave his approval and want him to care? What do I do? I'm so lost!!

Please please help."
1185,How are you dealing with your depression? (Post partum or otherwise),Other than antidepressants or anti anxiety pills.
1186,Tired of playing scenarios in my head that don’t even exist.,.
1187,My GF is sick and I'm scared I pushed her over the edge,[removed]
1188,Anyone have these episodes?,"Like the title says, am running in circles. It was in February when I tried to put myself out of misery with pills and alcohol. Then ended up in hospital for 7 days, got released after that with antidepressants and sleeping pills and antihistamines for anxiety. Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. And 3 days ago I tried the same thing. Only this time I didn’t have so many pills at disposal and it was only antihistamines (10 pills) and alcohol. My SO called an ambulance again and when I woke up there, I freaked out and took needless out of arms and took off. Had a bad fight with my boyfriend after that when I came home, he even called police on me, but they just came checked us out and left. 
But anyway, long story short between February and now I was doing quite well, taking antidepressants in the morning and these other pills when needed. Now question is, why am I going in circles?! Why is this happening all over again?! It’s like my mind gets darkened completely and am out of any control. Then I turn to alcohol for some calming effect but it turns to hell. Not every time, just like my brain turns upside down. 
Anyone has any thoughts to share, I would really be grateful. 
Don’t need to say that am sooo tired of these episodes and really don’t want to experience it ever again. I guess from that idea comes the suicide idea. From fear. 
Thanks to anyone willing to read."

1190,Anyone else have anxiety about watching something new?,"For the longest time, I've always had difficulty watching something new ESPECIALLY when it just came out. And even after a couple of weeks/months, the thought of watching something new kind of makes me anxious or scared. What makes it worse is that I don't know *why* I feel that way. Is there an explanation for this?

Btw, I've been diagnosed with panic disorder. Idk if that's the cause or what, but yeah."
1191,How Do I Get Doctors To Take Me Seriously," 

I feel overwhelmed and out of control. I haven't cut in a long time, tho only of guilt for the burden it causes others if they see it. Just spent an hour searching for a blade. I'm often advised to go to the hospital when I ask for advice about this sort of problem. The thing is, last time I went in for my mental health, I was treated like a hypocodriach. It was my first intense anxiety attack and thought I was dying. The way they seemed to not give a shit (for lack of better terms) and roll their eyes at me, and treat me like I'm over-reacting only makes me feel worse. Its like they think I'm wasting their time or something. Any time I've went in and wasn't literally on the brink of death its been this way...

I'm not sure what else to say, so I guess I'll update if I think of anything"
1192,what do i do?,
1193,Me and my Heart,"This could kind of be a long story but I'll keep it pretty brief. 

I have chest pain. I have had worsening chest pain since March time. I have been to the hospital easily 30 times for investigation but every time it is ruled none cardiac. I am so dizzy I feel like I will lose consciousness at any minute and I feel like my heart is going to stop. 

I've been told I have heart anxiety. I have a phobia of my own heart and I cannot function. 

I cant walk, I cant feel emotion - all of these things end with my visiting the hospital with 'heart' pain.

Depression set in quite early on, I am letting my family down by being so selfish, why wouldnt I be depressed? 

I would kill myself, but I cant do that to my wife and children. 

Therapist isnt working. Medication isnt working. I feel like my heart is failing and because I am only 32 the doctors wont take me seriously. 

I have (finally!) been put forward for a CT angiogram within the next few weeks, and I have just had an abdominal CT so that should rule out anything overly serious and hidden. 

I cant shake the feeling that my heart is blocked and not working correctly. 

I have had the following tests:
ECG
Blood Tests
Echocardiogram
24 hour tape

The doctors think my pains are digestive and my anxieties are adding to it. 

I cant remember the last time I had a good day. 

I guess I'm having a 'what is the point?' day."
1194,"My (F23) partner (F22) made a long way treating schizoaffective disorder and remaining stable for almost an year, but now I'm worried that he's overdoing himself...","I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it. In the end, it's up to his decision."

1196,How do you minimize depression and anxiety?,"Yeah, I know you go see a professional and they tell you want to do. I’ve seen so many and none of them have been good enough to continue seeing. So here I am asking the Internet. Any advice on how to end this hell before I start to feel suicidal?"
1197,A lot has been happening,"Lots of stuff has been happening to me lately. 

I think that everything doesn’t exist, what I touch, see, hear, everything it just don’t exist. Before my family moved, I’ve been seeing shadows. I don’t know what they are, they don’t look human and I usually see them on the walls, and once on the floor. My parents think it’s my vision, i have myopia and I am having my myopia treated, so I thought that too and I’ve grown used to them to the point I ignore them and don’t pay any attention to it.

It’s just now in quarantine that I’ve been seeing them less, but start to hear my mother calling my name when she’s not and feel anxious about living in another county. The neighborhood is quiet and empty like the last neighborhood I was in, but it just don’t feel right. I never go outside and rather stay in my room the whole day, but I know I have to come out at least care for myself with less motivation to do so. I feel like I’m being watched, and sometimes I try going up the bed trying to avoid whatever is under my bed ready to attack me, the same thing as the garage I quickly get what I need and exit as soon as possible.

So it led to the point that I think my house is haunted because it would get like this almost everyday, except the voices because i hear them sometimes, more when I’m sleep deprived because I’m starting to not sleep as much as I used to. I’m trying to sleep more early. I hope I’m just being paranoid and lazy like my parents say I am."

1201,Is it normal to daydream this much?,"I realized I daydream a lot, usually about characters I like (sort of like fanfiction except i don’t write it?) I think if I’m not doing school work, then most of my day is literally just spent sitting or pacing around daydreaming. Like I have a book I’ve been trying to read for 2 weeks, but I feel like I just can’t get myself to read it as I get too distracted with my daydreams. I also almost never finish videos or books because I get distracted by a daydream. 

During school I had to do independent work, but I got distracted again by daydreaming and music

I also noticed that I not only listen to a lot of songs, but just movie or show scenes in general that fit with my thoughts. Like, I’ll be watching a show that’ll have a scene of someone saying something, and a lot of times I’ll automatically think “This goes perfectly with “this daydream” and then I’ll play that scene along with songs that go with my daydreams usually while pacing around my house (I think my family must think I’m possessed or something since I just spin in circles, or if there’s people around I’ll lock myself in my bathroom and pace in there which makes my family mad)

I now mainly only listen to music that goes along with my daydreams

I‘m sorry if this isn’t the right sub to post this in, I just thought it kind of made sense to post here."
1202,How do I ask for help?,"I would be a completely different person if my mental health wasn't so bad, I would be better there is so much that I want to do in life but I can't bring myself to do any of it I can't even get out of bed. I'm so frustrated and angry at myself I hate it I hate this so much. In my life one bad thing just keeps happening after the next and I don't know how to cope with it. I'm a college student and I used to care so much about my grades but now I don't even attend my classes and my grades are gonna suffer because of it. I'm such a failure I hate myself so much and the only thing that's keeping me from ending my life is the people in my life that I love and care about because I can't do that to them. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I'm in this constant state of sadness and I can't see it getting any better, my anxiety has been really bad lately and I keep having panic attacks and I've tried so many things but nothing has worked I feel so hopeless. I thought about reaching out for help and I want to but I don't have the guts to do it and I don't know what to say or who to talk to, I feel really scared and my anxiety keeps me from talking about it with my friends and family. It sucks and I didn't ask for any of this I just want the pain to end it's ruining my life."
1203,I can’t control my self worth during difficult times.,"Since late primary school I’ve struggled with anxiety and mild depression, and recent traumas have made it more difficult for me to control my self worth and suicidal thoughts.

Recently I’ve noticed that whenever I have a somewhat difficult time in my life, suddenly my mind becomes really negative and I lose all self esteem. I forget all the good things in my life and what I’ve managed to accomplish, and my mind just focuses on the negatives. I have epilepsy, and recently I was living a good life seizure free and controlled with medicine, but one little random seizure happened and everything just came crashing down, I thought to myself- what’s the point in continuing if my epilepsy will just get worse and worse? I’ve also moved back to my small hometown recently, and a conversation with my boyfriend about why I don’t really go outside in my hometown was a little bit awkward, and I just thought- why would he date someone like me, I’m so messed up compared to him.

This immediate negative mindset results in me doing things that I don’t want to do, and with hindsight later I deeply regret how I coped in these situations. I’m tired of pushing my relationships away, I’m tired of feeling proud of myself one day for me to feel like I’m a monster the next. What can I do to control this? I feel like this mindset steals everything from me ☹️"
1204,Lonely.,"I just wanna die. I won't kill myself but I want to die. I went to college this semester after a gap year, thinking I would meet awesome people who would want to be my friend but I've never been more lonely. No one gives a shit about me. No one talks to me or hardly even gives me eye contact. I try to be nice but everyone is already set in their clicks and there's no room for me. I try offering weed or alc and I get taken advantage of. No one cares. I'm done trying to be people's friend, I don't give a fucking shit anymore. Idk why I'm this awkward fucking outcast that is unapproachable, what did I do? No one gets me, everything is pointless, I hate people. The pain in my heart runs deep, weed is the only thing that makes me smile anymore, I gave up painting miniatures, I gave up reading, I gave up longboarding, it just doesn't make me happy anymore. I want to cry thinking about my family and how special they are to me and I'm so sorry to them that I turned into this when they're doing great but no tears even come close to flowing. My face is stoic and I eat maybe one meal a day. Bags are forming under my eyes and I'm losing sleep. I don't get notifications on my phone cuz no one talks to me.  I just want people to see me. I feel like I can't go on like this, it's destroying me. I have no one else to talk to so I came to the internet hoping at least one person will say something back. I wish I could go back to being a kid when I was happy."

i do feel like i’m « in the scene » but not as an actor, but as a spectator, like the things that i do, i know i do them but i’m more like a narrator, it affects my concentration and overall happiness and i don’t know what to do and it’s becoming more and more frequent and i don’t know what to do
sometimes i just wake up and feel that way and i’m like ... fuck this is going to be a bad day and sometimes it’s during the day i just.... close up and i just can’t open again
it used to be only when i didn’t sleep enough but it’s getting more and more frequent and now i just hang out with myself all night and i was wondering, is there like a simple solution ?? like idk, coffee?? maybe drugs ??? i tried both and it didn’t really work but maybe there’s something else"
1206,just want to let go,"it’s been about a year since me and my girlfriend of almost three years broke up, i feel as if i haven’t progressed an inch. after it happened i moved to boston, i pretty much locked myself in my apartment for 10 months, i don’t really have friends either since this is a new city for me. i just tell myself i won’t go out bc of corona but i know it’s my anxieties keeping me in. i’m mad fucking lonely and all i do is think about her and what i could’ve done to not make her fall out of love... i want to feel better so bad but it feels impossible to fully let her go even if we haven’t talked in months. i want to embrace new opportunities but holy hell is it terrifying trying to meet people."
1207,Constantly stressed and irritable,"Hi all, I'm not sure who to talk to about this so I figured I could hopefully get some advice here. I'd like to give some backstory first.

I am an 18 year old male and, like so many other people, have had a rough year. First off, my senior year got cut short, which wasn't the end of the world but it really did suck. But I was able to keep my head up knowing that I got to go to college in the fall. But as the summer progressed, I realized that wasn't going to happen either. Currently, I am living at home going to college online and will be for the foreseeable future.

The reason I'm in this subreddit is because I don't really feel like myself. For a moth or so I was in a pretty sad place, but at this point I would describe it differently. I am easily irritable and have a lot of pent up stress and worry. I normally am a daily positive and happy person, and I am definitely a people pleaser. I avoid conflict at all costs, no matter how small. Normally that's fine, but since I feel so irritable, whenever something annoys me, or makes me sad, I bottle it up. 

 
As I type this out I feel like it sounds ridiculous, but I really just don't know how to describe it. Long story short, I feel like I'm prone to frustration and sadness, and I don't feel like myself because of that. If anyone has any advice I would really really appreciate it."
1208,I think im going to end it today,"I have no joy in anything. I think im going to killself today. Seriously. I give up. I seriouly just dont like myself anymore. I dont want to talk to people. I have so much anxiety i wont even leave my room to eat. I give up. It was fun. Im so sorry to my mom. I live her so much. I love you so much. Im so sorry to my bunny. I love you so much. I seriously give up. Im going to go on a hike today into the woods. Take a bunch if xanax and die alone. Seriously. I just moved to a new city and wasted 10k of my parents money. I give up. Schools to hard. I give up. Fully. Im done. This is my goodbye. Im done. Im no longer happy. I just want to die in the woods and be happy alone. Im done. Please dont be sad for me. If you love me be happy for me. Im finally getting peace from this mental game. Im done. Fully done. Im to sensitive. I fully give up. I love you so much peggie, your the only person who never left me❤️even thought your just a bunny i love you. Im done. This is it. I hate all of you for putting me throigh hell in highschool.

Thankyou so much for being so amazing. This is what makes me happy. This is how im at peace. Dad. You are the best. Thankyou for taking care of our family. Thankyou. I love you both to the moon and back."
1209,I keep imagining myself jumping,"It started when my re teacher began telling us how self harm is for people who want attention- he didn’t mean it in the way that you may think, but the rest of my class took it upon themselves to convert the teachers words, and they were all saying how self harm was for attention seekers. I just sat there on the verge of tears while they all just made me feel like shit, they were saying how, if someone really wanted to solve their issues they’d kill them self and shit. I kept ignoring their words so I heard bits and bats. But ever since then, I keep imagining myself jumping off buildings- including my school’s roof. I feel worse and worse and the thoughts don’t fucking stop. I have this constant hatred to myself in my heart, and it’s physical just as much as it is emotional. I’m just fed up of this"
1210,“Overwhelming” To-Do Lists,"Is anyone else “triggered” by to-do lists that seem overwhelming? For me, specifically, it is the list of things needed to be done around the house. Cleaning, laundry, etc I can handle as long as I stay on top of it. It’s a full time job, though. And the days that I work, my husband and kids completely wreck the place and then I’m overwhelmed and the depression kicks in. Then there’s the projects that I would like to do. I’ll ask my husband a few times to help me with them. He will usually find every excuse to push them off until later. They don’t get done. Then I feel like my wants are not important - trigger anxiety about life choices and ... depression. I hate this cycle. I’m at a low today and I hate myself for it."
1211,Anxiety Question,"How do I deal with tics in public? I’m in a wedding later today and, I just really started having them. How do I keep from people from staring at me and thinking I’m crazy?"
1212,How has covid affected your mental health?,Before covid I could somewhat manage my anxiety quite well. I was in a good routine. But now my anxiety is at an all time high! I feel unable to do the things I could do before the pandemic hit. I can’t even see my therapist because of the pandemic which makes it even worse.
1213,I might lose half of my family,"TRIGGER WARNING: sexual abuse, child neglect
Basically my mother abused me. And my family on her side quite frankly doesn’t care. I think I have to cut them off because I can’t have people who don’t believe me. I wanted to talk about it to them, but they said they didn’t want to hear about it. They still invite her to Christmas gatherings and such, which I don’t participate in. My brothers still are loyal to her too. I think I might have to cut off almost my entire family because they’re not on my side. And mentally I can’t deal with that. It seems like no one believes me, even my brothers whom she neglected and starved along with me when we were younger. I can’t take it. I don’t know what to do. My therapist tells me that I should cut them out of my life but it’s hard. Lots of times I feel like no one understands what I’m going through. And I constantly feel lost and don’t know what to do with myself now that things are getting better because it’s not normal for me, my life has been constant chaos. Idk. Is this something to be upset about? Should I cut them off because they are still close with the person who abused me? Should I just get over it because life’s too short and it’s not that big of a deal? Idk. Hopefully you guys have input."
1214,Finding therapy can be frustrating : /," So... over a week ago I spoke to the head of a counselling group in my area, and they said they'd match me up with a counsellor and get back to me to organise a session. When I heard nothing, I sent a follow-up email a few days ago to ask when this will happen and if it's still going ahead... and theyve still promptly done nothing : )

I contacted like 10 counselling places nearby... this group did that,  one of the private ones is unavailable for over a month and only doing virtual sessions (which Im not really comfy with) and well... the rest (besides 2 who I have yet to speak to) said nothing (Ive emailed them all twice and even gotten my friends mum to leave a voicemail... and gotten radio silence in response) 

Kinda annoyed at the provision (or lack thereof) of help if Im being honest! I would have thought theyd want clients anyway... isnt this a business? 

People with depression tend to find it really hard to ask for help and feel very despairing if they finally manage to and then don't get it,  and often might not have the energy to chase things up this much...  really not great I dont like to think how many depressed people might end up feeling that  the help isnt there, or feel rejected and less likely to ask for help  again, or are too tired to fight tooth and nail for a response in this  situation I have two more who actually scheduled an initial appointment and that I  can talk to somewhat soon at least, so... there is some hope (unless they do the same thing as this group or also aren't free face to face)

Just... anyone out there who is experiencing this as well, know that I empathise and really feel your frustration! But DO NOT GIVE UP - as much as what I said above is true and I think its wrong for people with depression to be forced to jump through all these hoops... just please keep trying to. You owe it to yourself and they owe it to you to respond... eventually."
1215,I’m not coping well,"My boyfriend of three years just broke up with me. Until this morning I had no idea this was coming and I am still in shock and I don’t really know what to do now. 
I feel like my whole life has just been taken from underneath me. I just graduated uni this year and I still have nothing lined up and now I don’t even have him. We had so many plans for this year and now they are all gone and I have no idea where my life is going next.
I have history of self harm and I haven’t had any urges yet but I feel it is just a matter of time and I need help on how to keep myself safe."
1216,"My (F23) partner (M22) made a long way treating schizoaffective disorder and remaining stable for almost an year, but now I'm worried that he's overdoing himself...","I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it. In the end, it's up to his decision."
1217,Emotional Sensitivity Issues,[removed]
1218,Can I force them to keep me longer in a psych ward? Long term?,"I'm completely losing my grasp on reality. It's beyond just running stupid scenarios on my head, I'm afraid I'm going to act on these incredibly bizarre and pointless urges I have. For example, all over my Facebook and TV all people are talking about is pedophilia and child predators. Constantly. Nonstop. Article after article after article. I read some at first because I like reading the news but now I'm ocd about it. I have to know more, I have to know everything. I get so uncomfortable reading it and it makes me sick but if I stop I get even more nauseous because I can't fight the urge to DO something like read or research. The subject matter is disgusting and upsetting, and I don't actually want to know more and yet I constantly do. Every link is like a rabbit hole and I end up learning about something that sticks in my head. Now I'm afraid of what my next urge could be. I read about the dark web or whatever, and now I'm afraid I'll end up learning how to access it and everything and then finding myself on there when I don't want to / care about it. Or I read about a really upsetting ""meme"" related to some awful video someone forced a child to make and I'm afraid I'll end up seeing the video, or the authorities will arrest me for looking up info about it... But the thing is I don't WANT TO. It feels like someone is holding my hand over a stove. I get do anxious and start sweating and freaking the fuck out, shaking and pretty much crying unless I research things. And then when I do, I calm down but feel a deep sense of regret and pain because I had to ""give in.""

The subject matter is constantly changing. A couple weeks ago, it was drone strikes and war crimes. Before that, it was Warhammer 40k lore. The list goes on. It's always something and I can't control it. The current thing is really destroying my head because I am so sick to my stomach reading about these horrible things people do to children and I'm so scared to have to learn more or end up in a place that has something like that, be exposed to it, and even if I report it I'll never be able to scrub my memory of it. I don't want to see anything like that but I'm afraid by reading so many articles I eventually could end up on some website that has it by mistake. It's driving me insane. I only have peace when I'm completely asleep. Even if I distract myself with a game or movie, the thoughts come back in the middle of it and I freak TF out. 

I need serious help and I have no one IRL except an elderly parent who can't help me. I'm completely alone and afraid. I want to go to a psych ward just to be isolated from everything but I know they'll just kick me out after 2-3 days. I don't know how to go and be kept long term for months or years. Medication will make my condition worse but I don't care as long as I'm just put in a room and kept away from all books, TV, internet, etc. Does something like that exist? Who do I have to talk to? I'm losing it."
1219,I want to fall in love again,"I want to be able to fall and feel in Love again

Hi R

You see, I have been in love with the same person for 3 years and the truth is that things never worked out, we were never a couple and she is doing her normal life like anyone entering and leaving relationships but I have given a lot of importance to what I keep having feels because the truth is that he was the first person I fell in love with.

 and because I have not overcome the feeling and sadness that I have never been able to take the relationship to another level, I want to feel better about myself and give myself the opportunity to know to other people and then in the future to have something with someone else other than her but it really makes me very difficult since my mind constantly reminds me that I failed with her and I am discouraged from trying something new.
Thanks for reading &lt;3"
1220,I’m Dealing With A Passion-Related Existential Crisis And I Feel Miserable (19M),
1221,"Is This OCD, or?","Hi. :(
I know how bad self diagnosing is so I won’t tread that category, but if there’s anyone on here who has OCD, or knows anything about it or even has something similar, may I please have your second opinion on this? My mental health has been going down a drain and I’m afraid this is worse than I precedented.

Here are some things I’ve been experiencing:

1. I have health anxiety, but recently I’ve been noticing washing my hands constantly after touching anything or anyone who is a stranger to me, in fear I’ll be getting a deadly disease. I’ve literally made my hands raw and rough from all the soap multiple times.
2. I now have intrusive thoughts, which destroy me from the inside out. I don’t want to get into it but they’ve made me have terrible breakdowns that I really cannot explain.
3. I am constantly...paranoid? Thinking the food delivery guy poisoned our meal, thinking the man who rang the doorbell may be a bad guy, thinking my cat will knock nail polish off my desk when I’m asleep and lick it and die, thinking my cat, who I know is upstairs, is in the bedroom/bathroom I was just in so I’ll have to recheck it again and again just to make sure she’s really not being trapped inside, you know, in case my large cat is behind my small toilet, thinking if I don’t check both of my pupils before I go to bed, I’ll miss the chance of a stroke or seizure or whatever kind of brain injury because one of my pupils will be much more dilated and I won’t know unless I check, having one major health anxiety flare up that lasted four months with panic attacks every day cause I thought I had rabies for literally the most baseless, nonexistent reason, and I proceeded to go through the most horrific time of my life with an unbelievable amount of guilt thinking that I’d doomed my parents too, thinking if I don’t pick up the T-Shirt that fell on the floor, that I’ll become a victim to karma for not....picking up a shirt. Rechecking whatever my brain tells me I need to recheck, like the bathroom door a hundred times, or if the bedroom doesn’t have snakes slithering on the floor a hundred times or if the window isn’t open a hundred times. The list goes on.
4.I maladaptive daydream a LOT.

I don’t remember anything else, but these are the more major ones. I know we shouldn’t diagnose each other, but I’d really appreciate it if someone could give me their opinion :( This is getting so tiring. 

*BTW, the increase in health paranoia is not because of COVID. For some reason, I’m not worried for it, and neither is the worst I have experienced for it nearly as major as it should be with someone who has a huge health anxiety. Weird, I know. By recently I mean the past less than a year!"
1222,Im so insecure about looks,"Im a guy and ik its a bit of a pussy move to be so concerned about my looks, but seriously some days i spend like 10 hours on these sites, seeing if im ugly or pretty or whatever and i don’t know why. Im 17 rn and a few girls have liked me in the past, but whenever i take a pic of myself and see it on my phone, or put it on one of those rating subreddits i just get destroyed and confidence dies inside. Ik as a guy its a serious pussy ass move, and i know that ‘beauty is not all that matters’ but the idea of not being attractive for the rest of my life just does not leave my head and whenever i see guys breezing through many girls at a time i just get pissed off at myself for some reason."
1223,Anxiety,"Over the past two years I had the exact same routine everyday and throughout my day I’d get anxiety here and there not thinking much of it. Two-three months ago I quit my job do to a toxic work environment and thought no problem I would just get another job, throughout these three months I found that my anxiety has been through the roof I can’t eat and sleep and I can’t keep a job or show up to interviews do to throwing up and not eating do to the anxiety. Sometimes I’ll get really severe panic attacks where my vision goes blurry and I feel like blacking out and my ears start ringing insanely loud while my whole body goes numb and fizzy and it’s a terrifying experience every time. I was wondering if this was like normal for panic attacks or something I was never like this until a couple months ago."
1224,Can I slip him Ativan?,"My boyfriend has gone completely off the deep end... I don't know if it's because he's been using hard drugs or not.. he's constantly swearing and he's become very violent and aggressive in his normal activities. I don't need this and neither do my pets. I was wondering, what if I put an Ativan in his food or drink or something?? Is that illegal?? It's so wrong, I know that.. it goes against everything I believe in and I've always said that's a big no no! But I just wonder if it would help him? Maybe he would get to relax for the first time in a long time, and maybe he would finally have a good day? Also, maybe I could finally take a deep breath myself and relax... But maybe I'd have an anxiety attack about him finding out and freaking out....? I don't know what to do... He's horrible to be around, and I can't imagine how horrible he must be feeling if this is his behaviour.. it's not normal for him!"
1225,I don’t feel real,I feel a constant pressure on my head like someone’s squeezing my skull. I hear a ringing in my left ear. Nothing around me feels me real anymore. I often feel like I’m in a dream. My depth perception feels off and everything looks stretched out and further away from me. I look at my hands and I can’t comprehend that it’s mine. I want to feel normal again.
1226,Feeling stuck in a relationship with a suicidal person,"As the title says I’ve (17M) been in a relationship with this person (17M) and it was quite late into the relationship that i learned of their mental health issues (which are pretty severe). Lately it’s been coming up to a boiling point and they’ve been very unstable. However, they haven’t been seeing a therapist or haven’t been getting any medication (as they are clinically depressed) and I don’t know what else to do. I’m not a professional and I can’t really do anything to help except talk but it’s making me scared that a little thing will set them off. I’m afraid to break up as I feel like it will send the message that he is too much for me, and he will take it badly and kill himself. His parents aren’t taking very good care of him and are separated so they haven’t been helping him either. He doesn’t really have any close friends to talk to either. I don’t know what to do please help"

I can stand in my room without looking back at the door every 3 mins in case someone's looking at me , they call me back to them whenever they need me 24/7 and i cant keep this up much more, 5 years and running , how can i solve this?"

So recently I have not been feeling like myself and I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety and irrational thoughts. Nothing to major, but I know I should work on it.

But I need some guidance so I’m looking for a good resource or a mental heath workbook that could guide me. Any recommendations?"
1229,i called my mom out and i’m not sure if i did wrong.,"hello all,

i am on a path of healing past trauma and i am in a process of speaking with those that hurt me in the past. i am a 27 year old woman. 

when i was a pre-teen i experienced what i call a minor sexual abuse experience form my step father. a person who i have had a great relationship since forever so this was a confusing experience for me.

i spoke with my mother about this at the time yet my father denied everything. my mom wanted to go to the police and i refused, i didn’t find it necessary, i wanted to resolve this as a family and move on.

my father then stopped speaking to me for months and when he decided to, his first words were “you nearly broke up our marriage”. i was shut down. i didn’t understand the need to say this as i wasn’t at fault.

years passed and we never spoke about it again and i guess i had to make out as if everything were fine.

christmas 2018 i brought it up again, and again i was 
denied everything but was also receiving apologies.

i left my family home to come back to my home, my parents then were not speaking to me for a while, as i ruined christmas. 

i then received an email from a lawyer a few weeks after, saying that i should never speak about the issue  again as it was false information. i couldn’t believe my parent went to a lawyer (by recommendation of a friend of theirs, which is dumb, digging their own grave because what if this person was to speak around town...?).

once again i didn’t understand why they couldn’t resolve this with me. it’s like my mom wanted to take my stepdads side instead of mine, her only child at that matter. someone who i have had a best friend type relationship with, so why did she do that?

a few weeks ago i brought up the issue once again, this time i spoke about why getting a lawyer on their daughter was extremely incorrect and also the way they brought me up, i disagreed with their lack of patience and that i don’t agree with the fact they used to beat me, a lot. i look back and, i behaved pretty much like every child.

i see how many parents act with their kids now, and i see compassion, love, patience and understanding. my parents aren’t bad people but they continued a generational cycle which i intend to stop.

my mom says she doesn’t regret anything and won’t apologise. she is now not speaking to me.

we had a great relationship amidst all this crap, what i don’t understand is when i’ve done wrong i have learned, apologised and grown yet when i have called them out it turns into an argument and lack of accountability.

not sure what to do at this point and if it wrong also."

1232,The urge for hurt/comfort genre in everything,"Hey! So i don't know if this is the right place to discuss this, but i don't really know where to go.

Little about me, i am a 15 year old gay girl and closeted for obvious reasons.

So I keep having this weird urge to see someone's SO get hurt and then saved by her lover, obviously this happens only with wlw couples. For example in Supergirl where Alex was kidnapped and Maggie was trying to save her this whole time. I watched this episode a couple times just because i wanted this hurt/comfort genre and I always seek it when I start some new series with a WLW couple in it. I don't know what it is and apparently it's not normal, since my friends don't seem to have it, (found out about it just a couple of days ago and it's bugging me ever since). I just want something to happen to someone's girlfriend and then be saved or something like that. I have been trying to research this myself, but I can't seem to find anything except that it actually exists as a genre in fanfiction lmao.

 I know it's weird, I just want to understand why do i have this in the first place, thank you for any help you can give me."

I’m having mental breakdowns in pubic places because I’m unable to drive when I start freaking out so I pull over and getting the cops called on me. I can’t focus on anything, I went to make photocopies and driving past homeless people knowing I have selective empathy like everyone else made me hate myself so much I was crying in my car getting as high as possible so I could walk inside and look some random person in the eyes so I can make these stupid fucking photo copies."
1235,Disassociation/Feelings Acknowledgment Advice,"I’ve been disassociating a lot recently (nothing feels real, hours seem like minutes, I feel separate from everything, etc.) likely due to the stress of being alive in 2020 on top of regular life things. Now, with RGB dying and the idea of having to go through yet another brutal senate confirmation (trying not to think about beyond that), stress has pretty much shut me down. I’m having a difficult time feeling anything other than numb even though I’m mentally still just this side of optimistic.

1237,Is a lack of a social life a bad thing I should want to change?,"I’m a 29 year old guy I’ve always been more of an introvert. I work 40 hours a week at work and without revealing to many private details a function of my job is communicating with people over the phone, so when the weekend rolls around to me it’s a chance to mentally recharge, mow my lawn, go grocery shopping or do laundry, clean my house, clean my car every so often. Basically what I’m getting at is a lot of these activities are ones I do solo. I was going to the gym once a week but I kinda stopped back in March due to covid but I might reconsider going back to put myself back in a positive social environment. 

I honest to god don’t have any friends. I communicate with people at work, mostly in regard to work related matters and sometimes I’ll say something funny or vent about something. I kinda realized that when someone asked me what my plans were for the weekend, I said “oh not much” and just kinda fake laughed. I’ve never dated but I’ve been successful in other aspects of my life. I kinda grew up poor and put myself through college, I worked hard saved a lot lived frugal I m a home owner I own my car part of my self pride comes to the tune of my financial success that I started with nothing and I build a strong foundation for myself. I’m financially secure basically which gives me so much pride and peace of mind.

The only thing I just never really mastered in life is the socializing thing. I’ve had friends before obviously just not in a while. In the past I’ve had acquaintances coworkers who i was friendly with and joked around with. The last time I had a friend in the traditional sense I guess was back in high school. But to be fair I didn’t really make an active effort to attach myself to people once I began college I did in high school but I did maybe once or twice or so try to attach to someone but it kinda just became the norm for me to be on my own to do things my way and so on. 

I don’t know if I’m upset or anything I’m just reflecting and kinda asking myself if I should put myself out there and maybe make a connection or 2? I guess I’m just kinda craving some new stimuli in my life like every week feels like a repeat over and over it’s fun to make more money save more get a little richer but I just feel like I’m lacking a certain something ya know

I don’t know maybe friendship companionship I mean I do value my alone time I just wish there could be some more exciting elements in my life I guess. Even as I post this I kinda have an idea about what you’ll reply you’ll say join a club, approach someone at your gym or somewhere else, or something to that effect. I just don’t want to randomly latch onto some random person I could only be attached to a person if there is some motivator. Maybe my thinking is flawed or I’m overthinking I don’t know. Well if you read this far thanks for hearing me out."

1240,I break down crying everytime I'm around other people,"I don't know what's going on with me. I've been suffering from depression my whole life and it's been horrible lately. I've came really close to ending it this month. Usually being around my friends provides some temporary relief from my depression, but lately it seems to make it worse. I'll be hanging out with people, and regardless if I was already feeling down or not, my mood just plummets. I can't connect or relate to the people around me, their laughter makes me tense up like I'm in pain. I'll try to stay in the room and just play on my phone (something that usually helps calm my social anxiety), but it provides no relief, and I just grow more and more restless and frustrated with my negative feelings. I seek escape, to another room, or sometimes I even go out to my car, and usually I break down crying immediately, and start feeling extremely suicidal.

This has been happening almost on a weekly basis. I just want to hang out with my friends but I can't stop being depressed, even for a moment. I spend all my time sleeping and crying."

1242,4 Ways I've Learned To Deal With My Internal Anger,"When I tell people that I consider myself an angry person, they usually don't believe me because I typically don't come across as one. This is because I tend to keep my anger bottled in, suppressing the emotions I feel. The issue with this is that just because you suppress your emotions does not mean that they go away. You still have to deal with them on your own. Because of this I have had to teach myself some ways to deal with my pent up anger, and I would like to share some with you beautiful people.

1. Stop being judgemental/cynical of others and start looking for the good in people.

2. Understand that most of the time, other people aren’t trying to piss you off. They just don’t realize that what they’re doing is pissing you off. 

3. Remind yourself that you won’t solve any problems by getting angry.

4. Remember that you yourself are not perfect. So don’t expect others to be perfect either.

Keeping these four things in mind has been crucial for me in dealing with my anger. I still got a long way to go, but I’m definitely headed in the right direction.

I go more into detail about all of this in my latest youtube video. Check it out here: https://youtu.be/NP90dZyVnKc"
1243,How do I get my parents to take my mental health seriously?,[removed]
1244,"I Have Been Battling Myself For Two Years (I need some advice... a long story, so whoever reads this THANK YOU)","I feel quite alone in how I've been feeling. I have had a rough couple of years now. A couple of years ago, when I turned 20, a lot of things changed. I had my first panic attack and triggered a panic disorder. That made me stay home and become more anti-social. I gained a lot of weight. My skin broke out. And with that- my confidence was gone. I became more bitter. Paranoid. In the beginning, I was so mad that this happened to me, while all my friends were out living their lives and had no way of understanding what I went through. They still looked good. They were able to do whatever they wanted. I was so angry that I was in my 20s and I felt like I was trapped from being able to enjoy my life. Not to be dramatic, but I literally felt like I was in a one-way mirror, and I was screaming to get out but no one could see me. I was so angry that in a matter of seconds my life changed and within months so did myself. 

*I am the worst version of myself and I have been trying to get the old me back ever since.* 

I used to be a girl that was known to be outgoing, optimistic, and I felt pretty good about myself (meaning I didn't *hate* my appearance, I had the confidence because I had clear skin, I was somewhat fit, etc) And now I am unrecognizable in every way. One positive is I did get my panic attacks under control, which wow, I really thought was the end of my life at the time. (I got them under control due to antidepressants, specifically Lexapro, and got off of it after 1 year) I am definitely grateful every single day of my life that, at least right now, it is gone! But- I have been FIGHTING to be happier again. And it took me a while to realize that one of the ways that would help me be happier is to clear my skin, lose weight, and go out more. It is just who I am as a person, I need these things to feel good. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I have tried, nothing has worked. I am still fighting 2 years later to ""look good"" for myself, and I am not one to give up. But strangely, I feel like I have been battling myself. 

Some days, I am really good at letting go and I try to be grateful for what I do have. I try to tell myself if I am consistent, things will turn around. I will feel good about myself again, which will then make me want to go out more, talk to people, find a boyfriend, make a career for myself, etc. My biggest motivator is to do this for my parents... because they've seen me at my worst for too long now. But then the other part of me self destructs (I get in a down mood and tell myself to give up). After a month, I ALWAYS give up. I overeat again, I stop doing my skincare routine, I stop seeing friends, etc. I don't take care of myself and then I go into a dark place and stay in my room and become very depressed. I become very snappy. I get mad at myself very easily. Even writing this, it is so weird to realize who I have become as a person. 

I have been crying every other day randomly. I cry when I listen to a happy song in the car. I cry when I'm about to go out with my friends. I cry sometimes out of nowhere when I am doing absolutely nothing. I feel crazy. I miss the days where I felt SO happy! I feel stuck. I am not sure how to keep going, but I know that if I find a way to past the one month mark, things can only go up. 

I know some people are going to say that the things I want will not make me happier, but I disagree. I think a big part of happiness is being comfortable with yourself and liking yourself. I tried to let go of this desire for my ""old self"" and just accept the way I look now. And that life is different now. But then I am left with... deep sadness. I can't help the way I feel, ya know? 

 **So, what is the point of this post? Well... I was wondering if anyone out there relates to this.** 

**What is your advice?** 

**What are the ways to change my mindset and not ""self destruct"" and ruin my progress?**

**Why am I crying randomly?**

1245,Found out my mum is depressed and that my uncle has cancer in the same day,"Today my mother told me that she's been very unhappy with my father lately. He doesn't ask her simple things like how's your day and how are you feeling and he generally always talks to her when it's related to work or if he needs something. On top of it all, he forgot their anniversary and this really upset her. I can see that she is very hurt and she is the type of person who keeps it all in unless she's pushed over the edge. I told her that it would be best if they said down and talked about it as my father seems to think that everything is fine. All this came as a shock to me because my parents have always seemed perfectly happy. I keep thinking that I might be responsible for this situation even though I'm probably not. I've also been very depressed lately and today it feels like I lost a big part of what I thought was stability. Any advice on how to help them work this out would be appreciated.
Later today I went to visit my uncle and I overheard my aunt taking to my mother about his blood tests. He has lung cancer. He's been a heavy smoker for as long as I can remember and his health has been declining over the last few years. I overheard their conversation because I was in another room playing with my niece and i felt so sad suddenly. I've lost one of aunts to cancer and I don't want to lose anyone else because of it."

1247,"I think I’m bipolar, should I go on anti-depressants?","Some background:
My mom is bipolar 2, diagnosed at age 43.
My dad was diagnosed with depression by his primary care physician, but has a lot of unaddressed issues and is very manipulative.

I started going to therapy through my school (I’m 21) about 3 weeks ago. I went twice with my universities social worker, and about 15 minutes into my second meeting she was asking if I wanted anti-depressants.

I was a little taken back, because I told her my mom was bipolar and told her about the symptoms I have that my mom told me she had when she was younger (mind racing, panic attacks, getting over attached/reliant on friends, eating disorder that comes and goes, being able to stare at the wall for hours in my own head, crying hysterically for hours then being able to pull it together to go out with friends and be genuinely happy while out), and she didn’t ask me any follow up questions about it. 

I know it can be bad to go on depression meds if you have bipolar, so I don’t know if I should go on them, considering I only talked to this woman for 1.5 hours in total."
1248,I think I need to look after my mental health more.,"Fun Fact: I'm romanticly lonely and confused about what to do, and I've been supporting other people with their problems and mental health problems but actually need support myself ( I think ) but I'm bad at expecting it. On the bright side, I'm getting better at helping myself emotionally... but it has ended up with a semi Coca-Cola addiction... so yeah, sorry for the dumb venting"
1249,Antidepressants,"I'm just sad all the time. I want it to stop, but nothing I try works. I tried drinking and smoking weed which (obviously) did more harm than good, so I backed off. I lost weight, but I'm still sad. I even stepped out of my comfort zone and met a girl who I love with all my heart and have been dating for a little over 8 months, but I'm still just so unbelievably sad. Hell, I even moved out of my grandma's house, which I thought was the reason why I was so sad all the time, but I'm still just as sad as I was before. Probably even more sad. I've heard antidepressants work, but I'm already taking medication for epilepsy and am really scared about possible side effects. I've heard they cause anything from weight gain (which would make me more sad obviously) to anxiety (which in my opinion defeats the purpose of even taking an antidepressant to begin with but whatever) to even an early death (?) so I don't take them.

However, being the good people they are they tend to bear with me and let it slide by.Today, i was teaching my brother  a few concepts of physics and i ended up making us solve questions of an old topic, making him shit scared, making him feel that he doesnt know the most basic of the shit. The whole thing ended with my brother getting a panic attack for the first time and i cant stop but think that i have got some serious shit issues with my head.  What should i do?

1255,The cost of being ill.,"I found a love so pure and so perfect but was young, poor, using drugs and had a untreated &amp; undiagnosed mental illness. It all lead to a perfect recipe of ruin and despair that has continued on for over 25 years. After she was moved away by her mother and me managing to make it down to her to stay a few months, then returning home I fell into a deep hole. My illness got worse, drug use got worse, life in general started to fray. I came to the conclusion that she would have a better life without me, a happier life. I told her a slew of lies, all fabricated to break up with her. I heard the love of MY life heart break. Never have I heard such intense pain. 
Years have passed and I have lived a life unforgiven, unbelieved and perpetually filled with heartache... and all by my own hands. Many have said to just “move on” and I have tried but the love we shared isn’t like anything I’ve ever known. There is a hole inside me that will never heal. Hopefully I did give her a happier life without me."
1256,Gender dysphoria and homosexuality as a mental illness.,"Before I begin let me say the title sounds mean, but hear me out.

I try my best to view everything from an evolutionary standpoint, for example a foot fetish, or any other strange fetish, can usually be explained through our primal urges. However, homosexuality and gender dysphoria from an evolutionary view, is a drawback. (Less reproduction stalls a species expansion)

Now this isn’t a bad thing, let me clarify that being gay or transgender is in no way a bad thing, it is who you are and you have every right to pursue happiness. But I’m always trying to find new ways to explain to people (especially the hard right) what exactly homosexuality is. 

The way I explain it is: View homosexuality and gender dysphoria as a mental illness if you’re unable to accept it, but not in a degrading way. Such as an amputee or someone with autism, these are members of our society, and just because they function differently doesn’t mean they are lesser. Many people automatically jump to “how do we cure it then” to which my reply is, there already is a cure. It’s called embracing your sexuality. A man who lives his life in the closet will most definitely have more self destructive tendencies, whether it be drinking or isolating himself. If you live your life putting on an act you will lose touch with yourself, the only way for someone who is gay to be satisfied, is for them to be openly gay. 

To summarize all of this, from an evolutionary standpoint homosexuals and trans people are an evolutionary drawback, however this isn’t a bad thing, and the only way for these people to be happy, is to be supported throughout their struggles. It isn’t easy being gay, personally I’m not, but I couldn’t imagine hiding who I am. It would drive me mad. I’d rather have a society of lgbt members than a society filled with repressed desires. 

Next time you’re in an argument over lgbt rights, just explain that forcing people to suppress themselves can lead to far worse things than being gay."

1258,Other Ways Of Asking “How Are You?”,"Day 19 of **Suicide Prevention Month** and in today’s post, it will be rather simple and straight to the point. Instead of listening you facts, causes or information on how to deal with Mental Health illness, I will ask one question that many of you haven’t heard in a while. 

**How are you today?**

It may be the simplest of question to ask a person, but unfortunately, it’s not asked enough. 

But, saying that, there are also **MANY** other ways to start a conversation with a stranger. By conversing with a stranger, it will make them feel worthwhile, feel important and that they belong here. You may not know, but the conversation you’ll have with that specific person could be the first conversation that person has had in weeks or even months. How do you know a person is going through a lot? Can you tell when a person is upset or on verge of being in tears? No. Be kind to everyone. Smile at people who deserve it. 

Here are some others way you can start a conversation with a stranger:
- What are the top 5 things in your bucket list?
- Who inspires you everyday? 
- What makes you laugh/smile?
- What’s your idea of a perfect day/night?
- What’s your favourite film/book/TV Show?

Starting a conversation can go a long way. For some, it will make their day, for others, they have made a brand new friend for life. 

If you, like myself, hear “how are you?” a hundred times a week and you’re in need of finding a different way of asking it, don’t look any further. Below, I will list MORE ways of asking a person how they truly are without saying those exact words! 

- How long has it been?!
- Anything interesting happening in your life recently?
- What’s new with you?
- Travelled or been anywhere fun lately? 
- How is life sailing?
- How have you been the last time we spoke? 
- What’s been the highlight of your day/year so far?
- What’s the latest buzz in your world?

Thanks a lot guys! :)"

1262,What actions should a patient take when their therapist ghosts them and they’re struggling?,"I’m an established patient (with this therapist), I’ve been seeing him for over a year. From what I could gather from our interactions (as an Autistic adult, so grain of salt there) we had an okay relationship.

A couple of months ago, I phoned him. He did not phone me back. I waited a month—nothing. So I phoned him again. The receptionist said he was busy, said she’d knock on his door. Nothing. I phoned again—he wasn’t in. Phoned when he was back, left a message on his machine—I tried to be calm and work with the system, hoping it’d help. Nothing.

I suspect that I have cPTSD, and I’ve realized on my own that I’ve been spending most of my days dissociated. I’m very isolated, and my support system is not reliable anymore. I’m trying to stay present, to be mindful and deal on my own, but I’m having limited success. Just being awake is a reason to dissociate. I’m struggling to care for myself through body pain and what looks to be a sinus infection (but “passed” the province’s COVID checklist).

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in this situation. I’m a textbook example of learned helplessness, and while I’ve found a hotline in my province (Alberta, Canada) that could potentially help connect me to other services, I don’t know if that’s what I should be doing... and I don’t know where to find out. Google searching did not help, and asking my caregiver will likely end with them lashing out at or dismissing me, which isn’t good for my living situation.

I need to do something. It’s difficult to think through the brain fog, but I can make phone calls. Where do I start?"

It's one of those days when I can't get seem to know how to continue my studies, while I really need to and have very limited time. Even writing this post seems like a task. So many illnesses intermingling and creating a hell for me!! 

Although I'm glad I came across resources which could direct me to ADHD and I could know more about it while my therapist and Psychiatrist couldn't pick up (I really didn't notice too), and things have started to make sense. I know a lot of my misery is because of this illness and not something inherently wrong with me. Helps me deal with the overwhelming guilt a little.

However, dealing with all this makes me feel tired. I wanna concentrate and study, I have really important ex's coming and I have appointment with the Psychiatrist after 2 weeks. I can't hold this long since I now know what is it and I feel it can be managed.

It’s not just when I’m going out though, I remember a few months ago I was convinced there was someone hiding in the closet at about 3am, I’m not sure why but I started to feel dizzy, sick and the feeling of dread was overwhelming. I sleep with a Swiss army knife under my pillow for safety reasons so I was just clutching onto it like my life depended on it. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. It is quite a problem because I’m going to be going to college on my own which ends at 5pm, it’s nearly winter which means it’s going to be getting darker much quicker which makes me even more anxious. I don’t think I’m much of a “target”? But still my mind makes up the worst possible scenario all the time."
1266,Depressing world views I can’t change.,"When it comes down to it, life is a bunch of distractions to a terrible society that we’re trapped in. People are awful to one another. Humans are terribly selfish, as shown through the pandemic. We live in a society with a horrible economy. There’s literally almost nothing good about life. There is no future for people my age until the old get sick and die (M21). We distract ourselves from our terrible situations to find temporary relief. We work 8 hours a day, five days a week, with weekends off.

There is no afterlife to me. This is it. There was nothing before birth, there will be nothing after, and shits going to continue to decline. Why do people keep going, I don’t understand it. I can’t get mental help because my family judges it hard and will just find me lazy and tell me to do more. I hate this life I’ve been given, but I’d never personally take it away from me. I’m just stuck. Everyone’s in the same cycle, I just feel like the only one who can see life for what it is in it’s truest form. 

Temporary distractions from a cruel fucked up tiring restricting world."

Pretty much, I was trying to talk about some issue i had and then i realized that for the past few minutes i hadn't been able think straight, like there was a million thoughts going on in my head all at once and i couldn't process any of them.

I can only seem to feel good emotions for split seconds in rare occasions, most of the time I feel like life is horrible and I'm sad/mad all the time... The wonder, love, and lust I had as a teenager is gone. I can't even have sex because instead of being in the moment I'm constantly thinking about how I'm gonna fuck up.

I don't know what to do; psychiatrist don't help, never have. I'm currently in trades school to become an Electrician and I have a path forward ( not suicidal ) I jist wish I felt young! I'm 24 not 90... 

I also have alot of beliefs around women that lower my self imagine and I'm terrified to talk about my emotions to other people because the reaction is always either to brush me off or the typical ""you're a man; be one"" speech.

Im listening to a podcast- they say words, which I hear perfectly fine, yet my brain goes ""im gonna ignore that"", so I have to fucking go back and replay. 

Because there's no such thing as a replay button in real life conversations, I'm constantly forgetting what the person in front of me has said. Even when they're on the same sentence, Ive already forgotten what they said at the start of the sentence, so as I'm trying to remember, I ignore what they're saying at the present. 

For me, I feel like this only when I'm stressed out. But the scary thing for me is, am I causing permanent damage to my brain from being so stressed out? Is it possible to fix a damaged brain? That genuinely terrifies me - the horror of suffering irreversible damage to the brain.

I was bullied and harassed constantly for years in my early teens. All my confidence drained out of me. I could barely speak in groups. I believe I missed out on years of brain development because I spent most of my lunch breaks at school in the fucking bathroom stalls.

I feel like a zombie. When I speak, I speak slowly because for even the words I say, I'm thinking ""am I saying this right?"" 

Im obsessed with using the right grammar, so I'm always fighting with myself on the correct word usage in spontaneous conversations that I cant concentrate on the essence of the conversation. 

An example for me is 'have not' vs 'did not'. I waste fucking brain energy from debating which one to use. Even though I'm a native speaker of English, I feel like English is foreign to me sometimes. I cant wrap my head around things I hear everyday, and that sucks. Especially when theyre fast at talking."

1272,15 year old girl with sleep deprivation,"I have always struggled with finding a healthy sleeping schedule. Ever since quarantine started, I have found that I have difficulty sleeping due to a heat wave, bad air quality, and now school starting back. My schoolwork isn't tough or anything, but I can't figure out what time to go to bed. I hop in the bed at 11:30 usually and wake up at 8:05, feeling fatigued and like I didn't sleep at all. I also seem to have had a cold for the past 2 weeks? I have huge eye bags and I look like shit. I don't know what to do anymore, I slept less than 8 hours somehow today and I feel awful. I'm also dehydrated how can I prop myself back up"
1273,I feel like I'm going to die,"I'm afraid to sleep because of this feeling. I don't want to die in my sleep. I was trying to distract myself from my thoughts by playing a videogame but I hadn't paid attention to the time until it was late. I'm supposed to sleep earlier. This happens a lot, but I don't know what to do. I can't stop looking at my veins on my wrists because I'm afraid the blood will stop flowing throughout my body? I know these thoughts are very unreasonable but I seriously cannot stop feeling like this. I've only just begun receiving professional help but they're still assessing me, so I still don't know what to do. I'm so sorry if I'm being less than competent, I just seriously, seriously don't know what to do."
1274,excessive guilt for no reason,"i've noticed a pattern in my behavior that i tend to blame myself for things that are not really my fault. For even the smallest things, it's so mentally draining. With uni work going on I can't even rest with all these thoughts racing in my head. Did I do something wrong? Are they mad at me? Do they hate me? 

It's my birthday today, and this is the one thing occupying my mind. How fun is that? 

I wonder if it's anything to do with trauma. I went through a lot recently and, I couldn't stop thinking it was my fault. It's my fault for letting this happened, for allowing them to hurt me and get away with it. 

It feels so heavy, all the time."
1275,Are hysterical crying spells considered panic attacks?,"I had to leave somewhere due to anxiety, feeling nervous and uncomfortable for no real reason, other than I felt threatened in a social situation. I do cry a lot when I'm anxious and stressed, so I escaped the situation and hid in the bathroom then started crying hysterically. When I cry I sometime hyperventilate and shake, I wasn't hyperventilating, but I was shaking and left immediately. Could this be considered a panic attack?"
1276,Not sure how to function without stress,"This year my job has been highly demanding and more stressful than normal due to Covid. It has meant teaching online, and working much longer days just to get through. Some nights, I was so caught up in working that I’d keep working until I realised that it was morning and I was due in class in an hour. It’s been exhausting and meant that I only had energy for work and nothing else. 

Holidays started two days ago. I’ve spent all of the time since in bed, not wanting to move or do anything. I ordered food as delivery because I couldn’t be bothered cooking, yet I feel like I should be working.  I have work to do still and keep checking it and forcing myself to close it instead of doing it immediately. 

The only reason I’ve got out of bed is to feed the cat, get food from the door and go to the bathroom. 

This is a pretty typical behavioural pattern for me and has been for years. I’m stressed with high anxiety levels and go go go, or I can’t do anything and have no energy. Having no energy will last for weeks or months without stress and purpose to get started again. 

Does anyone else get like this? How do you manage it?"
1277,"Start prioritising your mental health - by being more aware of the big and small decisions you make every day and making choices based on your wellbeing, you can make huge improvements to your mental health","Looking after your wellbeing is the most important thing that you can do to make the world a more peaceful place - when you're stressed you have more difficult interactions with others, they impact others and so on. So how do you prioritise your mental health? Through the choices you make in every moment, and these can be big, life-changing decisions and the little decisions we face in every moment. 

For example when considering a new job, we might look at it and say that it’s stressful and long hours, but a good step in our career and will lead to us being happy - at some point. But another option could allow us to enjoy our career and won’t take us away from the things that are good for our mental health like our family, friends and mindful activities. By making our peace the top criterion in our big and little decisions, we can lead more peaceful and happier lives.

1278,"Bye to friends that i care about, but that don't care about me","I recently made a new fb account because the old one was a mess and only invited friends that i care about. They are nice people and i want them in my life but i'm tired of chasing them.

I'm the only one talking to them first, and if i don't, it's like they don't even remember that i exist and it's so sad to be honest.

I don't want to just delete them and that's it, but i'm too old for this sh*t, literally.

I will only be left with like 3 people, but idc

Have you done this? How does it feel to say goodbye to more than one friend at a time?"
1279,I often try to accomplish tasks/goals without realizing or observing the destructive/chaotic trails that my methods leave.,"In other words.

I always prioritize the ends despite how messy or inflicting my means may be.

Whenever people discuss this with me, I'm completely left in confusion, and then I scramble to answer ""Oh, X may have happened because I tried to do Y.""

I feel as though I'm living in a completely different reality from the rest of the world, one where right is wrong and wrong is right.

Can... Can anyone here relate, at all?"
1280,What are your coping mechanisms?,"This year I have struggled with coping with a lot of changes which have happened, moving home, ending and starting of relationships etc. I was wondering, what are your coping mechanisms?"
1281,Smoking and sh were my way of handling anxiety but I want find something more healthy now.,"So Im struggling from depression and anxiety disorder for quite a while now and recently Ive been feeling good. About a year ago I picked up smoking to handle my anxiety and it worked quite well since I hardly selfharmed since then. Now I wanted to stop smoking which is no problem per sé but my neighbours are a couple that separated about 2 months ago but are now together again. They fight a lot which triggered my anxiety since I had a toxic relationship before which sounded pretty much like their fights do. I go out everytime I hear them but I just get so shaken that I need SOMETHING, be it a cig or selfharm. I dont need to smoke any other time of the day, only when I get triggered by them. Has anyone some advice or gone through something similar? Anything would be a huge help."
1282,Struggling terribly with my anxiety.,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend that I was with for almost a year. Won’t get into the whole story because it’s irrelevant, however, we did everything together. Any free time I had I spent with him. Ever since we broke up I’ve been having several anxiety attacks, haven’t been able to eat in two days and I cannot sleep. I’m looking into getting a therapist but until then any advice of how to move on from losing your best friend to how to get anxiety under control so I can attempt to eat or sleep again would be fantastic. I posted under another group but did not get the responses I was seeking :/ Any advice for my anxiety specifically would be great. I have just spent so much time with him that everything I do I have a memory associated with him and I absolutely cannot get him off my mind. Thanks in advance💕"
1283,I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid but I'm almost sure I do something related to other stuff,"Since I was a kid I was so compulsive and I always needed to be doing something or touching something, now that I'm 18 I still start feeling stressed if I'm not doing something, in classes (and right now online classes) if I'm not doing exercises or seeing something that Im interested in, I just start drawing something or visiting websites about something random, sometimes weird words I heard sometime come to my mind and I leave everything I'm doing to search it in Google, and I forget what I was going to do or stuff like that, is that the ADHD?

And the other weird thing is something that I do sometimes involuntary still today, when I'm looking something that makes me feel excited or is something ""satisfying"" (even seeing a bathtub fill with water) I feel the necessity of rub my hands with force and fast, like I need to release that excitement in a physical way, but I only do it when I'm alone, when I'm with people if the sensations is strong, I close my mouth hard trying to release that excitement, when I was 14 or so someone saw me and told me that it was weird, and I got totally ashamed, I didn't want to be watched, so I started doing it discreetly even totally alone, rubbing the hands slower and with more force, making me get some kind of skin damage when I was 15-16, then and now I began to quit doing it but it shows up sometimes.
I remember that I also was obsessed to walking in even steps, for example, if I walked 4 steps with my right foot I had to do 4 exactly with the other one, and when I lost the count, I went kinda worried or stressed.
What could that be?
I thought about some kind of autism but it makes me feel weird

This is the first time I tell this somewhere or to someone, I feel secure about it because Reddit is Reddit lmao"
1284,I’m scared,"I got dumped this morning and I have extreme depression that logically I know I don’t want to “give up” if you catch my drift and I won’t by any means but if anyone else has depression and knows this feeling when it’s so exhausting you just don’t want to anymore cause I will of course wake up everyday and be strong but it’s hard and it’s awful more often than not. But could anyone with similar issues offer me some advice? I’m only 24 and have been threw what I would consider 3 “major traumas” that haven’t been worked out yet I just don’t want to spiral. 
Thank you"
1285,Starting to feel depressed,"Hi everyone! First of all I'd like to recognise that it has been a hard 2020 all round, and I'm sure I'm not the only one struggling at the moment.

Basically I am a 29 yo male, and in January my long term partner who I lived with broke up with me (on my birthday) and asked me to move out immediately (it was her house). I have felt kind of like I've been drifting ever since, both physically and mentally. 

After the breakup I had a very short time to find somewhere to move to and so moved in to on older woman's house as a lodger on a temporary basis. This was okay to begin with, we each had our own routine and didn't see each other all that much and were civil to one another. In February/March I was spending a lot of evenings going to social events, and exercising to keep my mind occupied. I started a business at the end of last year which was going well at this point. I also started going to therapy in these months, and found a therapist who I actually got along with (after trying several in my life time).

When the pandemic came in mid March, I lost my main client for my business, the social groups I had joined were no longer doing events, and my therapist went to work in a COVID hospital and could no longer see me. I ended up being at home in lockdown all the time with my landlady, and I found her difficult to spend time with. I am very introverted and I felt like she would talk to me a lot about all of her worries and just want me to listen, and while I was okay to do this initially I felt like it drained me and I didn't get much out of it - we also had contrasting opinions on most things but I didn't want to offend her as I was her lodger. Because of this and also financial worries, I moved back in with my parents in the countryside in April.

I have been here for 5 months now, and had little social interaction with anyone other than my parents, the occasional phone call with a friend, and online chat with co-workers once a week or so. I am just grateful that although my business had a rough few months and I was not able to get any financial support from the government, I am able to run it remotely from anywhere with an internet connection, and it is now a success once again.

I feel like throughout the 5 months I have felt progressively more distant with more and more negative thoughts. I meditate daily and so tend to notice patterns in my moods and mental health. I the issues I was discussing earlier in the year with my therapist have been going around in my head a lot, and I am gaining a more and more negative perspective on them. There are 2 main issues:

1 - Asperger syndrome

The first issue is around me potentially having Asperger syndrome. One of the reason's my ex-partner broke up with me was because she believe I could not give her adequate emotional support, and she suggested to me (and our relationship therapist) that I may have Asperger syndrome. I am in the process of getting a diagnosis (the waiting list for seeing someone about this on the NHS is around 1 - 1.5 years currently), and have done online tests which suggest that I potentially do have Asperger syndrome.

I really struggle with the idea of this, it basically means that my brain works differently to most people's brain. I'm very good at logic and at solving problems, my brain works primarily via these mechanisms. I can get very attached to my own routines and systems, and need a lot of alone time to process in retrospect each event in my life and emotion that I feel. I get intensely anxious about things that other people don't (being the centre of attention, attending social events, driving, being in even a minor leadership position). I struggle to feel like I am 'on the inside of life' with other people and to empathise with them in 'real time', usually feeling like I am watching life go by as an observer (one of my favourite books is Perks of Being a Wallflower).

However, I do care about the emotions of others, and want to be able to connect with people and give support to those close to me. I feel bad that I have not even had the self awareness to notice my problem until recently, when I have started to look more closely. I'm nearly 30 years old and I have just 1 reasonably close friend (I see him every few months and we talk on the phone every few weeks), my ex girlfriend broke up with me because I was too emotionally distant, I have lost touch with everybody I knew from school and university, and other friends/acquaintances almost never message me casually - usually I have to be the one to instigate online conversations etc... and these often go nowhere. I'm not sure what my ex meant by emotionally distant, but I think it has to do with the fact that I would sit and listen to her issues but would not respond in an animated way, or always understand and process what she was feeling until hours/days later. 

Her expectations of me were that she could share her emotions with me at any time she liked, and she expected me to listen and to process them right away - this made me feel la lot of pressure, and also tired me out emotionally, leaving me with no remaining energy to spend on social/emotional interactions with family/friends. It made me wonder how on earth people who require a partner to give them this kind of daily emotional attention like this even manage when they are single? Anyway, after talking to others it seems her expectations were reasonable and that many/most people will have similar expectations in a relationship - but I just don't ever see myself being able to fulfil them! My own way of dealing with emotions is to process them internally and reflect upon them a lot, and then talk to someone close to me if I discover a tough issue that I can't resolve, but this is more of a 'once every now and again' requirement. Also, I see the need to talk to someone about my emotions as something that I am happy to do whenever the other person is ready, rather than something I must  force on someone whenever I feel the emotions come (which I have also been told is unusual).

2 - sexuality/gender

I have been thinking a lot about my sexuality and gender lately, I don't feel like I fit neatly into a box and this makes me uncomfortable. I never used to feel like I had to, and that everyone had a different  sexuality and that couples just made things work through compromise and exploration. However, lack of sexual compatibility (or of even being vaguely on the same page) in previous relationships has made me feel insecure - as if to get that sexual compatibility I need to fit neatly into a box and then search specifically for someone else who fits neatly into that box. 

Without going into too much detail - I am mostly straight, consider myself to be mainly aroused by BDSM activities, primarily as a masochist. I often fantasise about being dominated by a woman, or occasionally by a man or a couple. I also fantasise a lot about myself (lightly) dominating a woman, and cuckolding scenarios. To be honest I don't enjoy penetrative sex all that much, it certainly isn't the pinnacle of emotional connection for me, which I have been told it is for many. I much prefer touching/oral sex/teasing/imaginative sexual games, and the thing which makes me feel intensely emotional (in fantasy, haven't done it much IRL) is power exchange.

Next, I think I am probably monogamish. I consider 'loyalty' to mean being honest, transparent and emotionally committed to a partner, not necessarily complete monogamy. Until experiencing it first hand, I did not consider that many (most?) people have tight definitions of monogamy which are violated by many things other than just sleeping with someone else, including: me telling them I fantasise about other people, bisexuality (the thought that there is a part of my sexuality that they cannot fulfil and hence I am not enough for them), a threesome, not acting possessive if they show attraction to/fantasise about another.

I don't really relate to my gender, I'm fine with presenting as male to the general public just for simplicity, and I don't have gender dysphoria. I'm fine with having a man's body and sex organs, but would be equally happy with a woman's body (from an identity perspective - I am aware that having a woman's body is more hassle in our society). However, when I get close enough with someone to be sexual with them, I don't really enjoy them always talking to me as if I am some masculine guy, complimenting masculine features of my body etc.. it doesn't feel good. I don't want to feel like someone is turned on by me as a man, but as a person. I want them to know and accept me as a person, and not focus on me being male too often - perhaps sometimes, but to also allow me feel more 'female' sometimes too. 

I have found from multiple past relationships that there is a kind of default (in a straight relationship) that the man and woman both assume each other to be monogamous, straight and relatively vanilla. I have only had 3 serious relationships, so not sure if this is always the case but the conclusion so far is that I am yet again the freak/anomaly.

But anyway, I have been processing these 2 issues for months now, and feeling more and more hopeless about future relationships and friendships. I think writing them out and sharing them on here will help to get things off my chest a bit."
1286,How can I better support my best friend when she has a manic episode and she “shuts down”,My best friend has manic episodes and I love her to death as her best friend. She’s at times cancelled plans with me telling me she doesn’t feel like going to do something and I’ve found out it’s because she’s has a manic episode and was crying and her roommates had to comfort her. How can I better be there for her and help her? Or try to get her to come out and do stuff still because she’s also had an episode when her daughter and myself and her have all been on vacation she went silent for about 10 minutes then took a depression nap for an hour while we were down there. I’m a guy btw if this changes things at all as well
1287,Will it get better?,Everyone always says “it’ll get better” will it? Cuz i dont think it will we are in the middle of pretty much extinction and in america at least it is a living hell wether you accept it or not “just leave” I AM A MINOR AND THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FAMILY THAT HAS A PASSPORT UNLESS YOU WANT TO UPDATE ALL OF OUR SHIT FOR US AND CONVINCE MY MOM SOCIOPATHIC CONTROLLING EX TO LET MY BROTHER HAVE ONE GO AHEAD GO DO IT I HATE MEN I HATE HUMANITY PLEASE LET IT END IM SCARED TO DIE INCASE REANCARNATION IS REAL OR SOME OTHER SHIT PLEASE LET EXISTENCE ALL TOGETHER END WHY DO WE NEED TO EXIST WE ARE ALL WORTHLESS WORTHLESS UNGRATEFUL PIECES OF MEAT THAT JUST HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO THINK AND YET ALL OF US GO IN THE WRONG FUCKING DIRECTION I DONT WANT TO BE HERE BUT I HAVE TO I AM TRAPPED
1288,I cannot sleep,"Hi guys. So I was going through a break up. It started with late sleep, like I am not going to bed until 2 a.m. And then it got worse, I just cannot sleep. My head was perfectly clear as I am lying on the bed, even though I know I am exausted. What is wrong with me?"
1289,Sobriety and life after,"I’ve been sober from alcohol for a year now (and I don’t use any other substances other than caffeine and nicotine) and I just don’t find much interest in just about anything anymore. I’ve always had a small problem with drinking excessively since I was about 18, but I went off the deep end with it when I lost my mother a few years ago. I’m 25 now and I don’t regret sobriety one bit, but everything’s just so mundane these days. When I drank, everything was fun. Now, I’ll get heavily interested in something and subsequently lose interest very quickly. I’m constantly on edge and frequently anxious. I go to the gym 5x a week and I feel amazing after but once the endorphins wear off I’m back to feeling bleak. I think I may just be depressed. Anyone else have a hard time adjusting to sober life? I would’ve thought that a year down the road I’d be in a much better state of mind than I am now. Sorry for the long post"
1290,Compulsions,"How does it take for you to ignore a compulsion or obsessive thought?

1291,How to deal with anxiety during and after quarantine,I left my job last February hoping to find a better chance in another company but then everything closed because of coronavirus and spent months at home jobless living with my mom. Now after reopening since last July and I start looking for job contacted many companies with no reply. My anxiety has increased so much and I begin to feel depressed and my self esteem is very low. My brain is working as a motor because of overthinking about my future and I’m tired of this and I can’t stop thinking. If anyone has experienced this how did you deal with all thus anxiety (sorry for my bad english)
1292,Hi i wanted to die,"I have a lot of shit going on. Like you know a lot of problems and shitty mental health and whatever, but I don’t think I have ever wanted to die... Disappear yes. A little too often, but never die. Not until today. 
I am sick today. Physically just a little ill. Like I feel like absolute crap and I’m sitting in my boarding schools private mini movie theater with my friends and I think to myself that I really need to get some painkillers because my head felt like it was gonna explode. But when I was walking through the hallway I just felt this sudden urge to eat the whole pack. Like all of the pills. I just felt like I wanted to get high and die. It scared me because I’m quite an unpredictable person and I sometimes do things without thinking or even knowing and the fact that I’m so depressed today and feel all alone well knowing that I’m alone on purpose and on the other hand I’m such a spontaneous person who always does exactly what I want when I want... it scared the shit out of me, because I actually think I could have done it. I would maybe have done it without thinking. Of course one of my roomies was in there, but I had completely forgotten that I wanna live. I was so convinced that I wanted to die... I’m scared... I have been laying all alone in the room we have for sick people for like 8 hours now I think except one of my friends who snuck in to take care of me for a while and I’ve just been thinking and listening all this time and I came to the conclusion that even though every part of me wants to die today, then I don’t want to die because I don’t want to stop living. I don’t even know if this post makes any sense at all, but the bottom line is that I feel like I’m going crazy and I just hit a low point today. I didn’t want to die because “oh I’m sad and I don’t wanna live and it would be easier” and all that shit. No. I just wanted to die because I fucking wanted to die. Not because of all of the shit in my head because for once I wasn’t thinking of all the things that makes me feel depressed and shit. No. I just wanted to die. And THAT scares me..."
1293,I need help to feel motivated,"My grandma recently died, and I think I'm depressed. Because of the whole pandemic, I've had to do school work at home. It was a little hard, but I was able to manage it before. 
But now I can't focus, or sometimes even start my work. I stare at the doc or whatever I'm doing, but I can't really take in information, or do the work I need to do. 
I've tried scheduling, taking breaks, listening to music, but none of it is helping me. I'm a few weeks behind in work, and I feel worse everyday that I can't do anything.
Do you have any motivation tips? What should I do? I want to get stuff done, but I'm feeling completely useless right now. I think I should be saying something to my teachers, but I don't know how to do it. don't know what to say."
1294,Are pricier (~100$ range) lights for Seasonal Affective Disorder more effective?,"I have looked at some research on some SAD lamps, and many claim that SAD lights in 30-50 (Canadian) dollar price range are barely effective and marketed with false advertisement, while reviews on Amazon for these products are generally positive (i.e. Verilux tablet-like light). Some recommend to buy Northern Lights, Carex and other products in the 100+ dollars range saying that they are actually effective. Anything in 100$\~ range is an investment for me, so please help! I just want to be a little happier this winter :'). Any thoughts or recommendations if you have any experience with any of them?"
1295,Adoption and history of mental illness,"This is random, but I want to adopt sometime in the future( I'm 18 rn). I've never seen a therapist, but I suffer with suicidal thoughts, low self esteem etc. If I were to see one, would this come up in the checks they carry out? Would they know I am/was suicidal, among other things? I'd beat myself up if I couldn't adopt because my dumb ass couldn't keep my mouth shut. I love kids, but I don't want to bring more children into our stinking world. I'm from the UK if that helps. And no, I don't plan on committing suicide or anything, I just *really* hate myself."
1296,I feel so shitty about myself I want to die,I don’t know if I’m ever gonna get better. I’ll have short periods where I do but I always get worse again. I’ve hurt so many people and messed up so much. I just feel like really giving up at this point. I don’t feel like my life is worth anything. I have no friends and my boyfriend is on the verge of leaving me. I’m miserable and I have no hope anymore. I’ve tried for years to fight these feelings and they won’t go away. I think it’s time to quit trying. I’m a terrible awful human being I think I just deserve this
1297,"17m, scared of life.","I just turned 17 7 days ago, and i began to realise how much i grew up and how adulthood is just around the corner and its making me shit bricks. I am not scared as much of ""living"" as much as i am of losing the people i care about, specifically my dad. I lost my mom 4 years ago to cancer and i cant fathom that one day my dad will be gone as well. 

Also, i think i would find it weird and uncomfortable not living with him when i move out. I have a gf and we will probably move out to live together as soon as we can, but the fact that my dad wont be around the corner in another room a few years down the line is making me bawl my eyes out. 

My gf is very supportive and i love her, but my dad is just in another league."
1298,Can anxiety lead to anger?,"I have been very anxious recently but I have seen myself get more and more irrationaly angry at the things that used to give me anxiety as the anxiety increased to the point where when I had anxiety attacks, they felt like anger attacks."
1299,My mental health is.....😅,"my mind is literally in so many different places so i'm just gonna list them

mental illnesses: so things like anxiety, depression, and bulimia and thinks i know i have but can't get diagnosed until i'm 16 because i don't want my parents knowing 

parents: so my friend never really believes me when i talk about my parents but they always just act like good parents when other people are around but without company they turn into complete hell hole to hate me because i'm a girl and they wanted a boy like my brother 

TW⚠️other things: my mind constantly things about self-harm and suicide and then i've already planned that i'm going to die before 60 

school: literally gives me a panic attack every day

weight: basically my mind is telling me to get thinner

bestie: Still not completely sure how much i know about her,  i realised i might have asthma because i've got the symptoms and my mum and brother have it and that annoys me, yeah the asthma thing was important because i have panic attacks about how she might think i'm trying to copy her but i'm not

life: i've had a total of about 7 panic attacks just about the thought that my bestie might move further away if her mum gets a job somewhere that's....idk....not here?

so there's a tour of my brain
sorry

1300,A little help needed here 👇🏽,"I haven't been able to watch movies/series for about 5 months now after a mental breakdown. Before, I was a hardcore cinephile. 
Whenever I try, I get bored out of everything. I couldn't listen to music as well for the same reason for a really long period but have somehow found my lost interest again.
Just wanted to know if  I'll ever be able to start watching them again."
1301,"Healthcare may be defined by the guidelines, but the perception of those guidelines dictate individual care","r/mentalhealth has posted some amazing content on mental health and opened my eyes to many issues I did not previously know.

But one thing that stands out more than any data point, any guideline, is perception, which may be the most important thing in healthcare: [https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/2019/04/16/perception-equals-reality/](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/2019/04/16/perception-equals-reality/)

While we know COVID-19 has led to an increase in mental health and more overdoses, we still continue to face the same biases at an individual level. We as patients are not treated individually based on the clinical studies that discuss healthcare inequities broadly.

The reason for this discrepancy is the perception difference between individual patient care and broad healthcare policy.

I am working on a fundraiser that will sell hoodies and use the proceeds to educate hospitals on clinical best practices for patients with mental health conditions and substance dependencies, and we will supply critical medications like Naloxone that are often in short supply.

The most important thing to remember is that healthcare is not statistics, broad generalizations, or large scale studies. It is individual conversations, narratives, patient journeys.

Why do you think healthcare has such difficulty applying broad principles and policies to individual patients? 

And why do you think patients will mental health are disproportionately affected more than any other population?"

1303,I Want to See a Psychiatrist,"Ever since I was 7 I've felt like something was off about me. If plans don't go my way I fall into a panic. I'm tapping my fingers and feet and moving restless. Pacing around a room and don't know what to do with myself. And then after a while i feel numb and like something is missing. I go into a trance-like state and just...exist for a while. And then I know I've also had bad depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life. Though things have gotten better and I can cope better, I just want to know what a professional thinks is going on with me. My parents have made me feel ashamed of who I am so in the past I just ran from it but I want to learn more about myself and who to live with who I am. Even if that me isn't amazing, I just want to know."
1304,How do I stop feeling lonely,"I 18F have recently been feeling very lonely, and it’s turning into my complete downfall. 
Ive always been pretty lonely &amp; have had pretty bad abandonment issues, which is the root cause of my depression. However, recently it’s gotten pretty bad and it has gotten rid of any mental health whatsoever. I also can’t really talk about my feelings to anyone ik since I’m pretty bad at expressing my feelings and my acquaintances won’t understand/see it as smth small or even stupid (has happened already).
I’ve been trying to find people online to be friends with, but it hasn’t worked since the conversations last one day, and I have no social skills in real life and am very shy. 
I don’t think I need therapy/that it’ll help me much. I just need to stop feeling lonely and worthless, any tips on how to get out of here would help."
1305,hypothetical question regarding psych ward visits,"i’ve been in a very bad place for a while now. today happens to be a really bad day and although i think i can get through it, idk if i can the next time i have an episode like this. i’m thinking of voluntarily admitting myself to a a psych hospital if it gets really bad again, but i have some questions for anyone who has had experience:

-would i be able to groom myself? as a girl this is really important to me and if i’m not able to it usually drives my anxiety through the roof. i get that i most likely won’t be able to bring razors with me, but what about waxing strips?

-would i have access to electronics? i’m a college student and all my classes are online; obviously i wouldn’t be able to attend zoom sessions from a psych ward (lmao) but i’d like to be able to do my homework/study so i don’t fall behind"

1307,a year ago today i selfharmed for the first time,"things have gotten a lot better and a lot worse. many things are going well and im very grateful for them, but others are not going so well. i still dont speak up about my problems. i still havent found a reason not to selfharm. i still have no motivation. i like selfharming, i really do, and i have since the first time i did it. ill never stop. im stuck in a cycle. oh well."
1308,I spend so much time worrying about the future that I don't even feel like I live in the present anymore,"I don't know if this is because of the pandemic or not but over the past few months it feels that I've been thinking more pessimistically. I have always had anxiety. I worry a lot about upcoming events and I often dread social outings even if it's with my friends. I worry even about things that are so minor that I wouldn't even want to mention them to other people because it would sound silly. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently my mother has been talking to me about  my college apps as I am a senior in high school. I dread college from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't conceptualize a single future where I would enjoy myself there. I don't necessarily struggle academically but I guess you could say I really don't like change. I am not social either so if I lose touch with my few friends then I see myself becoming incredibly lonely. My two older siblings are in college and both of them have often expressed how I should cherish my time in high school because college isn't enjoyable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I've been feeling really down. I feel weak and have low self esteem. I am afraid that I may have to give up the things I love to do because college will take over my life. Thank you for reading."
1309,"Car almost hit me, I jumped out of the way...regretting that I jumped the whole day","I have a really bad habit at my school of not looking when crossing the streets because obviously pedestrians have the right away and people have to stop cuz yaknow it's a school campus.

But obviously some people speed, don't care, aren't looking etc etc

Again, bad habit of me testing people, being an asshole, and just a suicidal person...I don't really look all that often when crossing. I do when I'm not doing it on a crosswalk, and I'll do a quick left right glance like if I see a car speeding I'm not going to walk out, but if I see a car that I know has enough room to slow down, I'm going, lol.

ANYWAY, today there was a car that was way far back, and I wasn't at the crosswalk yet but I  was getting there and very obviously walking towards it to cross, I knew they had enough time to stop so I just kept walking but they weren't and I had to stop and they drove right in front of me. 

dead or badly injured idk which one I'd be, but I stopped before I got hit.

The whole rest of the day I've been thinking of that moment and wishing that I just kept going and got hit"

1313,I have no one,"Im married with kids but I have no one. I have a sister and mom but at the end of the day when I NEED someone I have no one. It is lonely and hurts. I go on long drives to help with the pain and to focus on not being in the house but it still hurts. I reach out to family or my spouse when I need help but they don't get it. I end up being rude or irritated towards my kids because of my depression, anxiety, and frustrations. All I want to do is sleep. Its nice and peaceful. All I want is someone who actually cares. I go to therapy but it doesn't help. She doesn't tell me anything that solves much. I just want a break I want someone to listen and be there for me."
1314,This is beyond depression and anxiety... I crave pity,"I have been diagnosed as depressed, anxious, socially anxious and a bunch of other stuff too over the years but I really think I have some kind of personality disorder. Probably covert/vulnerable narcissism or borderline or dependent, or at least strong traits of those, either in addition to or instead of my other doagnoses. I have other symptoms but the one that is most telling to me and that I will focus on here is my obsession with being a victim. It's sick and I hate it but it's so true. I can't seem to shake it. I crave sympathy so much. It's all about how others see me. I can't stand to be seen as selfish or bad but it's all about my ego not about being a good person and ironically I am more selfish because of my desire to avoid being seen as selfish. I use my mental instability and depression as a tool to protect my ego. It's part of the story I tell myself, even if I really am depressed, the reason I can't get better is that if I get better I have to acknowledge and take responsibility for myself. Well I have to do that anyway but... I thought I would grow out of this shit but I haven’t. I feel developmentally arrested and absolutely pathetic to be honest. At least in this respect. I mean, imagine it, I'm that person that WANTS to be pitied. How sick and disgusting is that? How offensive to those that are actually suffering and hiding it?

Most people I talk to who have serious struggles with mental health, abuse, trauma etc. say they try hard to hide their problems and appear to have the perfect life, that they actively dislike sympathy, pity, attention etc. Some people have even gone so far as to suggest that people with real issues typically don’t want sympathy while people who are “faking” or have less serious issues are the ones that talk about them the most.

While I am also very aware of how I come across to others, and try very hard to avoid falling into self-pity, oversharing etc. I very much crave to be “seen” and to share my pain and receive sympathy and even pity. It disgusts that I am like this. It seems very adolescent. Some people, particularly authority figures and bosses, trigger some deep desire in me to be seen and validated and even for them to feel sorry for me.

Here is another related thing: it is painful for me to be reminded that “everyone has their own struggles.” I know that is true, I really know it, and I remind myself of it all the time. But instead of feeling compassion and connection I just feel intense embarrassment and shame and anger, and a strong resistance to that idea, because I don’t want to believe it. It reminds me of all of the people out there who are doing the right thing day in and day out, who are not complaining, who can’t afford to have a mental breakdown, who are making better choices and are at least somewhat thriving (at least outwardly) and trying to be happy. It reminds me that they have issues too they are just dealing with the pain inwardly while I am here feeing sorry for myself and imagining that I am especially troubled and have it especially hard. Even now I still sort of believe that even though statistically speaking it’s unlikely.

It’s weird because I feel like when people say this to me, or on the Internet, they are not trying to be dismissive. I think I’m supposed to be comforted by the fact that my struggles are not unique. But instead I find it intensely painful because it implies that I’m overly sensitive, entitled, and lacking in character and maturity. It takes away all possible excuses for any of my behavior or the fact that I’m not where I wanted to be in life. It forces me to face the reality that I’m not special and that even though I’m in so much psychic pain so is everyone else (why is that so hard to accept?)

If I acknowledge reality I also have to a knowledge some extremely unsettling things about myself and my entitlement. I guess it also forces me to accept that having intense feelings is just a part of life, and because you don’t have it worse than other people, that means it’s probably not going to get that much better. So part of it is just going to be accepting that I’m always going to feel things and that there is a lot of pain in life and that’s normal. And that I can’t really complain about it.

I don’t know if any of this is making sense. I’m crying a lot as I write this. It really bothers me and I feel so ashamed and kind of disgusted with myself. It makes it hard to change because my defenses that hurt me are also what are keeping me from seeing the truth about myself, and so protecting my ego."
1315,My mental health is ruining my marriage,"My wife and I had a son 3 years ago, in that time I’ve felt myself become more and more disconnected. I’m losing motivation, feeling hopeless, and often find myself wishing I hadn’t started a family to begin with. My wife and I are in constant battles because she feels I’ve become a mean person who’s shut down(I have) and that I’ve just removed myself. I want to make my marriage work and take care of my family, but some days I just feel so lost and wonder if there’s even a reason I should try. I used to be super caring, loving, and we never really fought. These past 3 years have been miserable for everyone. My wife often wonders if I’m bipolar, as I have a week or two where things are fine. But when things get bad, they’re extremely bad.

1317,Sometimes things are so beautiful that i can't take it anymore,"This feeling is hard to explain but i will give it a try.
All my life i have loved. I automatically like people, and back in my teenage years i used to have a friend that i had a very deep connection with. This ""us against the world""-feeling. I didn't need anyone else and i finally found someone who i could give all my (platonic) love to. It has been ten years now and i haven't had any friendships/relationships on that level. It's like all this love is build up inside me and it's awful not being able to share it. I have friends and i have had lovers but...i don't want to sound ignorant but i feel like nobody ever understood the depths that my love goes too and nobody was ever able to love me on the same level. And this doesn't only apply to people. It's anything. Sometimes i see something beautiful, it can be just a scenery, the sky,..and i will find it so beautiful that it is unbearable. I once heard this quote from a movie ""sometimes things are so beautiful that i can't take it anymore"" and that's exactly how i feel every day. It's very contradictive but all this beauty i see and all the love i have, not being able to share it on a deeper level, makes me feel empty and sad inside. I don't know how much longer i can go on feeling like this."

1319,I need help desperately,"About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I shrugged it off because I didn't understand the disorder and thought ""surely that's not me"". On top of that, I started feeling better and falsely believed I was fine.

 Last week I fell into a major depressive/anxious state. I'm having panicked thinking basically from the time I wake up to when I am able to sleep. Sometimes I wake up and immediately start crying, or feel numb. I'm having consistent intrusive thoughts of sexual assault that causes physical symptoms like fast heart rate, sweating, anger, and chest pain. 

It's not even my own sexual assault that makes me feel these things, it's any triggers on tv, in conversation, and even scenarios I make in my head. I'm finding anything related to sex as non consensual even when it is. My boyfriend is trying to be there for me but I can't/don't want to tell him about all my trauma. I'm taking things out on him and he doesn't deserve it. 

I finally got on mood stabilizers and a prn that's supposed to help with anxiety. Nothing is helping. I have no will to get out of bed or do anything. I feel like this will go on forever and that's hard to reconcile. 

I can't keep a job longer than 6 months. I have an episode about every 6 months and quit my job. I can't go on like this forever.

I can't afford therapy but I desperately need consistent help. I need to feel like I'm not alone and that I'm not crazy. I guess I don't know what I hope to get from posting this... I guess just knowing that other people are there and might understand what I'm going through could help. 

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions about ways to cope or any free therapy avenues please let me know."
1320,I can't convince myself that people actually enjoy being around me,"TLDR: I've been struggling with self-esteem issues for a long time and it prevents me from having meaningful romantic relationships with people. I want to know how to fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

I (21M) have discovered that no matter how close I am with someone, it's impossible for me to truly convince myself, in my heart, that they like me and that I am a positive presence in their life. I've been thinking about this a lot over the last year or so, and I think I've figured out where it comes from, but I don't know how to fix it. Hoping that someone here can relate to this and point me towards the way to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder at 4 years old. In the beginning I showed all the classic signs - extreme shyness, lack of social skills, sensitivity to loud noises, etc. Over the years, these symptoms became milder and milder as I learned how to properly integrate into society. I can't thank my amazing parents enough for sending me through several after-school programs designed to help ASD people develop social skills. Because of those programs, I have now completely adapted, have a full and happy social life, and am even described by my friends as the social butterfly of the group.

&amp;nbsp;

But in elementary school, middle school, and even early high school, I was not yet so well-adapted. I was by all accounts the ""weird kid"" of my class because I wasn't able to socially integrate as well as the rest of my peers. I was near the bottom of the toxic social ""food chain"", and I was perfectly fine with this, because I was more introverted at that point in my life anyway, so I could care less if people thought I was the ""weird kid"". I happily learned my place at the bottom of the social hierarchy, and accepted as fact that that must be who I am.

&amp;nbsp;

However, even though it's been many years since I was in elementary/middle school, I still haven't been able to shake that mindset. I know in my head that I have lots of friends who love me and that people enjoy being around me, but in my heart I'm still the ""weird kid"" who isn't supposed to have friends, and I can't make that feeling go away. This has caused me all sorts of self-esteem issues, e.g. any time I make any kind of mistake, I end up in a rut of guilt underscored with the idea of ""of course you messed up, that's what you're 'supposed' to do."" according to my inferiority complex (not sure if I'm using that term correctly but you get the idea.)

&amp;nbsp;

The area where this really presents itself, and where I am looking for the most guidance, is in my romantic relationships. Anytime someone flirts with me, or we go on a date, there's a lingering thought underpinning the entire experience that says ""they're only going on dates with you because they have an ulterior motive, or out of pity. There's no way they could genuinely like you because you're not 'supposed' to be likeable. You're supposed to be the weird kid."" So I end up ghosting them after one or two dates because how could I possibly be romantically involved with someone if I am constantly doubting their motives for showing interest in me? That's not a healthy relationship, and certainly not something I am going to drag someone else into, because that's not fair to them.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I am trying to figure out how to make my heart believe that other people really do actually care about me and appreciate my presence. As I said in the beginning, I know in my head that that's true, but I can't make myself really, truly, feel it to be true. And this isn't something that can be tackled with rational ideas because this isn't a rational issue. It's totally irrational and I recognize that. And I think it's the irrationality of this issue that leaves me stumped as to how to start working to correct it.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to offer. I am considering starting regular therapy sessions through Kaiser (my PCP and insurer), but that's just me spitballing. If you have better ideas, I would love to hear them."
1321,How should I know I have bipolar disorder?,"Ten years ago I was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was prescribed lithium and abilify. Originally they though I had major depressive disorder. After taking an SSRI I got worse and worse and tried to kill myself. After getting out of the hospital I refused to take my medication. Tried to kill myself again and came close many other times. 

Next week I am seeing my doctor for “anxiety”—which I have. He does not know my previous diagnosis and mental history and medication. I will bring it up when I see him next week.  

It has been so long since I got that diagnosis. Would a doctor what to get me re-evaluated to make sure I am bipolar or something else?  

I always have doubts I am bipolar. The diagnosis was so long ago."
1322,I need your thoughts on this,What if we all live the same life over and over again with no change with all the same thoughts? With no chance of change has anyone else thought of this and had the same anxiety like me?
1323,Unexplained increase in violent sexual thoughts/urges (long post),"As stated, I have been very preoccupied with violent sexual thoughts, but by now I guess I would say they are urges. I have experienced violent fantasies for a long time, on and off for the past 5 years or so (I am 19). I have a therapist but I haven’t seen her since before covid. I just haven’t felt like calling I guess, I don’t really have a good reason why I haven’t been going.

Perhaps I should start out by saying that I have been feeling... more sexual (?) in general, if that makes sense. Lately I’ve been extra horny and I have been more vocal about sex and my sexuality (I am bisexual). I don’t have a partner so I just mean I’ve been making more sex jokes/ references with my friends, talking about people or things I find attractive way more openly for some reason. This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing, but my friends seem uncomfortable about it sometimes. Plus sometimes I feel bad/ embarrassed later for joking or talking about it. I don’t know why this change has occurred in me.

Now for violent urges, as I said I’ve had violent/sadistic thoughts for a long time, but it didn’t used to typically be sexual. Now those same thoughts that were just regular exciting before are usually sexually exciting to me. These sadistic fantasies include things like kidnapping, torture, drugging and raping people, and using weapons to threaten or even kill people. The strangest things are sexualized in my mind, even things that aren’t at all intimate or sexual like robbing someone.

I have been trying to find porn of stuff like this (not looking for anything illegal like actual rape, just fantasy) but there really isn’t a lot that does it for me anymore. There isn’t much anyway, but it either looks unrealistic/ not violent enough or I’ve seen it already and it doesn’t appeal to me anymore. I am feeling like if I don’t do it myself I won’t be satisfied. BUT I don’t want to hurt anyone. I wouldn’t want to put someone or their family through real suffering, so I am not going to do anything. These urges are just becoming unbearable and I feel like I have no way to deal with them. Nothing is enough anymore. I need help and I do not know what to do. Thanks guys."
1324,"I should be happy, but I’m struggling.","I have a good job, I just bought a house, I’m dating a great guy... and I’m miserable. 🤷🏻‍♀️

All these things sound great on the surface, but each of these things are bringing me stress and anxiety. I struggled with depression many years ago, and I thought I was out of the woods, but they’re looking more gloomy than ever. 

I’m a nurse during a pandemic and all of our experienced nurses are leaving. I’m working a ton of over time and I’m constantly training new people. I feel like my hospital is hiring any able body and the quality of nurses coming in just aren’t up to par. I feel like I have to be on my toes non-stop and everyone’s constantly looking to point fingers. We are suppose to work together, not pull each other apart. I’m so exhausted, I never used to dread going to work. 

I just bought a house 2 days ago and I move in this weekend. However the current home owners didn’t hire decent people to do the agreed upon repair work and now I have a home that needs more work than expected just walking in the door. I was able to get the previous owners to cough up some money for the repairs, but I have to take the time to find good contractors and get everything done properly. I know home ownership isn’t easy, but I was hoping to at least move in on a clean slate. 

I’m notoriously bad at relationships. I’m that flight risk who looks for any reason at all to leave. I finally found someone who makes me happy, but he has A LOT of baggage. He’s not divorced yet and he had 2 young children. When we started talking he told me the divorce wasn’t finalized because covid delayed the courts. Turns out his cheating ex is starting to miss him and wants him back. As much as he’s reassured me that he’s done with the marriage and ready to move on, I’m really uncomfortable with the situation. 
In addition to this, he has his children 90% of the time and it’s too soon for me to meet them with everything going on with his ex. I hardly get to see him and we’ve had to cancel plans a few times because his ex won’t be upfront about her availability and never takes the kids. 
I don’t want to walk away from him because he’s an wonderful person and amazing father, but it’s hard trying to start a relationship with someone you never get to see. 
I want to get married and have children one day and I’m already in my 30s. I’m afraid I don’t have time for this. Also I really want to meet his children. They’re such a big part of his life and I want to get to know them and have a good relationship with them. I’m afraid their mom isn’t going to let that happen. 
Last but not least, I’m feeling like a terrible person. I know I’m not getting to see him because he has the girls all the time. And I’m starting to feel jealousy. How disgusting is that?! I’m a grown woman who knows these girls need their father in their life more now than ever. And I would never ever want to come between them or compromise the relationship they have. But there are so many things he talks about wanting to do with me that I feel will never happened because he always has his children and his ex never takes them. 
I want to include these kids in everything we do, but it’s hard to feel that way when I can’t be around them. 

Everything in my life is complicated, and I’m just exhausted. I thought about getting back into therapy, but it’s so expensive and I have the new costs of owning a home that I need to figure out first. So here I am reaching out to reddit for some advice and maybe to be consoled a little.

1328,"In college, can't focus and hardly leave my dorm",I've moved to my college campus about a week ago and I've been isolating myself so much. I probably go out once a day to get food and then otherwise I'm in my dorm trying to study while I'm extremely distracted. I zone out every 2 seconds or check my phone all the time and its so. hard. to focus. I can't do work for more than 10 minutes at a time and I find myself staying up until 3 am to do it. My questions are: 1. what's wrong with me and 2. what do I do?
1329,Adderall is my miracle.,"there is a bit of a trigger warning/disclaimer here, this is a prescription drug but it is not prescribed to me. It's not abuse but more will be detailed in the post. 

Since middle school I've had so much trouble in school, between various mental illnesses and stressful home life, I became the very definition of an elementary school burnout. I peaked in 4th grade probably. I developed early in pretty much every way, I was advanced in reading, writing, history, math, everything. Until sixth grade. Everything went downhill. As my mental health improved, so did my grades a bit. But I was still pulling a C average at best. 

When I got to high school, freshman year was easy. Sophomore year was harder. Junior year was a disaster. Senior year, I just felt hopeless. Im doing a different method this year because of corona and I haven't been able to focus whatsoever. 

TW// PEER PRESSURE/DRUG DISTRIBUTION

so this part is how I got the adderall. 
a friend, I use that term very loosely, we had like, one class together my junior year and didn't talk much outside of it, offered me one of her adderall. I said fuck it why not and accepted. when I got home, I put it in a safe place and honestly kinda forgot about it. Until today. 

TW OVER!!!! 

today I was stressing over how I needed to focus and get on track with my school work. Ive gotten so extremely behind on everything and it's been such a struggle. But today I was thinking, what if I took that adderall? I've been a bit scared to before. but I really, REALLY needed to get caught up and focusing on things is my main problem. 

After it kicked it, it was CRAZY in the best way. I got about five hours of straight focus, I got a bunch of my school work done and it was right. like I know I know this shit, but it was just, I don't know how to focus n stuff yknow? I've tried fidget toys and such, but nothing worked. 
Until this. 

Of course I told my mom I took it afterwards, and I'm gonna bring it up to my psychiatrist next appointment to see if I get on these either PRN or something similar.

I also have a broken left femur and in a cast, the driver side door that I'm sitting in stopped opening today. I am lucky to eat a McChicken once every other day, my cat is also living with me in the car, I do make sure that she has food and water with access to litter box at all times everyday. I just can't keep this up, I have tried every church and outreach group I could find, literally no help because of current world events. I will probably take my cat to the animal shelter and call them to come out side and get her out of the car, then find a way to end this sad excuse for an existence. No one should have to live like this, I was staying in a hotel for the past 8 months but I can't work with a broken leg, so they kicked me out because I was unable to pay them. Sorry for the novel, just thought I'd post this so if someone goes through my phone after I'm gone, they will see why I had to do what I'm going to do. Thanks for listening. Peace out. (:"
1331,Does that voice in the back of your head ever go away?,"“Just kill yourself” “don’t worry about it you can end your life”. I’m not actively depressed or suicidal, but those thoughts always seem to linger whenever I’m going through a rough time. Does this kinda  “background depression” go away with age? I don’t really know what to call it, but it’s like the depressed shitty version of my brain is always there trying to convince me to go down. Any advice?"

1333,Waking up every day,"I am waking up every day again, again and again.Without knowing for who or why,nothing is really enjoyable. Its like an endless road without checkpoints. It's a torture, its going on my mind and I don't know how to fix it."
1334,Could This Cause PTSD,"I was recently in the hospital for a suicide attempt and while I was at the hospital a psychiatrist mentioned PTSD I never thought about it until now but I don’t think what I have been through would cause PTSD. 

I’ll try to keep this shorts I’ll only talk about sexual abuse I don’t really want to get into mental or physical abuse that’s a road I don’t want to walk down again. My first encounter was when I was in Kindergarten this kid in my class stuck his hand through my pants past my underwear at and grabbed my ass and vagina. I was stunned when that happened I didn’t know what to do I didn’t want to tell anyone because I didn’t want anyone to know. 

The second incident was the rape game that kids in my school played when I was in 6th grade. A group of boys would take turns holding down a girl and dry jumping and touching her until they got off. As far as I can remember penetration never happened. I told my mom she was furious and threatened to kill the lead boy, I told the assistant principal who didn’t listen to me so I never reported it to anyone else and I don’t think any other girl ever did. 

Maybe I’m making a mtn out of a mole hill is this really that big of a deal or was it rough play? A little more about myself I’m now 18 almost 19 and hate everything about myself, my skin color, my weight (not extremely obese but can lose 30 pounds), and my face. I have never been in a relationship with anyone and I hate people touching me I don’t get mad I just tense up and freeze. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety, and BPD. I self harm and crave words into my skin I make sure people see them, it makes them stay away from me. 

As for school I had no friends and 90% of the students hated me I was the ugly girl that everyone laughed at. Anyone who was nice to me either did it as a joke or needed someone thing from me like homework or test answers. I don’t think I was bullied though, I feel like everyone went through this. Could any of these things be why I trust no one and hate myself or is that just because I’m a messed up person in general?"
1335,Fear of going crazy,"So I recently experienced a traumatic event... something happened between my dad and sister a long time ago and it resurfaced and so we distanced ourselves from him for awhile... there’s a LOT more to that story but...

I’ve recently had more anxiety or panic attacks recently but I don’t really show it other than by shaking my leg... most people say I’m a peaceful and quiet person but they I oftentimes experience racing thoughts and intrusive thoughts that make me feel or think I’m going crazy, which then leads me to having anxiety and panic. The thoughts can be loud which makes me think, am I going insane? I took the tests online (yes, I’m THAT guy) but those tests give me more anxiety because I fear I’m going crazy... I never got any high results on schizophrenia but one website gave me a moderately high bipolar result... bone of the others did, all moderate-mild. The anxiety was high though.

So what do I do?"
1336,I think my mental health just ruined my relationship.,"I (21F) am severely depressed and my anxiety has been through the roof the past 2 weeks. Recently it’s gotten so bad I can’t breath. Like literally can’t breath with a mask on or in a room. Like I have to go outside or stand up and walk around. I shake my hands like I’m special needs. (I’m not) it’s bad. It’s so bad I started self harming after 4 years of not doing it. I hate it. 

Well my boyfriend (29) I can tell does not fuck with it. I know it bothers him which makes me even more nervous and now embarrassed. He thinks I’m on drugs because of how bad it has gotten. I promise I’m not. I haven’t smoked weed in almost a week now cause I thought I had to take a drug test for a new job.(I didn’t) also just wanna take a tolerance break. 

Weed has helped a lot with my mental health. I have other issues. I’m bipolar and have been told by a few therapists I’m a sociopath. Weed has helped with all of this. Recently, my tolerance has been so high I haven’t been benefiting from smoking at all. I’m not chasing the high just need something to balance me out cause medication makes shit worse I’ve learned. So I stopped smoking for a week and that has made my anxiety soooo much worse. Makes me feel like such a loser tbh. 

Sooooo today was my first day at my new job and I had anxiety all day. Like my heart was racing and I was sweating and got my hands all clammy. All around a bad time. Breathing was extremely hard. Like I had to excuse myself from training multiple times to go to the bathroom and do breathing ex we used so I didn’t pass out. That is how bad it has been. 

This has obviously been very stressful for my boyfriend. Or so I feel it has. And I totally understand it. I do. I don’t blame him for getting annoyed with it cause who isn’t gonna get annoyed with it after almost a month of absolutely shitty mental health issues. I try my best to not let them rub off on him but I fail all the time. We practically live together so it’s really hard to hide it sometimes. 

My place doesn’t have clean plumbing. Meaning there’s mold coming out of my tub faucet and shower head. So I went to his house after work to shower rq then leave. But my anxiety was so bad I wanted to get water and take a Xanax before I left. I got accused of hovering. I am not someone who wants be around people who probably don’t like me. I don’t wanna be around anyone rn actually so the fact he said that made me really angry and I lost it. I packed my shit and left. 

His friends had arrived so he was acting all nice and what not as to not let them know what was actually going on. But that made me even angrier. So I started yelling about while walking out. He came out and I started going off about how he’s fake around people. I regretted it the second I drove away. 

I genuinely have felt like he doesn’t actually like me for a little while. Idk if it’s my paranoia or my gut but it’s just been off recently. It’s made me feel so much more alone. I know my mental health bothers him. I know my attitude sucks and that bothers him. I am genuinely miserable and have been trying soooo hard to get it together.  I have called my old therapist to try to get back in with her with no success so I’m gonna start calling new therapists come Monday. I already called for an appointment for a psychiatrist appointment. I am trying. I want us to work. I want me to be happy. And I want to feel loved again. 

I love him so much but I know he’s tired of my shit and I don’t blame him. I just wanted to take a shower. I didn’t mean to hover. And now I think he hates me. Idk what to do. I don’t wanna fight with him. 

Has anyone else had their mental health destroy their relationship? Can I fix this. I love him so much and I’m crying just writing this cause I’m really afraid we are done. I tried so hard and I’m not good at this stuff. I hate myself and my mental health. My mental state has always been terrible. Idk I don’t wanna lose him but maybe he’ll be happier with out me. I wouldn’t blame him. I kinda suck.  

Any helpful ideas on how to get ahold of my anxiety would be much appreciated. Imma take a Xanax now. Thanks to anyone for reading this. Sorry I just had to vent and I don’t have anyone to call rn. God I’m a loser. 🤣 I hope y’all have a better night than I. Tomorrow will be a good day right?"

1339,What the fuck is wrong with me,"I'm so tired and just want to sleep forever and just waking up is a feat that I have to brace against with unreasonable hostility for every little thing. I'm angry my cats destroyed my blinds. I'm angry that people have started talking to me at work. I'm angry that I even have to leave the house. Im just angry at everything. I hate hate hate aking up every single day. I try to do homework and get that hateful squirming feeling in my stomach so I cant focus and I just want to run away so I dont finish. I watch shows to escape and destress until the reminder that I have so much to do still worms it's way into my head and I panic because I'm not getting anything done.

Emotionally, I feel raw. I feel my soul screaming inside me. I want to claw my way out of my own body. I want to escape myself. It hurts so much. My medication ran out 2 weeks ago and I cant get seen until next week. They were supposed to give me a new perscription without a visit, but they then denied it when my pharmacy sent in the request. They told me over the phone they would approve it and then did this to me.

It hurts. Everything hurts. All of it hurts. I want to vomit, I want to sleep, I want to run. I can barely make myself go to work, but I'm a new employee and dont have much time off. I'm struggling. I want it to stop. I'm falling apart at the seams."

1343,help with disassociation/overstimulation at my new job?,"I just got my first ""real"" job, as a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and my first day went really well. The only problem is I have a lot of undiagnosed mental health problems that I'm worried could become an issue in my work environment. When I'm experiencing a lot of sensations, it's too loud, or I have a lot to do all at once it can sort of overwhelm me. The kitchen where I'm working is loud, and the constant sensations of the water, the fan, etc. also create a lot of sensory input. I'm not sure if disassociation is the right word, but I'll end up sort of zoning out and it'll become really hard for me to focus and feel present. I'm worried I might end up forgetting to do something important or even have to leave in the middle of work if I get too overwhelmed. So far it's been ok, but I did have to sorta pull myself back into reality a few times during my shift when I started to feel too ""floaty"" and zoned out, and I even burned my hands a few times because being zoned out made it hard to realize the dishwater was too hot, so safety is also a bit of a concern.

I really just need advice on how to recognize when this is happening before it gets too bad, and some inconspicuous coping mechanisms I can use on the job. Thanks to anyone who can help me with this :)"

I've never had one before so I'm not entirely sure but that's what Google is telling me it probably was.

1346,One of the worst parts about depression is that the people closest to you can't really help,"I met with my therapist yesterday and finally accepted that I have once again dipped my toes into this reoccurring depression. For me depression is a regular visitor. Since I was a kid, it seems to stop by every other year (give or take). Though, this year provided some exceptional triggers. 

How do you talk about your depression to your family? your friends? It has never been something I've been able to do. Feeling so alone in all of this seems to make it worse. Quarantine doesn't help. 

There's nothing they can say, do, or give you that can make it better and so I don't really share that I'm going through this. My family lives across the country  and my friends can only do so much.  I don't know what to say when I've gone days or weeks ignoring phone calls or text messages. I don't know how to explain to them that I spent the entire day in bed. I know mental illness isn't my fault, but it's also my responsibility and I don't want to use it as an excuse for me not meeting my  expectations... Talking about depression with friends and family feels like just an excuse. 

I'm working on getting better... I have a therapist and a psychiatrist with whom I've been working for a couple of years now.  Until I feel better again, what is there really to do? Everything feels so hard and I feel so alone."

I feel guilty. My parents weren't bad most of the time, and I just feel like I'm being ungrateful. Any advice?"
1348,Serious Anxiety attack today,"Content warning: anxiety/COVID-19

I feel like it’s therapeutic to write about experiences sometimes, so I wanted to talk about my anxiety attack today.

I was doing some reading for school and drinking coffee very quickly. I rarely drink coffee and it became clear that I had over consumed when my adrenaline starting racing and triggering my flight or fight response. Suddenly, I felt incredibly anxious and disoriented and called my mom. She helped me get in contact with my college mental health hotline. I waited for about 15 minutes before being connected with a therapist who helped me calm down a little bit and help me breath more normally. I spent the next two hours recovering from jittery coffee shakes, fear and anxiety about my physical health, and calling my family members, all while rotating in and out of the shower and trying to feel better. I also sort of forced myself to throw up because I was feeling so nauseous.

I don’t know what I’m looking for, but it’s about 4 hours after the initial attack and I’m still sort of recovering. I’ve never had an experience like this and I was looking for some advice. I was so fucking terrified. I feel weak and jittery. My heart rate still feels fast. I feel nauseous. I just want to have someone listen and talk to me right now.

Thanks for your help."

I’m the type of person who likes to submit deliverables only if I feel they are of it’s optimal quality. Because I don’t really know what I’m doing, I keep putting off submitting the deliverables (since they don’t give me a hard deadline) and things are piling up because I don’t want to submit my work as I’m afraid I’ll disappoint people. What do I do? I’m so overwhelmed and I can’t sleep at night because of this. 
Should telling them that I can’t do this be an option?

I have more energy than I do at any other point in my life, and feel as if I could run, flip, sing, dance, cartwheel ...

I also feel like my impulse control diminishes? I want to text everyone about every emotion I'm having. But the emotions and thoughts are flowing through me so fast that I can barely keep up. 

What I read about manic episodes mentions sleepless nights, which I dont experience, although maybe will stay up later than usual if it's happening later in the day. 

Is this part of some mental illness or is it just me as a person lmao

dunno if this could be related somehow but I also have anxiety, depression &amp; ocd"

Is there a way to talk to your therapist about being sorta suicidal without them having to then legally take extra steps?

Over the last few months my brain has gotten extra tough and often when things go wrong I jump to wanting to die. I would like to be able to talk to my therapist about this but because i have an overactive imagination I end up thinking way into it which would be considered high risk. I also have past/fairly recent self harm tendencies that are also high risk factors. I’m in my new place I moved into last Sunday and although I’m wildly uncomfy I’m doing my best to not start the self harm cycle because for me once I’ve done something in a space it feels ok to continue the action. I’m just not really sure if there would be a way to bring it up nd be able to fully deal with it without crossing that line? Has anyone else had experience with this? I don’t really mind if she calls lile my fiancé because he knows but my parents are a big no and I absolutely cannot be admitted right now. Any input is much appreciated, sorry to post so much"

I’m currently binging Curb Your Enthusiasm and I find my self trying to act like Larry David to a certain extent. I’ve started writing standup and a pilot episode similar to Larry David’s style. Before this I watched madmen, the exact opposite of Curb, and I wanted to be like Don Draper and get into business.

Thank you for reading this."

1378,Panicking alone at home with puppy,"I’m wondering whether anyone had advice on dealing with experiencing panic attacks while alone at home. My partner is at work and we have a five month old puppy. I have been having issues with anxiety and depression and often feel having another person around helps ground me a bit. But being alone with my puppy is making me feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed. I feel like I hate him, I’ve been trying to do laundry all day and he keeps ripping clothes off the line and destroying them overnight so I have to supervise him with washing now. My house is covered in dog hair and I can’t get it clean and my anxiety is going haywire between trying to clean the house and feeling guilty for putting him out in the backyard while I mop. I try to play with him and pat him and he bites me on the face or arms and barks at my face so I put him back outside and then feel guilty for putting him outside etc. I’m really struggling and panicking rn and could use some advice or if anyone’s had a similar experience."
1379,My ex who didn't want kids is having a baby.,"We stayed close after breaking up. We had new relationships and that was all fine, in fact i like his new girlfriend for him.

But we broke up because he didn't want kids. It infected everything like poison because I did so we realised our futures didnt match.

When he said she's pregnant I was worried at first. Because he so strongly never wanted to be a dad I was worried.

When he said hes happy I felt like someone had stepped on my chest. I can't sleep, I'm going in and out of panic attacks. It's been about 5 hours and I can't feel good. I can't feel happy for him. I want to. He wants us to be close still because we became each other's rock.

And I know it was an accident but it's the only thing i can't handle. I could really handle him getting married. But i can't handle him having a baby. Hes so scared and I don't know how I can be there for him. I don't think I can. I feel so sick.

From the moment he said it I don't know what I'm here for anymore. There's so much other bad stuff going on I don't know if I can handle seeing him happily become a dad. It's all I ever wanted. He didn't want to be a dad. I wanted to be a mum. He's living my life. While I'm drowning.

I feel so sad I can't bare it."

Everyone around me seems to have goals and passions. Not that I don't (I do), but I feel so far from achieving them or that I'll never achieve them. I'm graduating college in December and I'm absolutely terrified of being out of school. I look around at my peers and they see so much more... professionally mature than me? It's a weird feeling and its hard to explain. Everyone around me seems to always be doing *something* to benefit them and then there's me. I procrastinate; I have major anxiety; I want to just sleep every day and I am so down in the dumps. I don't know what to do and I'd love to meet people who feel the same way as me. Ive been struggling with this feeling since I started college and I don't know what to do."

it's like a fly, but far away more vibration, annoying, reverbed, focused, faint, making the same sound on a loop.
it's been stuck in my head for over 5 years, it got louder the more i sit alone or enjoy silence.
when i focus on it it disappears, it comes back as soon as i try to focus on something else.
i never cared about it that much or noticed it.
lately it's been happening more frequently.
idk if it's triggered by being alone or enjoying silence.

1385,Constant need to check to make sure I did something,"For about the past 2 years, I have been having an issue with myself that I need help with. I commonly find myself needing to check to make sure I did something properly, like closed the door all the way or locked the door properly. The most common reoccurrence happens at night, before I go to bed. I spend at least about 10 minutes every night checking the sinks in my bathroom to be sure I turned them off. I push against the handles multiple times and run my hands under the sink to make sure I turned it off. I know the sinks are off, but if I do not check multiple times, I just can’t live with myself. I stay in my bathroom going from sink to sink pushing against handles. The repetition kills me and makes me tired, but I feel like I need to do it. That is the most common problem I have been having. I also find myself needing to have my sheets a certain way on my bed and I forcibly turn my door locks to be sure they are locked all the way. I’m not sure if those smaller details are of any importance, but I really wanted to know if anyone could tell me why I do this? Why do I feel the need to check everything even if I know i did it properly? Please help, it keeps me up at night thinking that I might have done something wrong. Thank you."

1388,I just think I would feel really good,"Imagine you have a best friend and or significant other. They are driving their car (I like to think it's a hippie van) your in the passenger seat. It's late like 3am, they picked you up bc you were having a bad night, so they drive you down a nice quiet back road. Turn on some music.

And you just start screaming. As loud as you can, no words just noises, okay Maybe a few swears. But you just let it all out, the pain, the fear, the sadness, the anger. You just lel it all out. They don't judge you they keep driving, turning every once in a while to see your face turn from, distressed to a rendition of joy. 

I think I would cry. As I screamed I think I would cry. I don't usually cry, Even when I'm sad bc I don't like letting myself feel that much at once, or at all. But if I screamed like that, let it all out, I know it would feel so good that I would cry. Happy tear or Maybe all the tears that I had kept in all this time. But either way I would be laughing and smiling by the end off it. Idk if I would be in genuinely happy way. But honestly I don't really care bc it would feel nice, kinda scary but over all nice, to feel that much at once

Then they would be there to hug you after your done. Let you cry on their shoulder and comfort you at the end of it all. It would feel nice I think."
1389,Im 25 and found out i was a dad yesterday,"I was dating a girl up until July-june  and when we broke up she was going through a false pregnancy (not the reason why we broke up) well it turned out that was a misdiagnosis and the pregnancy test they did there was a false negative and she was actually pregnant but never told me until 3 days after he was born and moved to a icu at a different hospital she said she couldn't remember the name of and that she already signed adoption forms.
Im fighting the adoption because I want my son. I was taught to never run from somthing worth it. 
I want my son
I dont know why she doing this to me. While we were together I tried so much, when she quit her job I supported her financially and the reason why we broke up was because she refused to look for more work. I tried getting her hired to the company I work for and she ignored 14 emails from the over a 3 months period and the only reason she got 14 because she kept telling me they arnt sending them and I would ask my supervisor to email another interview schedule time. She's refusing to help me get my name on the birth certificate,wont help try to stop the adoption because she want him to have a ""mom and dad"" but I have a large family that is already cone together as a army od research calling social workers , hospital, lawyers ,ive even contacted a old  buddy of mine whose dad became a judge. 
My mind is so exhausted from all the call and all the notes and legal and baby research is driving me to become just spaced in numbness. I've only had 4 hours of sleep in the last 2 days and probably only had half a muffin to eat. I just feel like if I rest he may slip from me and I can't live with that. I have so much help from loved ones but im just so overwhelmed with emotion, like I don't understand how calm I am. I usually freak out over things but for some reason omthe second I heard ""you have a son"" over the phone.  it was like my heart changed beats , stayed consistent everthing just looked different and I didn't know why I felt like everything was normal but not normal at the same time. I dont know if what I'm doing is enough but right now I'm on hold until Monday when social workers come back from the weekend and it killing me just sitting here not working toward getting my son."
1390,Why can’t I fucking end it? Help? Sorta? Idfk,"Ik I posted this somewhere else, I just wanted to better my chances of a response

Just laying in bed right now and feel like absolute shit. I plan for a future that I don’t even want to live to see. I have family that loves me and a friend that’s close but despite that I just wanna go. I usually just cut but I don’t wanna deal with the mess, and I have no will to go get it. But fuck me I wanna hurt myself sooooooo badly right now it’s indescribable, but I know that all I can really do is cut, because anything else would be noticeable. I don’t know what the point of living is at this point because whenever my buddy brings up girls, I just feel like shit, I have no motivation to try and find someone like he does. And when my mom talks to me about school (I’m in the process of taking my pre requisites for mechatronics) I always think about how badly I just wanna die before I even go that far so what’s the point. Honestly, if I don’t want friends, I don’t want to be around family, I don’t want a relationship, I’m not even able to be physical because of stress, and when I think of my future I feel a weird sort of sad that I might end up reluctantly living a long time. I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone irl about anything either because I’ll either be out on watch, checked in, or have people see me completely differently. I was writing out some suicide plans and thinking about the route of least impact so I went through my messages to think about people that might be affected, I ended up reading some really old convos and holy fuck I used to be a piece of shit. And I think under the right circumstances I still am, the only difference is I don’t have as many people to talk to, but I also miss having people to talk to. Fuck I’m a pathetic waste of life, can’t even appreciate what I have."

1395,I blame myself for everything,"Hi I am Matthew I am 18 and a College Student. It has been 3 years sense my last full blown panic attack. To give a short description of my week. The internet went down during one of my classes and then for the whole days. Then teachers piled on a f**k ton of homework. I got rejected by a girl, but that is what ever. I made plans with friends rescheduled it 3 times just to have it canceled. I blame Covid 19 on myself I think I straight up caused it. This is because I prayed to God that I would not have to visit a side of my family I do not enjoy to much. Guess what Covid stopped it. I still pray. I used the word W I S H in the prayer and every night at midnight I would say that anything I wish I did not intend that to be my W I S H. I stopped that tonight. I still blame myself for all of this the internet going down because I am the one who brings the bad luck to the apartment I live in. The homework because I decided to go to school instead of following my passion. The girl rejecting me because I just am not strong enough to loose weight. The friends canceling on me because I am just not good enough for them or I too pushy. Or that I am just a human piece of filth that thinks he has talent but doesn’t actually have any. I hate myself. I hate myself because I am failure. I do well in school. But I do not care. Every friend of my age(I have some older men I am friends with) has never lasted beyond 4 years and I have only really liked maybe 6 or the thirty friends I had. And no I am not moving. Yes I try and find and meet people with common interests. But I think after 18 years of my fucking life. I found people I actually like 4 of them. Omg that is amazing. Probably one of the best feelings ever. I plan on getting to know them better. I do not just want to play games with them online. I want to meet with them in real life. The problem is I think I may be coming off too interested. I might be driving them away. Every person I get close to I drive away. With Covid it has been hard to make friends. And these people I found are literally perfect. But I am not perfect. I am filth. 

Besides the point can someone tell me what is wrong with me. I have been working up the courage to say I W I S H. 

I am not crying or saying pity me. I do not deserve pity. I just want some support and calm questions. 
I am no longer having a panic attack I listened to Joe Pera from Adult Swim. Then hung out with some new people on discord and think I made a first good impression. 
Please just be helpful no hate. Advice appreciated!! Peace and love."
1396,What to do for my mother who is depressed?,"Hello\~ ( I am going to expose myself in this post)

My Asian mother who lived with anxiety (esp. regarding family) has denied having mental health but recently came to terms with the fact that she has severe anxiety and depression. Her anxiety is observed most often regarding curfew (8:30 pm), fighting, mental health, and when her kids don't do things that she says (like brushing our teeth a certain way, skipping a meal, or the way we walk). One month ago, my sister and I fought over a minor issue which escalated to my sister and me exchanging aggressive tones and her kicking me in the stomach. These violent occurrences happened for around 8 years. She kept telling me to look past and forget about my sister's violent tendencies for the sake of the family. I overlooked it for 8 years but for the first time, I refused to do so. So my mom often found me crying (I also have severe depression and anxiety), nightmares about my sister hitting me, dissociating, insomnia, and worst of all I would yell at my mom because she refused to confront my sister and giver her consequences for her actions. I admit that I should not have placed all the burden on my mom but during that month I kept thinking that if my mom placed boundaries to my older sister then it would not have come to this (please don't criticize me too much). My yelling at my mom led her to feel depressed and shows symptoms of depression such a few or no desire for food, fewer conversations, few movements, lack of anticipation for the future, and keeps telling me that life would become better if my sister and I left the house (note that I am not hurt since we did bring this horrible event into the house).  I tried to act happier around my mom and spend more time with her (like walking, sleeping and ""studying) and call my mom during and after my work times. I do not know what else I could do more. Please help me\~ Thank you"

1398,Should i (19m) search for an item associated with my fathers suicide? (TW: mentions of suicide and firearms),"Hey all. I’m going to be somewhat vague to avoid triggering anyone, as I know this is a sensitive subject. When I was nine, my father ended his life after a long battle with bipolar disorder. I cling to any item associated with him, and over the years I’ve struggled with separating who I am from how his loss has affected me.

A few years ago, I learned that someone in the family (that I won’t specify) anonymously sold the gun he used for the act once the police returned it, as they didn’t want the reminder. I completely and totally understand, and support their choice to just get rid of it. 

However, I’m an incredibly sentimental person and have always been curious about what exactly he used. Maybe in a way to feel closer to him? I’m not entirely sure the reason why, but for awhile I’ve wanted to go to the local police station and get the records/police report of his passing, which I figure would have the information I’m curious about.  

Would this be a good idea? Part of me thinks that knowing this would satisfy the curiosity that I’ve had for years, and another part of me thinks that it will in back horrible memories and make me feel things that I don’t need to feel. So here I am, venting/asking the Internet for advice. What do you think? And I’m so sorry if I upset anyone by posting this, if this triggered or upset you I’ll remove it. I just want to get this off my chest and hear someone’s thoughts"
1399,Leaky Gut Symptoms," 

### Antidepressants cause leaky gut

Leaky gut is a condition wherein toxins and bacteria can “leak” through the intestinal wall. Researchers have been conducted to see the impact of antidepressants on the composition of bacteria in the gut. Researchers have speculated that psychiatric drugs and antidepressants cause leaky gut as they can change the composition and quantity of gut bacteria displayed in rats. Similar experiments are being conducted to see the extent to which antidepressants impact bacteria and toxin in the gut. Anti depressant which causes leaky gut includes Prozac and SSRIs."

I've constantly been on the verge of tears for days... anything and most everything just prompts the waterworks.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis here, I’m looking for words to describe this. I have no idea what the hell this possibly could be and I need some googlable terms to look into possibilities before I set up therapy appointments. Any help would be appreciated."
1406,Letting this off my chest. I want help. I need help. Everyday I feel closer and closer to the limit.,"(Long post). 

I’m.... confused. Scared. 

I’ve always felt like there’s something off with me, like I don’t function like my peers. 
I can’t estimate time correctly, I can’t concentrate on a thought sometimes, my brain will try to think 25 things at the same time. My first instinct is to multitask. I struggle concentrating. I get distracted very easily and forget I’m doing something important while being distracted. 

I feel very disconnected from my emotions sometimes, like I don’t recognize them. For example I know I liked this person but I don’t remember what liking them felt like. 

My brain is... noisy. Sometimes I can’t control it. 

I don’t remember much from my life before I was 10 (I’m 20 now but I didn’t remember much from it even when I was 14 so maybe I blocked some memories? I don’t know) but I know one thing about me and that is that I’ve hated myself for years. The hate and the self loathing and the self dedication my brain puts me through is at times uncontrollable, it’s a default reaction. 

I feel like I have no control, no drive, no passion. 

Some things do bring me joy and it’s an explosive kind of joy but my lows comeback immediately the moment ido something else or... whatever. 

Going to bed is hard. I’m tired and sleepy but many times I feel like my phone is glued to my hand. 

My room is usually a mess because I Need to see things otherwise I forget I have them. It’s hard for me to even remember what to care about sometimes. 

I have no idea how I made it to college but here I am feeling undeserving and worthless and tired. Just... overall like a huge disappointment. 

Just thinking about the countless things I could do with my life triggers a chain of thoughts that I cannot put an order to. 
I’m insecure. Want to just disappear sometimes. Want my brain to shut down.  

My father struggles with mental illness, he’s medicated. There’s more history of mental illness in my family, there’s something in me that doesn’t work quite well I know but I can’t explain it. My fathers side of the family is deeply religious everything is solved through god type of Christians. My mother is sure that my behaviors are learned (not inherited)from my father. 
My father keeps saying that he’s glad I have a “normal brain” but I’m not sure. I’m really not. 

I need answers. I want answers. But I can’t afford help. Sometimes I even wonder if I deserve it. If I’m just being dramatic. If I’m just looking for pity if I’m just being immature. 

I’ve felt all those things and more while growing up but now, at 20 years old, it’s getting in the way. It’s much much worse. 
Sometimes I hyper fixate on things, or nothing at all. 
Sometimes my brain is noise and some others I just don’t think. I’m supposed to be thinking ?? Sometimes the only thing in my brain is one sound, one song. Or one word or one scenario and if I’m being asked something or if I’m supposed to be conjuring an answer for something I’m being asked I just can’t. Stop. 

I’ve had music playing in my head constantly ever since I was a kid. Every time. Even if I’m working on something there’s a track playing, a thought creeping out, an idea, sounds around me. Something. 

So much sadness. Anguish. Hollowness. 
  
I just.. I’m tired. I’m so tired guys. Whoever reads this.... thank you for making it all the way here. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know what I should be. I don’t know what I want to be. I’m tired. I’m exhausted."

I'm so afraid I'm going to do something bad in the future, or be a bad person, even though I want nothing more than kindness, peace and love. I'm so confused as to why I feel this way.   
I suppose maybe it's just feeling bad about what's happened to me in the past and how I've reacted to trauma and stuff.

Look, its not a big deal.. just need a place to vent since I feel like no one cares much, the people who do care I cant talk to because they're going through a harder time and I wanna be there for them. Everyday I tell myself, today is the day I'll go through with the deed, I'll plan my suicide note..

My atoms have the audacity to impose their will on these things. I can water my plant or I can play my guitar or punch my wall. I can decide the future of my descendants. It all feels a little fake if Im being honest. Like im living in a little capsule of existence. 

It comes like cloud of smoke, and hits your lungs cold- "" what am I even living for? ""

1414,how should i deal with closure and childhood trauma if my parents won’t take accountability?,"I am struggling to find ways to come to terms with finding closure with my parents faults as a child, seeing as they aren’t speaking to me as I called them out. I know well I didn’t do wrong in calling them out but my mother is making me feel as if i had, she doesn’t speak to me or answer my messages.

How does one carry on in life like this? It’s not fair that I want to close doors on old issues and forgive them but they are making things complicated and not recognising their mistakes.

I am very confused and slightly lost here.

1420,I’m uncomfortably similar to my narcissistic grandma,"Long story short: a few months ago my family (mom, dad, me, brother and sister) realized how manipulative my grandma was. We knew she had been very abusive to my mom but mom had forgiven her and let her back into our lives when we were little. 
I’m starting to realize now as I recall all these memories how similar I am to my grandma. I was kind of her golden child. I was her special little angel who was brilliant, beautiful, and perfect in every way. One day I would be amazing and perfect just like grandma.

That was all instilled to me since I was a toddler. I’m 17 now. I have an insanely difficult time making and maintaining friendships. I’m in therapy for that. The more we talk about everything the more I realize how awful and narcissistic my whole mindset is. I can’t form relationships because I automatically look down on people. I can’t take criticism or advice because I assume I know better. It’s been a really difficult revelation because the whole time I thought that I must be the victim. I was a victim of my grandma, right? But now it feels like it’s my own fault for being socially inept.
All my thoughts are so scrambled right now.. I think in extremes. I wish this were as easy as just trying to be less arrogant or more open minded, yknow? But I really believe deep down that if I’m not perfect then I’m worthless scum.

 I was expected to be this amazing, inherently special person who could do anything I wanted because I deserve it. I realize now part of the reason I can’t maintain relationships is this weird entitlement to people’s affections which mixes with a fear of rejection and further muddles with not wanting to be a burden or show “weakness” (weakness=emotions).

I don’t know what I want from this post. I just need somebody to tell me I’m not a bad person, I’m not gonna end up like my narcissistic grandmother. I’m gonna get better and I’m gonna make friends and have healthy expectations and boundaries or whatever."

1425,I can't sleep,"I can't sleep. No matter how hard I try, if I sleep I will die, if I sleep I will die. Every creak, crack and grrrtttt the rickety old house I live in makes, I feel like something is there - something terrifying that will murder me, something that will tear me in two pieces and drink my blood and suck my guts out of my wretched body. It's taunting me, it knows I know it's there. It knows that I know that no one will take me seriously, It knows what I am and what i've done. I want it gone, I want to be gone but I can't because I have a family. No one cares because no one knows what I'm going through, no one truly knows the thoughts that won't stop conveying in my head like a conveyor belt.

I want to die and I want others to die. Every time I think I am getting better I fuck up, I don't want to fuck up. I'm normal, I want to be normal I am normal but I don't feel normal... 

I'm a fat disgusting pig who is to lazy to actually lose weight, so instead I will carve a great scar across my stomach and rip out the fat disgusting animal that is inside of me. Then I will be loved and cared for and people will notice me...

1427,How can I help my sister?,"Background: my sister has a collection of behaviors that range from mostly harmless (insisting on washing her hands well before meals, wanting everything of hers in the right spot) to actively impeding her quality of life (requiring absolute perfection in school, freaking out/crying at the thought of going to the store). Last year in school, she'd be so thorough on assignments that it would take her two hours to write a ""summary"" that was longer than the original reading. All of her teachers and my parents constantly reassured her that she didn't have to do that much work, but she always continued to overwork. It got to the point where she was getting maybe three or four hours of sleep a night. Sometimes she got no sleep at all.

This year, she's going to be a junior in the IHS program. Anyone who's been through it can attest that it's a truly awful year of high school and nobody is really prepared for the amount of work involved. Last week, school was delayed due to the less-than-favorable circumstances in our area, but it's still coming. If my sister even hears the word school, she starts having an anxiety attack(?). I'm afraid she'll work herself into some sort of breakdown this year. 

My parents refuse to send her to any form of therapy or even really look into therapy options in our area. My sister refuses to admit that her behavior is harmful to her well-being or out of the ordinary. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to help (other than just be there to listen to her if she wants to talk)."

I have absolutely 0 friends I can talk to and the teachers at my school are only going to make my situation worse. I'm currently 14 so maybe it might just be a phase but I have no idea anymore. Break and Lunch are the worst part of my days because I have no one to talk to aswell. I  can't even enjoy my favourite games anymore I just get bored of them and I just think that there's school next day so I instantly lose all happiness at that time. Please help.
1431,Is this normal or should I seek help?,"For the last few years I've noticed that I really, really, really dislike when my responsibilities or plans change based on what I expected. I get very frustrated at minor inconveniences or when I know what I want to do in my day or at work and something external changes what I expected.

I often read books, watch a movie, or see the news, and view stories about leaders, etc and often wonder how they handle multi-tasking or changing priorities. I see people around me seemingly excelling at, or even eager for, big responsibilities or a life where rapid changes occur. I get so anxious even thinking about being in that position or situation.

I am someone who likes efficiency and try my best to find the best/easiest way to do a task or job. If something interrupts that I can get quite 'angry' (I don't show it, I just feel it inside). I hate this part about me. It can even be a minor change to a minor task. Such as, if I am processing a transaction at work (I work retail) and someone interrupts me or asks a question that is outside of my 'routine', internally I feel like lashing out.

Is this a serious issue or relatively 'normal'? Do others feel this level of frustration? I feel like it's holding me back from doing things in life and wanting to look for new opportunities at work so maybe it is something that I should look into..."
1432,My parents.,"I'm 13 years old, I have autism \[anger issues and emotional issues in general\] and social anxiety. My parents constantly, constantly feel the need to be controlling. When arguing, I try and prove my point but I cut get off a lot. When I try to tell them how I feel, it gets dismissed and then they try and tell ME the reason why I'M feeling that way. They say your average parent line when me and my brother fight - 'I don't care who started it, you're both as bad as each other'. But, as I said before I have issues with controlling my anger, my brother knows this and pushes me to a state of rage where I'm often violent, which ends up with me being called a bully because I 'hit first'. Also with my anger issues, when we argue, I try to walk away from the situation to calm down and reassess but I get called back, with something along the lines of 'Come back or \[insert punishment here\] will happen, which triggers my anger, which then leads to said punishment being put into place anyway. Today specifically, I tried to ask for my phone back, but got met with 'don't you dare' (for context: I did smash a bucket of paint, which was wrong on my part, but I was pushed to that point, once again by my parents.) so I stood there and waited \[probably rude to do tbf\] and then was told 'what are you gonna do? are you gonna smash my bedroom up this time because you didn't get your own way?' in a ridiculing and aggressive tone (they often try and put the blame on me for being violent but don't take responsibility for causing said violence). 

I genuinely don't know what to do. I have friends I can talk to but not often because my phone gets taken away. I have no self worth atm and I feel depressed a lot of the time because I'm made to feel like I can't even talk to my own parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, when I try and tell them I'm stressed because of them, they go 'you can't get THAT upset over us, something else is going on.'

&amp;#x200B;

They are decent parents a lot of the time, they just don't know to deal with me and assume they do."
1433,I feel so lame compared to my friends and i think its been affecting my relationship with my girlfriend,I have been getting weird feelings of being just not wanted and lame compared to my friends im the oldest and calmest and my friends are all hyper active and i keep beginning to feel like im so boring compared to them. My girlfriend at the time enjoys hanging out with them rather then me i hate to admit it im semi jealous but i keep using this jealousy as a chance to push my friends away and my girlfriend i dont know what too do this has happened with all of the other women i have dated i know im really boring and i have always been ik these are bad thoughts and stuff
1434,Thoughts of messed up Events,"I'm an 18M. Every once in a while I completely zone out of reality and vividly picture a completely hypothetical situation and it feels so real like I'm actually living in it. A lot of the time in these visualizations terrible things happen. Someone that's sitting right next to me bleeds to death while I try to save them. Someone I love gets raped right in front of me. Usually after I have these thoughts I black out and go into a rage or I'll snap back to reality while I'm punching something. I'm not sure what this is and a few minutes afterwards I can't remember specific details. Just now I had one where I walked in on my fiance being railed by my roommate and I beat him until he was barley breathing. While I was beating him my fianceé tried to stop me and I punched her in the nose and said ""Get off of me you whore."" Then I pulled out a knife, dug it into his neck and dragged it through his throat until it slit through the side. Then I proceeded to beat my fiancée. The whole thing felt terrible. It felt real and it felt like I was just in my body watching as someone else controlled it. And then I snapped out of it. For background I had a very messed up childhood and was molested and manipulated by my mother. I hardly remember anything from childhood  but I do remember some things that point to what she did to me. She would try to convince me to sleep in her bed, telling me that she was lonely, and sometimes she forced me to. I remember being so scared to fall asleep in her room even on the floor. I remember one time when I was 12 or so I was sleeping on her floor and I had a dream about a classmate giving me oral sex but it felt oddly real. But the thing is in the dream they were just there and I didn't want him to do that because I'm not gay he just happened to be in the dream when the feeling started and I was very uncomfortable and I woke up halfway through but I was too scared to open my eyes but a few seconds after the feeling stopped I opened my eyes and saw my mom getting back into bed. I looked in my pants and my penis was wet and it's so shameful to admit that there was in fact semen. When I was little I did sexual things I shouldn't have known anything about. I would pretend to rape my fucking teddy bears. I would pretend to have one that was my wife and cheat on it with another bear. I have no clue what else happened I don't remember what else happened but I would also insert random objects into my anus in the shower and curl into a ball and cry and I would be very depressed for months afterwards. As a kid before I ever inserted anything into my own anus it hurt to have a bm and I had constipation issues. When I was very little my mom was a stay at home mom so she had all the time she wanted with me. She would also do many things to control my life. She would move me schools whenever I had friends. I couldn't go to friend's houses and they couldn't go to my house until I stopped asking. She would attack me just scratching at me like an animal or say terrible things to me and when I tried to run from her or react she would call my (older) brothers saying I hit her and they would both hold me down sometimes while she would stuff my mouth with a sock or pour liquid soap down my throat. A few times my brother spit on my face and he would often punch me and my mom didn't care. All three of them hated me and I don't know why. I don't know what I have from this and I've gotten a lot better and a lot more stable as an adult and it's really hard. I don't care about the past anymore and I don't want to dwell in it but I just want to make sense of my own brain and how I can heal and just be a normal person. Thank you."
1435,Who the fuck am I?,"I realized that I do not have my own personality  
All I do is copying what people i find cool, in movies or in real life, do and/or say  
Is it normal? Maybe I'm just overthinking"
1436,How do I know if someone hates me or if I'm just overreacting?,"Let me preface by saying it is not a constant feeling. Sometimes I feel as if my friends are just putting up with me so that they can laugh at me when I'm gone. And the people that are not my friends outright hate me and wish me no good. They're just good at lying and being ""polite"". When I feel like this I usually try to stay away from everyone as much as I can. Even when going outside I might believe that the strangers that were talking and laughing are talking about me. It's even worse in large crowds, where I can discern my name in between all of the voices of the crowd, followed with rude remarks and laughter. No matter how much I say to myself ""these people are not talking about me. They've most likely never even seen me!"", it doesn't stop it from hurting. This sometimes happens at school too. I can hear my name being mentioned followed with some rude stuff that I am insecure about while a bunch of people are gathered a couple of meters away from me. I instantly feel targeted and scared, but the peculiar thing is that when someone is back-biting, they're usually whispering. They seemed to be chatting quite normally and the snippets I caught (if they were real at all?!) did not match their tone and body language at all. Perhaps they think it's funny and casual to talk about me, who knows. It's high school though, teens aren't known to be the nicest people on earth.

Once or twice I started asking a close friend of mine if our mutual friends hate me, and if my childhood-classmates hate me too (long backstory with insecurity, mild s\*icidal ideation and slight bullying, can't type it out cause it won't do it justice). She said they didn't at all. I was (and still am) not convinced. After that, I tried to subtly introduce my fear of acquaintances and strangers alike hating me by sight. She said ""no, that's not possible"", and told me to seek help. My sister wants me to seek help too but I am sceptical. I don't know if I can trust a therapist. What about if they are lying to me about me not being hated? What about if they just give me a sense of fulfilment while not accomplishing anything to distract me? Anyways, I doubt that this is severe enough for a therapist."
1437,"I don't drink to stop feeling, i drink because that's when i actually feel","First of all i won't use alt account because well, in my opinion it's no shame to have mental health issues

Second of all before i start, i don't have problems with alcoholism, i don't drink much and i am 18(legal drinking age) so all is fine with that

So basically, i will keep it as short as i can, i am really 'cold' person, by that i mean i can't show much emotion, especially sad ones, I can't cry, I can't show I'm sad, I'll turn it around into a joke to cope. Hell, I didn't even cry when my 10 years old cat died, yes i felt bummed out and sad as hell, but not a single tear

But once i am drunk, all of that changes, i cry, I can be sad properly because the walls I've built are just, gone, yesterday i watched a video that reminded me of me and my best friend and i got really emotional and it felt so liberating to be able to cry again, i guess you can kind of compare it to not eating the food you like for months and then you get it again, it's way better. You feel all of the things that make that food great and just like the cheese and meat in your lasagna, tears are what makes the memories really glow, it makes me happy because i went through those things.

I don't really tell my friends stuff like that because i hate when people worry haha, anyways

I'm not sure if i make much sense right now because i suck at expressing myself.

Have a good sunday y'all!"
1438,I somewhat opened up to my girlfriend and I feel terrible,"I'm not sure if that's the right place lmao

My girlfriend celebrated her birthday yesterday and I got hella drunk.. so did she.. At some point she started to cry and I honestly dont remember why.. We left the room and went somewhere else where we were alone. 

After some time I - for whatever reason - just bursted into tears. I hate crying in front of other people so I started to apologize for crying and stuff.. Just the usual stupid shit I say when I'm crying in front of someone.. But then I (for to me unknown reasons) just started to open up about being ""bullied"" in elementary school and how it fucked up my mental health and self esteem and everything.

It felt good... but now I regret it. She was feeling bad and I made it even worse by making it about me and my ""problems"". I'm such a selfish prick. I hate it. I hate myself. I remember every single second of it and I despise the fact that I made everything about myself again. I always do.

She isn't mad at me.. at least she said she isn't... She's actually glad that I told her all of that but I still feel terrible for... just doing what I did.

I always feel bad for opening up and telling others how I feel.. But yesterday was.. different. First off, usually I'm sober while talking about stuff like this.. and second.. usually the person I'm talking to isn't feeling like shit at that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry I just needed to get that off my mind and I didn't wanna bother her or anyone else with my bs."
1439,"I'm extremely tired, yet I've spent the whole day in bed.","These past weeks (month or two?) I've been having issues with being tired almost all the time for literally no reason. It's so annoying, it sometimes prevents me from doing basic stuff.

The only olympics I could win right now is the laziness olympics. Fr though, the fuck is this?!"
1440,I think things are starting to get more intense and more real.,"So for a while I was feeling off and I didn’t know what it was and at first they suspended bipolar and then they changed it to schizoaffective because I was experiencing I guess like hallucinations or something.  I thought they were but I’m not too sure I may have just been confirmation bias. 
But recently like overtime I’ve been less and less vocal about my issues. Instead of daily or weekly updates they turned into biweekly, and then monthly, and then bi monthly until I kinda just stopped. I’ve been feeling an extreme, overwhelming sensation of depression. I don’t want to get out of bed, I have little to no interest in things I enjoy, little to no interest my job, little to no interest in personal hygiene, little to no interest in actually seeking help, little to no interest in sex, ive been neglecting food and started fasting a lot reducing my meals to one meal a day and it’s not like I eat much anyways. That’s the emotional part.

Mentally, I’ve been extremely cognitively slow. I can read as well as I used to, I’ve been forgetting everything that comes to mind, I can’t spell for shit, I’ve been having to proof read everything I type because I think they sound good and are well written and then I re read it and everything is spelt wrong and nothing makes any actual sense so I’ve been trying to be better at articulating by reading what I type out load or saying the words broken down in my head down to each syllable. Spell check really helps as they finish most sentences for me or just have better words. I play more word games and reading more and and pay attention to new words and repeat them and use them myself so I don’t forget what they mean. Usually I do this for synonyms. But really what got me was the other day and today. 

So last night I was making a mod for fallout and listening to someone talk about a video game for 40 minutes. I kept hearing scratching and like muffled screams coming from the other side of the room. I ignore it as it’s probably the AC unit or the other persons room on the tv. It gets progressively louder and louder and I keep trying to ignore it. Eventually I can’t and I try to make out the sounds. It’s not distinctly human. There’s a human element but it so heavily distorted. It’s like a shriek or cry and there’s scratching just so much scratching like it’s begging for help to escape the walls. I grab my phone and try to record the sound to make sense of it but as soon as I open my camera the sound is gone and I never heard it for the rest of the night. It was an instant silence like unplugging the tv. It was very strange but freaked me out as I left my room for an hour and a half to forget about what just happened.

Today I was in the shower and it gets a little NSFW so I’ll leave a warning.

-NSFW warning-

I was pretty upset about the lack of emotions I’ve been feeling other than pure existential sadness, dread, and sometimes fear. Nothing was working for me, so I decided to look at porn to see if it would at least cause a spark but it didn’t and I just felt nothing. No emotions, not even a primal reaction I just didn’t have the strength to continue to do anything so I turn it off and out of nowhere I just have this feeling. Like this intense sensation overcome my body. I slid my phone across the floor and sat in the shower. I was tucked my head in my knees and curled up. Banging my head on the wall, crying softly and then grabbing my shampoo bottle and holding it like a baby. I kept hitting my head and I just sat there for about an hour in a half. I didn’t even wash myself I didn’t have the strength to get up, or clean myself I just sat there. And I realized just how much physical effort it takes to do anything. Cleaning, shaving, making my bed, getting dressed, doing laundry, or even entertainment. It’s all so exhausting. I’ve been having this feeling like someone is in my room like their presence is here where I can’t see them. And it follows me to the store, to smoke, even to work. It’s not like a ball and chain, it’s more human. And like I can’t stop this feeling that like something or someone is coming. It feels real, like really real like at any moment a man will come into my room and take me away when I’m not paying attention.

So reddit I’m here. Asking for help, support, emotional support. I’m scared, and I’m sad. It feels like a thousand pounds of cinder blocks is on my back and I’m being commanded to go about my day. It really sucks man. Idk what to do."

1442,Serious Self-esteem problem,"So, the point is that really a lot of people tell me (pretty sure it's what they think) that I'm quite good looking, intelligent, kind, one if not the best person they know, and there are very few and small things ""wrong"" with me, an exception is my serious self-esteem problem, because I don't believe any single word they say, but I believe they're telling the truth but everything in my life is ruled by the continuos voice that shouts ""well you're not enough"" covering the one that hushes ""you're way more than what you think, believe them"" (reinforced by all the psycho and mean partners that I had) you might think ""well get the fuck up"" and you might be right, but I'm falling down, sinking, unable to move and react and throwing all my chances of a happy out of the window because of this"
1443,Does anyone else feel like they just don’t have a future?,"I don’t see a future for myself, and that feels wrong somehow. Whenever asked, “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” I have no idea what to say. Simply put, I don’t see myself anywhere. Things just sort of feel hopeless, like I’ll eventually just disappear or stop existing. Does anyone else feel this way? It’s such an unsettling feeling, but I just can’t shake it. 

I have a partner, a nice apartment, and a decent job. My anxiety has me constantly worried that something major will go wrong, which I think contributes to me not even wanting to consider what a future will look like. I also suffer from depression, which really has me feeling as though there’s no point to any of this. Ugh. Just needing to know if there is anyone else out there who feels this. I need to know that I’m not the only one."

I feel like I have no right to complain to anyone about anything that's bothering me because other people have it so much worse than me.

I never suffered with acne as a teen, I was lucky. Out of nowhere after turning 26 6month ago I've developed adult acne, and I feel hideous, it's completely obliterated any and all self-confidence I've slowly been building up. Yet, I know it's not half as bad as some people's acne, and I see people with worse than mine and they still look beautiful! So how can I feel so god awful?

Same with my weight. I'm far from overweight, though I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I think literally everyone I know is bigger than me, and they all look fine to me. Why then, do I look at myself, knowing I am smaller than them, yet I feel so fat and wobbly and horrid? 

I haven't been so badly effect by covid, I'm furloughed but my job is secure, as is my partner's, yeh our holiday got cancelled and now our anniversary weekend away, but I haven't lost anyone or anything like that. Yet it's making me miserable, and I'm so sick of it all, but I feel I have no right to say any of it because other people have had to cancel weddings, have lost their jobs, have lost their loved ones...


It's like logic doesn't come in to play at all. I know I have it so much better than probably 90% of the population. Yet I feel hideous, miserable, and helpless. For the first time since recovering from my depression 4 years ago, I find myself waking up and wishing that I hadn't.

Vent over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."
1448,I don’t want to admit myself to crisis but I can’t wait weeks for a psychiatrist,"I don’t even know what’s wrong with my anymore. All my life I was told I was type 1 rapid cycle bipolar recently they said I might just have really bad panic disorder. All I know Is I have these episodes that I can’t control of crying, tenting up my muscles in my legs till they cramp and don’t work, I slam my head into things, beat myself with objects incurring Wepons if in range. I’m COVERD in bruises all over my legs from the past week. This morning I beat myself with my snow boot so bad my shin was bleeding. I just started therapy again 3-4 weeks ago and I hate my therapist. She hasn’t helped me with anything all she’s done is have me talk about my life and then be like OK see you next week. And the last time we spoke she said we weren’t gonna be talking for two weeks. I told her I need something as needed for these attacks and she said she’d recommend me to a psychiatrist but It could take a few weeks. I don’t want everyday meds I want as needed. I’m normally a very bubbly hyper person so all these anti-anxiety anti-depression meds really kill that and I don’t like it. I really can’t deal with this anymore my body is physically broken from it and it’s affecting my 10 year relationship with my boyfriend. I don’t want to admit myself to crisis But I need help faster than they’re going to get it to me. Is there anyone I could go to like a doctor or urgent care and just get something for my anxiety without them admitting me because I’m covered in bruises from earning my love. I’m genuinely not a danger to myself except when I have these episodes sometimes I won’t have them for months and other times like recently I have them every day. Nobody knows what they are nobody knows why they happen and nobody seems to be taking me seriously that I need help because I don’t want to be admitted and I’m only brushing myself not burning or cutting. The reason I don’t want to be admitted if I am a caretaker for my 92-year-old grandma and I can’t leave her alone for that long. I also can’t have for worrying about me that I’m in the hospital because he won’t understand why"
1449,"My (F23) partner (M22) made a long way treating schizoaffective disorder and remaining stable for almost an year, but now I'm worried that he's overdoing himself..."," I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it. In the end, it's up to his decision."
1450,Am I sick?,"Hello! I'm a 21 year old college student and I've been suffering from PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and memory loss for the past 5 years. I've gone to therapy many times and I've gone on several medications. I do feel better now with all of the above, but I have this major problem. I don't feel responsible for anything. I don't take responsibility for my house and my parents and even my degree sometimes. The most simple example is that, I eat and I leave the dishes and you could leave them there for days and it wouldn't cross my mind to wash them. I feel absent-minded almost, because later on my mom would tell me ""why didn't you wash the dishes?"" and I'd go ""I forgot."" and that's weird. Is this normal for a 21 year old girl? Do I seek help again?
Thank you."
1451,I can't get out,"My struggle with depression started around 6 years ago. 5 year ago I got my first treatment and over the years I kept going to counselling. I never got fully over it, i never felt fixed. 
1.5 years ago I met a person that gave me a lot of strength and I managed to improve a lot of things in my life. For a while, it felt like i was finally alright, like my world wasn't falling apart anymore. Me and this person were very far away for each other unfortunately.
Recently I moved to a new place, in a new country. I loved the  fresh start. I've already met some people that I can hang out with, I have some brief contact with people back home, I am trying my best to make the most out of everything. Nowadays me and that amazing person are closer. 

Everything should be great. But it isn't. Right now i feel like crying, like I am a failure, like I want to run away from everyone and everything. I feel like I'm mad. Everything is technically perfect and even though I have no reason, I feel like I'm falling apart.

How can I ever be worthy of living, how can I be loved? I feel like regardless of what I do, nobody sees the world the way i do, nobody feels the same way I do, nobody understands who I am. Nobody even tries.

Am I insane for feeling this way?"
1452,How i beat depression,"I used to be depressed, then they gave me a recipe for sildenafil (viagra) and my depression went away just like that. Would recommend asking for a testosterone tests if you're male suffering from depression .

It is human biology to have urges to reproduce. Depression causes you to lose interest in reproduction. Losing interest in reproduction means losing the meaning of life. It is deeply coded into our biology. Hope this helps :)"

My teeth started chattering, and I was shivering all over as if I was cold, but I wasn't cold. I could barely talk to my SO, and when I had finally calmed, my jaw was sore for a couple of hours afterward. I'm pretty sure I've experienced this before, but I'm not certain what it is."

1456,im coming out of a depression. now what?,[removed]
1457,Feeling of being left out,"Hi guys, I am not sure whether theres something wrong with me personally or if its something more serious. Precontext: College was 3 years in where i live. For one period of time, I had kinda shunned away from making new friends, after my transition from high school to college. For awhile during the first year of college, I always had on and off thoughts of killing myself, especially during the nights when i was alone, I guess it could be attributed to how I felt that I wasnt fitting in into college. Eventually I opened up to people in my last 2 years in college, and focused on my grades to help push me foward. One point to note was that I still kept in contact with my high school friends through college. 

Fast forward 3 years to now, I am waiting to enlist in the army and the thoughts are getting less. Most of my high school friends have grown up and are living a life of their own now. Personally, I have not really been in close contact with my college friends. At this point in time and previously in college, more often than not, i find myself relying on my high school friends to talk to me and not leave me alone most of the time.

Throughout this life stuff, I always felt that I would more often than not be ignored and always felt that people didnt understood what I was saying or where I was coming from.
So I guess my question is, I am not sure whether this is just me trying to seek for attention from people or whether or not its just a matter of learning to be alone?

TLDR: Didnt make friends in college and was relying on high school friends to talk to"

I am suicidal and I just need someone to hear that because I just can't say it to anyone in my life. I once called a family member and told them, like poured my heart out when I was really drunk, and then shrugged it off the next day. I've not drank since. I feel like I ruin all my relationships. I don't check in with people and I'm bad at replying. I cant think of any job I would be remotely happy doing for the rest of my life. I'm sick of comparing myself to others. I'm tired of having no one. I just don't want to carry on being so lonely with so little purpose"

1462,I never cry,Basically the title. I never cry ever under any circumstances. The best example I can give is my grandmother died this year after being in a nursing home for several years. Her condition had take pretty bad turn so I visited her fairly often. I got a call from one of the nurses saying she was on her last stretch so I rushed  there and arrived just moments after she passed. And there was nothing but a feeling of damn she is really gone for weeks. I eventually just kinda moved forward but like is it normal that I don't cry or no???

1465,I'm afraid my new girlfriend has some form of dissociation disorder. What can I do to help?,"Hello, 
So this past month I've started seeing someone new. She's truly fantastic. Smart, funny, charming.. itd be easy to simple for me to write a whole thread simply complimenting her.
To the actual issue at hand; I happen to believe she has some form of dissociative disorder. I became aware of it at first when we first started getting intimate. She told me she had some trauma and anxiety due to a prior relationship.. long story short, the first guy she ever slept with kind of tossed her aside after she wanted things to get serious. This left her quite scarred and I believe sexual interactions happen to be a trigger.
She becomes quite robotic... She has a very expressive face but when she dissociates she kind of stares blankly.. barely speaking.. she cant really describe what's going on.. she even told me she feels like she's not there or that she feels like she's observing her own life.
Obviously whenever this happens I immediately stop what we're doing and just try to comfort her.. usually all she wants is silence.
I told her about two weeks ago that there's no pressure when it comes to sex and reassured her that I'm here to help her get through this all.. in the mean time her psychologist told her it is likely a form of dissociation. After hearing that I started researching the subject a bit and understood that her disorder maybe more severe than I thought.
Other than sex I realized that I saw her dissociate two other times when we were on dates. One time happened when I mentioned her dissociation to her after the first time that it happened.. I just thought she got self conscious about it. The last time was totally bizarre and it happened after we woke up together and I took her out for a nice picnic. The whole time I felt like she was avoiding eye contact.. she didn't really have anything to say when replying to questions.. and she felt extremely distant. I got a little upset because I felt like I did something wrong.. but a few hours later she called all happy and energetic (which is what she's usually like) telling me she was sorry she was so out of it.

Sorry for the long detail dump but I do feel like it's a crucial bit of information.. anyways I've got a few questions as to what should I do moving forwards:

How should I approach her disorder? Is it wrong of me to assume that I know what's going on? 

Should I encourage her to get help? She may be seeing a psychologist but Ive read that to deal with this a therapist that is trained in dealing with trauma would be better

If relationships and intimacy are a trigger what should I do? Give her space? Give her more attention? I feel like I should be doing both but they sort of contradict one another.

And lastly.. I'm a bit of an anxious guy.. I do understand that her dissociation isn't something she's doing on purpose or to hurt me... But if any of you have any tips on how to handle the stress it causes I'd be grateful. I'm sure this journey will be long but I want to make it work so I'll need every piece of advice pertaining to this odd situation.

Thanks!"
1466,Am I In Hell?,"Idk where else to post this. I seriously feel like I'm in hell right now. Not saying this as a figure of speech. I mean actual hell, where you go when you die. I can't sleep, I can't feel my body, I feel this overwhelming oppressive vibe in the air. I feel so emotionally stunned and vacant. It feels as if this is my punishment."
1467,Is this a form of verbal abuse?,"My mom sometimes tells me that if she knew that I was going to be mentally ill, she would've aborted me. I'm so used to hearing it all these years that I never really though it was a form of abuse. Now that I think about it, I think it is."

1470,I’m finally starting meds,"This is the most reluctant thing I’ve ever done, but I’m tired guys. I’ve tried everything, been sober for so long I’ve lost count, I’ve stopped birth control, I spend time with friends, I work out, I’ve lost weight...I’m still struggling just the same as ever.

1471,"Feel lost, sad, lonely. I just don't know...","I guess I'm struggling with myself. I know I'm a good person, I help anyone and everyone without any questions but when it comes to getting help nothing. Nobody cares or seems to notice me or my struggles even when I don't hide anything, even when I say that I need help. While I know that I'm good I'm also human, I have my bad things. My demons. The anxiety, depression, sadness, the hole in my chest multiply my insecurities about myself. I honestly don't have anyone I can call a friend in my life so I guess I just wanted to express how I feel."
1472,"Anxious attachment style with a side of intrusive, insecure thoughts","How can I give myself the love and attention that I crave?

I don’t have a boyfriend, I don’t have a best friend, I live with parents who I’m constantly reminded of did not give the love and attention I wanted or needed growing up.

I spent a lot of time getting validation from boyfriends and teachers/professors. Those people felt like the kind of people that really knew me. They knew me at my neurotic points and at my genius points. Everyone else just gets a generalized glimpse, I feel underestimated all the time by other people and myself. I feel underestimated by my own family. That’s why I tried to distinguish myself, try and search for some badge of success so I can finally prove to my parents and the rest of the world that I am worthy enough to be loved and valued.

But now I feel hopeless.

I am the fattest I’ve ever felt, the ugliest I’ve ever felt, the stupidest I’ve ever felt (see that probably wasn’t even grammatically correct and I’m an English major so I can’t even write right), the loneliest I’ve ever felt, the saddest, the most bitter, the most out of control in terms of thinking and feeling this utter disappointment with myself and of life.

For days I’ve had this crippling feeling. I’m going to see a therapist but how do I at least temporarily stop this incessant harassment my brain is committing against me?

I see all the advice to practice mindfulness but I’m too consumed with wanting to just feel validated. Wanting someone to tell me the things I say aren’t stupid and that I should keep saying things, that the way I look is actually beautiful, that I’m not fat and that the images of women I’m comparing myself to are unrealistic and toxic, and that any guy with a heart could love me and find me beautiful without leaving me for someone much hotter or cooler, that my writing is good enough to be read, that I’m good enough to be heard, that I don’t have to see myself living alone in a cloistered cave because I’m a leper, that I’m good enough for people to want to approach me and want to be my friend or lover or just have a nice chat with. 

I just want the world to feel like a place where I’m wanted. Because it feels like a place where I don’t belong. Every moment of not belonging is torturous. I play videos of famous strangers I admire and I hear them talk and I feel like I belong for a moment, but the place I belong is a vacuum, or somewhere imaginary. 

I feel a greater sense of belonging from writers that are dead than by my family and friends trying to comfort me. Why? Why can I just practice mindfulness and be kind and happy?

Why do I just want to isolate, pray that like Salinger the world will want to come to me, that I’ll finally be the kind of person that is wanted by other people, rather than the person that works their ass off trying to belong to people that ultimately just reject me. 

I am confident enough to live independently of humans but I lack the confidence required to participate in interrelationships. I resent people because they do not appreciate me but I also want to hurt myself for not being good enough to be appreciated. I want to be alone so I don’t have to compare, so I don’t have to hear all the hurtful (unintentionally too) remarks that people make that crush my self esteem."
1473,I cant deal with not having anyone from my family care about my accomplishments,"My parents divorced when I was little. My father has another daughter (10y older) but he was never present to any of us. If I really need help, he would help me but he was never a paternal figure. He got a third family and thats the only family he behaves like a father. All my grandparents died around the same time, when my parents divorced, so I had to grow up with just my mother. My mother is the kind of person that never grew up. She lived with her parents until they died and even today she still behaves like a 14yo brat, narcisistic, needy and demanding. Growing up with just her was terrible. I wasnt allowed to have any friends or to ever leave the house. She was my best friend and the only one I needed. When I started university, things got worse. She would drive me and pick me up from univ. and when I didnt have classes she would lock me up inside the house with no internet, no phone and no money to make sure I couldnt talk with anyone. Even while locked at home, she would call me 10times per day to make sure I didnt leave in her back. I was in deep depression my whole life but still managed to have good grades. On my last year of univ I met a guy online, he lived 400km away. 4 months later I went to move in with him, got a copy of the house keys, he paid me the train ticket and I left and never looked back. My mother went to work and when she returned, i was gone. The first 2years my mother hated my now fiance because he ""stole me"". After moving in with him, I finished my masters degree in engineering (that I paid for), my mental health improved, got a good job in my field of studies, got recently accepted in an intensive networking bootcamp (got cherry picked between 1800 european candidates) and got to the 2nd stage of interviews at my dream job. Both my parents know this but act like I just told them Im going to the Supermarket. Nothing I do will ever be enough and I'm so proud of everything I accomplished. This makes me sad."
1474,Mental issues + bf vs. Mom,"Life story/back story.
Raised by my mom {who also had traumatic life (ex. lost daughter, raped on daughters grave, raised her brothers) and serious mental issues}. She was 50% super mom and 50% drug addict. 
Super mom: She always played with me. I received love and affection, always bought me whatever I wanted when she had $. Took care of us when I became a teen mom, etc. I was always fully supported by her. 
 Drug addict: age 10 and younger i would be toted to drug houses for hours, if not all night. left alone at home through night(s) starting at age 11. I'd turn all the lights on and hug my dog till I passed out. She missed some birthdays and holidays due to disappearing thru night. She'd cry &amp; have me check her breathing every time she came home. I got used to being her emotional crutch. I never stopped loving her and telling her it was all ok.
 She can go from loving/sweet and buying us things to screaming/violent in a second if you say anything negative or dont validate her actions. It wasnt always so extreme but u never knew when it would be. Unpredictable. Scary.
The rest of my family always seemed to look the other way regarding all of her pains and behaviors. 
Over time I had become her parent and she was the child that I'd calm down, care for, pick up from crack houses.
I now have an apartment of my own. Raising my 7yr old. Over the past 4yrs I've had a BF who doesn't understand why I still care for my mom and he says she hinders our relationship cuz when she doesnt get her way, she comes screaming at me and I'm like a crying obedient puppy that just wants to calm her. I explained, although not healthy, the reason I try to always calm her is cuz I'm afraid she'll get violent with us or hurt herself. He's like ""let her try to hurt you and I'll hurt her... and who cares if she hurts herself."" I care. He says since I grew up caring for her, I feel responsible for everyone and everything that goes wrong is my fault. I know its dumb but I do feel that way. 

He also convinced me tell my family 3yrs ago that, as a child, I was molested by a family friend. I told them. They were shocked, in disbelief, questioning me. He was angry that they weren't angry and he yelled at them. They got angry at him. They still hang out with the guy that molested me. My mom says ""I dont do it much."" Cuz that makes it better -_-

My bf grew up in a normal family. Very black and white. No gray area. He doesnt understand why I cant just cut people put that I love that are toxic to me. He's also impulsive and a bit childish in his reasoning sometimes. 

Recently she moved an hr away. I did actually tell her that I'm tired of being her emotional crutch (dont want my child to turn into it as well) and I'm afraid of upsetting her and her becoming violent- she screamed at me and so did my grandmother after that- but she seems to have actually acknowledged what I said and Maybe tried to change 🤷‍♀️ haven't been around her much since she moved. 
I still dont like the way they treat me when I speak about anything negative I went through growing up. They say I'm fishing for sympathy, exaggerating things and ""playing the victim card."" So now I feel guilty any time I even discuss this stuff w/ a close friend. They make me feel like anything I went thru was nothing compared to their pain and I should be grateful. I dont mean to be ungrateful and I swear I'm not looking for sympathy. I just want solutions or suggestions. 
My bf moved out and said he couldn't handle it anymore. He says I have to choose between her or him. Thoughts?"
1475,Should I stay in my relationship?,"Hello everyone, i have just discovered this subreddit and I want to introduce myself first. I hope that you will read all thssi because i really don't know what to do anymore. Also I am not a native english speaker I am sorry.

I am female, 21 yrs old and I have been struggling with this topic for a while now:

I have been in a few complicated relationships by now (three since 2015). The first one was really toxic and abusive (from both sides) and I was very glad when I was finally strong enough to end it. We were together about two years. (Oct 2014 - Jan 2017)

Only a month after we broke up, I met my new boyfriend. I was super in love and very happy with him but during the relationship, my mental constitution got worse rapidly. Then, from one day to another, he told me he could not be with me anymore (after 9 months, Feb 2017 - Nov 2017)

I was completely devastated and deeply depressed. I went to a mental health hospital and I found out that I had MDD and most probably BPD. I was in therapy for 2 years and it helped a lot but I am not sure if it was enough.

Shortly before I went there I met my new boyfriend (you already see, I rushed from one relationship to another). I already felt that we were not supposed to be together after two weeks but I could not break up with him bc I have severe seperation issues. We were together for one and a half year and I cheated on him twice. The relationship was very unhealthy,  the final break up hurt both of us a lot, and I have been feeling very guilty ever since. (Mar 2018 - Nov 2019)

Since January 2020 I am with my current boyfriend. He was the first on i cheated with on my ex boyfriend. There was something between us since the first day I met him. However, I don't feel certain about our relationship  anymore in the last 1-2 months. I feel very distant to him and I don't feel safe when he touches me. I am supposed to move to a nearby city next week. 

Do you have any advice for me? I am scared of breaking up but I don't want to ruin my mental health any further. Don't be afraid of asking questions"
1476,My guilt i immeasurable.,"Yesterday my father passed away suddenly from heart failure. I don’t really know how to feel. I haven’t really “cried “ cried since it happened. He lives in a different state and we were not very close since he was kind of a closed minded person. But he always supported me and I loved him for that despite my dislike for him. We had just started talking again and I had JUST began to start opening up to him.. and then this happened.. my sister is acting like I shouldn’t even care because we barley talk but I feel so much guilt inside of me for not talking to him. I feel like I don’t deserve to be sad. I know I was his “pride and joy” that’s what he would always say when he introduced me to someone and all of my family is telling me that when I call them but I feel like I do not even deserve to speak to my family or see my dad one last time. My heart is broken but I don’t know how, I don’t know if this feeling is grief or guilt and I’m terrified to face my family and myself, and my dad. I’m only 17, I just opened my first little business and I was so ready to tell him.. but he had to go and be selfish and not tell anyone he was diagnosed with heart failure 3 days ago. Right after I heard I cried for about 15 minutes and my roommate te took me out shopping to stop thinking about it because I didn’t want to. Every time she left for a moment I could feel this pain come over my body and I felt like a horrible person for doing this right after I heard that my father passed away. When I got home I put in the last episode of the midnight gospel and cried.This is my first big loss, and I do not know how to handle it.my guilt is mixed with grief and fear knowing I will be seeing my dad for the last time, and will never be able to speak to him again. We have only called once or twice in the past 3 years. The last thing ever talked to him about was some articles on where I came from.. I don’t know how to cope."
1477,Thinking of my loneliness makes me tired.,"I've felt like the odd one out for as long as I can remember. In school, in college, in my gap year working. And the worst part is how this has wrecked my relationships. I tried and tried but everywhere I went I found so few people who shared the same values or interests. And here's the thing, I'm not willing to tolerate bullshit from either other people or myself. The few times I tried overlooking bullshit, I ended up getting caught in it and dealing with the pain for months. 

I know I have social anxiety and I know I can be pretty hard on myself. I know I find it really hard to trust anyone after the amount of disappointment I've felt in my life. What I don't know is how to end this. I think I've never *wanted* to be the lone dude; I've just never found people I clicked with for long. Old friends grew apart. New people just don't seem interested. 

The better days are the days on which I go ""fuck this"" and just own how sad and alone I am. Because it is better to be alone than to waste energy on people who don't reciprocate. It isn't that I'm *happy* on those days; it's just that I'm *less* miserable.

yeah, I know I'm going to feel a shit load of anxiety once I finish posting this. 

Would be so nice if people who have gotten out of a similar slump could talk about how they did it. Is it just a matter of waiting for luck to miraculously change?"
1478,Leaving a toxic person,"How do you leave a toxic friend, when they didn’t do anything wrong like lying or betrayal but you know that they are toxic and really bad for your mental health. Everyone keeps telling me I’m being dramatic but I honestly feel like everytime we meet my mental state just becomes worse. I honestly don’t want to explain myself to him or anyone else but also it feels bad to just break a friendship out of nowhere."
1479,I Think That I'm Going Through A Quarter-Life Crisis (19M),
1480,"If you think about ending it all, think about all the future happiness you are throwing away for a ""today's problem"". Everytime I have a crisis, I think about all the small good things and happiness I had the chance to experience because I decided I wanted to live a bit longer. Living is worth it !!",How I keep beating my depression. Problems come and go. Happiness is worth the effort.
1481,What just happened?,"I was back from a birthday party, i have some things going on in life that are making me pretty nervous and i am generally often very nervous.

I was making my bag for school and i don't find a sheet of paper. Really mild inconvenience, except my heart starts to race at a hundred miles per hour, my head gets hot and i get incredibly nervous, shortly after i break on the ground sobbing and crying. At this point i don't even know what is going on because i legitimately do not know what I'm crying.

My mom comes into the room, asks why im crying, i answer ""i legitimately don't fucking know"" and i start to laugh uncontrollably because the situation is so surreal i guess? My mom looks at me worried as she should. 

I'm fine now but...


Now, what was that? A panic attack? A panic attack because of what?? I don't know what happened."
1482,my (20) mind is going 100mph and i'm just waiting to crash,"recently, i've just been so overwhelmed, like my mind is going 100mph and im not in control. despite the fact my sleep pattern has been amazing recently... i am constantly overthinking, creating fake scenarios, which then makes me sad. the littlest things that don't normally annoy me, are starting to affect me. and even when nothing is on my mind, i feel like im still not at peace.

i don't think i'm depressed at the moment either, but I'm also not happy. i just don't know what makes me, me anymore, it's as if i don't know who i am anymore. i have no clue where i want to go or do in the future.

i feel like i'm about to relapse really hard and i'm not sure how to stop it."
1483,My gf feels suicidal and idk how to help her.,"There is a lott of stuff going on, me and my gf (16each) are in a long distance and haven't met in moths cuz of this lockdown. She has an sorta abusive mother and stuff in her house isn't going so well, she told me that all this is too overwhelming and she wants to kill herself.  Idk how can i help her.Please tell me what to do."
1484,Im empty inside and I don’t know what to do,I just have a complete emptyness inside me. Not like a hole in your chest or sadness or something just nothing.

1485,Doubtful,[removed]
1486,I have issues.I'm not sane.,"This could be a long post as I just want to get some thing out of my chest and I don't know how much I'll actually remember right now.

I was thinking about myself.About my life,why do I even exist? I don't even know what I'm doing.

I was recently diagnosed with OCD and I'm also bipolar.Thing is,I don't even care anymore?Thinking back,I might have been mentally I'll since I was a child,the earliest thing that comes to my mind is my grandpa dying and I didn't even feel anything.

I'm just numb.My parents are assholes,I'm sick in every aspect,I may even be a psychopath!!! How else would I enjoy seeing others being sad?

I feel like I just exist in a void,watching the days and the weeks go by.Don't have the courage to commit suicide.

I've gone to therapy and I had to spend days in the mental hospital,which did basically nothing,because I can't be fixed.

I'm sick in the head,and I don't know the cure,maybe I don't even care.

Who knows,maybe I'm actually okay and I'm just pretending to be insane.I just don't feel anything anymore."
1487,How to be happy woth myself,"Lately i have noticed that i always want to have always want to be the one in power.

1489,Anxiety Relaxation Advice Needed,"Hello,

I'm looking for some good, quick ways to relax. I have dealt with anxiety my entire life. I take a mild daily medication for anxiety and it helps, but I still struggle with it. I have a busy work and home live and I find it difficult to find time to meditate or relax. My most relaxing times are when I have 30 minutes to watch a documentary or something like that.

1490,Loud sounds cause me to panic. What should I do?,"Like the title says, loud sound make me feel panicky and cause attacks if it persists. For example: sudden loud noises (like a pan falling) cause me to feel shaky and anxious, loud music and people talking loudly/over each other builds up an anxiety feeling and I eventually have an attack. This even happens if someone is making mouth noises when eating. My dad doesn’t believe in mental health problems. And my mom doesn’t think doctors help. I don’t know what I should do. What does this sound like?"
1491,There’s really nothing anyone can say. Just nervous about my first day back serving since covid while just being diagnosed with epilepsy last week.,"I’m so nervous that I will have a seizure at work, on our cement floors, fall and hit my head on our cement tables. Ugh. I’m afraid I won’t remember anything about my job or the ingredients of anything. My seizures (if not all?) really effect my memory. Ugh. Just stressed out and stress can trigger a seizure. Not that epilepsy is that uncommon or that crazy in most cases, I just have general anxiety and it just makes everything a little harder than normal to handle."
1492,Overwhelming regrets?,"Hi everyone. 

I'm trying to feel less alone in my struggle against the emotion of regret. I am glad I have a strong conscience but I sometimes can't keep my regrets out of my mind, they make me feel really bad about myself and they actually stop me from improving. 

I tend to regret two types of things: 1) things I have done which are bad and 2) things I have done which are irrational. I'll give some examples so you can gauge how bad the things actually are that are causing me to feel so terrible. 

These are some things I regret on a day to day basis atm. I've indicated whether I feel each one of the things I did was bad OR irrational: 

1. Not having been a good enough owner of my rabbit, who died two years ago, because I didn't always give him very much attention. (MORALLY BAD)
2. Doing things which in hindsight were quite covid-risky six months ago. I don't mean I was breaking lockdown to go to parties, its more that I continued to do legal but ish-risky things like shopping, right up till my government banned them. (IRRATIONAL)
3. Making plausibly sound financial decisions some time ago about how to spend savings money, but half-assing the decision making process and not really bothering to check whether I did the best thing with the money. (IRRATIONAL). 
4. Freezing up and being entirely unhelpful two years ago when a friend confessed to me they had been sexually assaulted (MORALLY BAD).

&amp;#x200B;

My impression with these things is that I've correctly identified them as either bad or irrational but that they are still probably emotionally bothering me more than is normal. As well as that, I am having a lot of the ""this makes you a bad/stupid person"" thoughts rather than any thoughts about how not to do these sorts of things again. 

Is my impression that I am feeling regret too strongly right? Does this excessive regret seem to fit in with any mental health condition- I've never heard of it as a symptom of a disorder? What can I do about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks sm in advance."
1493,Fantastic Fungi Documentary,"Last night I saw the Fantastic Fungi documentary available in AppleTV+.

Besides having amazing footage that makes the documentary worth by itself, it presents some very interesting information about fungi and hallucinogenic mushrooms overall.

Has anyone tried alternative (in a controlled environment / accredited clinical study) treatment for depression / anxiety such as mushrooms, LSD, etc.?

How good / bad was the result?"

1495,Survey - Making an app to help people experiencing mental health issues!,"Hi all. i personally have really bad anxiety and depression.

 i'm currently studying UIUX and i decided to develop an app that can provide better care and counseling for people who are struggling with these issues. my goal is to make an app that can provide a platform for people to express their thoughts and the option to talk to licensed therapists without the insane waiting times or expensive prices. 

at the moment it is still in research stage! but if you can help fill this survey it would be very helpful. i take this project to heart and i hope you do to! the more information i have the better i can provide a place for all of us :)

1499,When depression makes you a “bad friend”,"I struggled with where to post this.. I often lurk on reddit but never post.

I feel like there’s no one in my life right now who can understand this phenomenon or painful experience so I turned to reddit. 

I have CPTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Panic Disorder. I’m also a very high functioning person. I’m a licensed social worker/therapist in the public school system. And a damn good one. I’ve been in therapy and on medications for the last 3 years and they help IMMENSELY. There are periods in my life when I really struggle and then there are periods where I don’t. Right now, since Spring 2020, I’ve been in a deep depression phase. It’s certainly one of the longer lasting and hardest one I’ve ever felt. Not only because of Covid and world events, but personally this has been an extremely hard year filled with loss. 

I have been upfront with my partner and my best friend for months - telling them that I just don’t have the usual capacity to hold space for them like I usually do, because of my depression and other life factors happening at the moment. Apologizing in advance saying “I can’t be the friend that you deserve right now; I’m sorry I don’t have the emotional capacity to be who you need right now.” Each time, my friends reassuring me that it’s ok and they support me. Of course when they come to me with problems I help. I do my best, I don’t tell them to fuck off because I’m drained and emotionally/mentally paralyzed. 
Today I got a long text from my best friend saying that she knows I have “complicating factors” but she feels like I don’t appreciate her or have concern for her and basically described how she treats me “the best” and in return she gets “the worst” treatment. Obviously this upset me because 1) I already feel like shit and hate myself right now. Now apparently my mental illness makes me a shitty friend, too. 2) kind of fucking pissed actually because I feel like I have been mustering up all the energy I can to be there for her; and on several occasions on my own have apologized because I know I have nothing left to give right now and it’s unfair for her. It feels like she’s acting as if I’ve never acknowledged it and That I’m choosing to be a shitty friend to her and take advantage of her. I know I’m hard to be around this year. It’s hard for me to even be in my own body.
I feel powerless and my self-esteem is even lower. One of my fears that often comes up in therapy is that I’m afraid I’m “too much” and if people really knew the depths of my mental illnesses they would leave (yes I do have an attachment disorder and abandonment trauma). It seems that I now have evidence that my fears are true, not just my depression/anxiety talking to me. 

Any relatable experiences or advice is welcome."
1500,What does akathisia feel like? So confused on why being prescribed meds that cause it when I already have a SEVERE anxiety disorder,"My doctor has me now wanting to try these newer akathisia. My main issue my whole life has been SEVERE ANXIETY and obsessive thoughts (bad tunnel vision). I'm really confused cause I've not been given a Bipolar diagnosis. Its just been 15 years of severe anxiety, obsessiveness, and a racing mind. I'd say moderate depression... 

Well I was given a bunch of samples to try especially the new ones (Latuda, Rexulti, Vraylar). My psychiatrist said start low as I wanted and build up. Said I could even cut in half the dose. So I tried Latuda (hopeful because it causes the least weight gain, *meds that work but make me gain weight are pointless as they cause just more depression) and I felt this jitteriness within an hour. Thats when I went to google mode and see a ton of these class of meds (AP's) cause akathisa. I read somewhere its present in up to 45% of people who take AP's. 

My diagnosis is clear cut a lot deeper than just the severe GAD. But the trademark of my life is ANXIETY. So I'm so lost at why Im taking drugs that cause ""even more"" anxious, jittery, restlessness...

Sorry this went from a question to a vent... just feels hopeless and that these psych's are literally just playing guess and check. Been over a year of this and I'm just tired."
1501,I should be happy...but???,"I feel nothing.  
Not happy. Not sad. Not angry. Not restless.   
Just went to the store with hubby and our youngest child (who is 10)...and all the while we were there, I seemed happy and normal.  
I was not. Intrusive thoughts (about a certain something) are getting worse. I am on the verge of just lashing out and saying FUCK IT ALL...but the rational part of me, which is quiet and almost inaudible, but still there, is yelling at me to not be stupid and that I can't do that to my family again. I will go back to prison, and I know it.

Should I just fucking off myself now? That would also cause irreparable damage to my family...probably worse than going back to prison. At least there, they would be able to see me (somehow).  
I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place and hell...I don't know what to do with myself, I don't know which way to go, I don't even know how to FEEL right now.  
If someone reads this, can you just please tell me how I can get out of this danged deep hole in which I find myself trapped?  
Can someone throw me a rope or a ladder, please?   
Help."
1502,Does anyone else have problems making eye contact or feel pain when making eye contact?,"My parents are always asking me why I don't make eye contact when theyre getting on me. Thing is, and I've told them many times, that i'm either anxious or dissociating and making eye contact is literally too painful. I start panicking and scratching and it just gets worse from there.

Does anyone else experience this (pain when making eye contact)?"
1503,Counseling and therapy?,"Does anyone know if theres any free online therapy in the US, or are they all paid? I've been looking for awhile, but I haven't found any."
1504,Am I In The Wrong?,"My brother said tomorrow we would go back &amp; get my stuff I forgot at someone's place. But today is the day, and because I didn't wake up when he woke up, now he's not going and he doesn't feel like going. I started crying and was upset, and blamed him for not following through with what he said he would do for me, I called him incredibly selfish, &amp; he called me childish, and said he could lose his shit more at me but I should be lucky he isn't. I don't understand why everyone in my life is toxic and cruel, and I am starting to have very little options left to be here. Why am I suffering?"

1506,My family thinks I’m lying and tells me to snap out of it... How can I explain?,"I’ve been actively seeking treatment for years when my fathers answer has always been to “man up”. Recently I had a rehab lined up in Utah but they stopped me, since then I’ve been dealing with awful nightmares, anxiety, fatigue, rage, hopelessness and whatever else that comes from PTSD/Depression. They say if I don’t “snap out of this” and act happier they’re gonna send me to a hospital instead of a treatment center. How can I get them to understand my pain?"

1510,How to deal with Work Anxiety?,"I feel anxious and stressed everyday, during work, before and after. I can't enjoy weekends because I just feel like I'm dreading going to work, and zoom meetings make me feel sick. I don't even have a particularly big workload, I'm just constantly feeling this way. 

Any tips of dealing with work anxiety?"
1511,"Everything looks like a face/person, why?","Everything has been looking like a face not the normal stuff where there’s 2 circles for eyes and a triangle/square for a mouth found in everyday situations, It feels like everything’s looking at me all the time when I’m going on walks and walking past everything I mistake them all for living standing people especially things like polls or flowers and even after I look around and see they’re inanimate objects my brain still sees them as faces and thinks they’re starring, like I know they’re not people and can look and see they’re flowers but I still comprehend them as a face looking. I looked it up on google but I didn’t find anything about it, does this happen to anybody else and does anyone know why? Either way thank you for reading, Have a great day sorry!"
1512,Mom called me a psycho (M17),"I recently made a post on my reddit to see what advice people had for me because I happened to be relapsing into self harm and I don’t want that to happen. So basically I just wanted to know what people did to avoid getting back into it again. 

But I soon realize on my own that the only real way to feel better for myself is to meet a mental health professional. I tried doing this once already with my dad but he said that he wanted me to face the issue and overcome it on my own when I was suicidal. 

So I thought maybe I should show my mom my post and see what she thinks (she doesn’t know it’s me). She read through the post half way and said that whoever this person is, is a psycho. I’m glad you aren’t doing this. What really stuck to me was that she indirectly called me a psycho and how much she really doesn’t know me or what’s going on in my life. 

I guess it just goes to show that some parents wouldn’t understand mental health no matter how you present it to them. I’ve tried talking to my parents a couple times about going and seeing a professional but they just keep coming back with the same argument that we can deal with it together when I’m reality I need a professional to help me better understand my feelings. 

Can someone tell me how I can actually get my parents to take me to a professional because I hate feeling this way. And tbh my self harm can get out of hand and I can get addicted to it. I really don’t want to do anything can help."

1514,Could you please tell me something nice? I'd really want to end it rn,"I don't want to die, I wouldn't do this to my mom, but it's unbearable. I'm dragging myself since days with this weight on my chest and it doesn't go away. There's no one who I can talk to. I thought I could reach a friend, but she's the reason why I feel worse now.

I've tried three times when I was younger. I've been hospitalized. I'm on meds. 

In moments like this, the thought to be dead and how to do it is so vivid that's like I can touch it. It wakes me at night, punches me on the stomach during the day, and my head hurts like it has already crashed to the ground.

I won't do it, but I don't know how to survive the pain now. I swear I'm doing things to be occupied, but it doesn't help, the moment I stop just to take a breath it's like I'm suffocating. 

I think I'll go to drink, hoping I'll stop feeling for a little."

But anyway, recently I've just been like, so exhausted from it, it's like I can't handle it anymore and I'm not even paying attention to it because I'm so burn out from doing it.

I definitely overthink and breakdown and bla bla bla, but it's like, I have no energy for it anymore and it's just draining me more than ever before. And I'm just like at this point it's just so annoying and I don't want to give it my time and energy anymore"

I’m the nicest person to anyone I meet. I’m just sick of feeling empty. I used to smoke (weed) and it helped but It was getting in the way of my life so I stopped a while ago.

1522,"someone help me, please","i need help. i started losing weight back in june and i’d say overall I’ve lost about 10 pounds. (f17, 5”3, 132lb) I started by dropping to about 1000-1200 calories a day which worked till about july until i quit for a few weeks bc i felt like total shit. i’m now averaging at about 1600 calories a day but my mind is spiralling. im staring to get intrusive thoughts about whatever i eat and i feel like i’m obsessing over every bite i put in my mouth. i’ve got this stupid notes page in my phone where i’ve tracked every single thing i’ve eaten since since june. i hate it but i can’t let myself skip a day. it’s like there’s a voice in my head telling me i’ll gain weight if i don’t have total knowledge and control over what i’ve eaten. even when i quit at 1200 i still tracked what i ate. I feel so much guilt and shame if i eat what i consider to be too much. my biggest thing right now is when a meal comes out to be more than 400 calories i’ll beat myself up over it so bad. I feel worse now that schools started up again. My friends have no idea bc i count everything i take to school beforehand but i physically cannot let it be over 400 calories. i don’t know why. i want it stop. i just want to be able to eat what i want without thinking of the nutrition info. i think about calories and food constantly. it’s draining. Im not thin enough for it to be an eating disorder but im so tired of feeling obsessive over everything i fucking eat. it doesn’t matter what i eat it’s like as soon as i go to bed my brain starts evaluating everything i ate that day and how i could have eaten better. i need help, please"

1524,Are they trying to keep track on what i do on my social media?,"Since high school and today I had very toxic friend groups they will always gaslight me thinking I'm dramatic and gang up on me when i call them out. It's even worse when I stood up for myself and they tell me in a way of I'm wrong for sticking up to myself and it's sad because they were the every people who tell me to stick up for myself. They spread horrible lies about me call me superficial even though I know damn well I'm not a fake person and would never talk behind their backs and they did this because I found out they were talking about me behind  my back because some of their friends told me and instead of them owning up to it they tell me that I'm the one talking bad about them they called me person who likes drama and try to manipulate me into thinking that but I just walked away in the end and they still keep talking about me to other people till this day. 

I have deleted my Facebook and instagram six months ago to focus on college and to drown out what's happening. Now I re made Facebook and instagram all set to private where nobody can see what I'm posting I'm feelings much better. I graduate next semester and will be moving out of state. But one thing i notice old friends and their friends who they talked behind my back started requesting me on both social media and i decline but their other friends tried requesting both accounts and i feel like my old friends are telling their friends to follow me to keep track of my life. I don't really post because I'm busy but I do get request from their friends following me even though i never talked to them or hangout. I don't know if I'm over thinking it or they're actually trying to keep track of me because i stood up for myself and walked away from the toxic friendships."

I held her tight and told her she'll be alright, I've never seen her so helpless and I did my best to call her down. I called her parents, she calmed down a little and they decided to take her to the hospital. After they left she hugged me for few more minutes and was okay. We went to the hospital and they gave her a shot and now she's on her way home to get rest... My god was this stressful...."
1526,Do I have an ED?,"
I’m not certain if I struggle with an eating disorder or not. I haven’t been diagnosed with it, and I’m not underweight (as far as I know). But I actively count calories, and if someone would present me with a piece of cake to eat, I would get high levels of anxiety. I measure my body using my hands, and I frequently take pictures of myself, to check if I think I’ve gotten bigger. If there is a day were I’ve felt that I ate too much, I tend to compensate (or at least try) for it by eating less the following day. Since I’m not underweight (and since I’m male), I don’t think anybody notices how I’m struggling with food. Because, even though I might not have an eating disorder, I definitely feel that my relationship with food isn’t as normal as it used to be a couple of years ago. I’ve started to chew candies and/or sweets and then spitting them out in the bin, because I don’t want to consume it all. I only do this when I know nobody can see me, and only with certain types of food/sweets. I don’t want to tell my parents about my struggle with this, since I already struggle a lot with my mental health. They’ve been trough too much as it is. I don’t want to make their burden even greater."

1528,Any (daily) tips to deal with stress and anxiety when you can't afford therapy?,"I am in my last year of university in a field that I like less and less the more I study. My anxiety has been getting worse lately precisely because it is my last year and I am supposed to get out into the world once I'm done with my degree. I am so scared to not be able to find a job that I like, as I've discovered my mental health has been getting exponentially worse when doing something I don't like. I don't even know how I got to this point honestly and now I feel like I am the only one who doesn't fit in this field while everyone else is doing great and has plans for the future. 

Now the thing is, I've been making some plans myself lately. Because I want to get better and I want to find what's right for me. But the moment I try and apply for an internship I'd love, my anxiety gets to me and I feel like I'd be useless and I wouldn't make the cut. Not mentioning the fact that usually what I want to do doesn't exactly fit my degree. So I lose all motivation and get very negative. It's eating at me and I'm getting very sad and even whiny (which I hate). I also cry very easily and I can't stand feeling choked up everytime my anxiety shows up anymore. 

I've never been to see a therapist. Mainly because I always felt like I should be able to get better on my own. Also because I didn't want my parents to worry. My mental health isn't at its lowest right now, but my anxiety is at its strongest. And I'd like to take care of it before it gets worse and before it prevents me from doing something with my life. Sadly, therapy is very expensive here (France) so it's not really an option (although I'm considering going to my university's therapist but honeslty I wouldn't even really know how to go about that as I've never seen one before.)

So here I go. I know there is no magic answer and anxiety can't be cured but. Would anyone know of any tip to help cope with it? Maybe something I could do everyday when waking up or going to bed... Maybe something I could read or listen to. There's too much of everything on the internet I feel lost.

What has helped **YOU** cope with anxiety? Is there anything you do/tell yourself everyday? Maybe a ritual of sorts to feel better?  Or an app/website to keep track of your anxiety to help better understand it? 

Also, if anyone is going through the same thing as me, I'd love to talk for a bit. It would help me to feel less alone and maybe you too :)"
1529,Is there a psychological disorder where people cannot accept criticism when first confronted but upon reflection of their actions later they can genuinely feel sorry?,"And I mean going to EXTREME EXTREME lengths to avoid the idea in their mind and showing extreme lack of empathy for the person that is confronting them and how it is making them feel? When the relationship between the two people is certainly one where emotions should be felt and understood empathically by both parties. Narcissistic traits? I know the person is not a full blown narcissist, are there certain situations where traits can be amplified and brought out? They CAN genuinely feel sorry for how they’ve treated you, but may repeat the behavior later. 

I’ve known a few people like this in my life and I have been wondering if these are symptoms of a documented mental disorder."

1536,my friend is not eating properly and I don't know if telling a teacher is a good idea or how to help her in general,"Hello, 

first of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, please link me the right subreddit if that's the case.
second of all, I'm sorry for bad english, it's not my first language.

a classmate who's one of my closest friends is struggeling with eating, she told me how many calories she eats and it's really really concerning, she's also lost a lot of weight in a very short time and I'm extremely worried because it doesn't seem like she's going to stop any time soon.
It all started maybe two months ago or even less, at first she told me she couldn't eat much because of all the stress going on in her life (a breakup, fights with family, ...) and I obviously believed her since she was going through a lot. But all of this calmed down a lot and she's still talking about how she's losing weight and how much sports she's doing and all that and by now I'm sure she's doing it on purpose. The way she tracks her calories and all are obviously not on accident.
I am really concerned because her weight was normal at the beginning and she might be underweight now (not sure but definitely borderline)
I know teachers often make things worse, but I really trust the one I am thinking of talking to. (he's a big support to me and helped me with coming out as trans to my class and is overall very sweet and protective of his students)
I would not talk to any other teacher. Her parents also kinda know, but I'm 100% certain they don't know how bad it has gotten (they only know she hasn't been that hungry lately)
I feel like if I tell the teacher I'll betray her because she trusts me with this, but I really don't know what else to do. I can't just go to her parents, they are terrible people and they'd probably just send her to the hospital without any explanation or something like that ughh
I am so worried and I don't know how to support her without supporting that behavior. I myself am mentally ill (DID and MDD) and I've been to a psychiatry before so I'm not completely inexperienced when it comes to this sort of stuff, but I'm still overwhelmed with how to help her. I'm scared that if I don't do anything it will get even worse. She mentioned that she's not even getting her period properly anymore. 
What can I do? One of my friends I met in the psychiatry was servery anorexic and almost died from it and I'm so scared she'll end up that way. I just want her to be happy because she deserves it more than anyone. 
Any advice please :("
1537,19M severe trust issues,"How do I trust people again? I don't think I can anymore. Everyone I let into my heart has stomped on me. The last person was someone I loved a lot we talked about so much and I thought she was someone I can truly talk to. But came these last few months where she turned her back on me. I put in so much effort and she said she'll put effort in but what can I say actions speak louder than words. I tried talking it out, I tried being a good person by giving them all the support and love I can give but that hasn't gotten me anywhere, I was told everything was lie, all the talks we had was a lie, all the experiences was a lie. And all I got was a sorry. Its really made me bitter and angry all I wanted was someone I can grow with, have fun with, and talk with. But now I don't think that's possible. She told me that it was my thinking process that I was too optimistic and unrealistic and that I was in lala land. That really messed me up but she taught me something no one matters but me, I cared about a lot about people but no more if this is what happens when you let someone in then I don't need anyone but me. So much pain for nothing. I think I'm done with people they aren't worth it anymore. I used to be happy despite all my issues I tried being my best me I tried being good and striving for things that were in reach. But after all this I feel empty I stopped caring. Is there any hope? Should I give people a chance?

1542,Thanks for all of the inspiration,"Sorry if not allowed.

I’m going to be a psychiatrist in the near future but have recently been feeling a bit down after coming across an anti-psychiatry subreddit that is filled with people who think psychiatrists are evil and that their treatments don’t work. After reading lots of the success stories on here it has reinvigorated my drive to specialise in psychiatry. To see the difference that psychiatric treatment can make to so many people is profoundly breathtaking. 

You are all so inspiring and strong and I wish you nothing but the best for you life. I hope one day I will be worthy to help people in your positions."

1545,j=Just gave the best performance of my life [rant],"Been locked up in my room now for nearly a week struggling with some anxiety mixed with depression all fueled by untreated ADHD.  I'm not medicated for anything and doubt I would stick to it long after a bad experience as an adolescent combined with having been the only one in my family to be able to keep medications sorted and administered to my late mother who passed of cancer earlier this year. most days I have been able to mange on my own but this last week has been extremely difficult. Nightmares starting as soon as I start to drift off into sleep that terrify me awake. Not the average (for me) being chased by an unseen terror in the dark. Its been the same thing night after night, a really violent attack that I come into midway and its me attacking myself in a really brutal way.  The nightmare is one thing, but having the same one on repeat anytime I manage to fall asleep for days on end has really taken its toll on my mental state. I've resorted to pretty much caging myself in my room. its put so much stress on my mind that I've completely lost my appetite. I don't even really snack at all. the though of eating just gives me stomach pains.  Tonight though, I had to make an appearance. Questions were being asked to other family members about me and the question of if I was even still alive even came up. I decided that today was the day. I came out and had someone go to the store for supplies. I was making chili. something I used to do pretty often was cook dinners so I thought maybe if I act like I was just really tired these past few days things will be fine. well I cooked and socialized on and off  which had the effect I was going for. The questions and wondering stopped. dressed in sweats so no one would notice the significant amount of weight I had dropped after not eating more than an apple or 2 for about 6 days. no one noticed. I even got some texts again from my sister as if everything was back to how it should be.

To be perfectly transparent Im not remotely close to the realms of okay and actively searching for a doctor that might be able to help. But this has been my life since May. Lying my way through the day to everyone about just about everything just to get through one day with no one asking if im okay. Im not. And I havent been for a long time even before my mother got her initial diagnosis 3 years ago. I have b=just been phoning it in and playing the ""with it"" guy since middle school and I think Im finally at my breaking point with it all."

Many people would probably see me as a productive person and desire my life. But I personally don't see any value in it. I manage to live my life so that most people never realise I even have a problem.  But inside, I'm completely empty and devoid of any joy. I feel unimportant even though I know there's people who love me. I feel like I fail at life and neither I nor anything I create is of any value. There's been better times but I also remember being at the same point a lot. I do make an effort to create a better life, try to love myself and value what I have.

1548,I (19F) am struggling with random attacks of bad feelings and anxiety,"So tiny back story. I've struggled with depression for about 3 years now, I'm on antidepressants but lately it feels like they haven't been working even if I've tried to higher the dosage (with my doctors approval). I'm 19, my boyfriend is 23 and lives in a different country. I'm moving to his country to live with him while I study in about 2 weeks and I'm super happy about it. I love this man and I am so excited to get to live with him and experience a new country (I've always wanted to move abroad).

My mental health however hasn't been great lately. I'm looking into getting therapy once I move there so I can get help with it but currently it's hard to deal with. I'm leaving my entire family and everything feels overwhelming. I can be happy and then randomly my mood drops and I get thoughts of not wanting to deal with anything , worrying about absolutely everything possible, ""what if it won't get better"", ""what if I can't deal with leaving my family"", ""what if.."" etc. I know things are most likely going to work out and that everything will start feeling better once I'm actually there but my stupid brain can't help but make me feel like this every single day, all the time.

Since I currently can't get therapy on such a short times notice in my own country I don't exactly know how to deal with these feelings, especially when it happens multiple times per day. My depression has flared up, I don't have energy, I have a harder time sleeping, I don't feel like doing anything at all.

Nothing has helped for an extended amount of time and I'm continuously finding new lows. I don't know how anyone can live with these constant heavy thoughts and I probably would have offed my self by now if I wasn't a coward and wasn't scared of death and the potential further punishment from the after life if any of our current day religions/beliefs are accurate.

I don't know where to go, who to talk to, or what to do in general. I don't want to live and pretty much refuse to accept what life has to offer. Yet I also am too scared to end my life as well. I'm pathetic and hate myself more than anything, yet I can't bring my self to rid myself. I'm tired of the crisis lines as I understand they try to calm a potentially critical situation to where people can move on from there and get proper help. However I've been through the ringer and none of the 'proper help' seems to help in any way and the messages themselves don't provide any comfort. They feel emotionless and sometimes condescending, I know its not their intention but that's how it feels to receive those texts.

Currently I'm undiagnosed with anything as my parents don't believe in mental health and I'm too broke (I think) to go and talk to a doctor or something. Although I'm not diagnosed, I am huge on mental health, am majoring in psychology, and overall decently informed (again, I think, I may be totally wrong), so I'm not just making things up for attention or whatever.

Currently I'm addicted to weed. I don't really have a problem with it, but the withdrawals can be pretty bad, for me anyways. I'm also pretty sure that I'm depressed, and I have a serious fear of dying alone. And I also show signs of having ADHD, and that makes doing homework right now super hard and I just struggle with any work.

Today I found out that I can't submit it because of a technicality, despite working so hard and despite having it completed and ready.

1557,I'm having an episode,"I'm not clinically diagnosed and I'm not self diagnosing. Ever since I've gone through puberty around age 10 up until now (I'm 19), I've had these moments of great sadness. There were a lot of triggering evens that most people could relate to, but the older I get, the more I realize I have problems ""bouncing back"". I notice I look for situations where I am uplifted in order to show my true personality and really let loose, but as soon as something negative would happen in my life, I let it destroy me completely. I'm talking hitting myself, pulling my hair, cutting, trying to jump out the car, and urges to commit suicide. I didn't have anyone to talk to about how I was really feeling deep down, nor was I given the knowledge of how to express to people what I was feeling. 

Growing up, I don't think I had a strong genuine connection with my family. I learned to people please because of how my family attitudes towards the world is, and treated like a glorified helper almost. ""Joti do this"" ""Joti do that"" and get whatever I wanted, but nobody was really \*talking\* to me. This is where my addiction to technology developed because at least online, I was recognized as somebody. I moved away with my mother to MD and that's where I felt most alive because I was meeting friends who were not treating me like their subordinate. I was learning new things about the world and finding my way, but my relationship with my mother was failing. She would become too upset with me over small things which is where my condition got worse. People began bullying me on things I couldn't control about myself and I didn't have siblings to confide in. I did not feel comfortable enough to talk to my mother about it because of our relationship, and I didn't want to bring such worry to any of my family members. I'm pretty sure my step father was doing something weird to me in my sleep because I remember waking up to him in my room one time. It was a very lonely time to be dealing with so much at once and have no one to talk to. This is where I began to get extremely depressed. I remember the days I would eat lunch by myself. I remember the days where people looked at me like I was disgusting. I remember having to hold back tears on the bus rides home every day because I felt like an outcast. I remember rushing to my room to just cry. This occurred ages 11-13.

I switched schools, found my group of friends, and things got better. I think we all got along so well because we were all broken. Life was pretty great for ages 13-14. But then I moved to Georgia to be around my mothers' toxic family. 

They're not all terrible people, but as a whole, they are. My grandmother is super critical of me, talks down to me and my mother like nobodys's business. She talked me down and influenced so much that I literally lost my identity. My wardrobe changed, the vision for my future changed to appease her ideal, and I was constantly made to feel like I was less than. My image was always up for discussion and I had really low self esteem during HS. She and my mother didn't get along and would argue all the time dragging me in. This is where I learned selflessness; I no longer existed anymore, I just wanted to protect them from each other. I had no real personality except for the fact I could do school. At this point I become very numb to what I am feeling on a daily basis, but on occassion I would burst with tears one I was alone with myself. 

I'm miserable and the thought of suicide hangs over my head. 

It's not like anyone really talks to me anyway."
1558,To whoever reads this or cares,"To be honest, brutally honest I don't think anyone cares about me, I'm cynical and don't depend on anyone because I feel like nobody cares about me and relying on someone will get me hurt. Tbh I'm not surprised nobody likes me, I'm an asshole, why would they. I may be a pussy, I may not have a terrible life I'm just not happy often I have spurts of happiness lasting 1 or 2 days but then it's back to seclusion and feeling like I'm nothing. I don't really knows who sees this, you probably don't care"
1559,"Being a suicidal ""survivor""","Feels exactly what it is. I haven't won anything or really gotten that much better. I've fucking survived. Twenty years of fucking hanging on to life. Surviving. My prize for living through a god damned nightmare for 21 years is more nightmare. When the fuck is this going to get better, exactly? So far it's just more of the same bs, again and again stretching out in front of me like a fucking field of wheat but instead of wheat there's just fucking rotten flesh and beartraps that I'm expected to fucking crawl through FUCK ME. The longer I live and the more people I talk to and socialize with the more I realize why I feel so fucking lonely and lost all the fucking time. If there was a scale of how mentally depressed a person can be I'm pretty sure I'm some sort of freak case where somehow by some fucking means I still live despite being so fucking tired of everything and everyone that any marginally more sane person would've done the fucking mentally healthy thing and just fucking made out with a shotgun. The only reason I'm even remotely functional is that my two ""personalities"" push and pull at each other, never letting me fully settle and reflect the pain in a healthy way. It's just depressed, rage, depressed, rage, sad, angry, suicidal, murderous on and on again like instead of complex emotions all my brain has is a switch that is either sad or angry and that's ALL I FUCKING GET. Literally the reason I'm still alive/haven't killed anyone yet is because of this cycle. I want to kill myself... No wait why should I die when this world gets to go on living its wretched existence, I'm actually going to fucking murder someone... now why bother, I'm so fucking tired and useless anyways  AND ON AND ON IT GOES IT NEVER FUCKING STOPS AND THEN THE fucking shrink goes ""well I'm not sure what to do about it"" PUT ME THE FUCK DOWN. ARE WE LITERALLY SO FUCKING OBSESSED WITH APPEARING HELPFUL that you can't just fucking RECOGNIZE that I'm a lost fucking cause and put me out of my misery properly. Are we so fucking obsessed with not losing a single life even though you COULDN'T GIVE TWO FLYING FUCKS when I wasn't threatening homicide/suicide? GOD I can already feel the fucking cold void of sadness wash over. In 10 minutes I'll be back to slumping over in a corner feeling pity on myself and then another 10 minutes later I'll be right back to fantasizing about exactly what sound a human skull would make when it is cast in the role of being the obstacle in a romance between a boot and a pavement and their repeated attempts to be reunited. Fuck this fucking shit WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE BETTER? I'm so fucking tired dragging this worthless piece of fucking shit meat sack around all day, pretending to give a fucking fuck about anything these worthless fucking cretins wants from me. FUCK ME I'm going to just stop typing I could literally go on for hours."

1561,Originally posted in r/anxiety regarding an odd episode I had.,
1562,My brother is a sociopath?,"Okay...  i tried posting a year ago on another profile. Whatever. 

For the last 15 years my brother has been in and out of prison. I believe he is bipolar, a social path, a narcissist, and who knows, maybe a psychopath. He will be held next spring from Prison. I know he is going to start harassing me and demanding I sent him money. He has threatened to murder me in the past, as well as my whole family. As for if he will do it…I know he has at least shot a man in the head before (15 years ago). 

He is a psycho. I wish society would be brwve enough to rid themselves of these unhelpable individuals.... but unfortunately.... ppl want to pretend everyone just need ‘better advice??’

Fuck everyone. My brother will murder ppl in the future. He has remorse. He is a waste of space. 

Just wondering if anyone had gotten through this situation before? Should I change my number? I’ve made sure he doesn’t know where i live...... but the fucking internet will pull up my address with my phone number."
1563,Is this more than depression?,[removed]
1564,Colors that swim and change,"I've had these symptoms forever, but I never really thought too much about it until my partner became an artist. 
When I look at colors, they change and fade. For example, I was looking at a pimple and I was for sure that it was green. However my fiance looked at it, assured me it was white, and when I looked again, it was white. 
Another example, I was sure that an outfit I love was pink. Again, my fiance and his friends assured me it was purple. I stared at it for a good five minutes, and then I was that it was purple.
This also happens if I look at a wide array of colors. I play this color fading game, where you try to arrange the colors from one hue to another. I'll be going along fine in it, then I look back and realize I've mixed up all of the colors. Like if it was supposed to go from purple to green, I'll have green on the purple side and purple on the green side. 
Not a huge issue, but it kinda of weirds me out. Why cant I keep track of colors?"
1565,"Hey, I'm looking forward on talking to someone that has a good knowledge of one of these: depression, anxiety or ADHD.",I've been struggling with symptoms from all of these and they never really connect. I'm not confortable sharing all the things I've went through because I feel anxious to talk about them publicaly like this.
1566,Is it worth getting help?,Most of the time I question whether or not I should get help because I don't want to be a burden on someone else. Any opinions would be welcome :)
1567,How do I manage the costs and difficulties of looking for the right fit with the right therapist?,"I haven't been to therapy in a quite a while, since I was out of work, between jobs, or working partial hours for a long time, due to the very reason I need therapy. I now have a full time with healthcare provided as well as a new apartment and the added stress is making it impossible to avoid treatment. I'm especially concerned that I'll lose my job because I have very poor executive functioning. For the same reason, I'm concerned about being able to manage my time and money spent looking for a therapist. Since I don't want to diagnose myself here, I'll just explain that I have some moderate/severe social anxiety, so I have trouble making phone calls and being too agreeable. I also have a tendency to hyperfocus or obsess, and difficulty with organization, prioritization, and impulse control."
1568,Fine and then just not,"Sometimes I'll think I'm doing really well. I'll be having a good, productive day. And then all of a sudden, it's like I run into this invisible brick wall and I'm just sad. There's no apparent cause, I'm just really sad. My depression runs me over like a truck and it's really hard to shake off for the rest of the day. Not sure if this happens to anyone else."
1569,Why do I feel the need to repeatedly check things to be sure I did it?,"I have been having an issue for the past 2 years about where I feel an insane need to have to check to be sure I did things like turned off sinks or closed and locked doors. My main problem occurs every night. I walk around my bathroom for about 10 minutes making sure I turned off my two sinks and my shower. I check each sink faucet multiple times and I know that they are off every night but it’s like if I don’t check I can’t live with myself. I repeatedly push on the sink handles and run my hands under the faucet. I check each sink about 50 times before I finally go to bed. I don’t want to spend all this time in the bathroom, but I just can’t help it. Another problem I have is when I am closing doors. After leaving my house, I tend to turn around and make sure I closed and locked all the doors before leaving the neighborhood. I know I did these things but I can’t help it. The issue is very serious to me and I need help. Any advice with what’s wrong with me is helpful, thank you."
1570,I want nothing more than death,[removed]
1571,How did you learn to be perseverant? Is your outlook on life better now versus before?,"One of the events that made me perseverant was probably not doing so well in college but eventually realizing that it wasn't the end of the world and that if I made the right changes, I'll be okay."
1572,"My husband was admitted to a psychiatric hospital but I’m not okay, either.","My husband is in the military and we have gone through some very tough situations in our marriage. For privacy’s sake I’m going to keep details to a minimum because the things we’ve been through and our specific situation is very unique and recognizable to those who may know us. For four years we had a long distance relationship while I finished my undergrad. I graduated in May of this year, ready to move across the country and finally start my life with him. He was supposed to PCS (move) to a new location closer to our home on the west coast three days before the military enacted a travel ban due to COVID. This changed his orders, sending him to a new, horrible place in the middle of nowhere with no job opportunities. On top of this, none of the rental properties would let us have our pets so we had to move 30 minutes outside of town in the middle of even more of a literal ‘nowhere’. My husband has been through a lot in his life and I think all of it finally came to a head. 

He had a breakdown and had to be admitted. The military sent him 8 hours away to a place where I cannot visit. I am now in a new town without any job opportunities. I lost the potential job I had set up on the West Coast due to the travel ban changing his orders. I graduated at the top of my class and while I know this is temporary, it’s hard for me to see any point in why I tried so hard in school the past four years. I have Aspergers and I don’t know anybody on this side of the US well enough to try and make friends. I have our animals with me and I’ve just been hanging out with them in our apartment. I’ve stopped eating and I can’t sleep at night. 

He calls occasionally and I have to keep it together because I know he needs me to be strong for him. He’ll be in there for 6 more weeks and I don’t know if I can handle this. I feel like both of us were spiraling out of control and he’s just the one that snapped first. Now nobody is here with me and I feel like I have snapped. He FaceTimed me today and I broke down crying. I feel so bad because I know that my outburst probably worried him or made him think I wasn’t thinking about him. He’s *all* I am thinking about and it hurts to be alone at such a strange and pivotal moment in my life. I don’t know what to do."
1573,Is this just loneliness?,"It's just another covid post, sorry. I live in a different country than my family. All their visits have of course been cancelled. I had some friends here but they all moved away last year. My cat died a couple months ago. I'm not going to be able to travel to my best friend's wedding. My job has always been working from home, independent contract work. So no coworkers. I haven't spoken to anyone in person but my spouse for about 7 months. 

I've been really weepy and lazy recently. I've gained at least 15 pounds. Every little thing annoys me. We got a new kitten but I just can't seem to bond with it. Should I just chalk this up to covid loneliness or is there something I can actually do? 

Thanks, sorry it's long."
1574,Are there any online services where you can talk to a professional instantly for free?,Sounds like a pipe dream but I really need to speak to someone right now...
1575,University of Montana coming up with an opioid vaccine," [Big Sky research is on the rise with yet another](https://www.trialsitenews.com/nih-awards-33-4m-to-university-of-montana-for-clinical-trials-testing-opioid-vaccine/) ***important research award announced recently.

1576,"I reached a new low in my life, I don’t know how to escape.","Yesterday I wanted to kill myself, and the feeling hasn’t gone away. This has been building for a while, but I am so lost in my own life, I have no purpose, I feel alone and isolated and I wish I had more freedom for myself. I wake up and I feel miserable. I try to entertain myself with games or days out and I feel miserable. I have lost any passion for anything.

I try to talk to my friends and I hear things such as “get a grip”, “you have nothing to stress about, you are literally only 18.” I feel as though they don’t understand. I don’t rly know if anybody does, hence I crawl to reddit in the hope some stranger out there gives a shit about me. I want to kill myself still, and yet I don’t have the courage to go through with it.

What the fuck is even the point of going on? Can anyone share their experience from feeling similarly, and if so how did it go? I can’t be arsed feeling like this every fucking day, I just can’t fucking go on."
1577,"Well, my mom's depressed, my dad's depressed, I'm depressed. Only a matter of time until my sister's starts.",Nice.
1578,Is there such a thing as like empathy pain or symptoms?,Recently I’ve notice when I’m around my best friend I’ll get like random issues come out of nowhere or I’ll get them after she says that she has them. Like I’ll start to feel tired randomly then she will say she wants to go home and take a nap because she’s tired. My stomach randomly started to feel upset and I got a migraine out of nowhere today as well and when we were out she said she felt like she had to throw up then got a headache. Is there such thing as empathy symptoms or like randomly getting the same ailments as someone else you’re close to?
1579,Realizing I am mentally unstable after 15 years.,"I took some psilocybin mushrooms to escape reality every 2-3 days for a couple months and am starting to see that I'm mentally unstable.
Been a bit over a month since I had my last trip that helped me realize that my brains not quite right.
I had a vivid image come to me a couple days ago during a bit of a mental breakdown.
It was of my mother and sister in tears kneeling on the floor in our living room(I was about 12 or 13 years old, now 28). This is a couple years after my parents seperated and we are told my dad is now imprisoned in peru (addiction-&gt;cocaine-&gt;smuggling) which devastated them. I believe this is the moment that I shut down mentally and stopped dealing with emotions. I think it messed me up more mentally than it did to them. Been a very happy individual all these years(I think...) until recently now I'm consumed by heart palpitations, light headedness, unable to focus, and random periods throughout the day where I just break down mentally and cry.

Looking into therapy now which was proving difficult. I spent a fair bit of time searching online for therapists in my area and could not find a single one. 
Told my wife this and she pulled her phone out and in seconds had a long list of therapists. Now I'm curious exactly how often my mind is putting up blockades for me...

So... any thoughts?"
1580,I can't fight anymore,[removed]
1581,Night time thoughts,"I can usually block at feeling bad and lonely after school with tv or games, but when I am trying to sleep I feel like I am the worst person in the world. I will look back on something I did in elementary school years ago and think because I said this or because I did that nobody will ever like me. I feel like I am alone even when I’m not and I feel like I have no friends in this world. Life sucks."
1582,Increased dosage? (Prozac),"Hey y’all, hope you’re all doing well. I’ve been on 20mg prozac for a couple years now and a couple weeks back I felt my intrusive thoughts and anxiety skyrocket to the point where I sat in bed shaking for most of the day.

About 2 weeks ago my psychiatrist upped my prozac dosage to 40mg from 20mg. The first 7 days went very well then it felt like there was a reset on my anxiety levels and panic. My psychiatrist told me it would take 10 days but then she changed her answer to 3 weeks so I'm not too sure what to believe.

(TLDR) How long does an increased dose of prozac take to work? (20-40mg)"
1583,Not like the usual posts but I am scared of lobsters. (No joke),"I think it's called kabourophobia(?). I'm terrified of lobsters. Even if its cooked, if I touch it I feel a shiver down my spine. I can't even touch its shell. If its alive it's worse. I used to be able to eat lobsters normally but now I'm terrified of them. Please help"

My family has always been too close to each other and always walking lines but never crossing them. My grandmother is especially unnerving and all my life has always had to have her hands on me or be near me or just stares at me and when I grew older I was able to stop spending so much time around her until four years ago when my grandfather died and my mother felt obligated to take care of her every beck and call and be around her almost every waking moment. Thankfully, with the pandemic we have just been dropping off meals and not spending any time with her. My birthday was a few days ago and she sent my dad back home with a gift for me which turned out to be 6 journals front to back detailing every minute of interaction she had with me from 1999- 2009. I'm very upset and I don't even know how to feel but my parents keep telling me it's not a big deal and I just need to let it go. If you know anything about anything like this and can give me any information on how to move forward I would appreciate it. Thank you."

1592,His Fuckin Ear Fell Off (story/insight)," I accidentally cut a kids ear off with the corner of a brick pillar/wall when I was in 7th grade for the second time. I did mean to go over there and talk to the guy, I had every intention of turning him around and trying to talk with him for messing with my then girlfriend while we were in a rough patch. But not for his ear to fall off 

  That bitch played the shit out of me. Fooled around, cheated a bunch, made me look even dumber than I'd already looked. I had grown up being bullied and she only further degraded me. Anyway, all I wanted to do was talk to this kid. I wanted to turn him around so that I could kinda do that whole, ""you're walking and talking with my girlfriend and we both know it's more than just a friendly chat"" type thing.

  Hell, I was in the middle of a conversation with one of my teachers as they walked right by me. It was the end of the day, last bell had just rang, I knew I wasn't gonna let them walk right through as if she didn't notice me. I wasn't gonna wait until we got home and have her ignore me and or lie as she always did over the phone/texts/notes/to my face. And I wasn't going to wait until the next day, I had to do something now. 

  The way she came down the stairs, with him. The way her and that kid were laughing as she looked over at me with her arm wrapped around his, pressing onto his chest with her other hand. How she flicked her hair over her fuckin shoulder like popular kids and attention whores do all the time. Ya know, the typical ""cool kid table"" sorta people. Disgusting. I remember seeing my teachers mouth moving in my peripheral but I couldn't hear a sound.

  Everything was slowed down like in that one movie, fuck man what's it called.... Dredd? Now, I didn't see that movie until after this incident due to the fact the movie hadn't even come out till a few years later but that's beside the point. In this moment I'd entirely forgotten I was mid conversation with my teacher. I just started walking toward my then girlfriend and this guy. Again, I had every intention to turn the kid around and talk with him, ask a few questions, call them out, whatever.

  What I should have realized is that although I had this intention and I was conscious enough to think about it; I hadn't really grasped how quickly I was loosing grasp on reality as I'd previously explained above. If that makes any sort of sense through all the irony? It was the weirdest fuckin thing, I don't know how else to explain it really. 

  They've both made it passed me by this point but I'm clossing in. It's really loud now, kids are fuckin everywhere but it's like all these other kids are ghosts. My eyes were glued to these two. My girlfriend and this guy. The pushing and shoving of the other students, the obstacles/structures they didn't matter. I had this weird, speedy, stalk walk thing going on, I was moving like an animal. It was this surreal, dream-like feeling of absolute flow I'd never experienced before. Like some sort of prehistoric or ancient primal instinct took over where I no longer knew what I was doing, where I was going or who I was but IT did. Whatever it was. 

  I was there now. I was right behind this guy, his arm was around her waste. My feet were in sync with his. My shoulders swayed to the exact rythem, I reached my hand out towards him to turn him around. All I did was touched the fabric of the strap on his backpack. 

  Everything stopped, it was silence without a ringing in your ears, a chill without goosebumps and a heat without warmth. I have light colored eyes and the sun regularly blinds me to tears making it hard to open them without blinking like, you may see while somebody has a seizure. The brightness of this was brighter than the sunniest day with the lightest and whitest shaded piece of paper and not a cloud in the sky. If you don't understand the paper reference than you should start appreciating your brown eyes more. 

  I thought I'd killed this kid. I can't say what exactly transpired during that very brief amount of seconds my hand or hands made contact with this poor kid. All I know is that when I came to, snapped back, ""awoke"" whatever...he was on the ground staring into nothingness. His blood had even managed to *spatter* the wall of this brick pillar/column thing where the side of his head magically aligned perfectly with the very corner of this thing. Blood was pooling around his head and I notice that his ear was basically cut in half. Not hotdog style but, hamburger style. Right across the middle, straight across his ear-hole, I guess you could say? Horizontal...thats the word. 

  Turns out, I didn't kill him. Right-o, that's a huge fuckin plus in my book. Only now that he's flailing around all over the got'amn place and screaming and crying and holding whats left of his ear, I start to have the, ""Oops, I fucked up"" (with the really long drawn out, ""Man"" moment.) Ya know what I'm saying? Like, ""Maaannnnn"". So I pick my head up because this last 6-8 seconds has felt like eternity and when I do, it's all eyes on me. Did I mention that this happened in the main courtyard?

  What do I do? I make it even worse. Instead of trying to explain that it was an accident and that I'm not entirely sure what exactly just happened, I run. Like a fuckin coward. The crazy primal instinct beast thing I had slipped into was gone and now I'm running like a scared 12 or 13 year old kid, freaking the shits out of myself cause I mean, c'mon. What did I just do? It all happened so fast that as I sprinted through the court yard and passed the school admins they still hadn't realized anything even happened. I was yelled at to, ""Slow down!"" But I was expecting something along the lines of, ""Stop in the name of the law!"" Hell, I didn't even get the old school ""Freeze!""

  I get to my bus. Yes, I made it all the way onto my bus when even more panic sets in. The logic start clicking and things start making sense again. Eh, sorta. I realize that by this point they're not going to let the busses leave, I see all the admins and shit, the schools cop, ect ect outside the window looking for me. I mean, they're looking for somebody and they have an idea, the entire school is my witnesses, but it's still so fresh and they're not sure of anything anymore than I am, myself.

  I walk off the bus to make things right and I walk straight up to the officer who kinda pushes me out of the way cause ya know, they're looking for me... So I'm trying to tell the cop and the admin that I did it but they keep fuckin moving. My adrenaline is gone now and I'm starting to crash so I'm just following them through this sea of children while they look for me high and low as I'm steady walking with them saying ""hello, it was me, I did it, hey you found me, I'm your guy."" Finally by the grace of whatever you believe in, the cop turns around and asks if I saw anything. ""Yes ma'am, I did it."" Now she's asking me stuff like what'd I see, do I know where he went, and all these stupid fuckin questions. *face palm* ""MA'AM I DID IT.!""

  Needless to say, I turn around, cop puts me in cuffs like she's some fuckin hero that found a bad guy all by herself without any help cause I didn't just chase her around the fuckin school saying here I am for the past 10 minutes. It's whatever. I go to the front office. All the important people are there, the principal is the same principal I've had my whole life and he knows my parents well, and let's just say they aren't fond of one another. They get called out if work, yadda yadda yadda.

  We're waiting for my parents now, and the whole time I'm getting yelled at by this cop, all the administration dicks and I'm still pretty freaked out. I don't know what to say, so I plead the 5th basically, I just didn't say that. Next thing you know, the school is swarming with city cops, fire engine, an ambulance. You'd have thought it was a school shooting or something crazy. Then the teacher I was talking to right before it happened walks into the room and she's crying. She's a friend of my parents and I always loved her like a second mom.

  She asks me what happened. Why I did that and how it made no sense and even she was trying to explain that it wasn't like I planned it but that it was kinda just a freak thing. A snap or something. They don't care to hear that though. I'm crying now too because yes, I did feel bad. I still do to this day. I didn't even know the kids name until after his ear fell off. My parents finally arrive, my dad comes running in cause he hears them yelling at me, so he practically shoves the door open and starts yelling back at the police and the principal and everybody else, my mothers crying too. Find out the kids dad is being, ""restrained"" in another building cause he wants to beat my ass for cutting his sons ear off but apparently he stopped as soon as my dad showed up and he could hear my dad going off. So kid's dad decided to leave and be with his son instead. 

  I was facing time, had to pay all the medical bills, (it wasn't some easy, stitch the ear back on either.) Nope, too easy. Apparently they had to do some sort of plastic reconstruction surgery stuff to put it back on. Had to write a letter of apology to the kid and the family and to the father. (All separate letters for some reason) went to court and the CCTV footage had a bad angle. It showed me talking to a teacher, casually walking away, I dissappear behind the pillar thing, a few seconds go by, and then it showed me speed walking out the otherside of the pillar. They couldn't prove any malice intent. Was jotted off as an accident. Which, I feel it was, personally.

  To this day I still hear about it, people bring it up. I've heard a million different versions of what happened. What they saw. Some say he deserved it. Others say it was too fast and all they really saw was me turn this kid around and he was on the ground. Some say I shoved/slung his head into the wall when I turned him around by the back pack. Others just remember rounding the corner and seeing me stand over him with a thousand yard stare. 

  I learned a lot from that experience. I also still don't know what it was. For years I've been dealing with mental illnesses and have refused to seek help. Up until recently that is, I have my first appointment with some shrinks next week for counseling, a psychiatrist and whatever the other psycho therapy analysis person is. 

If you're reading this, I apologize again. You didn't deserve that. I remember thinking about how I probably just ruined your Halloween as it was October 30th. Probably fucked you out of enjoying a party, or a costume/mask. But hey, if it's of any consolation, I fucked my Halloween up too.

(I've previously posted this to a separate reddit but since then, have seen a therapist and have an appointment with a psychiatrist on tuesday.) 

This was more or less a story about something that took place years ago. I've only gotten worse though. It went from depression to anxiety, to panic disorder, and now agoraphobia. Ontop of it all, I may also have a personality disorder as well. I'm not suicidal but I'd like to die at times. Ya know...when things get bad. Hell, I call a crisis line almost every other day just so I can be told how to breath properly. I'm losing my mind and figured maybe somebody here has some insight. These next few months are gonna be hell for me but I'm trying to get better."
1593,do i need a therapist?,[removed]
1594,Is this relation toxic,"So I broke up with my gf a few months ago because it was too much to handle. She fell in love with the idea of me but not who I was she only really cared about the affection. Whenever I couldn’t do something for her she’d get mad, whenever I was with friends she got mad, whenever I do anything that wasn’t about her she would get mad. She would cuss and yell if I didn’t call her. After we broke up I felt so guilty i was stuck in bed for days at a time but recently I haven’t felt any guilt so I stopped texting her or answering her. She recently texted me saying I used her what should I do?"
1595,I'm bipolar and my boyfriends a sociopath and I'm struggling,"I'm really really bad with communication ever since we met each other 3 yrs ago, and I'm having a hard time trying to tell him what I'm feeling, which is pushing myself away from him more. he recently told me all the things he had been feeling, how he doesnt feel actual feelings, empathy and such, then a few days later he had a new death experience. he told me the only reason he stayed alive was because he thought of me and started to panic. he tells me I'm the only thing that gives him emotion, happiness and if it werent for me hed be dead. I know he has such a difficult time telling me this since it took him so long so I wouldn't consider it toxic, just how he is and I cant change that. But it puts alot of stress on me because I have HEAVY commitment issues and often get unattached to someone a month after dating them, it's been almost 3 months now, our 3rd time dating. I've tried telling him about what I feel but i feel like it can never compare to his mental state and he wiuldnt be able to understand my emotion. I have heavy mood swings and I never tell him because his state of mind is that is stupid to feel strong emotion if it doesnt affect you in the long run, it's a waste of time. I have been losing friends recently and so now hes the only person i talk to and i cant tell him how I'm feeling and it's really really hard because I've become a custom to telling people to release my anger. now I've realized I've started taking it out on other things like my laptop and my desk and doing in healthy things I've took YEARS to stop doing. it's difficult and idk what to do because he wouldnt understand what I'm going through because he doesnt un understand emotion that well. help?? 
ps. I'm looking for anything, everything, just your thoughts on the matter, I havent been able to talk to anyone about this except here,,,"
1596,"Everything is going to be okay, if it’s not okay then it’s not the end🤍",Just a reminder 🤍
1597,Coping mechanisms?,"I (27/F) live in the US. Things are bad. Climate change is taking its toll, our political system is a mess and is sliding into an authoritarian regime, my city just got hit with a devastating storm and we are now a COVID hot spot. Racial and socioeconomic tensions are at an all time high (in my lifetime). Everyone keeps saying 2020 is so bad, but i think this might just be the beginning of a stretch of really shitty years. Maybe the rest of my life if nothing is done to combat habitat loss and climate change. 

The thing is, in my personal life everything is stable. My husband and i live comfortably, kept our jobs, have two beautiful cats and a dog and a nice little home. I don’t want to feel this depressed and anxious about things outside my control but it feels like i can’t help it. I want to enjoy my life but it doesn’t seem possible when the world is burning. 

Does anyone have a similar situation? Have any coping mechanisms or other ways of looking at things?"
1598,Anxiety feeling like it came out of nowhere,"I've had a relatively positive experience with mental health throughout my life, but in the past year or so it seems that I've gotten increasingly anxious. I've somehow developed a pretty strong health-related anxiety, so bad that I've made appointments to see a cardiologist to check my heart and a dermatologist to check my skin (I'm 23 and healthy, but I can't stop obsessing over these things).

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to a new city a month ago and went from basically just hanging out all summer to working 5x a week and doing work for my graduate program. In the beginning, I felt like I was thriving and I was really positive, but now I will get this wave of anxiety out of nowhere and not be able to do anything to control it. I do not feel depressed, per se, but I do have a little crying break down after some of these waves of anxiety, mostly because I get so frustrated. I know I should see a psychologist, and I have a consultation tomorrow, so no need to tell me to see one! I just wanted to hear other people's insights/experiences because I think it'll make me feel better."
1599,I don’t know,"uuhhhhh I (21f) recently started my first job in an attempt to ground myself, learn how to interact with people again. It’s going well so far but I still feel so disconnected from this reality (and can’t make eye contact to save my life) I’m surround by family whom I love very much and love me but I feel lonely. (This is probably due to my only friend being quite literally on the other side of the country from me) I had a pretty nasty relationship 3 years back and it feels like I’m still having to pick the pieces up mentally. we were friends for a long while before we ever dated so he was already in my psyche (he was narcissist, quite possible a psychopath too) it was after our breakup that I felt i lost a piece of myself and the disconnect began. I feel so stuck in my head. My insides are always clenched up with nerves I put too much pressure on myself and I generally just don’t know what to do to help myself or where to begin. I haven’t been working very long so I’ll give it some more time but I told myself the same thing when I went to college and it never got better and I wasted 2 years and $60k. I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and I’m not doing enough. I’m petrified to drive which just adds to the soul crushing complacency I feel trapped in. I don’t know how to get out of my head. I also feel dumb for still feeling so distraught and going back to that dreaded relationship for why I feel the way I do - after 3 years you’d think something would be better. I’m tired of saying “I don’t know” for every not-mentally-healthy-thing I could work on. I’m so tired and just want some kind of direction"
1600,"My dreams tell the future, at least my brain says they do","I need some advice or an opinion on what is going wrong in my head. It’s really difficult to explain but I’m going to try my best.
Basically, I get dejavu a lot at work at home hanging with friends but it’s not normal dejavu. I feel as if I’m getting dejavu and recalling the events happening from a dream instead of me actually doing said thing before, which is typical of normal dejavu. 
For example I will be at work at a new job site and I’ll get dejavu but not because I’ve been to the job site before, but because I feel like I’ve dreamed being there. This wouldn’t really bother me so much if every time I got it I didn’t have the immense feeling that all these events are leading up to something bad about to happen in my life. 
Sometimes I have this happen to me several times in a day and it’s really affecting me and my life, please give me any advice or clue to what might be wrong."
1601,Disassociation and paranoia/severe anxiety,"I’ve lately been having extreme anxiety and paranoia that turns into these full blown panic attacks that take an eternity to go away. I’ve had a number of hardships due to the pandemic and I have been handling it okay for the most part until recently. I was drinking really heavily for a while but have now eliminated it almost entirely. Lately I cannot stop spacing out and daydreaming almost all day long. All weekend I had this feeling of impending doom, and have been flighty on and off. It got so bad today that I kept thinking I was losing my mind and going insane. At the store I kept freaking out if someone got too close to me and was getting spooked by the weirdest things. I then got home became dizzy, and very lightheaded. Then my mind had racing thoughts and I felt like once again I was insane. My heart was pounding, hands shaking, and I began hyperventilating. I had to keep drinking ice water to snap back into reality and it was awful. When this happened I felt like nothing was real and that I am not really here(if that makes any sense.) I took a Xanax and it took about an hour to chill me out. I cried and have never felt so scared in my entire life. The thing that sucks the most is that there is no specific thing that triggered it. I am finally okay now, but I just don’t feel like myself anymore and I want to feel normal again. Can anyone relate or give me advice? I am going to try and find a therapist tomorrow. I had a bad reaction to SSRI’s in the past and don’t want to go down that route. I take Xanax only ever in emergency instances like this one today. Anyways, thanks for listening."
1602,Goodbye,.
1603,Can a mental illness cause Physical symptoms?,"I have had symptoms of depression for over a year but I have not told anybody. I am 14 years old so I know people will just assume hormones. I have struggled with headaches for over a year and I take amitriptyline for it. It has worked for a while but lately it has gotten worse. I talked to my doctor and she said to switch from 25mg to 75mg a day and I still have head aches. I also have episodes where I get very dizzy. Sometimes I am dizzy nonstop for weeks-months. I also have episodes where my vision goes black or blurry and sometimes I lost control of my body and fall. I have hurt my self from this a few times. This has been happening to me for over a year and nobody can find out why. Could these be physical symptoms of a mental illness? I have felt very sad, isolated, and overall down for a long time. When ever my doctors give me those tests for depression my mom tells me to watch what I answer and says she knows I’m not depressed. She doesn’t know how I feel. I want to tell her but I just can’t find the strength. 

I’m sorry if this isn’t where I should post this. Please comment if you might be able to help."
1604,Uncontrollable images before bedtime,"I've been dealing with this for a few weeks now. Its something I see whenever I close my eyes which makes me keep them open and try to erase the gross image from my mind. I don't know what is in the image, it's different everytime but almost always it is like a pattern and clusters... all I know is that it really disgusts me. One thing I should mention is that it's not wierd for me to see images, I've experienced that for many years on and off. There seems to be ""phases"", like in one phase I always saw eyes... in another I saw me hurting myself in different ways etc. Now it's the gross patterns phase and I absolutely cannot handle it. Also, idk if this is related but I have trypophobia."
1605,Slowly imploding.,"Posting to see if other people can describe their experience the same way and what they did to help it.

I think the only way to describe how I am right now is that I am slowly imploding.

I am cutting myself off from the world. I have stopped reading the news, deactivated facebook/social media, stopped being part of group messages (because in person socialising doesn't exist as I am doing the right thing during the pandemic). I don't even feel like doing my weekly video chat calls to my family who are back in my home country. I can see what I am doing, I can see what is wrong in my head, and why I am doing it as I have history of anxiety/depression (like nearly everyone in this world, it doesn't make me any different). But I am just giving into it.

I'm imploding."
1606,Feeling happy feels weird now,"I'm always so sad/depressed that when I do have a brief moment of happiness, I tend to feel kinda strange afterwards. It almost seems unnatural."
1607,Can I take an extra gabapentin to deal with this panic attack,"Hey, I am currently on 300 mgs gabapentin twice a day. I am having an awful panic attack right now, tantamount to the one that caused me to seek the prescription in the first place. Is it safe for me to take another 300mgs right now to deal with this"
1608,Is this a psychological thing? Why do I feel this way?,"Ever since I was young, I just never had much of a bond with my family. It might be simply because I’m the ‘middle child’ and have always been independent, but honestly I think it might be deeper than that.

Any time I’m at a friends house or out alone, I just feel... better... I guess? I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but all I know is that being with my family causes me to feel sort of empty in a way. Don’t get me wrong, I love them with all my heart, but I can’t suppress this feeling I have. In fact, the only reason I try in school is so I can hopefully get a scholarship and move away (we’re relatively poor, so that’s my only chance of leaving).

Maybe it’s because my family was pretty conservative or because they’re not from this country, but I have literally no other explanation as to why I feel so out of place with them. Is this psychological? Was I born this way? What can explain this??"
1609,Does anyone experience this greater than others or are we supposed to feel this because its the way humans are wired,"Does anyone else when reading or watching something negative automatically feel negative as if you're the person you're reading or watching is about. That you put yourself in their shoes and feel the negativity physically in you're body. Maybe it's an empathy thing, not too sure just curious if anyone else experiences this. I think we all do because it's our human nature.

TL;DR: does anyone else feel energies like this more greater than others do"
1610,Sooo tw: spiders,So I live in a shared house and it feels like spaces are getting closed in; the room I used to escape to has a spider problem my friend agreed to handle it then got distracted and forgot now I’m literally always being in public view (someone actually put one of my pets on top of me while I was sleeping cuz he thought it was funny). The rooms infested with hobo spiders my last bite I had a violent reaction because I’m immuno compromised and can’t fight even a basic histamine response.... but another week like this makes me think I’d rather die to spider bites in my sleep than wait for anyone else to be motivated to fix the issue; if I hire an exterminator feelings will be bury because why not just wait. And I just I dunno
1611,i wish i could sleep,"small rant/vent. but im so tired. i can't sleep anymore, without alcohol or weed, or chugging nighttime cough syrup. like even when im at the point im hallucinating (worse than usual), not having slept for days in a row and I feel absolutely warn down...my body STILL refuses to sleep. i just want to sleep without having to use substances. i just want to sleep. I want to lay down and not be consumed by hallucinations or delusions or intrusive thoughts or obsessive compulsive thoughts, I JUST WANT TO SLEEP."
1612,Should I see a therapist or am i just being dramatic?,I just had my first panic attack. Felt horrible. I was just minding my own business and I thought about my day then instantly my heart started beating so fast. I started breathing heavy. I had to lay on the ground for a couple minutes. For the past few weeks ive been feeling kind of mopey idk why. I dont feel motivated to do anything. I feel like i dont have anything to look foward to. Over the weekend ive watched 14 hours of tv because I didn't want to do anything. Sometimes I feel like sleeping because I just dont want to be awake. I feel like im wasting my life. I tried smoking for the first time yesterday. Felt so relaxing ive been craving it. I dont know if this is depression but im definitely not suicidal like I obviously want to be alive. Im just kinda lost.
1613,I cut for the first time in 10 years and I am not OK,The title pretty much says it all. I’m so fucked up rn. I’ve never hated myself more. WTF is wrong with me?! 😢
1614,i'll never be happy with my life.,"dramatic title!! woo!! TW sewerslide ment. / questioning 

i've been maladaptive daydreaming for the past seven or so years. It's gotten really bad latey, to the point where even if I'm daydreaming happy scenarios, I'll break down crying and sobbing and it'll be a good half hour or so before I can do anything else. 

I talked to my therapist about it and she basically was just like ""hmm wow that sucks"" so like :/ shes not a ton of help. but i was venting abt it on my instagram and my friend said ""its because you realize nothing you experience in real life will live up to your imagination."" and. holy hell hes right. 

i've ended numerous relationships and friendships just because they're not what i wanted/imagined them to be. i've latched onto the idea of reality shifting and astral projection just so I can experience a different world. Because I know everything that I experience in this world is never going to live up to my daydream of what i want it to be.

I genuinely don't know what to do about it. I havent been s^^c^d^l in a really long time but if im right and nothing will ever live up to my imagination then why go on?? Idk guys. sorry if this isnt the place for this i just really wanted to get my thoughts out. Has anyone else felt this way?"
1615,What do I feel so lost?,"I'm 13, and for the last year, I have just felt so unenthused and disconnected from the world. For example in school the easiest tasks feel so hard, not that the work is hard, it's just sitting down and doing the work part that is hard, like when doing homework I just break into tears. It may just be my ADHD, but does anyone have any advice, please I'm desperate!"
1616,Machiavellianism.,I’m not only a psychopath turns out I’m Machiavellian too...
1617,Failure and never feeling worthy,"This is just kinda a vent and pouring my heart out. I never really accomplished anything. I come from a big family and I'm the 2nd youngest of 9. Each and everyone of my siblings has success in either an actual ""adult"" job or in something they love. I was always the below average funny one. 

2 years ago I was living in my car due to an severely abusive bf that forced me to drop out of college after working hard for the first time in academics with a perfect GPA. We worked and went to school together. My boss knew, demoted me while giving him a promotion. My family disowned me and I lost my opportunity to intern abroad. I was so sure I'd die that year. Any free minute I had was smoking weed, drinking or on xanax. Eventually I tried to jump of the rooftop of my college and lucky a guy came out of no where and grabbed me by my backpack loop. A month later my younger brother(who was a fucking prodigy and my only real friend) completed suicide a week after I saw him. 

A month later I turned my life around and happy to say today I'm in a healthy loving relationship with two amazing dogs I found. I still struggle with bipolar depression and PTSD but am in a much better situation than before. A few months ago I was down because I was furloughed and started watching old animes for the first time in over a decade. I remembered one of my dreams since I was a child was to work and live in Japan. I started making my design portfolio and applied to jobs. Fast forward couple months now, I just got a call back finally about a company interested on hiring me if I can move by the end of the year. I'm crying so much rn. It's such a mix of happiness and feeling like I hate myself. Idk how to really handle this since I've always been the failure in my family. I did this for my brother and me. I feel like, for once, I'm so greatful that stranger saved me from jumping. I feel so unworthy because my brother would of made a better impact in the world if I killed myself before him and maybe he would be inspired to finish his dreams. Man, I hate myself. I'm so lucky and undeserving. I think, I'm starting to love my life again."
1618,Does anyone feel negative/bitter about certain things?,"Hello everyone, 21 F here. There is a TLDR at the bottom.

I am in the middle of a Teams call while writing this and my sudden realization kicks in and I notice how I am bitter, envy and sad(?) about many things. As the people in the call are all chirpy and happy, I just feel like a grumpy uncle at family dinner. I roll my eyes and feel annoyed most of the time.

I'm not sure if it stems from my upbringing due to comparison between my siblings, cousins or peers but nowadays, I feel as though that I envy and feel bitter about other people's success. These people could be my friends that I am close with. I know I should be happy for their successes but  I just feel so bitter and envious.

I think it all kinda started when I was 12 maybe even earlier? There was a girl who I was best friends with but she had always been better than me, physically and academically. I guess I *was* happy for her successes but as the years go by, she progressed and I keep feeling as though I've regressed. To this day, I still feel very envious of her life and her achievements. It's like I want to be her but I know I will never be like her.

I keep telling myself that I run my own race and I shouldn't beat myself thinking about it. I should be proud of my own achievements. I mean, I am proud but there's always a tinge of bitterness, disappointment and envy feeling when I realize I didn't do enough. Some days I just feel as though I disappoint people in my life.

I am conscious of it but what do I do with this information now? Has anyone felt like this before and what was your way to stop feeling like this?

TL;DR : I know my inner voice is very critical at times but I have no idea what to do with it. I've always been compared to and I am envious and bitter about other people's lives. Due to this, I sometimes get annoyed so easily. Has anyone faced this and has worked towards diminishing the critical inner voice?"
1619,unmotivated and unable to move forward,"I'm unable to fix everything. I hate my life and yet I'm unable to change it. I have no friends but I'm unable to remember how to make them, for years I've been trying to recover from abuse and a bad depression episode I had all of middle school. I hate the people i live with and want to get a job but i just lie in bed watching things I don't care about. The things i need to do are not that hard and yet I'm unable to do them, slowly I feel more numb, its not a suffocating nothing but a dull nothing. And I'm tempted to commit self-harm to feel again, to motivate myself into doing what i need to. I've tried doing these fresh starts multiple times and they never work. its gotten worse recently since I've discovered i hate my father and i only clung onto him cause he was all i had and i didn't want to grow up yet. I wanted someone to take care of me and i push everyone else away but now that I've faced the truth i don't know what I'm going to do, i can't help but lie in bed and push everyone away, advice?"

1621,My mental state,[removed]
1622,I don’t know if I hallucinated?,"Hi, I’m (17F) diagnosed with Severe Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Full disclosure: this might sound really stupid and I keep questioning myself. Earlier tonight I walked into the bathroom of my college dorm and no one was there except for someone at one sink. I looked down at the floor near the stalls and saw a huge dark bug at least the size of my thumb. I stepped back and blinked and I think it moved. I blinked again and saw something black fly up to the nearest stall. I stood there just looking and it was not there. I opened the stall door and couldn’t find it, then moved to the next two on either side. I looked up, down, everywhere in each stall multiple times. It’s not a big bathroom. Then I kept questioning if it was really there. I know this may sound silly but for some reason I don’t believe myself. Like I know I saw it, but I don’t know if it was actually there. This might sound strange but for the last half hour I have been obsessing over if I’m lying or not?? Which is weird because it’s like I don’t trust myself. I’m not paranoid about the fact that there was a large bug, I’m kind of freaking out about the fact that I can’t tell if it was truly there and why it’s such a big deal to me and I can’t let go. I have suffered from invasive thoughts pretty badly in the past and currently perseverative (repetitive) thoughts as a symptom of GAD. I know this is probably ridiculous but I need some advice. BTW for additional info I am currently on an SSRI and Wellbutrin for meds. Please help?"
1623,Anyone else feel like a Burden when it comes to getting help or talking to someone about your depression?,I know someone else has to have the same feeling as i do when it comes to opening up about your depression to either your family or friends. I know people can’t fight depression on their own but i don’t want to feel like someone else has to carry my load emotionally because i don’t want my family members wanting to be worried about whether or not i’m suicidal.
1624,"How to Cope While Someone Recovers from Mental Illness?, Need Help","Good Evening World,

I don’t know where to start but I am hoping someone out there can help share their story. I am essentially looking for reassurance due to the current circumstances. I realize that nothing is ever certain but I am trying hard everyday to hold on to Hope and Faith. I am torn between science and spirituality though I would consider both intertwined.

Essentially, the love of my life has fell mentally ill. We aren’t married yet and she has been in the care of her Mother for almost two months now since her episode. Leading up to her current state she was a very lively individual. We both didn’t understand that she was on the verge to undergo her mental recovery but here we are. I am trying my hardest not to blame myself but thinking back to this point I just didn’t understand. We were in the process of removing as much stress in our lives and be more minimalistic when this happened. It has been an extremely hard experience for me and I can only imagine for her. Due to circumstances I cannot be by her side on the day to day and I just saw her today for the first time in a couple of weeks. She looks better but God/Universe knows I struggle to keep a positive outlook and speak positivity and life into her improvement. She isn’t anxious or showing signs of panic attacks I believe. I asked her if she is still thinking alot and she said yes. She was extremely apologetic and the hardest thing to deal with is even while she isn’t completely herself she focuses on my wellbeing. She also believes that everyone dislikes her and that she is a evil person. I try to reassure her that she isn’t but it doesn’t seem to help. She just got back to the point to where she will text a few words which occasionally are not as coherent. It is just so much. For the first two weeks of her recovery I was bedside sleeping on the floor next to her following her rhythm. Unfortunately, due to my job I had to leave back to my worksite and due to travel restrictions can not visit until weekends. I feel like things happened for a reason though because while I was there I felt as if I was hurting her recovery because she would focus on my wellbeing alot of the time and not herself. It pains me because I try to tell her to focus on herself but as I have so much Love for her she has it for me. Like the last thing I want for her is to focus on me when she needs to focus on self. I just said the same thing multiple times. My mind is in disarray. I guess I seeking peoples stories from both sides of the isle and I am wondering has anyone gone through this process holistically. Her family is reluctant to seek further medical advise because prior to her being cared for at home the experience at the hospital was horrifying. I don’t know what to do. Her family knows she will get better. I am trying to believe and know she will be fine but I am scared, sad, uncertain just everything. I believe she is getting better. I wouldn’t wish what she is going through on my worst enemy. Please help. Thank you for your time."

1626,What is wrong with me? Diagnoses? Suggestions?,"I’m suicidal, everyone tells me I’m going to be great and do amazing. But I do nothing.
I have really bad hyperactivity that causes heart palpitations. I feel like my veins are going to pop.
I am 6’3 180 lbs. I feel like I have so much energy I could power a nuclear reactor. Yet so much self doubt I don’t even think I could make it.
I was adopted and given up.
I am transgender MtF. But haven’t come out.
I do music but I’m too scared to preform. 
I have ptsd from a long line of being raped, and tortured.
I can’t do anything.
I try to break things down to logic and devoid of emotion.
I cry daily.

Help please.
I take no medication.
Nor vices.
I don’t even drink coffee because it makes my heart palpitations incredibly painful.
I also am poor. So I can’t see a doctor. Because 19 year olds don’t get healthcare. Even if they were in foster care and homeless. (I’m not homeless right now, because apparently I have a good appearance and it is easy for people to like me. I don’t see it. But they do.)

I am honestly stupid as fuck and would love some help."

1628,my family keeps commenting about my weight,"my parents live in a different country from me, and every time we call to catch up with each other, my mother always tells me that i'm fatter than i was. she's always comparing my weight to hers, and how she looks thinner than me even if she's old. i don't know how to make her stop, because its been really hurtful to me, and every time she tells me so, i just want to break down and cry. i've been trying to eat clean and exercise but when i hear it from her i just want to starve myself. i've had history with skipping meals in high school but since then i feel like i have been doing better, but hearing it from someone like my mom just makes me want to spiral down again.

tldr: my parents keep telling me i'm fat. does anyone have advice"
1629,I have never been consistent with anything I do.,"I have always had this thing of inconsistency with everything I have done over the years. I am 22 now and over this life I have experimented with a lot of things be it in different fields. But I have never been able to be absorbed by just one thing and have always ended up being shuffling or juggling between different aptitudes. It was okay in the start, pretty adventurous and exciting, trying out new things and all. But now, when theres a need for consistency in one single thing I cant hold it. I do tend to juggle between 4-5 things now but it happens over the course of a few months and at a particular point of time I can only indulge with just one. It gets so frustrating to just live life this way because I cant really get into properly as I will end up losing the aptitude or the aptitude with shift to something else and that will mess things up. 
If I start something, theres always this fear that I’ll lose the aptitude and I end up leaving it sooner. 
Theres also this nagging thought in my head saying I am not the first one to be saying this on this platform and countless others must face the same problems the same way I do. 
And it makes me feel weirdly left out. 
What is wrong with me?"
1630,Rap/poem about bulling.,"
Another poem or a rap…

Don’t care what it’s called…

But bully he is cold, and his crap…

is getting old…so Bully crap is getting told 

So bully back off, do not scold 

do not touch me, do not hold 

cause bully bullshit is a drain 

And bully bullshit causes pain 

And he likes it, like it’s fun, and he likes it, like a gain 

but to me, it’s no game, but to me, it’s
a drain 

And to me, it’s no fun, but to me, its insane."

1632,How to feel secure enough in my life for a relationship?,"I am in a relationship with a successful and happy partner. But my problem is that I'm not successful and only happy some of the time. So I spend weekends with my partner, in their apartment, and when I have to go back to the little room that I rent, it is kind of jarring. I feel like I need time to adjust every Sunday, and just realize that even though I feel so safe and happy with my partner, their place is not my place and my life is not actually safe and happy. 

Plus, I work and go to school full time and when I'm with my partner it makes me forget that I need to strive for more. I just want to relax with them in my free time and not take classes anymore. 

I feel like maybe I wish we were together longer and could get married so their security could be mine, but I often grow resentful very early in relationships that they don't want to immediately make me feel safe. We haven't even been together a year and like, I've asked about moving in together and they think its too soon. 

So I need to accept that I have to work hard all the time for myself and it really weighs on any relationship that I have... because if I ever do become self-sufficient, I'll probably be too bitter by then to want to be with anyone. Why would I share my life with someone who didn't offer to pick up the slack when I needed it? Would I want to get married and share a home and bills and finances with someone who wasn't there when I needed them? Especially if I'm capable of doing it alone then. I think I will probably think ""I got myself this far alone, I'm more capable than ever of being alone now, and this person isn't a true partner because they didn't help me when I was scared."" And it sucks to think of ending up bitter and alone. But I don't know how to feel when I'm not happy and my partner doesn't feel close enough to me to help."
1633,How do I do this?,"Hello all. I am in the beginning stages of looking for a counselor or some kind of services for my young daughter. I received mental health services when I was a teen and know how beneficial they can be. My daughter, 8F, is showing signs of depression and anxiety that have grown increasingly worrisome due to everything going on lately. 

I've started looking at providers in our area, but I genuinely have no clue how I can ever afford the fees. What do you do when your insurance sucks and you don't have enough money to get the help needed? She has our state insurance, but it's a joke. I just want to help her and I'm feeling increasingly hopeless that I can do this. I am going back to work very soon, and just worry so much how that might make things even harder on her. I just need some advice of where to look, and realistically, what do people do to afford it?"
1634,I don’t know how to cope.,"I’m just really really struggling right now. I’m really trying to pretend like I’m okay and people keep telling me how amazed they are by how well I’m handling everything going on right now but I’m not handling anything. I’m just shoving all my feelings down and pretending like they don’t exist. 

My boyfriend of two years broke up with me a week ago and I miss him so fucking much. He was my everything and the person who I looked forwards to talking to every single day. He made me so happy. And now he’s gone and I don’t know how to handle that. Everyone just keeps telling me it’ll get better over time. I want to text him and tell him how much I want him back but I know that’s not fair. I need to respect his reasons and feelings for ending the relationship. It would be selfish of me to do anything else. But I can’t help crying every night at the thought of not getting to tell him goodnight. 

I’m really struggling in school right now too. I’m in college and with online classes it’s been really hard to learn. I’m practically teaching myself two  of my classes. It’s so hard. I spend all day studying and going to zoom calls. I don’t ever leave my dorm room except to go to the bathroom or to go to the dining hall once a day. I want time to myself but if I take that then I risk failing my classes and I can’t take that risk. I have a quiz tomorrow and instead of studying I listened to Green Day and crying. I know I’m going to fail the quiz tomorrow but I have no motivation. 

The anniversary of my dads death is in less than two weeks. He died in an accident when I was thirteen. I found his dead body. That image and the voice of the 911 operator telling me to breathe are something that never leaves my head. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. The closer it gets to his death the more flashbacks and dreams I have. I can’t sleep because of it. 

After my dad died, my mom didn’t cope well. It was really really hard on her and she took out her frustrations on her kids. When I was a teenager she was emotionally abusive. She would call me names and was extremely controlling. My mental health was awful while living in my house. My mom is going to therapy and getting better but I still feel like I can’t talk to her about what’s going on and it sucks because I just want to turn to her and have her give me motherly comfort but I can’t. 

I looked down at my arm a little bit earlier and I saw all my self harm scars and it made me really want to self harm again. It also made me really sad. I don’t have anything to self harm with though and I promised myself a year and a half ago I wouldn’t ever do it again so I won’t do it but I still want to. I’ve also attempted to kill myself before and suicide is seeming like a good option right now but I know I could never actually do it. The thought of being dead makes me happy though. 

I’m having a huge mental breakdown and I’m just at a loss for everything. I don’t know what to do to deal with my sadness and my pain. I signed up for therapy with my university but my first appointment isn’t for another week and a half. I just want to curl up into a ball and ignore the world until I feel better. I want to talk to someone but I don’t have anyone to confide in. I wish I could do nothing. I wish I could call my ex and talk to his goofy ass that always made me laugh. 

I feel so unloved and lonely."
1635,I need help. My depression is paralyzing me in bed. What do I do?,"Not literally paralyzing, but it might as well be. I haven’t moved or done really anything at all for a month. I wake up, cry because I’m alive and then spend the whole day in bed thinking of things I should be doing, but no matter how much I try to push myself, nothing happens. My body doesn’t move and my thoughts race a thousand million miles an hour. I cannot focus on one thing, because the negative thoughts take the entire spotlight and I can’t run away, not even when meditating.

I’ve fought this depression for my entire life and I can feel it getting way worse every year.

I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I stopped caring about having a job or money. I don’t want to see or talk to anyone, but at the same time I feel so abandoned and alone.

Today I had a headache the whole day because I was feeling suicidal and other things happened that kind of stressed me out, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m... out of ideas. I just can’t get myself to do anything. I don’t even turn the TV on, for fuck’s sake. I don’t even feed myself! I haven’t eaten all day today and have been eating once a day for two weeks. 

I don’t like living like this. My last option is killing myself but I’m scared that it might actually come to that, because I’m just tired of everything and I’m not interested in whatever the future holds, even if it’s good, because I literally couldn’t care less about “experiencing” life when you die anyway.

If there is anyone with some ideas on how to tackle a depression that is this extreme, please let me know.

I really believe that, at this point, I am unable to fight this and I need extreme measures and help.

I’m sorry for being so negative, I really can’t help it.

Please, I need help. Once-a-week therapy and pills didn’t work. It feels so embarrassing to be such a failure in life for not being able to handle this myself like everyone else is. 

I don’t even know what joy feels like anymore, haven’t felt it in a few years. I am unable to enjoy any new activities I try or friends that I meet, so I decided to stay home and not waste my time on things that were requiring so much energy but were not making me feel better. It’s like now I am unable to feel love or any positive feeling from myself or anyone else.

My friends and family don’t know what to do and they just told me that I’m not trying hard enough or that it seems like I just don’t wanna try to get better. But it makes me furious because I’m trying my hardest and it’s been my entire life!!! How can you tell me I’m not trying when I’m still alive and I’m 26yo? Do people even care to give credit for what I have endured?!

I need help. I am extremely emotionally weak and it’s gotten to a point where I cannot do anything anymore. Just slowly waiting to die.

Tl;dr: I really really need help and advice. I have extreme depression that has ultimately taken control over me for the past three years. I have tried a million things and it’s only getting worse. I can see the clock ticking. Any advice on how to seek for help when you can’t do anything anymore?"
1636,Should I see a counselor or my regular doctor for memory loss?,"I am still rather young(31). But I do have some issues with memory. It has become enough of a problem that my husband seems to be worrying. 

I have been planning to go to a therapist that works with a psychiatrist in the same office as my regular doctor. I have anxiety and ADD and some childhood trauma. 

I know that sometimes emotional things like this can cause memory issues. I am just not if I should go to the therapist first and see if it helps or if I should go to my primary doctor."
1637,What goes into a neuropsychological testing?,"I’ve having crippling mental health issues that have made working almost impossible and my relationships (work/family/social) have become totally broken. I reached out to my insurance and was suggested to take neuropsychological tests by a neuropsychologist that works in the same practice as my psychiatrist. Mid 30s with awful history (refugee with violent abusive dad and lonely childhood from being rejected by peers). I’m already diagnosed with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety disorder, chronic insomnia and panic attacks. There is many hints I’m on the autistic spectrum. I’ve already failed 5 antidepressants, antipsychotics, various other meds and only thing that’s even keeping me together is a benzodiazepines prescribed reluctantly for almost a year by my psychiatrist that can make me sleep and break an awful day/night. Wondering what I could get out of testing and how intense I can expect treatment to be. I’m surging only by moving back home thanks to my loving elderly mom and her husband, no clue if I’d be on the streets totally destroyed without them."
1638,I feel like I've lost myself. I'm not sure what's going on.,"This may sound like rambling and I'm not sure where to start but I haven't been myself lately and I'm not sure how to fix this or how to get help.

Im 25 years old and I have always been extroverted, especially around friends, but lately I've felt very disconnected in social settings and just very disengaged and unhappy in general. I've always been able to make people laugh and make conversation and just talk. But now I'm unable to talk, nothing comes to my mind at all and I've noticed myself staying absolutely quiet in any social setting. I've also noticed nothing excites or makes me even happy. Whether it be plans, my future or even something simple like good food. My life is good. I'm not struggling financially, I have amazing friends and family, and I get to do things I enjoy pretty often. Yet I don't care anymore about any of it.

This summer I was crushing over this girl who I think is perfect and we even started dating last month. I'm sure she's picked up on this and she probably thinks I'm nervous or something as im unable to make  conversation or even text outside of small talk. She asked me what I wanted most in life/what was on my bucket list and I couldn't answer the question. Like I don't look forward to anything in the future. We've been seeing each other for a month and I really want this to work because she's amazing and one of the only things that makes me slightly happy of recent but I'm just not there and I don't feel like myself anymore. 

I feel like Ive ""checked out"" or something and I don't like it. I don't look forward to anything in life anymore and if I died right now I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't take my own life as I don't think I'm capable and it would destroy my parents but it's something that comes up sometimes.  

I should add that since last year I have started using certain psychoactive substances pretty sparingly. Smoking weed once or twice a week. Microdosing LSD and mushrooms once a month or so and a couple macrodoses this past summer. I'm thinking of taking a break from all of the above however.
 
Reading this back I feel like I'm still having trouble describing this accurately so if you have any questions feel free to ask."
1639,How to face difficult decisions and self doubt?,"Hey all I've only posted here once I'm sorry I haven't been very active and also if the formatting is weird im on mobile. Anyway I've been going through some big changes and its really taken a toll on me mentally. I was injured pretty badly awhile ago and it took me away from training to do a job I've been dreaming of since I was little. Recently I reentered training and until now I've been fine but my injury seems to be flaring up again. On top of that I've been in a slow downward depressive spiral for about three weeks and its hard to talk about any of it because I myself just see my own complaints as more of an annoyance than a problem. I'm afraid that my injuries have unfortunately gone too far and will keep me from my dream, I just don't exactly know how to come to terms with this, I've practically built me and my fiancés life around this and now I feel as though for once I literally have no idea what to do. I know we can't stay in our small town and just be coasting by. Neither of us want that. But im also at a loss its almost like I've gotten the mental wind knocked out of me. On top of that its made it hard to help my fiancé with her mental illness problems. I've become so overly sensitive that even the slightest change in expression sends me into high alert. She has been working very hard on getting her anxiety and manic and depressive episodes under control and im so proud of her! But even though she reassures me its just her own head being terrible to her I get paranoid I've done something wrong or feel it is my fault. How can I stop this feeling so I can help her even more? And how can I come to terms with possibly being rejected from my dream? Thank you to anyone who reads!"
1640,Should I tell my parents how severe my depression is?,[removed]
1641,Meds changed my personality. I'm off them now and I've changed again.,[removed]
1642,does anyone else not find “don’t worry that’s normal” not reassuring or comforting a lot of the time?,"so i have pretty bad anxiety and whenever i’ve tried to talk to family or counselors about what it is i’m feeling (i’m not able to see an actual therapist at the moment), a lot of the time i’ll hear something along the lines of “oh that’s perfectly normal” or “that’s alright i do the same thing” which i feel like should reassure me into feeling not alone, but instead it just makes me feel like i’m overreacting about my feelings since it’s apparently normal to feel. for example, i was talking to a counselor about the anxiety i get at school and how i feel constant paranoia about the smallest things and she responded like “well we all get anxious about doing certain things but it’s fine i do that too” and i know she was just trying to make me feel better but it just made me feel like maybe i was making too big of a deal and stressed me out way more.."
1643,I feel like a horrible person for even thinking about this,"I’m in the process of finding a therapist for some stuff that I won’t really go into but I’ve been trying to start figuring stuff out on my own as well, because I don’t really remember most of my life pre-high school. And I’ve had this horrible recurring thought/feeling over the years that I may have been s*xually *ssaulted as a small kid. It makes me feel absolutely horrible because I have no memory of something like that happening to me and how dare I even THINK about the possibility when there are real people out there who have been through something like that and they live with the memories and pain every day. But I’ve looked into it in the past and I’ve read posts by people who talk about stuff that hits too close to home for me to just completely brush off, and it would explain some of the things I would do when I was really young that I don’t know how else to explain. I feel like a terrible person for even considering it but at the same time it just feels like it fits and... I don’t know, I just had to get it out of my head so I hopefully feel less like the scum of the earth or something. Sorry."
1644,I think I have AD(H?)D. What next?,"I am a 20 year old male college student. I have had focus issues all my life.

Never wrote in my school agenda despite daily reminders from my mom throughout middle school.

Last year, I zoned out in 95% of my lectures, and this year is even worse with online school. There’s this switch that flips five minutes into class where I zone out and I can’t refocus. My brain blocks it out and I can’t stop it. 

I get hyper focused on the wrong things and I can’t stop. It’s always “one more hour” until the whole day goes by. This goes for Netflix, Side Projects, business ideas, a formula I want to crack, etc..

I’ve always wondered if I had ADD or ADHD. Never been diagnosed, but I sympathize with almost every symptom I learn about.

Whether I have it or not, my lack of focus is out of hand. And my mind is always thinking about something else that it can’t stop even when I know I should.

I think it’s leading to terrible sleep schedules and a screen addiction too.

I’m finally acknowledging I can’t manage this on my own. What do I do next? Do I suck it up and live like this? Is there a better way to manage this? Can I get medicated?"
1645,Why am I so happy in public but when I’m by myself I feel the opposite and often start crying?,"Like it’s so rare for me to get sad/ angry when I’m with my friends unless if I were to burst out a mental breakdown. Like as soon as I leave school and get in the car, I feel (I don’t want to say depressed because that’s extreme) but really sad where sometimes it becomes painful and I don’t want to speak to anyone. I want to cry so badly but like idk why, i feel like it could be partially that I miss my boyfriend but other than that I shouldn’t be really sad about that since I saw and talked to him today. I can’t understand why this sadness is causing me such pain, I can’t find the roots to it."
1646,workout issues??,[removed]
1647,Is it me or everyone else,"I’m confused on who I am, sometimes I feel amazing and great about myself and I think i’m attractive and full of energy then later that day I’ll be completely drained of any will and i’ll be super sad about everything and i don’t even want to look at myself. usually i’ll be okay when i’m with i’m with people and when i get home and i’m in my room alone i just start to spiral down. i call it “getting in my own head about things” it’s like brain just starts listing off all the bad things in my life and how terrible i feel and i just get deeper and deeper until i can either  snap out of it and and become super energetic out of nowhere or  stay like that. I have trouble with relationships with the people around me and i just start to feel unwanted so i distance myself from everything. i just want to have a stable mind i guess i don’t want to be super sad all the time, i only feel depressed when i’m alone but i hate my stepfather so i don’t want to go hangout upstairs with my mom, both of my siblings have moved out and barley come around anymore so i just feel alone in this house. i feel like i have to support from anyone mentally and i have to deal with all of my problems by myself. I have tried to talk about how i feel with my parents but both of them have just told me when i’m feeling down to just “snap out of it” . 
i have started hanging out with some of my old friends from middle school cause when high school started i went to a different one and i’m gonna try and switch because i think i’ll have more friends then i will at this school. when I start to feel really bad about myself i write poetry, it probably explains how i feel better then this word vomit above. i don’t want to re read it so sorry for typos.

No Support
I don’t feel welcome 
I don’t feel excepted 
I feel like the universe is trying to send me a message
that all the people around are just human messes 
that I don’t fit in cause it doesn’t want me to be infected
infected with a mindset that sets me back
sometimes it makes me want to bite the strap
i feel like i’m trapped
feel like my situation is capped
what is my life like, is it already mapped
what do I do
I have no role models 
no one to look up to
I feel like i’m in a zoo
not in my natural habitat 
i don’t mesh and i feel attacked 
they don’t really care 
neither do I
I just wanna fly away
throw all of my troubles away
i feel abandoned by myself i feel betrayed
I have no one else call me a stray
my mind is frayed 
nothing makes sense
i was born and my life was designed to make cents
i wish i was born with no modern civilization 
no gas stations 
when i’m at school i feel board 
like a rope around my neck i feel choked 
for this life i am not stoked
but like a fire i’m going out like i’m not toked 
like my necklace is a rope
i don’t know how i cope
one day at a time 
that’s what they say
alone with my mind 
that’s how i feel all the time
even when i’m with “friends”
they don’t care that i’m there
i’m just another face in a crowd
i wanna scream but can make a sound
if they knew how much i frowned 
maybe they would stick around 
feel like a king uncrowned 
feel like a fish that can drown
cant make sense this world is astound
all the hate, disasters, “go to school and get a masters”
nothing makes sense 
it’s greener on the other side of the fence 
i can smell the hate the bad stench 
they don’t understand me like french 
i’m not apart of the crowd 
cause of what’s behind my brow
the mind of my fathers and my brothers
we’re just the same
inside we feel blame
i do not feel the same
feel so old need a cane 
wish i was dead who would they frame
i really wish that you came
when i’m with you i feel sane
like i’m not the one to blame
no one likes me no fame
feel like the blue part of the flame
on this world i’m a stain 
hope none of this is in vane"
1648,I feel like I'm gonna die soon,"It just feels like my time here is short and I'm not supposed to be here for much longer, I don't want to kms, I'm just saying that it feels as though I can sense I won't be alive in a few days from now."
1649,My life's at an all time low 😃,"No fr time's have been rlly tough :( I gained 15 pounds over break so my mind hates me to my core more than ever since I've had body problems since my pre-teens. Now all I do is compare myself to every person I see and mentally beat myself up when someone looks healthier than me so u know my self esteem is just great~ but in all seriousness it's gotten rlly bad, to the point that I p*nch my stomach in frustration and feel worthless whenever I binge eat.
My anxiety and stress levels have been through the roof and I've been having stress dreams for nights in a row.

Im usually very open with my parents about my mental health but I've closed off a bit because my parents don't really understand mental health?? they think it's like something that I only feel in the moment, Like they'd be supportive and comforting when I open up but get frustrated and mad when it starts effecting their life's.

With all that and school, it's just very tiring. I try to hype up my friends to make sure that at least they can feel good abt themselves but it's HURTS especially when my totally healthy friend talks bad abt herself when im literally 20+ pounds heavier than her :|
I hope everyone else is also doing all right and that whatever bad things going on in their life gets better soon."
1650,Identifying level of depression,"I’m at 23f that’s struggled with depression on and off since roughly 13 years old. I’ve seen therapists throughout this time but struggled with consistency due to financial costs. I recently scheduled appointments to start back up in a few weeks as I’ve now hit a rough spot again but I’m worried about the level of depression I’m feeling.

Just to start I haven’t harmed myself in any way or actively planned it. But I’m experiencing days where I feel so unmotivated I have to literally drag myself out of bed. After 8 hours of work I feel so exhausted I sleep for hours immediately when I’m done. And when I wake back up I’m filled with such an intense feeling of boredom and apathy. Then at night I struggle to fall asleep and just feel completely encompassed in overwhelming sadness. I don’t break down and cry, just like I’m smothered in it and struggling to break past it unless I’m so exhausted I can’t keep my eyes open. 

Is this something that therapy alone can solve? Should I push for medication at this point? In patient therapy? Idk, it just feels so heavy and I don’t know how best to fix it."
1651,Lusting for a past memory,"I have a feeling that is always with me, it’s the feeling of the time lost. It’s the feeling of wanting to go back and relive all the moments I still hold onto. I’m 22 and I’ve been single now for almost 3 years. Every time a girl tries to flirt with me or ask me out, I will have a reason to put it off or turn her away. I can’t let go of my ex. I think about her all the time. I don’t understand how people say there are “in love” or something because all my friends (or just people in general) just date people and get dumped or dump they ex and then just say bad things about then and trash talk them. That’s not love! You can’t just say you love someone and then turn around and put them down with your words. I used to believe live wasn’t real. But after I feel in love, I realized it was real. She doesn’t love me anymore and needed a new life without me, and I love her so much I just want her to be happy and feel loved. Even if that person isn’t me. She deserves it. I miss her every moment of the day and I don’t have anything bad to say about her. She is beautiful and sweet and sexy. But that’s not the reason I feel in love with her. I fell in love with her because her heart is love. She is everything people hope to be, but never can reach to. She truly puts others before herself and cares about other people’s feelings. She is the girl who stops by the dog shelter every day after work and plays with the dogs who don’t have anyone to love on them. She’s the girl who meets you at 2:30 AM in the Walmart parking lot to let you cry and explain why you aren’t feeling strong. I don’t know how to explain how her heart really is because I don’t know any other person to compare it to. Her heart is what I feel in love with. It was just icing on the cake that she was pretty. I will always love her. And I’m not suicidal anymore. I just feel really alone and I know I’m going to be alone, but I just didn’t realize how hard this would be. It’s not a pain that suddenly falls on you, it’s a deep pain that creeps it’s way in slowly day by day, Month by month, year by year. I just hope the pain slows down because it’s a lot to hold sometimes. Anyways... sorry for the rant. I hope this finds someone"
1652,I don’t know what happened,[removed]
1653,Just something I wrote out while thinking about life.,"Life just feels like one thing after another. Just always disappointment. I kinda just feel empty like I could do more, be more. I dont always think this every waking hour but it's just always in the back of my head. My mind may not be on if directly but subconsciously I feel so useless to everything. I always try and get life to work but it just never does in the way I want it to. I spend to much money on useless stuff. I eat to much junk and not enough good foods and still eat to little. I have so many bad habits that suck. I bite my nails, smoke too much kush, do drugs once and a while, vape way to much, sit on my ass and do dont the shit I want too (even basic chores or fun stuff) and overall just a negative mindset. I used to be such a happy kid now I smoke to much and always disappoint people. I always feel like the odd one out in a friend group. Like a awkward sack of shit but that ain't nothing new.I try and be true to myself but sometimes I'm just not. I feel like I mask who I am sometimes And I dont know if it's a mask or who I am. I have changed so much for the better and the worse. But I fear that the bad outweighs the good in that I am and of who i became. I've been so stressed. I also feel so angry. Angry at life. Angry at myself and the anger just turns into a deep burning ball of rage and hate for myself and everything. I just want to scream and talk to someone but I'm just gonna write this out and bottle up the feelings I have and just continue to act ""happy and content"" with how my life so no one will know and think less of who I am (except reddit now :/).I'm just pissed that life turned this way. I see the good In my life right now but i also see the bad. There is a lot of bad right now it always feels like one step forward and two steps back ."
1654,Dissociative Identity Disorder or just Sleep Deprivation?,"Sometimes a memory just feels like a story I know and not really something that happened to me. As if I'm not the person I used to be. Sometimes when I say my own name, like introducing myself, it doesn't feel like it's actually my name, though I know it is. Sometimes it feels like my memory is slipping. I used to always be the first to memorize my lines in a play, my good memory was a trait of mine that those close to me knew. But now I'm forgetting details about even recent events. Like I transferred jobs sites about 3 months ago and I have to sit and think a minute to remember old supervisors name. It doesn't effect anything else in my life really. 

Though I do work graveyard shifts, it's common for me to work 12 hour shifts and get maybe 3 hours sleep between them. I've been working graveyard shifts for about a year and a half, and I know sleep deprivation can cause issues with memory and concentration. 

Am I going crazy or just burning myself out? Haha"
1655,Can't seem to stop until I've completely destroyed myself,"Just overall exhausted. I can't stop clenching my jaw even when I conciously try to relax it. Horrible migraine all day, no relief. Running myself ragged inside with guilt and freaking out that I broke the law somehow or did something so wrong my life is over. Called lawyers freaking out and worried and they all told me the same thing: you didn't break the law. Yet, I can't shake this need to ""turn myself on"" or that ""the authorities"" are going to ruin me. 

I can logically see all of this makes absolutely no sense, but I feel powerless to stop it. I just can't calm down at all. I'm completely miserable and have regressed so far as a person I'm unrecognizable. I miss being ""me"" instead of whatever this is I've become. A shut in, no friends, no job, no future. Convinced I'm going to be jailed and my reputation destroyed. Constantly running the scenarios through my head. I just want some peace."

1657,Developing memory issues,"I don't know if this is the right place, but i also don't know where else to start. I'm a 27 year old male on the autism spectrum, and diagnosed with ADHD I've never had great memory (typical autistic trait: i can remember tons of useless trivia but not important things), but lately ive found its gotten way worse. I repeat stories/jokes a lot because i cant remember if i've told them. Im having a much harder time retaining names and faces of people i meet. Ill frequently misplace items i was just holding and spend 5-10 minutes looking for something directly in front of me. It takes me way longer to learn new things, or to pick up things i havent done in a while. The worst right now is the ""fake"" memories. Usually with simple tasks. Someone will ask me if i've done something and i'll immediately say ""yup"" because i remember doing it, even if i hadn't done that thing that day.even if it was seconds after i should have done it. It feels like a record skip in my brain. Its starting to affect my life really negatively; i feel like im losing my mind. Why can't i remember things like ""clean the dishes"" or ""where are my socks"" but have no issue recalling every make and model of ship in star wars?? I don't drink, or smoke, and im no longer on any medication. I've always been absentminded but its getting so much worse lately and im terrified of it..."
1658,Mental Signs ARE really ignored sometimes. Sigh....,"Idk how many time I've messaged some friends and they asked how life is and I literally say ""ehh, it's okay"" 
And they ask what's wrong, i tell them and all I get is the ""oh everything will be alright"" and then next subject. 

I don't insist on the conversation because I feel like a burden and if they feel happy in their life I don't want to be the reason why it's not okay anymore. 

Social media...I've shared things, a lot of things, regarding mental health and how it's sad how people always say ""the signs were there, i wish I would've seen them before"". I think about this a lot. 

For a few months now I've experienced that myself. Nobody has bothered to message me if I'm okay, not ""friends"" or ""family"". I started thinking if I were to end things, not saying that Im suicidal but putting myself in others shoes, people would just say the exact same thing that they always say ""I wish I would've...."" and then they'd feel horrible for not seeing the signs. 

Yes, it is my responsibility to seek help, this feeling right now is just temporary. I'm not suicidal. But it hurts. It hurts to feel alone. It hurts to feel like you have nobody in your life. I hurts to feel like your throwing signs out and nobody cares or is paying attention. 

Is this what people feel when they're contemplating their life? Maybe I am suicidal and I'm in denial because I feel guilty and I should never think that way because I have kids and it's selfish of me to think that way.

I need help, I'll be looking for a therapist tomorrow. 
I'm in ny feelings right now, I'm sure it will pass i just thought I'd let out what I was feeling. Sorry."
1659,I don't want to remember,"I've been through a lot, and maybe one of the things I hated and wanted to drag myself out of- my addiction to cannabis- was a blessing in disguise. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's mainly a psychological addiction. It's a craving like no other craving I've ever expierienced.

I won't get into a whole lot of specifics other than I've never lived in an environment where everyone I've lived with was good to me, and I've been abused by so many of the people I've been close to. I have never lived in a place where I felt wanted, or even welcome.

I was abused by a doctor who tried to get me naked with no good reason (he could have asked questions to find out what he wanted to know), got mad at me for not getting naked, and broke HIPPA to tell my mom I was transgender to cover up his tracks because he knew she wouldn't believe me if she thought I was just angry about that and trying to get him into trouble. I was a minor and very scared of my parents, who would not have taken well to me trying to report this doctor, especially being that he gave them info they wanted to know.

My abusive ex moved into my dorm room on my first day of college without giving me a choice. He also pushed me to smoke a ton of weed, among other drugs.

By the end of the school year I realized that I had a huge problem. I couldn't function without weed and I constantly craved it. It dulled the pain of being around him and having a nasty past. If I didn't smoke i would sit in class just thinking about how bad I needed it, how good it would feel to just take that first puff, how amazing it would be to smoke a bowl and go pile up a ginormous salad in the dining hall afterwards. What's weird though, is that I actually seemed to focus a lot better in class when I was high.

This is the first time in almost 2 years that I've been able to decide to stop smoking weed when I had the choice to. My partner(not the nasty guy) is proud of me, and I feel like I'm letting him down with my current realization- I don't want to be able to remember all these things that keep flooding back. I dont want my brain to work right. 

I just turned 21 and I've been drinking, but recognizing that I've been drinking a lot, and I've already made rules for myself about it, because seeing how hard it's been to quit smoking weed, I dont want to start drinking like that, but...

I think in order to keep myself away from alcoholism and keep myself from the pain of living those memories over and over again and having them keep me up all night just isnt worth it. I need to smoke. I need to get high. I need to forget. 

Weed makes me hate myself a lot less. I enjoy my life more when I'm high. I'm not as anxious or depressed. I'm just so tired.

Maybe I'm not in the right mindset. Who knows? I'll bring it up to my therapist next time i see her. She did tell me that it takes around 6 months of abstaining to start feeling good after an addiction. Maybe she's right, and I just need to relearn how to deal with the memories.

Maybe I'm just really badly addicted. Before I smoked I had no trouble dealing with all the abuse I suffered emotionally. I had no issue powering through everything. I'm so tired now. I'm so so so tired.

The weird thing is, when bad things happen to me now, theres no emotional reaction, no feelings attached other than guilt if my mom is trying to manipulate me, even though I know that's exactly what's happening.

The really emotional things and the things that mess me up to think about are deep in my past. It takes me a long time to realize how traumatic something is and when it hits me it kills me and smoking puts a stop to it.

I'm depressed and anxious to the point where I would be considered disabled if I had the motivation to go through and confirm that. I can't work. I can't remove myself from my horrible living situation. My parents have called the cops on me as an adult and somehow convinced them to make me take a ride in a squad car back home. 

Im trapped. Im being isolated. I haven't seen some of my closest friends in over a year and a half because my parents wont let me. Im 21 and I just cant do anything without the approval of my parents. The 2-3 horr screaming fest and ripping apart my room every time aren't worth it. They keep telling me they'll do anything to help yet they make it worse constantly. 

Why are they so strict? Because they think marijuana will kill me before I kill myself when they won't let me leave the house or have any money. 

In all reality, I'm not planning on killing myself but because of chronic illness as well as such severe mental illness I can't fathom any escape. For God's sake my parents are rich and will pay for the best lawyers to get a conservatorship over me before they let me leave, and even if I were to somehow get out of it, they would make my life hell in every way possible.

Im so damn tired."
1660,Illusions? Should I be worried?,[removed]
1661,21 years old and I don’t even feel like it,"The combination of mental illnesses I have is really starting to take a toll on me. Not only mentally, but physically as well. I’m so tired these days. I don’t have motivation to do anything and I’m just...I’m exhausted. My mind never shuts off and sleeping is really the only way I can get a break. Between the anxiety, depression, bpd, and minor schizophrenia, I’m losing it. I don’t feel sane anymore. I feel like I’m on autopilot all day and I’m just passing through. I can’t bring myself out of my head and it’s actually driving me insane."

1663,Need advice for someone I care about...,
1664,I have so much trouble emotionally connecting with anyone,"I'm not a mean person, nor shy, but I straight up do not emotionally connect with most people. I have a fiance, I care about my sister, and I was really attached to my dog (like devastated, in a deep depression when she died), but that's pretty much it. I've always had friends (up until I graduated college) but I never really cared when most of them fell out of my life (usually due to me not responding or contacting them). I always felt like I was just keeping up being friends with people because that was expected of me.

It doesn't help that I have terrible terrible memory. Like, I don't remember how most of my past ""friends"" were as people or how I interacted with them, things I did with them, etc. I have straight up forgotten the existence of people that I spent a lot of time with only a few years ago (and then my fiance will bring it up and I'm like ""holy shit I FORGOT they existed""). I wonder if that has anything to do with the reason I don't really miss people? I guess I don't remember what I'm supposed to miss.

Part of me feels like I need to go to therapy, but my life had been basically coasting on easy mode outside of some depression problems when I was younger and college stress."
1665,been feeling really depressed lately... *trigger warning mentions of su!cide and f!rearms*,"lately i’ve been feeling really depressed.... it’s nothing out of the ordinary but i’m scared that i might do something impulsive... 
i’ve been thinking of purchasing a firearm (illegally cuz i live in canada) and finally putting an end to myself, but i don’t know if i’ll be able to actually manage it. there are lots of things to consider, place, time, date, how strong the firearm is, will i be able to pull the trigger and make sure the bullet ends up killing me in an instant rather than just severely damaging me.

honestly these are things i think of every day because i try to find death in every scenario (for example, going somewhere as innocent as the mall means taking the train which is a potential thing i can use to k!ll myself). it’s ridiculous because i can’t manage to do anything without thinking of ways i can end myself. 

anyway, as i said, this is nothing new, but i’m always impulsive and i get in risky situations all the time, so if i DO purchase anything i’ll basically HAVE TO end myself cuz the thought of owning a firearm is scary, and also the money isn’t mine, so if i don’t kill myself that means i’ll have to live and explain to the person why half their money is gone lmfao. 

i have lots of issues (i’m an 18 y/o female) like ED, anxiety, panic disorder, and severe depression and whatever, i stopped speaking w my friends a few weeks ago and stopped speaking to my therapist too ((he never even bothered to call or text back which made me quite sad :/ )) i also stopped taking my meds cuz i was too exhausted but it’s only been a few days so i’m gonna try to force myself to take them... 

anyway, i just need an opinion on how to get by for now without doing anything reckless.

1670,Helping people,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to learn how to support people in distress better. I tried to assist in something earlier, but I was overwhelmed quickly (luckily I had other people to call on to assist). I would just like some tips on how to help. For example, what to and not to say.

Thanks :)"
1671,I feel like there’s something connecting all of my issues but I have no clue what,"I had selective mutism as a young child. I may be a HSP but am not sure. I started trichotrillonomia at age 12 but it’s very mild now. I’ve always had some obsessive overthinking. I am almost positive I have a deviated septum. The ENT doctor mentioned I had sinusitis and gave me nasal spray a while ago. I have Tourette’s syndrome although it doesn’t interfere with daily life too much. I’m pretty sure my mom is emotionally abusive/ narcissist/ controlling. I have been able to keep close friends easily but think I may have social anxiety or anxiety. J was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd. I couldn’t focus on professors no matter how much I told myself to focus and started at the screen- I’ve been like this since I was a young kid. Focusing on assignments felt impossible. I know I’m smart and motivated enough to do much better in school but my grades are very bad. I startle very easily. I have convergence isnfuciciancy I think it is part of adhd. I remember in class not being able to see a color pencil held on the side of my head for an experiment &amp; all the other kids could. I’ve always naturally started walking towards the grass or diagonally one the sidewalk and had trouble looking around where I was going. Adderall helps with this and fixes it. I had to issues reading because I couldn’t comprehend and anything and my eyes naturally skipped but Adderall helps this too. It was helping with self doubt issues before but I feel like I constantly wonder if I’m a good person and what Is wrong with me. I’ve always had a nasal voice that sounds helium like naturally &amp; a bit of valley girl speak which I try to control. My mom says she thought I had oppositional defiance disorder but I don’t relate to that in anyway and have no issue following instructions. I feel like I get sick very easily and my sicknesses last a long time. My sophomore year of hs- me &amp; this one other girl were sick for three months but I never got a diagnosis because strep and mono came back negative. It was like I was constantly hacking coughing &amp; couldn’t laugh or speak without hacking my lungs out. Some people say sleep apnea causes adhd but I’m slightly underweight not overweight &amp; don’t wake up in the middle of the night. Before I got nasal spray I was unable to even drink water or chew food without gasping for air after because I had no ability to breath.

I saw some of these things are comorbodies with EDS  but I don’t have chronic pain. I do have some of the other symptoms though 
Soft skin
Bendy back
Arms can connect in back- easily scratch my back and zip my own dresses
Told shoulders are different
Long arms 
Ankle issues from running
Back posture is strange"
1672,about to get admitted to inpatient,im so anxious i cant feel my legs
1673,feel like i need a break and i dont want to do anything,i just want to sleep for a very long time and im too tired to do anything ever again.
1674,i dont think im well,"there's alot of bugs and pests where i live. this past year, i had found a new way of getting back at the bugs that bother me. i'd bought a few small glasses and jars, and saw best use to them to take the bugs that always found their way in my room and put them in the jar. at first it was to kill them indirectly. i'd fill the jar up with water and wait until the bug drowned. but later i just kept them there. didnt want to kill them anymore. there was this one spider that i kept for four months before it finally died.  yesterday, a big moth came through my window. i caught it and put it in a jar again. i think i broke its wings, because it wouldnt fly away anymore. it only moved its legs and body. in the jar, it couldnt move at all. i guess that gave me a morbid idea that if i took it out of the jar, it still couldnt go anyway. it was just alive. so without thinking about it much i went ahead and picked a few of my art supplies, namely water paint, took out the moth and started colouring it dark shades of blue and green. it looked pretty to me, but the whole time the moth was alive. still is. i knew i was putting the thing through a lot of stress but i didnt stop anyway. at one point i almost put the painted moth in my mouth. i dont know why. after i was done i put it back in the jar. it's still there. i understand what i did wasnt normal. im disturbed, but not freaking out yet. what bothers me most is that i know if another moth comes flying in, i'll do the same thing to it. i enjoyed doing it, and i guess that lack of regret, and the sudden urge to eat the moth were both the things that weirded me out the most."

1676,"I need help, I'm having sleep problems because of anxiety and issues from my past","Hi, I'm 19 years old male college student. I'm currently studying Psychology yet it seems that I'm not able to help myself.

I had severe depression last year because of issues in my class, rejection, and being in a wrong cycles of friends. Long story short my life last year is so messed up. I even self harmed last year and I have to rely on xanax (antidepressant) to make myself calm and to make myself sleep. I also have known that my so called friends are backstabbing me. Now I have trust issues.

Today, I thought I learned and become a better version of myself but still. The pain and sadness I'm feeling is never ending. It is because my ex gf left me during my birthday, it's been 5 months now since we broke up but I still can't move on even though we no longer have contacts for 5 months and I have removed and deleted everything that could remind me of her.

To make things worse my gf probably talked to most of our classmates and ruined me a lot from her story. Of course she also told it about those back stabbers which made them happier so they can ruin me a lot more. I can't believed that I even begged my ex for her to be back but nothing happens. I even went to her house during this pandemic but of course, it is such waste of time because her grandma simply told me that she wasn't there when I went there.

I am very broken and it feels like I was beyond repair. I got rid of my social media accounts and I was not able to talk to anyone for so long.

I can't even tell my mom that I think I should be back for antidepressants again because we're having problems financially.

I'am very tired and I really want to sleep but my stupid brain always reminds me these horrible experiences from my past. I'm starting to be suicidal again and I don't know what to do anymore.

All my gf do is cry and cry and cry and cry and cry then tell and tell and tell and tell and tell to others how disgusting of a person I'am. She is very pessimistic and it is extremely rare for me to see her being positive and optimistic. She is one hell of a negative person. Yet my stupid self keeps missing her and wanting her.

I'm tired...I want rest but I can't...my pain seems never ending...I don't know what to do anymore."
1677,"I don’t want kids because of my mental illness, will I change my mind?","I don’t know who to talk to about this. I posted on another sub and it was rejected because I didn’t ask the right question.

I’ve (30F) been diagnosed with major depression and after 3 years of therapy and a year on new medication I’ve changed for the better. I feel really happy and in control of my illness and mental health.

Husband (35M) and I never talked about kids much, we’re married 4 years , together for 10. In the beginning he wasn’t interested in kids and I was ok with that and assumed we weren’t having any. We had a rough time for the first 2 years of marriage but after I got help we’re doing great and both happy. But it’s still hard to talk about “serious” things - specifically kids, he doesn’t really like discussing the future and he says “well we’re not ready so no point in talking about it”. It feels weird to me, I feel like normal couples talk about it (whether they want to or not) what their parenting philosophy is etc. 

My issue is that i think he is thinking about it and doesn’t want to be childfree anymore. Which at the start of marriage was ok for me (I didn’t mind if he really wanted children) but now I’m starting to think I can’t do it. I’ve lived my whole relationship mentally thinking I’m not going to be a mother. Now I realise I don’t think I’d be a good mother and I don’t know if our marriage could survive it. I feel like it’s taken a lot to get to where we are now and if we have a child in a few years time it could ruin it. Whenever people talk about kids it just looks like so much sacrifice and hard work. I understand it’s rewarding and fulfilling but you have to give up so much of yourself and I feel like I mentally wouldn’t be able to handle that. 

I’m much better with my mental illness now but I still struggle so much with getting things done around the house especially when I’m working. I do the bare minimum to get by and my husband does a lot of the chores. Has anyone dealt with this before? Did you decide you weren’t having kids but changed your mind? I want to tell my husband I don’t want to have kids but I don’t want to shut the door completely if things could change in a few years. 

My therapist tells me not to worry and I have 10 years to decide. I want to go to marriage counselling with my husband but he doesn’t think we need it. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it and “jumping the gun” and need to let things take it’s course. I’m not a “wait and see” kind of person I get anxious and depressed if I don’t know where my future is going and if I don’t have a plan. We are also South Asian so my mom tells me I’ll regret it if I don’t have kids while I can. It’s an elephant in the room when I see my in laws or friends and family our age with kids (no one is pressuring us thankfully but I’m always conscious about how we don’t have any and are not planning on it) 4 years is a long time in our families to be married without kids. 

Any thoughts / advice welcome. Thank you."
1678,I need help how to lie to my employer.,"Hi I'm new here. I really hope I don't step on anyone's toes here. I read the rules, and from what I understand, this is okay to reach out about. Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm super nervous to reach out about this.

Okay, so I'm having an absolute mental breakdown and legitimately considering suicide, as in getting the letter written in my head.  The walls are closing in. The catalyst was an abusive relationship I just ran away from. I feel like my soul left my body.

I live in extreme geographical isolation. I have many friends from all over. I know I am not truly alone, but right here and right now the walls are closing in.

There is no other way out.

I also live in an area where mental health doesn't really exist and is super taboo. 

I had a psychiatrist before and stopped going. I thought my anxiety had disappeared. I thought I could be better on my own.

I reached out to him again and made an emergency appointment first thing in the morning. Finding him in itself is an absolute miracle. Actually mental health clinics and professionals in general aren't really a thing, so medication is really the only help I can get right now. I'm desperate and I'll take what I can get. 

I lied to my employer stating that I need this appointment during company hours because ""of a serious internal issue"" and I need to travel to this specific office's location because ""it is a specialist"". When asked a bit more, I said it was ""severe stomach issues--can't keep anything down"". This also isn't a complete lie.

The employer was sympathetic to what I said. 

How else can I lie tomorrow if I'm asked to provide more information? Do I just say ""I'm not fully understanding the issue and they need to run some tests?"" Blah blah blah? 

If asked for a doctor's note I'm just going to say ""gosh I'm so sorry I was in such a hurry to get back to work!""

Admitting to a mental health issue could legitimately result in termination and destroy my career as a whole. I could be unemployable for now on if the truth is found out. No, I can't quit or just get a new job. I'm literally bound to this. I actually like the job enough, I'm just at a loss here.
 
I'm sorry and thank you."
1679,I don’t think I need therapy but some medication may help?,"Hey sorry if this isn’t right for the subreddit, but I’ve been going through a lot lately and my anxiety has skyrocketed. Because of recent events (and how I’ve reacted to them), I think I may be bipolar or having some sort of episode. I was diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety in high school, but I’m 20 now and haven’t seen a professional for probably four years now. 

From what past therapists have told me, therapy is a tool to get you to a healthy enough mental space that even though you’re dealing with things you can handle them in a healthy way. I feel that I do this and I honestly am proud of the way I handle things, but sometimes panic attacks get too much. 

Because of some things that have happened to me recently I’ve found myself having panic attacks that I can pull myself out of. All of this because I think after years of dealing with my mental health (about 10 yrs), I’m able to cope now in healthy ways and realize pain is temporary when it gets really bad. Although I’m saying this, I feel that when I have really bad anxiety I can’t go on with my day to day life. I’m bed ridden basically for days or weeks only because the physical aspects are crippling for me. I have stomach issues, can’t sleep, and I can’t eat because I just throw it all up which in turn makes me weak because I’m not eating. 

I just feel therapy isn’t beneficial for me because I think I deal with these things healthily; I talk to people, get out as much as I can, have positive thoughts, etc. But sometimes my body just doesn’t let me physically. Therefore, I feel like there’s not much a therapist could tell me or help me with because I’m genuinely using the normal “therapy advice” and coping mechanisms to their full potentional. 

I feel like I need an outside perspective on my situation. I’m thinking maybe a psychologist/iatrics appointment would better fit my needs just to manage the panic attacks? Also because I’d really prefer not to be on anti depressants or anything that may change my moods long term from past experience. Thank you in advance!"
1680,CPTSD or depression?,"I had a turbulent childhood with an emotionally absent father and an unstable, angry and frustrated mother who resented me for ruining her life. Was constantly bullied and hit by my brother, and my sister was also really mean to me. Lead to self harm and I think I had untreated depression for years. Isolated myself in my room and trusted nobody, had no friends and only found comfort from my cat. 

I became a people pleaser and was afraid of showing my true self. Somehow I managed to get a sweet boyfriend, and a few good friends during my university time. Did not finish my degree but managed to get a good job regardless. 

I’m 27 now and I feel like my act is crumbling. I can’t function in my job, I isolate myself even more and have on and off insomnia. I feel like a failure, a burden and I’m so tired and sad all the time. I feel so guilty for not doing my job. I procrastinate instead. I feel guilty for not contacting my friends. I lie to my boyfriend that I’m okay. I feel hopeless and I don’t know how to talk about my issues, writing here is a bit easier... I asked my GP to get a psychiatrist but I am so scared she won’t believe me. She’s not the best GP but in my country (Norway) we have to go through them first. 

I don’t know if this is CPTSD or depression or if I’m just stressed. Can you give advice on how to talk to my GP and psychiatrist and how to open up to my bf and friends? Also if anyone here is from Norway in Rogaland area, any psychiatrist you can recommend?"
1681,I can’t find purpose,I’m 18 and starting college this year however I’m starting very late ( in uk most people start at 16 after leaving high school) I prepared for the last year to do an art course however on the first day left after an hour because I was petrified. I then panicked because I had nothing to do and signed up for an ict course my friend is doing at a much smaller college. I don’t want to do this course it’s 2 years long I just panicked and joined it. I have an interest in art but completely bottled that course and can’t sign up for anymore for another year now. I feel like an absolute loser and can’t find any purpose or direction to go in.
1682,Not answering birthday calls and texts. Wrong?,
1683,I M(20) am pretty fed up with my brain.,"I'm venting at the moment, but I would love any help I can get. Warning: I am being blunt as heck.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 19. This was after I drove myslelf to the hospital because I was feeling uncontrolably suicidal. I laid in bed for 5 hours waiting for a social worker, and after a 15 minute talk, it was determined that I should spend some time at our local suicide prevention center. I stayed for 3 days, talked to a psychiatrist over web-cam for 15 minutes, and was prescribed zoloft. I took those for 8 months, 50mg, but it only made things more foggy than they already are.

That hospital trip cost me $3000, and I haven't paid a cent. I'm $1,500 in debt for schooling that I have no degree to show for it. I quit my job printing donald trump tshirts in february because it hurt my soul. I now live off of unemployment, don't have therapy, and am very much struggling.

I used to always have suicidal thoughts, but those have dampened as they seemed to be my greatest issue. I have been working on it. I also have friends now who would miss me. This is a problem, though. I keep finding myself angry with them over the smallest things, and they are my best friends. That hurts my feelings a lot, and makes me feel like a bad guy. It is pretty irrational, and I try so hard to stop. I feel the pain of 1000 needles any time I am passive aggressive or just normal aggressive.

Besides for that, I only ever want to be alone. I wamt to tell everyone that they can go fuck off and die, but that doesn't make any sense to me. Simply, I don't understand why lately I have been so prone to anger when I know that I am generally kind. It feels as if something is wrong with me, but I will never find out what that is. These days are flying by so fast that nothing seems important anymore. Nothing is fun. It has been happening for months, and I would only like for it to stop.

I am generally pretty active in life. I have been watering my tomato plants, and I cook at least a meal a day. Still, though, I'm wading through the same depressive waters and I don't know how to get out. Marijuana really helps for me to manage my trauma, but not this. I can smoke a bowl or take a dab to calm myself down or to really analytically think about something, but it doesn't take away my pain. I can't even think of a prospect that would make me happy, nor do I have any dreams. I have everything that I've ever wanted in life at 20 (A computer/Girlfriend/Room/Food/Cat/Friends).

Maybe I need some fulfillment, but I can't get a job, either. My phone is at 2% and I don't wanna lose this post so..."

As a background, I was brought to the hospital for my exam anxiety and given meds. I was also sent to therapy by my school when they found out I had a suicidal plan. The thing is, the doctor has never actually stated I have any mental problems and despite having a plan for suicide, I feel like I won't act on it even if I really want to. I feel like I am looking for attention by even mentioning this to other people. Am I being insensitive to people who are actually diagnosed to have mental problems?"
1690,What am I experiencing?,I worked in retail 5-6 years ago and I haven’t worked in retail since but I still have been having nightmares and random memory flashbacks to my really rude and mean bosses/ managers. I don’t know what this means it was kinda weird.

1692,"Why is diversion risk more important than getting clean? Why is it harder to get a doctor to trust me than to get heroin? And how the DEA is lowering quota for opioid medications even more, down 33%, for 2021. Everybody knows COVID-19 is worsening the opioid epidemic. IAmA September 21st, 10 am ET","Megan was a patient of mine, whose life was taken too soon. She was a girlfriend, a daughter, and a mother, and based on how she was treated, she was seen more as an addict than a patient with an addiction. 

She tried to get herself off heroin and went to me to treat her anxiety that inevitably formed. But then I got questioned whey I was giving a former heroin addict suboxone.

It did not matter that she was taking the steps to treat herself. That she was doing the things she needed to do to help her daughter and mother. No matter what she was doing, the DEA just saw her as an addict.

The DEA felt the diversion risk she posed was greater than the addiction she was trying to overcome.

They didn't get that she would get anxiety when she got clean. Apparently mental health for a former addict is a crime.

As a result, she fell out of the healthcare system and into despair and depression.

She committed suicide a few days before her daughter's birthday.

In memory of her I began the start of my opioid education initiative that has since grown into so much more.

Now I'm hosting an IAmA later today, ostensibly to discuss my opioid project, my book, and my experiences as a physician in dealing with the opioid crisis.

But what I have learned, and what I plan to discuss more, is this immense, yet chaotic healthcare - for lack of better term - influence that exists in Reddit. There is no one person that controls the healthcare conversation, and we all know the varying degrees of posts and conversations that take place here.

Yet amidst the chaos like some organizational force, some influence, that can be used in a positive way. I do not know how, but over the course of my fundraising efforts, I will encourage dialog in which I discuss my work, but more learn from everybody how they use Reddit to discuss healthcare.

Listen, as much as we would like to believe, there is more we do not know than know about COVID-19, the opioid epidemic, and indeed so much about healthcare. And people are scrambling for data to figure it out.

I am interested to see how and why we say what we do and we post what we post. That would go a long way in understanding our own thoughts and our own perceptions of healthcare.

In many ways, we should be leading the research efforts and conversations that take place on Reddit. This platform has more users than any healthcare system has patients.

We all can carve out our own personal space to do good if we just know how we can help each other.

Hopefully I see you all there today for the IAmA. We are all Megan."
1693,How do you deal with apathy?,"Hello,
I've been dealing with not being able to feel emotions and I've come to the realization that I may be apathetic. Like I genuinely just cannot feel any emotion, I just go by the day as a hollow shell.

I hate not being able to feel, I've been thinking of going to therapy for it but I do not know what to say. I'm sick of feeling like a robot and just going about the day empty. I'm assuming it's from my battles with my mental health, and as a last resort my body just shut off all emotions to cope. I hate it.

Does anyone that has suffered from apathy or just knows anything can tell me how to get rid of it? Or do I have to go to therapy (I dread having to go because I know ill mess up and not say the right things)"

1698,Why don't i feel sad about the death of another?,"I'll need to put a little context, I'm below 18, and I'm an introverted teenager, i have friends but i don't enjoy being with them.

So, when i was a kid, my uncle, who was in the military, died, and everyone in my family cried, everyone except me and a few other people.

I was quite close to him, i never hated him, i remember whenever he would visit my home he would make up lies about his time in the military, and as a dumb kid, i believed him, he never exposed me to guns, and i was never really fond with them.

When i was around the age of 12, my uncle died, and that's where i realized something, i didn't feel sad.

I'm not trying to act 'cool' or 'badass' I'm actually confused, I'm a human, and another human died, and i didn't cry.

I didn't feel sad at all, i didn't feel happy as well, i don't know why but it just felt normal.

""Everyday thousands of people die, why should i cry over one?"" i said that to myself when i went home.

I remember my relatives telling me about how strong i was, but i didn't feel a thing, i just accepted it.

Right now I'm much older, and i heard news about another of my relative's dying.

I wasn't close with this relative, so i think it was normal that i didn't feel sad, but since i was older, i was curious.

Why was everyone crying? i said to myself.

I went back home, then went onto YouTube, there, i searched for videos about murders, shootings, bombings, and whenever i would check the comments, i would always see people talk about how sad it was that innocent people died.

I watched a video talking about the Sandy Hook Shooting, and when i heard that 27 children and teachers died, i just thought ""It's not even that much""

I don't like the way i think, i want to change, i wanted to change, so that's why i kept on watching more videos about shootings, serial killings, and murder.

I wanted to feel sad, i wanted to feel sadness.

And yet i didn't feel a thing, i just thought it was normal, i thought that death was just normal.

To me, life is just a cycle, we are born, we go to school, and graduate, we get a job then we work and work and work until we get old enough to get retirement money, and anyone who goes against this cycle, is either poor or stupidly rich.

To me, we are just slaves to fate.

But of course i want to change, i don't want to have such a heartless heart when it comes to death.

Am i mentally ill? i can speak properly, my grades are average, and i live a normal life, its not abusive and its not luxurious.

I remember seeing an article online about writing a book to try and change your view of things, i didn't know how to write back then, but i was desperate to change.

I opened Microsoft word and taught myself, a person who never even wrote a single story before, to start writing,

I just wrote what ever was on my mind, i didn't change anything in my story, i just wrote what i was thinking of at that moment.

It was a story about a high school boy with no heart (in terms of emotions) who died and woke up in another world, there, he would find change, and he would go on to become a hero who lights the world with happiness.

It was a short story, no longer than 2000 words, and it was really badly written, the first lines were along the lines of 'The sky was blue and the sun was yellow, the yellow light of the sun went into the window beside Ken', it was like a children's story, written by a child (teenager specifically).

I since deleted the boring story, and now started writing a new one, this time, i made the character resemble me, he was heartless, like the first story i made, but this time, i made him stay this way.

I made about 7 chapters of this story, each less than 600 words.

I also deleted this story, but the plot of this particular story was something i passed onto another story.

I started writing a new one, i uploaded it on Wattpad, but the last i updated it was a few weeks ago, and i doubt ill ever update it again, I'm not going to post the link to my story, moderators might think I'm doing this for free advertising.

I'm still the same, I can still laugh, i can still smile, but i can't feel sad over the death of another.

When i heard that about 1 million people died from the virus, i thought 'Well, that's quite low'.

I just want to change, i want to think like other people, i want to have a heart, a heart that can ache for another person.

Right now I'm older, and yet i still feel the same.

Tl;Dr- I Can't feel sad over the death of another person, even if that person were to be close to me, how can i change?"
1699,Repost from r/offmychest because nobody responded,"To the math teacher that hates me for no reason

I live in Germany and school just started for me like a month ago. In this month Math we wrote 2 Tests and one class test. On the first test I got a 5 (E in American Grade System) on the second Test I got a 6 (F) since I apparently cheated eventhough I didn’t. Basically what happened, he handed out the tests and he said „we’ll first go through it once for questions so no writing!“ I was like „Okay no writing!“ but then after 2 minutes I heard the cap of a pen fall and I saw another person writing so that’s why I started writing because i thought we could write now. Then the math teacher said „Ok I have seen 4 people who I think started writing.“ Then he called me and 3 other people to his desk and he saw that we started writing so he confiscated our tests and gave us a 6 (F). So then we had to wait through the whole 15 minutes doing nothing while others wrote the test.At the end of the lesson he called us four and asked what was wrong and we explained to him that we were very confused and saw others writing already but he still wasn’t very convinced. On the very first day of school he already announced a class test so i thought that’d be my chance now. I studied countless hours and did like 10 pages of exercise. Well guess what I got today? A 5+ (E+). Now everything was for nothing.While others cry because they got a 3 (C) I am getting my 70th 5 (E). In seventh grade I had to get therapy because my mental health was in such a bad condition because of school. And since first grade I have never gotten an A in math. I have never got to know the accomplishment of getting an A in Math. And every week I have to worry about my future life because nobody of the teachers wants to understand me. Btw after the second math test my French teacher who is also our overall class teacher noticed that I was angry so she asked what’s wrong. I told her about the math test and talked to the math teacher. Well next lesson he talks to me and pretends to be innocent and that everything’s going to be fine.
I have had enough! 

Has anybody got any advice for me on how to cope with this? 

Ps: I am still in 9th grade so something like Highschool and English isn’t my first language so I apologize for any spelling mistakes"
1700,Toxic friends,"I'm an adult. Full grown, haha. I still am figuring out what healthy friendships look like. Was burned badly by people I thought were friends. They did the ghosting act. 

I was talking to someone about this yesterday and she said it happened all the time during her adolescence...and I felt somewhat worse. And wondered if I was literally the only functioning adult who was hurting from broken friendships. It doesn't feel petty like highschool drama, it feels real."
1701,I’ve hurt myself to prove I didn’t lie,Sometimes people think i’m lying to them about something so I physically hurt myself just to prove i’m not do I need to do anything about this or just try to get out of the habit.
1702,I am getting so sick of everything,"I am sick of my mum saying completely pointless things to me to convince herself that she’s trying to make me feel better and when I call her out in it she gets angry and passive aggressive. She’ll say things like ‘there’s no point feeling X,Y’ ‘You need to stop being negative’ along with other things I can’t remember at the moment, not in a supportive way but in a kind of annoyed way. If I could turn off my feelings and put away all the shit and intrusive thoughts in my head then I wouldn’t need fucking therapy would I? Sometimes I feel like she is all I have so when she gets angry over things like this and completely misunderstands my problems I feel completely alone. I can only see my therapist maximum once a week, I don’t really have any friends at all let alone any who understand mental health, I have no one who I am important to other than family who either deny, don’t know about or misunderstand my issues, my dad is a narcissistic prick, the teachers who I trust are always busy and I can’t see them outside lessons cause of coronavirus, it’s sad that the only place I can express my emotions is fucking reddit. I’ve been having an existential crisis for months if not years and it got really intense during my maths exam today where I felt completely negative about life as a whole. I have nothing. The time I should have spent revising I spent either looking at my ceiling thinking about death for hours or doing the few things I enjoy to convince myself that there is a point to living, I especially needed to do that after not being able to do literally anything because of lockdown. 

 I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I’m a complete outcast who no one wants to spend time with apart from people I train with and that is the only thing they do with me, with no interest from the opposite sex and when that happens it’s usually 2 weeks max before they leave me for someone else, while I am okay at what I do at college I completely fuck myself during exams and pretty much forget how to read nevermind how to answer A level questions, I completely hate my appearance despite my only hobby being bodybuilding. I am not funny even though I try to make jokes to fit in and fail, I don’t even know who I am as a person. I fuck up pretty much everything. I have no job because of coronavirus and there are no vacancies for people my age. Our area is in the strictest lockdown in the country so even if I was able to arrange plans with people it would be illegal. 

The biggest thing I hate about myself at the moment is my fear of death and lack of willpower. 

I have always looked at the negatives in life but now I look at both and realise that there aren’t really any positives. 

I really don’t know how to convince myself that being alive is the best option even though I know it is the only option - while I have pretty much constant suicidal thoughts, like I said my fear of death makes it so I am certain I won’t attempt anything.

I feel so trapped and helpless, I’ve spent half of my life waiting for the next stage and it just gets worse instead of better. 

I feel like when I get into university I’ll be a lot better but I’m really doubting that I’ll be able to do that at the moment and even then I have 11 months of this shit (not just college, everything) until I get there. 

I want a new life and I feel like university will bring that but the life I have at the moment is fucking tearing me down so much that I don’t know how I will get to that next stage."

1704,Genuinely looking for help in my area. 26-year-old female and possible signs of either psychosis or the onset of schizophrenia.,"Hey guys I have never posted on Reddit and if I have I don't remember it. I really don't know how to navigate the site but I am not really sure what to do at this point. My life has taken a turn for the worst in the past 6 to 8 months. To be honest I honestly can't remember time for me doesn't feel real anymore and I'm not sure what day or a lot of times even if it's 20/20 anymore. I have been in and out of therapy my whole life but I am pretty sure at this point I am actually starting to get worse. I have not had any medical care since I lost my health insurance after turning 26 in May. For about 2 years I was on Seroquel but got off of it when my health insurance ran out.

I know I sound dumb and like a child most times but I genuinely don't really care about what happens anymore about myself. I have been feeling this way for a while now and it's just gotten worse and now I genuinely feel like I am losing touch with reality. I have a fiance and we fight constantly. Apparently when we fight he says things to me that I make up in my head. I never even realized that I did this I know I've always been a paranoid person but he has pointed out several times where I heard him say something that simply he did not say or somebody else said something to me that they did not say.

I'm almost positive at this point they are hallucinations they are so real to me and nothing can convince me that somebody did not say what I heard them say in my head. It's literally driving me crazy I feel so alone because I feel like everybody is out to get me. I literally have no friends because I feel like I can't trust anybody I genuinely don't want to feel like this anymore but I don't know how to. I haven't left my house for anything but just to go to my parents for Sunday dinner on Sunday. And it's been like this now for about 8 months. I'm honestly scared because I just constantly hear my head telling me to kill myself. And that it should be over there's nothing left to be here for and that it's just too much. I'm either in the state of panic or in a state of just not being able to function. Like everything is so overwhelming that I just sit there and I can't talk or anything. I just want help at this point all the doctors I'm going to just tell me that I'm depressed and then put me on depression medication that makes me more manic. I've never actually thought about ending it until now because I can't live like this anymore I'm so sick of it and I feel so alone.

I'm sorry for the long post I just really don't know where to turn for help. I was going to a psychiatrist but then they moved everything to phone and I never was able to tell them about the hallucinations or anything. It's really hard for me to talk about because in my head it really is real it's there and it just frustrates me when somebody tries to tell me that it's not. I feel like my brain is telling me to end it because I just can't do this anymore and I don't know how to ask for help anymore. I don't think therapy is going to work I feel like everything is just too far gone. I should also add that after I get into the states I am unreachable. Yesterday I tried to slice my throat and I don't remember it I woke up this morning with bruises all over my arms because apparently I bit the The crap out of them when we were fighting last night. And my face is all black and blue because apparently I hit my head against the wall hard multiple times. I'm genuinely scared for me and other people around me and I don't know what to do anymore somebody please help me.

I don't know if this helps but I'm in the upstate area of New York I really don't care about any of this covid stuff I would rather die of covid at this point I'm sure none of it could be worse than what's actually happening right now. And please I'm sorry if I sound ignorant I'm in a really really bad state right now and I don't know what to do."
1705,"I think I developed trauma, help?","My gf and I were in a bad living situation with my mom for about a year until it came to a boiling point late June. We packed up all of our belongings in 4 days and moved across the country. Id never moved out of my mom's house, never lived out of the state I was born in, etc. It was really disturbing and stressful for me to leave everything I've ever known behind in 4 days. 
Almost within two weeks of arriving at my gf's parent's house, where we would be staying until we found our own place, my gf had first episode of psychosis. This was very very upsetting for me to see her go through as she is/was the only constant with me during the move and being up here. Everything else is very new to me, and when she had the episode even she changed. She almost deliberately crashed the car with us in it and I had to stay alone with her parents that hate me while she was in the hospital. I was totally alone in an unfamiliar place with people that severely dislike me, trying to cope with the fact that only thing keeping me from panicking was now incapacitated.

Sometimes I get vivid flashbacks to seeing her scream and try to struggle out of restraints in the ambulance, the look in her eyes, the way she almost killed us, etc. I had a really bad flashback on the night of September 12th and I have been having severe panic every day since. I can't function, I am just in hysterics all day. Nothing can calm me down. 

I don't know what to do to help myself. I'm so preoccupied with trying to take care of her now that she's home, even though she can do it on her own I'm so paranoid that it'll happen again that I'm...babying her on accident? I don't know what to do with myself. I'm not well but I want to be so I can properly be here for her through this major thing she's going through. I'm just running myself into the ground.

1707,It’s time to cut the shit,"Have you ever had that ‘epiphany’ where you’re like “alright time to cut the shit and get/do better?” 
So I’ve had that thought a few times within the past 3yrs, and each time it’s followed a somewhat traumatic experience. 
Long story short: each of these events unfolded because there were two common denominators... alcohol, and my mental health. I’m writing this because I had another one of said events recently.

I figured I’d share this for any one else who feels similarly and/or for support. I’m definitely an alcoholic but don’t consider it as I’m fresh out of college, but one thing I’ve noticed is that whenever the anxiety/depression increases my alcohol intake increases...thus leading to shitty situations/events. The same goes for when I feel ‘hypomanic’ (I say this because I’ve yet to have an official diagnosis but am taking prescribed a medicine for this). Each time these drunken episodes occur, I end up in an awful situation and/or threaten suicide and am close to going through with it....
Anyways I’ve realized this shit cannot keep going on, I’m worsening my current depression, PTSD, and anxiety along with hurting relationships and trust.

It’s time for change. 
It’s time to finally get a therapist instead of just having a psych to prescribe meds and give me official diagnosis’s. 
It’s time to take this shit seriously. 
It’s time I got this off my chest,
and it’s time for whoever reading this that can remotely relate to consider joining me on a journey to feeling and acting better.

I hope I’m not alone in feeling this way because the anxiety and self-guilt is eating away at my sanity. Also I’d greatly appreciate any support and any considerations of starting a small support group with daily inspiration/reminders and venting if anyone’s interested.

Thank you for reading (on mobile, sorry for shitty formatting)"
1708,Did I experience trauma or am I just making excuses?,[removed]
1709,What does an attack/episode feel like?,I've been feeling extremely anxious over the past few days. I've been overwhelmed with work and I just went back to my house after spending more than a week with my boyfriend. I've been feeling so alone since coming home and it's making me feel a lot more anxious than usual. I don't know what an attack or an episode feels like but I feel like I just had one :( Just now I started crying uncontrollably and I felt overwhelmed with things. :( Please help? Or send a virtual hug please? Sorry if I'm all over the place.
1710,Breaking point after 10 years.,"I was 16 when this whole thing started. Three attempts that failed. I only told one person about everything but it didn't turn out well.

I'm reaching my limit, it's getting harder not to think about it. But I've been planning for months now. I just want to die."
1711,feeling sick from depression,anyone else feels literally sick and has flu like symptoms?
1712,What's somethings Triggers your anxiety?,"For me, it's big crowds and people looking at me and the unknown and meeting new people? What about you what triggers your anxiety?"
1713,I’m not sure how long I can do this for..,"Need to vent because i’m a lonely bitch with no friends.

I’m sure many of you have felt similarly to me - not wanting to be alive but also not wanting to die. Everything is just too much right now and I don’t know how long I can do this for. I don’t want to tell anyone irl about my passive suicidal ideation because I don’t want to scare them.

Recently my grandpa, who means the world to me, got diagnosed with cancer. It’s been tough. Really really tough. I have never dealt with a loved one getting seriously ill or dying before, and I never imagined it to be this difficult. My heart hurts as if I’m going through a break up, and I fee physically sick a lot. 

This has affected every area of my life. Everything is harder and seems worse. My self-esteem is worse than before, my body image, my ability to do things, my relationship. My boyfriend is pretty good at understanding my needs, but I really struggle to be honest with him and recently I have been really anxious around him. I think it’s mainly because I think I do everything “wrong”. But I can’t tell anymore. I just have such little motivation and I feel like I have been a horrible girlfriend, and a bad person in general.

Anyways, there is too much on my mind right now and I can’t take it anymore. I called the Samaritans but the guy made me feel a lot worse (I mainly talked about the cancer and mentioned on the side that it affected my self-esteem and relationship, and the guy said “so you feel like your boyfriend has given up on you.” And i was like what? Well should I feel that way?)

If anyone actually read this, thank you, and I’m sorry for my somewhat long rant. Cancer really fucking sucks and I’m so mad that my lovely grandpa is having to go through this. I have sought out therapists in my area and am waiting for responses, but I just can’t deal with life being this difficult in my head."
1714,Spent the last hour thinking about runing away from home with my phone and bike only,*text*
1715,Derealization," I want to talk about this because it feels very isolating and I feel like I'm the only person who experienced this and it feels good to express it.
 So a few months ago I experienced what my doctor said was derealization. To me, it felt like a neurological issue though.
 I hadn't been feeling like myself for a while. One day, I went out with one of my friends and as I was walking I started feeling very dizzy, tired and generally out of it.  I thought I was sick or something like that I even thought I had called the coronavirus. As we were walking I started feeling extremely out of it and Daisy and I also felt as if I couldn't control the muscles in my head and ask if my head was moving without me moving it if that makes sense. I was also really nauseous and everything felt as if I was living in a nightmare. I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen but it felt very different from a panic attack and I've had tons of panic attacks in my life. I thought I was seriously ill and that I need to go to a neurologist because I thought I had epilepsy or something.  I have to sit down. 
  When I went home I was still feeling this way and I was so scared and had to call people on the phone because I felt so stared and everything felt like it was a nightmare with physical symptoms on top of everything.
  Long story short, this lasted for about a week and another day I experienced it very intensely and I felt as if things were moving extremely fast and I have totally lost connection with the world I new something was wrong I just couldn't control it. If I haven't visited my psychiatrist who is also a neurologist, I would have never guessed that this is was derealization felt like. I thought it was a lot more subtle than that. I had tunnel vision and felt like I was in a claustrophobic bubble the whole time. It was TERRIBLE and terrifying. 
 Has anyone had a similar experience before ?"
1716,I want to be “gone”,"I don't want to kill myself or necessarily die; I just want to disappear. I don't feel anything. I don't want to feel anything. I have a child and even then; when I am in this mood I feel nothing for (them). It's such a blank feeling. I mean, don't get me wrong, I know I know I love my child, but at the moment I feel so ""ehh"" about (them). This is how I am feeling now. I always go through this wear cycle of being happy and optimistic, to being FULL of anxiety, to feeling numb, to then a deep depression. It is so confusing to me. I hate it. I know what to expect next, but I don't know how to control it or help it. Today I cried for no reason twice, then went back to feeling nothing. What is this and why? There are times I feel like I am seriously going crazy with all these full blown emotions and weird symptoms. I don't understand it."
1717,"just in case no one has told you today, you are beautiful.",[removed]
1718,Woke up angry and suicidal. This isn't the first time. Idk what to do,"I'm posting this to a few different subreddits because I'm desperate for a helpful reply. 

On Thursday I had a bad dream where I tried to kill myself and failed. I woke up angry and anxious and went to the kitchen to kick a bunch of stuff. After that I went back to sleep for a few hours. Then I woke up, grabbed a couple bottles of pills. And went to a hiking trail to kill myself. Obviously I failed, , kind of like my dream was a premonition of what my day would be. Now the past few days I feel completely normal, if not a little sad. 

I have had times before where I get so upset I break something or knock something down. Some as soon as I wake up and other as a response to something. 

Any advice? I will be making an appointment with a provider soon"
1719,so...,"lol so my dad came to talk to me about school and I was like ""I can't take this"" and I was like I JuSt WanNa bE aLoNe and so yeah and at this point I like don't want anything to do with school. it seems like SUCH a burden to me right now and I feel like it's holding me back and draining me of my motivation to do stuff. I want to do stuff but then there's school and I stress out at the mere mention of that. I guess I have such a huge superiority complex or something and these are just first-world problems and then my mum mentioned something personal to her and told me to ""keep studying"" and it made me feel SO bad so I just cried. and my dad always says ""it's ok to cry to relieve yourself or whatever but not if you don't have a reason"" and he went back and forth from saying ""it's ok to cry sometimes"" to ""you're being pathetic"" and ""stop crying"" and adjskdfl like the reason I was crying was because what my mum said made me emotional and ALSO the internal stuff I have in my mimd but they don't know about that obviously so that's fair... but then that's another thing, I feel like if I were to ever get the break from school that I want, I have to divulge everything that's bothering me to SO many people: my mum, my dad, people at school like teachers and everything. my dad tells me he wants what's best for me and for me to be happy but idk. what's best for me or what he thinks is best for me? idk, when I say a break from school, he says ""oh like a month? two months?"" and I say ""no a year and I don't even know how long people who take breaks from school do so for but to be honest if I were to have one, would I ever go back, realistically? if I did take a break from school, it would be so much time to just find something else and UGH thinking about me thinking ""I won't need school eventually"" makes me feel like such a pathetic little spoilt brat. its just exhausting and I hate this. my mind is constantly at work because of what could be ocd so then I have more work and!! wow!!!! please stop!!!!!!! and I feel guilty talking about me possibly having mental illnesses like ocd or social anxiety because I haven't been diagnosed with them!!!! like it's likely that I do because of stuff but!!! yeah!!!!!! I'm stupid!!!!!!!! uwu!!!!! I wish I could be free from all of this!! but particularly school!!! it would be easier to deal with the other stuff without the added pressure of school but yet another thing is this:

 **I have this weird thing about feeling better**. I don't know if I *don't want* to feel better but yeah sksksks

also my hair pulling thing came back (see my post from yesterday on my profile AHAHAHAHA)"
1720,Don't really have it in me to go on much longer.,"I guess I've had a rough couple of months. Looking for a distraction tonight- tell me a story or share your playlist. It's been getting harder each day to retain some form of normalcy. Not really sure if anyone would even see this but if you do, hit me up. I might have a habit of pushing people away but does it really matter if you don't intend to get close anyway?"
1721,How to stop heart palpitations without medicines?,"I can't buy medicines until a month more till my paycheck arrives. My heart palpitations won't stop.

I need some other way to stop them. I can't go on like this.

It makes me want to stab it, and leaves me struggling to breathe.

Guys, I don't feel so good."
1722,Short or long term disability for depression/anxiety,Does anyone have any experience getting approved for short/long term disability due to mental illnesses? My meds are messing with my head and i feel like i need time to wean off them and start something else.. ive never felt so low in my whole life. I've struggled with depression for as long as i can remember but never like this... Im completely dysfunctional at work which just leads ti more guilt and anxiety. Somebody tell me youve been through this!
1723,"This isn't ok, right ?","Well I am 16 years old, and I feel like a lot of these things can be happening due to puberty, but I feel like it has crossed the line a bit.

It all started a few months ago, when I started thinking about death, suicide, and all the things that may happen before and after a person dies. Well today I just wanted to kill someone so bad... It was my teacher and I really was thinking about stabbing her with a pen.

I have had these things happen to me for a while. Also I wanted to stab my dad once. But I never do the things I think about, thanks to my self control, but I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to control myself and I will really hurt someone.

I don't really want to talk about this to my family, because I don't want them to think of me as a crazy person, but I want to get a bit of help."
1724,"My friend is in a mental hospital, but I haven't been able to talk to them in days and its really fucking me up. Is there any possible way I can actually talk to them.","My friend attempted suicide last Tuesday, and was admitted to a mental hospital, she basically helped me through a lot of shit and it feels like she is basically dead. I have been trying to call her for the past 5 days and still, she doesn't pick up. I know they take your phone away for IN my fucking opinion dumbass legal reasons, but I don't get why they don't allow her to talk to me. On her way to the hospital while she was overdosing she asked to talk to me, that's the first thing she said, so do I think that she doesn't want to talk to me hell no, the hospital is forcing her not to talk to me.

I find that extremely bullshit because your forcing someone to feel like they literally are more isolated then they are, if you have an S/O and you get admitted to a mental facility wouldn't you feel like shit if you can't talk to them at ALL. IN this particular case, having access to a cellphone would be a hella of a lot more helpful than not having one. 

Enough with my rant, is there any way I can find what hospital she is admitted to and actually talk to her or am I just forced to assume she is okay, and not you know fucking dead. Or she can be there for her entire life I don't fucking know I just ask the questions what's the benefit of keeping me in the dark."
1725,Am I okay?,"I have weird things I do I mean it's pretty bad.

I get extremely obsessed with stuff for a little while completely looss interest and quickly move onto something else. Like I was obsessed with RDJ then suddenly got bored moved onto another person, got bored moved onto another person.

I have an obsession with horrible people. I got into an obsession of Ted Bundy that lasted like a month,  I collected 90 photos of him just to look at, I watched all the videos of him and basically drooled over him. 

Now its fucking Jeffrey Epstein, I've watched everything on him basically,  and have memorized his court speech and say it randomly, when I watched the documentary what was on my mind was how nice his looks and voice were not what he did, that's all I cared about and I've had creepy thoughts about him being my teacher. 

I like to watch gore for no other reason than I just feel interested in watching it. 

I cry over stupid things, yesterday I was in tears because my mum was getting a new couch. I'm attached to a fucking couch. 

I get very angry over nothing, I was stressed over the couch so my mum wrote some of my maths for me and she didn't do it perfectly so I went into the bedroom and flung the paintings of the wall then cried. 

I love talking to my teachers over the students, I find them nicer to me and more interesting. 

I've self harmed over nothing.

I've been groomed many times, one time has been so traumatic that I just think about it every day and feel upset and feel awful. Any mention of something related like even the country they are from to the person who groomed me I feel like crying. 

I am a mega procrastinater, due to me being obsessed with stupid things. I left 2 weeks worth of maths for the day before it was due because I was too stuck into watching Jeffrey videos. 

I feel like a horrible person who finds it funny watching gore sometimes and gets obsessions with people I shouldn't."
1726,Stuck in hell,"Lately I am feeling stuck. I have been having a lot of embarassing issues for a long time and mentally I can not take it anymore as the problems just keep getting worse. I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder as a teen, but I do not fully agree with the diagnosis. The thing is that mentally I may HAVE the symptoms of BDD, but the problem is that none of my issues are imagined and I honestly only feel suicidal about the things that truly make me unattracrive wether I wanna admit it or not. At the age of 16/17 I started devloping my bad body image, but only because at that time I found out my testosterone was already low-average which isn't normal for that age and I URGED for TRT and no doctor would give it. As a result I kept worrying about my development and my ""manliness"" kinda.. I didn' have gains in the gym, felt weak and tired, socially anxious, depressed, etc. I knew my testosterone levels where at least part of the problem. But besides that I messed up WAY worse. I messed up by trying to increase my penis size trough jelqing. Jelqing is a technique where you kinda squeeze the penis and over time it should slowly increase bloodflow and size. But these are not safe and I found out the hard way. I didn't have many issues and just kept going as I felt it could only help. But over the next couple months at some point I developed weird symptoms.. sharp pains, numbness, change of shape and eventually even change of size. But right about when I started getting these symptoms I stopped the jelqing, but it was already too late. It was the months AFTER that I developed a lot of scar tissue inside. I did everything over the years to try and improve my situation. Fast forward to 26 I am now on MY OWN protocol of testosterone replacement theraphy, as my levels where genuinely low at 25 but the doctor STILL refused to perscribe and just told me to change my lifestyle while I have been trying that for YEARS with no positive effects. So I was done and now I just buy it illegally myself. It DID make me feel a lot better and I kinda made a body transformation since then and now I finally start liking or at least accepting myself for the most part. I am balding very bad, but I can deal with it. I am not really handsome, but I am 6'4"" and now in great shape since the testosterone and working out. But the penile issues are STILL continuing to get worse. I only.wear sweatpants, avoid jerking off most of the time, take cialis, pentox, l citrulline, but it is too late and the inflammation never seemed to go away. So from 17 all the way down to today at 26 my penis has been inflammed abd getting progressively more deformed over time. Now I feel like I am stuck inside a cruel joke of a life where I finally look good and accept myself, but now I literally cant have satisfying sex anymore. I am getting extremely anxious about never finding a partner, but even MORE anxious about finding a partner that finally accepts me but not being happy anyway cause I can't have proper sex. I wish the inflammation would just go. I may be able to accept the loss of volume and numbness and change in texture and all that if it would at least remain stable for the remainder of my life, but it actually still hurts and gets worse no matter how I try to get better. My urologist can't do anything... lately I am feeling old, afraid this will only get worse and I feel myself turning into a bitter and angry person no matter what I try to do. Last couple of weeks for the first time in my life I think I been crying multiple times a day every single day. Suicide is on my mind 24/7, but it feels like I can not die without ever living. The only hope I desperate cling to is that maybe one day there will be some magic cure to actually ""revive"" parts of my penis, but it seems that is WAY in the future. But for some reason I almost feel like I rather live on, get fixed at like 80 years old, have sex with a beautifull hooker one time and then maybe I can die a little more peacefull. But I doubt it... I mostly feel horrible.about all the missed experiences and the loneliness. I can't help but feel like isolating myself as the sensation of your penis slowly breaking down is something that zapps all the energy from you. I am at a point now where I start getting paranoid cause I can feel my bulge has basically dissapeared and it leaves me feeling extremely weak and embarassed as a result even when I do activities totally unrelated to sex. This messed with me so hard that I just can not see a future going further like this. I realize that the next 5 years will probably be the same as the last 5 years except now my penis will be in even WORSE condition later on. I wish I was able to deal with this, but I'm really not. I would almost consider quitting testosterone to lower libido, but the drawback is that I will still crave love and female attention and I will have to deal with low T issues possibly making me even less motivated and energized. I feel like I am stuck and at this point the only thing keeping me going is the thought of not wanting to die like this and hoping to fix myself one day. But it turned into anger and frustration. Lately I smoke a lot of weed to calm me down but now I have developed an even bigger dependency on it than when I only.smoked a little. The stress is just building up. As a result I became extremely toxic and angry with social workers, doctors, my family, etc. I just feel.like I am stuck here and nobody is gonna help me and I an left in the dark. I often direct my anger towards the people around me and lately scream and cry and I switch from wanting to kill people (I dont want to actually do it but it is the emotion that fills me), wanting to kill myself, then angry again and like I WANNA LIVE I DO NOT WANT TO DIE. Then realizing death is the only solution again. And this cycle continues on and as a result I have fits of rage, crying spells and just odd behavious cause it feels like I am already dead and nothing I do matters anymore so I just flip out. What the hell should I do?? I know I should learn to control my emotions, but I truly can not live like this anymore. Realistically speaking I can only think of a couple of solutions which would be to either fix my penis, MAYBE be able to work around the issue and find a decent girl to love me nonetheless and be somewhat haply about at least not being alone, or actually commiting suicide cause I also feel like I will never feel satisfied even with a partner if I can not have sex anymore. So now I am hellbend on either shutting down the urges inside my brain aka shut it down or healing my penile issues so I can FINALLY stop surpressing my sexual urges. I know I might still never get an AMAZING sexlife. But th thought of NEVER getting laid again scares the hell out of me. The fact I am now somewhat attractive in many ways but I am afraid of having to tell girls I grow attached to and likely can't work around this without risking humiliation I am stuck. I just wish I could try and date around again without having to worry about getting denied later on cause of this."
1727,How can I actually talk to my friend in a psych ward?,"My friend is in a psych ward, in order for me to talk to them they need to sign a consent form, but in order for them to sign a consent forum I need to know what hospital they are admitted and they need to know that I want to contact them. But they never know that I wanted to contact them if I cant actually contact them. SO How in the world can I actually call them, I know with a 10000000000 % certainty that they want to talk to me, it's just the law is basically banning me from doing anything. What the hell am I suppose to do?

I called the hospital and they said I can't do anything so what do I do? How is HIPPA even good if it makes contacting a patient impossible, even when the patient really wants people to contact them?"
1728,There needs to be a mind overview test. Is there one?,"I'm trying to write out everything wrong with my thinking so that I have an easier time explaining it to my mom. However, I came across the issue of me being extremely paranoid.
Is there some sort of ""overview mind test"" that lays out your mind like a spider chart and it records how paranoid, disorganized, anxious, etc. a person may be based on how you answer the questions? 

I'm just curious and want to know where I would fall on that chart."
1729,"I binge ate 10,271 calories in 21 hours","Hey everyone, I'm Richie, 25M from the UK, and I've struggled with binge eating since I was 19.

I didn't fully realise about my binge eating until a day in October two years ago when I ate 10,271 calories in 21 hours.

I decided to film myself talking about this because we have A LOT of work to do to tackle the stigma men feel around Binge Eating:  
[https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM](https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM)

I've typed out some more context below as well.

If you're a guy needing support with Binge Eating, please do drop me a message: I'm here for you and we have a men's support group going with 35 of us sharing our stories 💪

Sending love to you all.  


\--------------------

*I felt I was living a double life.*  
*From the outside it looked good: I'd graduated from Cambridge, I'd started a company the year before, I was sociable at parties.*  
*On the inside, I felt like a failure and felt like my life wasn't going anywhere.*

*As men, we don't learn about eating disorders.*

* *From society, we hear that ""guys don't have eating disorders, only women do"".*
* *From our own brains, we tell ourselves ""it's not manly, it's shameful"".*
* *From our well-meaning friends, we hear ""you're fine mate, everyone eats a lot, don't make a big deal of it"".*

*Luckily, I've had CBT therapy in the last 18 months and am doing well now.*

*But I know how difficult it is for us men who binge eat.*  
*We firstly need to be aware that this exists as a condition and we then need to be able to admit to ourselves that we are struggling.*  
*Only then can we get the help we need.*

*So the stigma and the shame needs to change.*

*My mission is to make it easier for guys like me — and maybe if you're reading this, guys like you — to get the help we need to tackle binge eating.*"
1730,Struggling with Self Worth (HS Senior Problems),"So I’m finding myself basing my worth on test scores lately. 
I just received my SAT score, and it’s not as good as I wanted it to be. Now I just feel stupid, and I’m worried no good university is going to accept me because of my not-stellar score. 
I do exceptionally well in school, but does that even matter if my test scores aren’t good?
I don’t know how to feel. Am I worth anything if I don’t do really well on a test or two?
I just don’t know. 
Anyone have any words of wisdom?"
1731,I'm really unstable right now.,"I have always had violent thoughts but it's getting out of hand. I might kill someone if i get into a fight. I've started skipping school a lot so i don't get into a random fight, i might potentially kill someone.  I'm also extremely mentally exhausted from school, i never liked school and only went there to see my friends. I barely tried and got passable grades but shit is getting tougher and i need to put effort, but i will come out absolutely dead inside if i sacrifice my mental well-being for school.

What can i do?, my friends keep wondering where i am and i feel guilty. My boxing helped me cope with the violence but it's shut down, it was my drug and now it's gone. It's been 30 days of school and I've only went 7-8. Shit is going downhill fast and I'm lost.

What do i do? i need a fucking break right now, school has just imprisoned me, every creative thought i have is fading because of school. One more year and i can dropout but i know for a fact i wont last one more year.

the fuck do i do?"
1732,My new therapist insists that I'll use medications,"A little warning and a backstory before that. First of all, sorry for grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language. 
Now the backstory, since the start of 2020 (ironic) I started having alot of negativity in my life. It was so unbearable for me that I went to a therapist and she diagnosed me with depression (and other things I rather not to share now). Me and her did a lot of progress in the beginning and I was satisfied with her. But after something like 6 months I realized that we made no progress no more. I started to feel bad again and alot of the negativity came back to my life. 
Later on I asked to change therapists and she gave me a contact of a good therapist not so far from my town. I go to him for almost a month now.
Since our second meeting (the first one was just a recap of what I've been through with my old therapist), he insisted to use prescription he wrote for me. 
I'm relatively young and plan to work for the military in the future, but the thing is the military does background check on illnesses and medications. If they'll find out I use medications for my depression the chance for me to get the job are zero.
With my old therapist I stated from the beginning that I do not intent to use any medications and she gave me alternative exercises. My new therapist insists for me to use the medications and states that it's the best way for me to get back to normal. And he barely gives me alternative exercises..
Now should I just keep going to him (I do not intent to take medicine)?
Or should I just switch therapists again?
What's are your thoughts on the topic in general?"
1733,Struggling and can’t seem to find out why,"Hi! I (F19) have always been a generally very anxious person. Losing my father at a young age (seeing him unconscious) and seeing my mom very manic were things that my mind still lingers back to, till this day.

I’ve noticed something in myself lately that I haven’t noticed for almost 2 years. I’ve been having bursts on intense energy and happiness, doing very impulsive things (hookups, sneaking out, smoking a ton) and honestly spending money I shouldn’t be. Just after feeling like the best version of myself. Then, after that week or so, I feel terrible. I just get stuck in a deep depression and don’t even wanna do basic necessities like brush my teeth. And it usually goes like that until I crash and the cycle repeats. 

This morning I work up feeling very unmotivated and horrible about myself, after feeling the best about myself &amp; feeling so happy the prior night and days before. I don’t know why I feel this way. I just started therapy and have an appointment later tonight, but was so anxious and disappointed in myself I felt like I should vent now."
1734,any advice?,"I'm 15, cut not too often and am going to have a mental breakdown and try to kms again, i'll most likely fail but dont rly wanna die yet. Was told 8g of paracetemol would kill you so i had 9g today at school to  be surei would die and still no result just a lot of stomach pain now im neing told you need like 12g or something. I basically need to get out of school and don't know any excuses other  than being ill because ive already pulled that card twice within the past two or three weeks. sorry ik this makes me look like an attention seeker coz ppl probably have a lot worse problems on here but  recenly realised some ppl give good advice on this site so why not try anyways ty."

yes, nowadays my parents are doing better but I'm traumatized of failing my studies that I've heard they may disown me if i failed miserably again (heard this since im 9 or 10 years old), hence my only coping mechanism is just being an escapist from my trauma (studies) or either occupy myself from it, now im 16 and i have my major test coming up which could determine my life and job occupation here and i grew up very anxious of this. im really struggling to cope with the fact that this is my ""future"" but my body just seems to be so tired everyday (i had an depressive episode 2 weeks ago where i laid in bed all day doing nothing but binge watch and my appetite has been volatile) 

I'm still struggling with low-self esteem and i don't have much friends growing up cause of this. 

what symptoms would you say i would have? and i really thank you all for the supportive comments🤍"
1739,I get like mini bouts of mania and I got no idea what it is - any pointers?,"It usually happens at night, and it can go one of two ways. 

The first way which is rarer feels like I've done some coke or something. My brain is popping thoughts off at a million miles per hour, I feel super creative and motivated, quite on edge, usually end up chatting in the mirror with myself (saying stuff like: look at ye, ye big weirdo eh - handsome fella tho it's gotta be said - just random stuff really) and speaking real quick.

The other more common type that i get is the same racing thoughts and restlessness, but instead of positivity I just want to run down the street naked whilst screaming at the top of my lungs. Then probably get into a fight with a moving bus or something. 

Is it just pent up emotion or indicative of something else?

Probably worth noting that my family has pretty strong mentally ill genes. My mum's on lots of antipsychotics and everyone else has been on antidepressants at some point. Me and my mum also have terrible sleeping problems in general."
1740,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Hi, I'm fourteen, and my life isnt so great. my parents are abusive, im pretty fat, and  my mental health doesnt look good. whenever i get upset, i get a tendency to scream and self harm.  i spaz out too. my mom took away the knives, so now I bite myself. I get very violent and i cant stop thinking of hurting people. when im not angry, i just have a low self-esteem. i get very sad and think how ugly i am and how i hate my body. im not very good at talking to people, and whenever i get outside im afraid of making mistakes, or messing up. im not very good at following directions, and its not because i dont pay attention, im bad at navigating things. this causes my peers to be upset with me. i could go on and on, but if u want more details please feel free to ask. i just want to be diagnosed. my parents wont get me treatment or try to see whats wrong with me. they think my behavior is normal. theyre christian so it makes sense. please help"
1741,How do you how do?,"How do you handle suicidal thoughts, i haven't stopped crying for days. I just want to end things and yet I feel its easier to keep moving forward than to give up. I'm so tired and I feel like I can't take another step. I also feel like I don't have a choice. All the people I'd let down if I gave up. My pets wouldn't understand where I went they would just miss the hell out of me. But how do you cope  how does the pain of it all go away. Does it? Needed a vent and I could use someone to talk to. (I'm not suicidal, I just have suicidal thoughts, I have no intent of harming myself or others)"
1742,Is BPD commonly misdiagnosed with MDD?,"Hey guys. To keep a long story short, after being hospitalised after a suicide attempt in January of 2019, I was immediately diagnosed with MDD after a brief interview with a psychiatrist, and put on antidepressants. For many years I knew something was wrong in terms of my mental health, and depression seemed to fit the bill with regards to the thoughts, feelings and behaviours I was experiencing/exhibiting. I never questioned if MDD was the wrong diagnosis because the antidepressants worked wonders for the most part - I barely had suicidal thoughts anymore and daily tasks were easy to tackle, I didn’t feel physically tired anymore, etc. I also started going to therapy which helped a little bit, but the therapist was kinda whack so I’m looking for a new one right now, not really relevant but anyway. The point is, I didn’t really question anything because my functioning wasn’t impacted significantly anymore.

However, recently it came to my attention that the psychiatrist I go to is often too quick to make diagnoses, and misdiagnoses people sometimes. The case that stuck out to me was a girl who had been hospitalised like me after a suicide attempt - and same thing, after being interviewed briefly by this doctor, she was told she had MDD etc. Later, she said that she went to another psychologist and found out that she actually had BPD. 

After realising that I have a very unstable sense of self, my moods are changing constantly throughout the day, that I have unstable relationships, that I’ve had suicidal tendencies throughout the years and I lash out angrily after even a minor negative event, I can’t help but question if I’ve been misdiagnosed. However, I am against the idea of self-diagnosing so I am in no way trying to do that. I’m definitely gonna go to another psychiatrist and another therapist so they can assess me accordingly. But after doing a lot of research, I am worried that I’ve been misdiagnosed which brings me to my issue - if the antidepressants I’m on are allowing me to function relatively well, I barely have suicidal thoughts anymore and I am stable for the most part - does it really *matter* if I have been misdiagnosed? I’m not sure if any of this has made sense, but if anyone has some advice, or similar experiences, I’d really appreciate any input. Thank you if you’ve read this far :)"
1743,What does it mean to feel apathetic and emotionally numb?,"
I’ve been feeling this way for around 6 months, and I don’t know why. I just feel so void I guess, I don’t really feel emotion? And if I do, it feels so blank and diluted (if that makes sense). I also constantly find myself zoning out a lot and daydreaming since that gives me more comfort than real life. I’m not so sure."
1744,Everything is overwhelming,"This is my second time posting here. I just feel the need to vent and for someone to hear me out. At least out here, no one knows me and I feel that I can speak my true feelings without being shot down nor judged.

Today was my first day back in university as a third year student (wee). I am excited but very much overwhelmed with the thought of doing my dissertation and my other school obligations. I'm worried about balancing work and my time management. I'm worried that being home here with my family for the rest of the semester is going to drive me insane.  I'm worried about doing my dissertation and in general, online learning. 

Since everything is online, I don't meet my campus friends. Recently, a friend has been giving me the cold shoulder too. She isn't as excited to hear from me as I am from her. Maybe I'm overthinking it but I feel as though I have no friends (I know I have them) but when it comes to nights like these, I feel so alone to my thoughts. I tell my boyfriend and I know he's supposed to 'fix' me but he is there to listen and it doesn't really help much. He just tells me to sleep or nap it out but I can't sleep with these thoughts swirling in my head.

A lot of bad news has been circling around me too. I found out my aunt is diagnosed with breast cancer. My dad's long time friend passed away. My grandfather had to be taken to the hospital a while ago to have surgery and some health issues regarding with his prostate. It has been a rollercoaster. This all happened in the span of 2 weeks.

While I'm social media, I feel like everyone is having the time of their lives but me. It makes me bitter, envious and annoyed. Sometimes, news reports are bad. The total cases of Miss Rona where I'm from are going up recently. Celebrities are getting the virus and people passing away. I recently was watching The Crown on Netflix (really good show about the British monarchy btw) and there's like scenes of sickness, death and funerals. Then, I worry about my own life. When and how will I go? I worry about getting sick and realize stress can make a person sick and I worry about being too stressed. It's just an endless cycle.

I want to cry but nothing comes. I keep thinking, ""why do I need to cry for?"" or ""what am I crying for?"" I squeeze and try but my eyes are dry. I just know that I'm upset.

I've now given myself a headache.

I really don't know what to do."
1745,Has anyone here been neurologically tested and how did it go?,"My therapist recommended I get a full neurological exam so that we can know what were working with, but I worry that im not that bad and I'd be wasting their time."
1746,Endocrinology is the physician specialty with the highest rate of telemedicine adoption. Click to read more.,https://drexly.com/top-10-doctor-specialties-using-telehealth/
1747,How to cope with the feeling of your life being meaningless?,"I bet we've all felt this before. We ask ourselves what the point of working hard or bettering ourselves is when we all end up with the same fate in the end anyway (not in a suicidal way). My mental health is not so great when I spiral into these kinds of thoughts. How do you all cope with this feeling? Particularly those of you with no children, as I have none myself."
1748,Leaving this sub,I’m in a much better place now and taking care of what I’m absorbing and feeding my brain when I get on here (Reddit) best of luck to everyone
1749,Accidentally sent my teacher a message,"This isn’t too bad but I know she’s going to be looking at me weird in class. I sent her a message with the title “Doctors appointment” and all I wrote was “Hello, I do not thi”. That’s it. I feel like the biggest dumbass."
1750,I am no longer suicidal,"When 2020 began, I made [this post](https://archive.vn/oAtIr) while going by the username of [u/obamaherox](https://www.reddit.com/u/obamaherox/) until eventually deleting my account, saying I would want to end my life this year, however in the past few months I have been reaching out to my friends and family, as well as seeking proper therapy and support, and I am happy to say that I’m no longer feeling as miserable as I was in January and I am no longer suicidal. I feel a lot more confident, I am not ashamed to be the way I am, all my family loves me more than I could ever know, my family and I am happy with who I am. I have zero plans on ending my life. I just wanna say thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this rough journey that came with plenty of lessons. I also wanna thank the random people on Reddit who have helped support me too. One of the reasons why I’m making this post is to inform everyone that I’m okay and not in any danger."
1751,My Anxiety Is Getting the Worst of Me,"I’m a recent college student and I have been dealing with GAD for the last three years. Whenever my anxiety spirals  into a really bad place, I wake up with nausea and throw up in the mornings. I have barely been able to eat for the last four days and I wake up and throw up every morning. I’m sick of feeling this way. I want to eat food but I can’t stomach it. Has anyone gone through the same thing and can help me? Maybe give some pointers?"
1752,I learned that breathing techniques calms you down. Here is a summary of my research,"I’m a random guy who runs a business from home and dealing with stress during the day. Half a year ago I started a diary. It changed a way I think about myself and “woke me up” in some way.

It made me open to trying other “free tools” that are popping up here and there on the internet. The only thing I miss is support from others who do/learn something similar. But we can connect and share our experience.

**Breathwork**

There is emergency breathwork you can do to calm down. Once you feel overwhelmed try to extend your breath for 7 seconds and then release it for another 7 seconds. Your body goes to the parasympathetic nervous system that is responsible for the body's rest \[1\]. And your heart rate gets down. Use this in a stressful situation or if you go to sleep after the hard day.

But we need something more powerful to deal with regular stress.

There are many variations of breathwork. You may know about pranayama (yoga practice) or holotropic breathing. In general, breathwork is a process when you isolate your breath from any physical activity and do only it to push your body above previous oxygen limits.

**The Wim Hof Method**

I learned about the Wim Hof Method by watching the Joe Rogan Experience podcast \[2\]. This technique consists of three rounds. You do deep breathe for 40 times and hold it for as long as you can’t. Then you release, inhale and do one more hold for 15 seconds. That’s round one. There is even a video where Wim Hof guides you \[3\].

Laird Hamilton shared a story behind the method \[4\]. He said Wim Hof’s technique is a derivative of a Himalayan breathing technique called “Tummo”. It was developed by monks to keep their body temperature in the right condition in a cold environment.

Mister Hof says breathing is about changing chemistry.  “When you saturate cells with more oxygen then you typically need, your body stores it. And your body’s chemistry becomes alkaline. That enables control of all the body systems — immune, endocrine, lymphatic, vascular, etc.”

“Oxygen influences the body’s chemistry by balancing it in affected areas. Scientists agree with me, doing psychotherapy is not enough to reduce stress. You should also work on your chemistry” \[5\].

There are some scientific papers behind the method \[6\]. Which makes it even more interesting to try.

Hope you found this useful. Maybe I can tempt you with my newsletter about ""[Free tools that change people's lives](https://1pday.substack.com/p/coming-soon)"". I'm going to share new research, like this one, once a month.

1754,Help me find out what’s wrong,"Okay so I’m gonna be honest, my life hasn’t been no where near as hard as other people’s, so I think I’m just a baby, but I have really bad problems with anxiety, and I’m not really sure where most of it comes from, but anytime someone yells at me or like makes me feel guilty, my brain immediately finds a way to turn it on to myself, but it feels like it’s not me tell me it, it’s as if someone is in my head tell me it’s my fault, and I instantly know a way to logically put it on myself, and I start to think that it’s right and that I hate myself and that I’m a shitty person, and nothing really can make me genuinely smile anymore, and I feel like it just turns into a major depression, and I constantly hate myself, but that’s about it, can anybody help me find out what is wrong with me?"
1755,I quit my job due to a toxic work environment and trying to work on my mental health. Jokes on me- I’m an anxious wreck.,I don’t know why I should feel guilty or even loyal to a company that treated me like dirt. I don’t know how to feel better or even begin to move forward.
1756,I’ve realised the movie ‘Cast Away’ is an analogy for my mental health problems.,"Cast Away, the hit 2000 movie starring Tom Hanks reminds me of my own personal struggles with mental health. I wonder if anyone else can relate?


Life is fine. Not perfect, but in fact maybe a little better than fine; You’re a decent human being, you’ve worked hard and put in the time at a respected company, you’ve met a person you love and are planning to marry. You’re up in the clouds, so to speak.


Suddenly out of nowhere, you come crashing back down to Earth. Chaos and fear are followed by confusion and loneliness. You battle on alone, taking each day and each challenge one at a time. It’s a struggle at first and things that were once easy now prove to be difficult. You stumble at false hope, often make things worse. You can’t eat, and have issues stomaching what you do eat. You find that you talk to yourself far more than you used to. You cling on to an ever fading memory of your past life, but it’s that memory that remains your guiding light and reason to survive. You realise you need help and attempt to inform people that you’re in trouble, but the message just seems to wash away unnoticed. You decide that the best way to beat this is to go back to basics. This leads to learning things you never would have if this had this not happened, and you slowly discover new ways to tackle your problems like finding better ways to ask for help.


Somewhere along the line, after much time has passed, you plateau, you get stuck in limbo. You’ve somewhat mastered your new, trapped. mind and accept the feelings that have come with how you now live. However, deep down, you know you’re stranded; You can still feel the waves that enslave you constantly crashing in the background. You’ve learned to live with the voice in your head and have even come to see it as a friend. But chronic limbo leaves your mind exhausted and your body broken and despite the mastery, you can’t help but feel that you don’t want to carry on living in this restricted world.


But something drives you on, somehow you have to keep breathing even though there’s no reason to hope. Looking after yourself, eating well, accepting your problems and a great deal of patience gives you the ability to spot opportunity in the very thing that has been keeping you at bay. You build upon this new strength, embracing it with everything you have - believing there MUST be a way to use what the waves have offered against them so to overcome them once and for all! You brace yourself for the worst - even worse that when this all began, but you are a stronger person now and survive the leap, but at what cost? You’ve become so accustomed to your feelings that you’ve forgotten what your old life was like and have no idea if it’s even out there at all. As you drift further away from your problems but no nearer to normality a sense of clarity comes across you, you realise that while you are still alone, you’ve managed to let go of much of the past. Some small things remain, things that you reluctantly must let go of, no matter how much it hurts to say goodbye (I’m sorry Wilson!!!!)


Then comes a breakthrough, just when you’re on the brink of giving up - finally your mind and feelings can somewhat relate to the real world again! Things that you had gotten used to being difficult have become easier once more. But you’re not entirely comfortable with that - you’d grown to appreciate having to work a little harder for things, as it slows life down to an acceptable pace. Things aren’t quite the same back in the old world, and you get a sense they never will be - the world you left behind moved on without you in it. Yes there are some people that still love you and are glad to have you “back”. But they, too, know that things aren’t the same as they were - it’s not that simple! Life will still have you back, but you will have to learn, all over again, how to survive in it. You’re mind is at a crossroads and, once again, you must embrace.


The end."
1757,I had therapy,"I had my first therapy session today! It was actually okay, I was super nervous, but the therapist was very understanding and insightful. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I didn’t expect to have like a plan set up and set goals and expectations for the next few months. It felt nice to actually take care of myself."
1758,When I read about people on the verge of homelessness it makes me so depressed,I'm so upset that this country and world is so expensive to survive in. young people living with their parents are at risk of homelessness if they are thrown out. of course there are many other situations that lead to homelessness too. it is so scary. It makes me extremely depressed to think about and hear about it. I feel so scared for people and potentially myself in the future.
1759,What can I do to help,I'm really concerned for my friend I knew he had anger issues but I never knew it was bad. I have him pinned on google meets for fun and all of a sudden I come back to the tab with him slamming and shaking his desk and he got up and started slamming and punching the wall and guess he got so angry that he forgot to turn off the camera the teacher didn't notice then he was pacing around noticed his camera was on turned it off turned it back on and he seemed really depressed and was twitching. I never have seen him like that before and I believe he has other issues but I'm not sure. He overthinks a lot to the point where it consumes his life like a little argument that happens months ago he will still think about it and thinks we hate him! He never seeks help before and I don't think he's planning too. What do you guys think he has and how bad do you think it is? What can I do to help?
1760,Feels like I’ve lost all emotion,"Been feeling like this for like the past month after some interpersonal issues. Feel like I’ve forgotten how it feels to smile. Only time I feel emotion is when this sudden burst of anger, regret or sadness hits me. Spent a week trying to drown myself in alcohol and still didn’t feel anything. Finally went to see a psychiatrist through video today and  idk. Just diagnosed me with depression. Hoping whatever treatment plan he comes up with works because this scares me. Just feeling completely empty, like there’s no meaning to anything or any purpose. Tried to stab myself through the heart just to feel something or escape this emptiness."
1761,My household,"I don't know what it is, I do something and I get yelled at for what? Literally this morning I get yelled at for my dog getting loose and wanting to fight with another dog. I just got out the shower and I usually let me dog out of the restroom so he isn't just trapped in there with me while I'm getting ready, the routine is I let him out and usually my mother is downstairs with my other dog, but the door leading to that room is closed always since my dogs have a thing where they see each other and decide to fight with each other. I let my dog out, and the door is cracked as I'm walking down the stairs, he sees the other dog in our house, they get angry and my mother gets angry at me, for what, you left the door open, I was just coming downstairs and you know the routine of what happens, you close the door knowing that there is another dog in the house, than she goes off about how I didn't hear her or listen to her not to let him in, ARE YOU FUCKING OF COURSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THESE DOGS FOR TWO YEARS, than I go to make the dogs food (cause that's why I was coming downstairs so he could eat), and she yells at me ""that's enough"" like wtf why you gotta tell, what did I do to piss you off this morning I literally just came down. It's like whatever I do I get yelled at for it. Situations like these where I get yelled at for no reason is what is making me question whether my home life is good or not, I feel like I'm living a white lie and that we supposedly live a good life because of our house and all the things we have yet the love isn't there. It's like I'm torn on whether I can love my mother or not, she acts so pissed off almost all the time and idk how to avoid it or what to do. My brother oh boy my fucking brother, he's something else, I fucking despise him, he makes me feel like I'm not his brother, I've always felt a disconnect from him and the love was never there, he has always been a fuck to me, many times when I was a kid he'd always hurt me, one moment I bump into him and yet he decides to punch me in the shoulder which left me with a bruise later that day, there are more cases but I'm not here to go on and on about that.      I'm just here to question my sanity, there are moments where I think about murdering everyone in my household including myself, I always push myself away from thinking like that yet the thought roams around in my head a lot then I would like it to. Literally every move I make in this house is always monitored no matter what, I make food I'm constantly being watched, I mess something up, I get yelled at, all this shit is why I'm so fucking fidgety and my household family wonders why. Someone please help me, I don't want to go down any bad paths, I'm 15 and male btw to give you an idea. I'm sick of this shit, it's terrible and I can't take it anymore and I've been on my last thread for years now, I don't know how much more I can ensure."
1762,I'm failing university right now and I got labeled as a risk,"I'm just scared right now, I got two emails saying I was at risk and now I'm even more scared that I'm gonna flunk out of university and just be a loser. I have no other life plans."
1763,Does anyone else have imaginary bladder issues?,"I know that this is all in my head but I feel like I’m going to urinate myself all the time, and when I decide to go to the restroom, it’s nowhere near the amount I expected. This issue has been chronic since I was in middle school and I was always going to the restroom 6-10 times a day."
1764,These Are Trivial Causes of Insomnia,[removed]
1765,Why do I feel a strong urge to self harm even tho I don't actually want to?,"Recently I'm having so much anger towards my own and suddenly my brain goes like:

""smash your had against that wall!""
""throw your hand in shattered glass!""

And I'm so confused. I never self-harmed (except for one planned and obviously failed suicide attempt but I don't really count that bc I had a goal there, not self-harming just because) and never even considered doing it (like I said, not self-harm just because/ without a goal)

Now suddenly my brain/body wants me to do this and in my worst moments I have to focus very hard to not let it happen
(for example: was sitting against a wall, focusing not to throw my head against it, lost focus for a split second and suddenly my head went back without me wanting to do that)

I just don't get it, I don't want to do that, yet I feel like I barely have control over these things and I'm scared I'll have a moment were I'll lose control again but way worse"
1766,Why does everything seem to crash all at once?,"I've been really good at controlling my emotions and feelings recently, but now I feel like I had so much pent up that the bottle feels like it's about to break. I don't feel in control anymore and I hate not having anyone who can understand how I feel. I feel so alone, so helpless, and so close to just locking myself in my room and avoiding the world. I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could understand why I feel this way. I'm even beginning to wonder if I should see a doctor, as this up and down feeling has been happening so often. But the thought of getting diagnosed just makes me all the more anxious since there is such a stigma on mental illness in my family and well, everyone else in my life, that I'm afraid I'd feel more isolated and alone if they discovered I had a mental illness. None of them would look at me the same. 

At this point, it's hard to see any reason to keep staying alive."
1767,im losing hope,"my therapist looked into intensive outpatient programs in my area and the reviews are terrifying for all except one, but the one that looks actually good is for people 18 and older. i cannot be institutionalized, ive discussed it with my therapist and weve come to the conclusion that inpatient care would be more damaging for me then helpful (control issues) and i just dont mnow what to do. eve ry rhing is so hard and bad right now, my dad thinks im overreacting, my mom believes me but doesnt have any custody so she cant help me, its just hopeless. is it worth the risk of tryi one of these outpatient programs with spotty reviews? im just..nervous"
1768,What do I have?,"In the past 10 years I had some strange symptoms. It’s probably a mental illness, but I‘m not sure which one.

One of the symptoms is Anxiety and intrusive thoughts. There were many moments, where I was worried to get fired, whether others are talking bad about me, whether my teachers have something against me.

The second symptom was heart pain. I think this heart pain was caused by my brain. I had the feeling, it was linked with my psyche. When I had stress, everything was ok during the day. But suddenly, when I came home, I had unbearable heart pain for 1-2 hours and afterwards the pain suddenly just stopped. I don’t have a clue what that was.

I microdosed 0.5g shrooms for the heart pain and took 200mg of Modafinil about one year. 
Then I got drug-induced psychosis.

The psychiatrists thought it’s just drug-induced, but can also be schizophrenia.

Are anxiety and heart pain, symptoms of the prodormal phase of schizophrenia? Was this all the time schizophrenia?"
1769,Lifelong search for a diagnosis,"Anyone had the experience that you believe you have (insert mental health condition) but you don't officially ""check all the boxes"" in the criteria?

You identify strongly with the symptoms and have similar life experiences to those who do have a diagnosis.

But you can't get across the finish line and get a labelled diagnosis.

I am in that position. The reason I want a label is that it would account for my life experiences. And it would give peace of mind to me. 

I found myself in a Catch 22 situation. Many years ago I identified that Asperger's Syndrome was something that made sense of my difficulties in life. 

I worked really hard on all the deficits and I overcame it. 95% anyway.

Coping mechanisms and masking techniques have become incorporated into my personality.

So when I went for a diagnosis (no psychological help was available to me 25 years ago) they said that no signs of autism were detected. 

Even though I told them how I was previously. They didn't believe me. They had to see it on the day.

So I feel a bit pissed off about it seeing as all I wanted was peace of mind."
1770,i regret being open with my father,"alright so, i just had a long conversation/fight with my dad. i've been especially closed off for about two weeks since a really hurtful incident happened. basically his girlfriend completely humiliated me till i had a panic attack, while he just sat there and did nothing. this is nothing new, happens all the time. i carried absolutely no fault but she snapped at me. like i said, this is nothing new but that day, i decided for myself that i couldn't take it anymore. i was in a very bad place already, but i was miserable after what happened. had strong suicidal thoughts again. i know this might not sound like much but to be constantly told that you're extremely selfish (even tho i try to be little to no burden), that I am lazy (i've been severely depressed for a while now, and am happy that i at least manage to get up in the morning), that i ruined their day and such things. it's not exactly uplifting. i'm slowly feeling like i'm dying in this house. i feel really uncomfortable with the people there and my childhood trauma occurred in this house. i'm just really not well. and my dad is constantly pressuring me to find work, which I am searching for but just haven't found something where i could see myself in. i have a mini job and he doesn't have to pay for me at all. but he talks to me like i'm a failure and even tho i try my best to survive, it's not enough. anyways, i got a bit lost there i'm sorry, i just wanted to give a bit more perspective.
so today we talked for a while, and also argued. he just started blaming me for a bunch of stuff. that i'm the bad guy because i don't feel comfortable opening up to him, and not accepting his help (which i do tho). basically i am at fault again. well after a lot of crying and arguing i let out a lot of my emotions and how i really feel, and i guess it ended kinda peaceful? we had these kinds of arguments/conversations before, nothing usually changes.
so now, i regret that i was vulnerable so much. and i wish i could take back all of the things i said. i do have difficulty opening up, but i have gotten better and don't usually regret it. but with my father i do. i don't have a very strong connection with my dad i might say, he was barely there when i was growing up, had an alcohol problem and anger issues. but i never felt this confused.
like, this conversation got my whole emotions and thoughts confused. i feel sorry for him. do my feelings even make any sense. i don't know how to describe but i just can't grasp any feelings or thoughts i used to have. it literally feels like, my brain got shaken up, and some things broke. i don't know which emotions or things actually even have any weight anymore, i mean they did all this time. and i wish it never happened, i feel extremely uncomfortable with him knowing all this stuff. i have talked with people about this, but i don't feel that with them. why can't i grasp anything right now? 
i just want to be away.

i'm really sorry this is so all over the place and i might also note, english isn't my first language."
1771,Can someone diagnose me,"I have voices in my head which seem more real than reality. I've narrowed it down to schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder. The voices prevent me from sleeping but not in the sense you are thinking. They have the ability to give me panic attacks and will threaten me, resulting in some part of my body being hurt.

1772,How do i learn to like myself?,"Ever since i was a kid, i have struggled with low confidence and anxiety. This has but a burden on many parts of my life and recently i have decided to seek help and begin the long journey of self improvement. I have come to a roadblock where it is becoming more difficult for me to get better because i can't accept who i am as a person and learn to like myself. I am very caught up in fitting in and cant seem to be myself but i really want to learn how to do this. I think the first step to this is learning how to like myself. I know objectively that people like the ""real me"" and i have many likable qualities but i still dont like who i am. Any advice on how i can learn to like who i am?"
1773,Anxiety vs. a new relationship?,"I’ve been talking to this guy for quite a bit and then we went on a couple dates. He’s really sweet and cute and fun to talk to, and I know he wants to make me his girlfriend. But I don’t know if I want the same thing. Like I wish I did, but the idea of going into another relationship worries me. I still think about my ex (not in the “I want to get back together” way but the “oh, this memory” way). And I graduate/am leaving in December. Is this what going into a new relationship is supposed to feel like? I’ve only ever dated one guy (and it was for two years). And while it’s been like 8 months since we broke up, is it bad that I still think about him? Should I push myself to put a label on my thing with this new guy? Is my guy telling me not to? Why am I so freaking nervous and hesitant about actually doing it? Is that how a new thing is supposed to feel?"

1775,Is my sister in need of help,[removed]
1776,Just a question. (And a stupid long rant wow sorry),"Basically I was wondering if maybe I just haven’t found what I’m looking for or something else but basically ... I have entered a period of my life where nothing really seems that interesting in the long term. Video games can come out and I can hangout with people for a while but when I come home or when I’m done doing something .. life kinda just feels dull. I fantasize/daydream a lot about doing all kinds of stuff which makes me feel really good but real life doesn’t feel the same. When I try to find a hobby or a career I want to pursue it feels like phases .. like I’ll be interested in something and try it for a while and just get bored and try to find something else. Life kinda just feels purposeless .. like when I was younger I used to dream about all the stuff “Older me” was gonna do when I grew up but now when I think about those things all I can feel is that it won’t even bring me ... idk happiness? Just to give an example of some types of things I think ... my older brothers have tons of stories of crazy shit that has happened to them with cops and women and parties and drugs etc, and I envy it all. I grew up on GameCube and PC and I’m a socially awkward guy and everyone supports me in my family and tells me that I’m going down the right path and stuff like that which I understand since our family has been through shit to finally become stable and I’m the first one to make it to college. While my brothers talk about wishing they’ve gone to college and finished school like I have.... I feel like I wish I have done all the crazy shit that they have. I feel like their lives have been more interesting, thrilling, and more like I guess a movie or story to tell their kids when they have them you know? Even then sometimes I think that being in their position I would just be bored with life too though because maybe I’m just trying to seek something that doesn’t exist ... like I’ve grown up too obsessed with magical powers and mythology and stuff like that from games and movies. We make all these beautiful stories and video games with supernatural stuff or insane powers and then we come back to reality and it’s just lame. I’m really sorry for being really cringe and dumb and there’s so many more important issues out there then this 😂 but yeah I just don’t really know what I should do ... I’m 19 and in college and I just feel a bit lost right now. (Idek if this fits in this sub I’m really sorry if it doesn’t mods)"
1777,"I think I have OCD, but I don’t know who to tell.","This is going to be quite a long one so don’t feel obligated to read.
For some context, in my family I have always been seen as an attention seeker, which I probably am but this time I show almost every symptom of OCD. Also my brother has OCD as well.
Now onto the real part. 
I can’t actually remember when it started, but around puberty, but I didn’t know it at the time. It would be stuff as little as just switching the light on and off because it didn’t feel right the first time. That’s the least extreme part. The most extreme part is when I have a really distressing thought and I can’t get it out of my head. Or I will be walking and think to myself “what if I just jump in-front of that car right now?” 
If what I suspect is true, i would like to get help as I just want to feel normal again, but the main problem is getting diagnosed. Not necessarily the doctors, but my family. They will always try and downplay whatever I say and won’t really believe and just say I’m looking for attention but I honestly believe that there’s a chance I have this condition. Is there any other way of getting a diagnosis or should I just tell my family? Appreciate any help you can give me."

1781,"lazy eye, struggling with eye contact",So gonna make this short. When i was a kid my dad noticed that my eyes are asymmetrical and started calling me crosseyed (straight up bullied me) for like 4 years. It caused me to have a lot of anxiety. To be honest I overcame most of it but anxiety about my eyes is still there. I am planning to do an operation next year coz having eye contact for me is haaaard. Anyways I still want to try overcoming this anxiety too and not to have to spend money on the operation. Do you think they are noticeable? How much eye contact should I have with a person?

1783,Pure O OCD,"Around the time I went through puberty, which for me was at age 13, Id started getting really strange anxiety attacks about mundane things. I didn’t talk to anyone about it, taking special care to keep my parents from finding out since they’re conservatives and at the time they unfortunately didn’t understand depression or anxiety or any sort of mental illness of the like.

I suffered with it through my first two years of high school. To give an example of the intrusive thoughts I’d get, it was as if something dirty was trying to attach itself to me. I didn’t touch any desks with my bare hands, and I didn’t look at anyone because another thought was that I would stop looking like myself and my face would take their shape. I spent alot of time staring at the floor as I walked around and likely looked like a weirdo since Id often whisper to myself to calm down and that I was being ridiculous.

I don’t like to talk or think about the more violent thoughts that would squirm into my head, since they have found their way back into my brain now. A lot of the time they had become so loud I couldn’t handle school, id make excuses to stay home and not leave the house. I guess my sister had observed this closely since she began asking why I hated school and avoided going out for even just a walk. She thought I was being bullied but honestly I had made myself so invisible at school that no one talked to me. It took some time but I eventually told her about my intrusive thoughts and anxiety and that I had given into self harm a couple of times that year. I owe her a lot since she was the one who confronted my parents, and talked them into talking to my primary doctor, who then convinced them into letting me see a therapist. 

Through therapy, I challenged myself to look up and be curious about the world rather than ignore it all in fear that my brain would later use it to attack me. I reconnected with some middle school friends and though it took some time I slowly got better. I started gaming, which helped keep me distracted from these thoughts.  I relied on this and the other “distractions” that I had in my life to pull me out of dark places. Whatever I was going through didn’t have a name at the time, my therapist had just told my parents I had severe anxiety. Things were fine through the end of highschool and university, which were the best years of my life. But ever since I graduated and started working, some of these thoughts have wormed their way back into my head. 

I don’t know what triggered it. It happened over the summer as I took the subway to work (I took it to uni for years and it never bothered me) and the anxiety built up again. Thankfully I relied on old breathing/mental exercises so Ive been able to somewhat control it but theyve been getting worse and worse. I’m having difficulties in having basic conversations, or watching movies/gaming or hanging out with my friends/family.  This is the new aspect of it, since I could rely on my friends or my hobbies to distract me but now the THOUGHTS are distracting me from them. The pandemic had made it oddly tamer, since I haven’t been leaving the house as often. Not really wanting to go back to therapy, I’ve just been trying to muscle through it. I researched the symptoms I’m having and found that they were pretty much identical to the symptoms reported from “Pure O OCD”. 

I’m proud of my parents for being open about mental health now, but am reminded of their worry when I first went through this. I’m living with them right now and don’t want to see them worry since COVID has already made them so nervous. I genuinely don’t want to go back to the therapist myself. Working from home helps alot but my brain seems to be starting to find new ways to torment me even in the safety of my own house. 

Do I keep muscling through it? I dont know.  Im glad that whatever this illness is, it has a name that I would want to talk to a psychologist about. The whole world feels so surreal since last summer and everything this year has just doubled down on it. I don’t feel hopeless, just really tired."
1784,I hide in my closet when I want to feel safe. Is this normal?,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit, so I might be doing this entirely wrong. I've seen a lot of advice in reddit threads and I finally got brave enough to ask for advice myself. So, I guess I'm gonna start out by saying that I'm not super mentally ill (I have ADHD, anxiety, and some minor depression and PTSD, but nothing major. I'm really lucky compared to a lot of people.), but I'm not sure if my behavior is normal. When I'm overwhelmed or anxious, I sit on the floor in my closet. Now, my closet isn't very big, but you can walk around in it. I started doing this when things at home were unstable. I have two very loving parents who are together and happy, but for about seven ish years my home life was hell. My sister had a severe mental breakdown and started to have episodes. I'm not gonna get into detail (unless you guys want me to, I'm comfortable sharing the story) but she would have screaming fits and suicide attempts. All in all it made me feel really unsafe from the time I was 13 to about 18, and therefore my developmental years were kinda effed up. When she would have an episode, I would hide in my closet. So now, I'm kinda worried that I'm not normal, because as a 19 year old at college, whenever I'm feeling nervous or even homesick, I chill in my closet. I'm not panicking or anything in there, it's just comforting. Am I messed up? Any advice?

TL:DR I hid in my closet when I was scared as a teen, and now I do it whenever I want to feel calm. Is this normal?"
1785,I want to write my note and leave here,"I feel like there’s no escape, I feel so trapped and everything I do goes wrong. I just want to end it all."
1786,I’m doing the best I can to not act on my intrusive thoughts...but my bf isn’t making it worse,"Am I wrong for being livid my bf(m21) won’t leave my green cheek conure alone? So a little back story, I have stress induced psychosis along w other mental health issues that make it hard to control my intrusive thoughts sometimes. With being in quarantine I’ve been STRUGGLING to keep a lid on my mental health issues as my usual coping tools like going to the gym, bookstore, or to my moms to calm down is no longer an option as I’m high risk for COVID.

I love animals and caring for things helps me stay sane. The kind of bird I have usually only bonds to one person in a family and in her case it’s true when I brought her home and opened the box she immediately picked me. Everyone tries to touch her and she flies off or bites but she lets me bathe her and sleeps in my hand. With my mental illness I sometimes have thoughts of harming her and when I’m stressed the impulse become intense. When I feel jealous that she maybe loves my bf more (again this is mental illness I know the thought process isn’t one that makes sense) I become enraged when she shows anything but aggression towards him and feel betrayed. When I’m feeling this way I just leave her alone, she hasn’t done anything and I don’t want to even risk actually doing the things I think. 

I’ve never in my life actually harmed an animal and these intrusive thoughts aren’t new but with the state of the world I’m extremely fragile. I’m afraid I could take all my emotion out on this innocent lil birdy so my temporary solution (until I can talk to my drs and therapist to figure out how to cope) was to ask my bf to just not interact w her at all so I won’t be triggered. I have told him exactly what my intrusive thoughts are and how it hurts my soul that I think those things and want to make sure I leave no space to act on these feelings but he won’t leave her alone!! He picks her up, pets her, feeds her treats, and talks to her which of course because I’m distant its making her prefer my bf more and more.

Yesterday she bit me for the first time since I started training her. I yelled at my bf about how he doesn’t care about my mental health or my birds health and why can’t he just leave her alone she’s never neglected or mis cared for so it’s not like he’s stepping in to help he just wants to play w her despite my very real fear I could hurt her. With that I’m thinking about rehoming her for her safety. My bf has showed he won’t use an ounce of self control about playing with her and I don’t think theres any other options. 

My boyfriend says that I’m just getting rid of her like her previous owners and that I made a commitment to her for her life and breaking it will just traumatize her. I think he doesn’t take me seriously because I am very good at hiding the crazy shit going on in my head and he doesn’t really think I’d do it but I am not so sure."

1788,What is it like to be medicated ?,"I just talked to my therapist about how my depression and anxiety has been increasingly worse. I just turned 18 and recently started therapy for the first time, for context. She said that I should probably try out medication and it would take 4-6 weeks to start working. I’ve never been medicated before, what will it feel like? Will I feel worse at first? I’m starting college soon and I’m scared that I will start medication the same time as school."
1789,I finished uni,"I started self harming at the age of 12, which was 10 years ago. My mum used to hit me, once even threw a phone at my head. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 3 years ago. As a teenager I was with my drug addict ex who mentally abused me.
This year my dad and nan passed away 2 months between each other and bf of 2 years left me. 
Despite all this and strange time of coronavirus I've managed to finish my undergraduate degree. I am actually proud of myself for achieving something and not dropping out. At school I couldn't see a future or my worth at all but I know I need to keep working at it. I need to keep working on myself to become better."

1791,Social Anxiety vs. Friendship,"I haven't been talking or texting anyone lately. The only reasons I do though are as last resorts when my mental health is low and I am in a dark place.

My friend recently said that I've been treating her like a personal therapist.

I realized that I am anxious to talk to my friend on a regular basis, but when I talk to her, I am afraid that I am almost always on the verge of a mental breakdown like how I once ran away from my house (I'm a high school student). I had some trauma in which this friend bullied me before, but we became friends again although she never fully apologized for socially isolating me. She also told me recently that she didn't think I ever liked her anyway since we became friends after the bullying incident. The one time I talked to her about my problems in that time was when I would talk to her about my parents divorcing, but she didn't really feel it mattered. Though, I started asking her more about why she bullied me years ago, and I grew to trust her again to talk about trauma or challenges since quarantine. Though, I have social anxiety of reaching out for social connection, so I don't talk to her as much about topics she likes. Overall, my friend thinks our friendship has gone stale and that I am toxic. I wish I could find a balance between getting enough mental support and not burdening my friends. 

I feel like a bad person, but I try to tell myself thay no person is truly bad if they try to improve themselves. That's what I hope to do :)"
1792,Venting about the mental health program,"	Please whatever you do, do not ever go to the Florida Assertive Community Treatment Team, an outpatient mental health program. Although they helped me find a place to live. However, it came at a cost. Today I spoke to my Case Manager here's how it went. \[It is kind of long\]

I told him I had some concerns I would like to address. The first thing I asked for is a copy of my lease because I rushed while signing it and I was unsure what was in it. The second thing I asked for is a reason as to why I am responsible for paying the whole house 3 bedrooms 1 bath worth's of rent when I am only renting one room and not allowed any guest or roommates over. I told him that the last tenant told me she didn't have to pay the whole house worth's of rent. My CM told me it was not true and began to explain that the tenant did pay the totality of rent. He then passed me to his supervisor.

		 The health care administrator who works in that office told me she would discharge me from the program, effective today, and I would have to find a new place to live even though that is not how the FACT team really works. She was just trying to bully me into leaving a program that pays part of my rent. I was not going to let that happen. She then told me I was responsible for paying the utility or they would discharge me. To that I told her that I already paid the utility bill (even though it is not under my name).

This is where things got ugly. she then stated, ""Then why are you calling bitching about it?"" . I told her she needed to act as the professional she was hired to be. I replicated her attitude. I told her everything that was on my mind. She hung up so I called back. Then she kept hanging up each time. 

		I filed two reports with civil rights and the MHRCF. I described to them the way in which the health care administrator has conducted herself from the first time I had a problem with her. She has stated in the past that I was ""looking for attention,"" when I tried to get the office to relay a message to the doctor to please adjust my medicine because I was not feeling well. This later in the same month led to my hospitalization.

		Also, I told them about her racist remark towards me in June 2020 "" Did you learn all your letters in Haiti yet?""  ""I know you, you're a trouble maker,"" and ""Go to the streets. Do it right now!"" Last but not least ""I will Baker Act you!"" A statement she made 12 times because she felt like she was ""going in circles"" with our conversation. Even though it is illegal for one to placed under Baker Act when they don't meet the criteria.

	I am still awaiting civil rights as I filed online but as for MHRCF they contacted her supervisor right away. Just do me a favor and make sure you never end up in my position-wanting to leave because of bullying and discrimination, but not leaving because the bully would win."

1798,Questions about getting therapy.,"Heyo

So I’ve decided I want to give therapy another try.  

For context I am an 18 year old female, I’ve only been to therapy for 3 weeks at the beginning of this year until covid closed my college.

I had the opportunity to move things online but I decided not to at the time.

Ideally I would like to receive diagnoses, medication, and talk therapy all together. Can I do that all with one person or will I need several people?

Also how does online therapy compare to in person? Would you say it is better or worse? Any pros and cons would be great information. (Also tips for doing online therapy in a small house would be great).

Finally I was wondering how I would ask my dad about all this. Earlier in the year he offered to get me therapy after all the things he did when I was a child (he had undiagnosed/now diagnosed ptsd for much of my childhood along with being an alcoholic). 

I am not really good at conveying my emotions to other people though I really can’t avoid such a topic when asking for therapy. I’ve been suspicious that I have depression, aspergers, and c-ptsd (to name the most likely candidates). I’ve self harmed for years (nothing major though) and have been suicidal since I was ~11.

I don’t really know how to bring this up to my dad though, I know he will probably let me get therapy regardless I am just not used to the idea of opening myself up like this, especially to him (he was very militaristic when I was a kid and emotions were usually seen as a bad things).

Any advice or personal experiences you guys can share would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You!!! ♡︎♡︎♡︎"

any advice? thank you"

1802,so much to say,"i cant really put anything into words right now. i recently was very guilty and am now very angry but all throughout my mind is remaining cloudy and i cant think straight. It might be bcause of my sleep deprivation



because of this i just cant be bothered and enjoy the things (watching shows/reading books/playing games) and hobbies i used to do (piano/art). i havent had much to talk to except a word document, since my parents arent that supportive.

all my problems have been stagnating and becoming cloudier after i bottle them up- i dont deny this. I tend to do this with all my emotions except anger and sadness at home

my mum avoids speaking to me about serious topics nowadays because she fears for it devolving into an argument. she is pretty tired throughout the day and i dont know hy tbh, she works above normal hours but doesnt do night shifts. My mum either says that shes too tired to speak or doesnt want an argument. And what the fuck am i meant to do then? I remember i think it was some time last year when she said people at my age then (15) dont get any serious depression and dont have serious mental issues unless they are a genetic trait. So i assume i cant speak to her about that.

There does exist some sort of language barrier between me and my dad as he cant understand full english. When i talk about my problems with my family, he always says that i just need to listen to them and everything will be alright. One time when my sister and i got into a fight, he immediately supported my sister. Today, i got extremely mad at my mum and he immediately supported her. There seems to be a pattern.

My mum and my sister have said some horrid stuff to me, although mostly in our parents’ native language. My sister did say a couple of times a while back to me to kill myself, which didnt really help at that time seeming as though i was thinking a lot about death around that time. My mum gives me threats in the other language but when i asked her when she was calm and cool, she just said its how she was raised up???? What the fuck i dont want third world parenting in a developed country mum.

On the other hand, my mum does have another side somehow that is pretty much the opposite, where she treats me very nicely. 

Throughout the entire lockdown i reckon, excep for some gatherings i spoke to around 3 people. I started lockdown by just snacking on bars of dark chocolate and noticed i gained weight. Now however, ive lost that weight and even more. Anyway, i felt so empty.

I shouldnt forget to mention my sleep problems caused by chronic procrastination. 

Im generally afraid for my own future, because the way i used to see it a few years back was ambitious and clear, however now ive lost all my ambition and dreams and passions. 

All i do is waste my time on reddit. 

I wish more people at school talked to me, as they are all pretty friendly, but they just have an amount of energy i just cant match to fit in. 

I tried talking to some people online, but every single time, there seemed like there was some barrier between us- like for example i was talking to a person about life and then the conversation devolved into politics and how our native countries have conflict.Another one of my longest term friends recently left the religion that i follow, (please dont hate on me being a religious person reddit) and the festivals every year and going to the prayer place was generally the main times we ever met. Now its not like we cant be friends anymore, its just that just like other friends of mine, we are becoming more distant. Another one of my longest term friends moved  away a couple of years ago and although i have moved on a long time ago, it just shows how im becoming distant with everyone. And THE closest friend i have talks to me much less and shares barely any interests anymore. Things wouldnt be so much of a problem if i was getting closer to someone or some people.

barring reddit, i dont use social media that much anymore

The main things keeping me from wanting everything to end is :

me wanting to have kids who i can give a great life and be the best father i could be

my fear of god [again, please dont shit on me reddit :(   ]

me being able to make mends with everyone and seeing if i could be successful. My parents used to say i have a bright future but now they say you need to quickly decide on your future. I used to have this nursery or reception teacher that , when i was leaving for a different one, said to my dad that “whereever he (me, u/safinhh) goes, he will be able to fit in”. My dad quotes this and tends to this memory like its a damn prophecy


There may be some other things like


WHILE FUCKING WRITING THIS MY DAD CAME IN AND CAME JUST TO FUCKING ARGUE I WANT TO BEAT SOMETHING UP HE GOT MAD AT ME FOR SAYING PLEASE LEAVE WHAT THE FUCK. HONESTLY SOMETIMES I WANT TO HIT HIM SQUARE IN THE FACE

my mind sometimes has conversations with my consciousnes

1804,I don’t know what I’m doing with my life.,"Oh man. Where to begin. Sorry if this is long I’ve been holding this in for far too long. 
  Last year I lost my best friend, he didn’t die we just lost contact, and when I tell you this guy always lit my world I truly mean it. He was really smart, funny i mean this guy made me laugh so hard in my worst days and my best days, oh man I absolutely adored him. In the middle of all the chaos I graduated high school, and we all know how that goes you either go to school or you start working. I was one of the few who started working and it wasn’t enough for my mom so I signed up for the navy to make her proud. A couple weeks after I joined my best friend reached out and we caught up and we kept in contact for only a while and then yet again he leaves. I mean I can’t blame him he was in high school and he’s meeting new people but I never thought he’d fall into the wrong crowd. Anyway, it’s been a year and I haven’t shipped out yet. I feel like I’m not making any progress in my life whatsoever; people tell me “oh but you’re young” “it’s okay to be confused” like it’s not that I just feel stuck, broken, and unheard. My best friend had depression and we would help one another in a way I never thought possible. I mean this guy was just that special someone. No one knows me like he does, my bad sides and my good sides he dealt with all of it. And I with him. Part of me feels like he left because he was getting better and I was getting worse and I stopped helping him and I would bring him down and he just left. I don’t know. I dwell on him far too much."

1806,"I strongly believe I have depression and anxiety, friends and family members, say I should I see someone about it, but I disagree... Asking for you guys' opinion? (24, M, UK)","So, I have high-functioning Asperger's and although I have never been diagnosed with either, I strongly believe I have mild depression and moderate social anxiety, although when it gets to tough times of year for me, my depression can get to the point where I lose motivation to eat for a day or two although I still get up for, and go to work, still look after myself in terms of appearance and hygiene and I still get things done but since that lack of motivation to eat only lasts at most 2 days, I wouldn't say there'd be any problems. 

Although I have been suicidal, driven to alcohol (mostly to combat the insomnia from my Asperger's which, yeah I know isn't a good idea, but I don't drink anymore and my insomnia is still there but nowhere near as bad as it was) and having the lack of motivation to leave my bed in the past, about 3-4 years ago was my worst, that was due to what I had going on at the time, which was a hell of a lot (3 family deaths, failing my degree, losing my main group of friends at that time due to romantic reasons with one of the friends).

People keep saying that I should see a doctor and get officially diagnosed with the depression and anxiety either to organise a psychologist or be put on medication. 

My reasoning behind not wanting to get diagnosed is, I feel it'll go one of 3 ways if I am diagnosed:-

- They recommend me to a psychologist or whatever who will basically get me to just question every decision I make asking ""why I did this?"", ""why I didn't do that?"" And ""what were my thought processes at the time?"" Which I do anyway since I have a very philosophical mind from my Asperger's and I like to question things throughout my life, so I'd see that as pointless.

- They put me on anti-depressants or whatever other drugs but I wouldn't want this because, I'd have thought this would basically numb me emotionally. The reason I wouldn't like this is I love emotional music and films and I'd still want to be able to get emotionally invested in such things but from my college-level understanding of biology and chemistry, all I'd guess anti-depressants would do is force releases of serotonin and dopamine to force your brain to be happy, which I wouldn't want due to a lot of things I enjoy being linked to my sadness like film and music.

- They decide I do have it but not strong enough to do anything about and so then it's just something on my medical record that I have, which seems pointless to me.

Because the only way in which I'd say it is currently impacting my life externally is when my family is worrying about me not eating for a couple of days at the the tough times of year. Should I stick to not getting diagnosed with either or should I actually do something about it? Thanks"
1807,I’m a dangerous person.,"So I’m not sure if this is a mental health thing, but here goes. 
I’m not a good person anymore. I’ve basically decided, who knows how long ago, to really only care about me. 

“Tbh you really should have that figured out babe; you're almost 30 and still just don't really know how to be aware of when you're fucking people over”

“You're a physically intimidating grown man who likes to walk over people to have your own good time. You hurt people without thinking about it so you can have fun. You're like, a very mentally and emotionally dangerous person to be in situations like that with because you mostly just think about yourself and how you should be in control”

Got that from my partner today. I think she’s right. 
I don’t know how to fix it. Unless I know nothing about the subject, I think I’m the smartest guy in the room. When people don’t have solid boundaries I’ll just push on them a little till they break. 
I’m the guy in control in pretty well all my relationships. Friends or family or dating. 
I legitimately don’t know how to stop forcing things. 
I used to think of myself as a pretty easy going person, but looking back this has been a problem for years. I don’t know if it’s learned or if I’m just broken somewhere in my brain. 

How do you become a better person?"
1808,getting a psych evaluation??,"this is more of a rant sorry if it doesn’t make sense

my parents ignored or were blind to my mental health issues while i was growing up (i’m 19 now). of course i hid my inner emotions and attempt, so i can’t blame them for not knowing that. but i’ve had a lottt of manic episodes that were clear. and i have been hospitalized once (almost twice). i think it’s pretty clear there’s something fucking wrong

i want to get a psych evaluation so i can know whats causing me to act and think how i do, but they’re all so expensive (lowest i found was $100 and they don’t take my insurance) and take forever to get the results (4-6 weeks). AND i definitely can’t afford treatment/meds so what’s the point...

i’ve been diagnosed with depression but i feel i’ve been misdiagnosed, i have too many symptoms of mania. and since i’m in a lot of psych and social work classes, i just keep learning more and more about mood disorders. all signs point to bipolar.

i guess i just want a psych evaluation to give me reassurance that there’s a reason for all of my bad actions and thoughts. i don’t know what to do...."
1809,I’m so tired of life right now,"2020 has messed me up and broken me. I’m failing in school, my grandmother died, I’ve lost all of my friends, and every day I just find it harder to just stay normal.

If anyone is triggered by racist/homophobic/xenophobic/transphobic, basically anything like that please don't read on thanks :)

Also mentions of rape, child abuse, murder, etc though this will be very minor so if that's triggers you, be warned, thank you  again.

Forgot to mention, Hitler is talked about and what he \*did\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If it were any other day, this would be a suicide help but, at this point, it's the opposite: homocide..

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so over the past few days my brother has been saying really racist, homophobic, etc stuff about literally everyone and everything and each time he opens his mouth, I want to punch him or stab him so hard that he isn't able to open his mouth again. I'm not talking 'oh black people are thieves', etc, no. That's nothing compared to what he says. 

To start things off, he is autistic (he says it's aspergers but us autistics know that's a very bad diagnosis) and all the things he says he will look through it but he won't take in anything that is known to everyone and instead listens to all the little things that people literally make up (he won't read news cause apparently it's all wrong, even though it is right in the whole, the exaggerations are the issues. Instead he reads things that anyone could make up like PDF files he finds or that one website on page 6068 on Google). 

Today and two days ago was when it affected me the most. He keeps saying that feminism is evil because women are apparently stupid and they don't know anything. 

This is very minor with what I'm about to say now so please stop reading if this is bad for you.

&amp;#x200B;

He says that muslims are only over here to rape our little girls, that LGBT (or as he calls us 'LGTB') people are trying to overpower us or something. He says that people in prison should be given knives and stuff so they end up being able to hold a weapon in public without attempting to kill someone (he's talking about rapists and murderers here or people who've stabbed overs, etc). He fucking said that I am just a 'lady boy' or whatever cause I'm trans. He even showed me a firstnews paper (he says firstnews is full of crap, etc) and he said that a black dude is stood infront of a white dude which shows that black people are taking over, I pointed out that there's a white kid on the opposite page and he said 'oh he's an ugly ginger kid' which I'm assuming means that he thinks ginger kids are less important or whatever that white men? He then said Hitler killed Jews cause of how they look, not because their grandparents/parents/wife/husband/themselves were jews, I even looked through everywhere on the internet to find proof that Hitler sent the Jews to concentration camps because they were jews/related to jewish people and he still told me that I was wrong. He says men need to stop being obsessed with computer games and makeup because 'it lowers their testosterone levels'. He says that the UK didn't take over Africa and force slavery but rather we 'went there to help them learn to farm'. He says that Covid is just the flu when my dad literally got rushed in to hospital today over a bloody stomach bug cause of how ill he is (his extremely vulnerable). He says we don't need to wear masks because it lowers our immune system (which I agree with a bit but my dad WILL DIE if he gets the flu/covid) and in winter all our kids will die in the world cause they have weakened immune systems. He says that my dad only has a minor disease or whatever when this is the last stage now, he's gonna have a tube straight to his heart for meds 24 hours a day flowing unless he gets a double lung AND heart TRANSPLANT, he's literally going to die soon. He was given three years, it will be three years in July. 

It just fucking sucks having a brother like him. I would just rather not be alive or fucking strangle him, with my bare hands. Just fucking jump out a 50 story high window or lob him into an ocean. I just can't handle this anymore. My mum won't even cut of ties with him because 'hes her son' and 'I need to see me grandchild' and I'm like that kid will literally fucking die cause he things superglue will heal everything and that plasters/bandages will be worse than playing in mud and dirt with an open wound. I can't do this anymore. I really just can't. I don't think I will be able to hold it together the next time I see him (probably tomorrow) and I might end up doing something I regret but I  can't do anything about it and it fucking sucks, okay. I can't do it...

I'm not expecting anyone to read this lol but I guess it's better than ending my life right now I guess? Or arguing with HIM (I don't even want to associate him with family anymore) until late in the night. ."

1812,I hate myself," its a long story, to sum it up in few sentences:  
I (17 yo) was abused  by my parents when i was a kid, my father was absent always, i have  daddy issues, i have issues with belonging due to the enviroment i lived  in, irealized at a young age that my mom is not a good mother and  doesnt relly love me, since then i have trust issues and very strict  rules with any relationship  
i struggle with all kinds of   relationships, dont have a family or a place to call home. I got so fed  up when the girl i love actually made me realize she has a loving  family. 17 years, and i never fell in love thinking that the girl i  think of is as good for me doesnt exist, until she actually showed up!  Since i saw her being the best person ever, with a family i lost my  interest in her, i felt so jealous. I wish to have a family, a father at  least, but this never happened. I really dont want her anymore, i feel  so jealous yet so sad because well u know how family is! it is the most  important thing ever, too bad i dont have one. I really dont know what i  should do anymore, i cant keep a friend or even the girl that made my  life better. I hate this"

1814,In patient options,"I know, without a single doubt, that I need help very very soon. I've had friends and family members who've had horrific experiences in publicly supported behavioral health centers and I can't do it, I'm afraid it's too risky.

However, I have been advised that an in patient facility is my best hope, but isolation is a huge part of my problem.  So, as you can imagine, complications related to Covid - no visitation, limited staffing, etc., combined with autoimmune issues (Type 1 Diabetes, Lupus, etc) have made my mental health provider wary of pushing me to admit myself. She also is not fully aware of how *nothing* I am.

And, as silly as it sounds, she and I are both resistant to separating me from my dogs and cat. They are my positive thing to hold on to.

I don't have any friends. My husband loves me, but is not a support. I can't tell my parents, as they are elderly and I CANNOT burden their brains with this. Totally out of the question, they don't deserve that. They are wonderful people.

I can't exaggerate how strongly I loathe myself - without reservation, everyone would be better without me. My existence adds nothing but stress.

I tried in-person therapy, but I just couldn't. Hard to explain, but the overall issues are that I don't deserve it and can't break away from presenting myself in a way that doesn't worry others. 

I guess I'd just like to hear advice on what alternatives are out there. Whatever source of help anyone could suggest.

In reading through this sub, I see how strong so many of you are - even if you don't know it. So thank you for sharing your stories."
1815,I'm bad at asking for things.,"I genuinely think I have some kind of anxiety, I've never been to a doctor or psychiatrist for it but my symptoms seem similar enough to them to raise concern in me. The problem is I'm no good at asking. For the last couple of years, I've never asked to go to the doctor once unless I was really sickly or in physical pain. My parents have gotten used to that and I have too. I don't know how I'd even ask them.

  My family isn't very understanding of mental health. I've had my dad jokingly call my friend a ""retard"" for having depression and anxiety. Mind you, it was all in jest, sure it was insensitive, but he said it to me and not to his face. It's not that they don't believe disorders are real or anything, I just think that they don't understand exactly what they are. I also don't know if it's covered by my insurance and we aren't in the best situation to spend. So, asking them to have me checked up for something like this is very worrying to me and just scares me. 

  My mental health has been going down the drain recently after the quarantine, I think I've always had pretty bad mental health but quarantine has actually made it a problem for me. I got put into an AP-Course (a special program for college credits that smart people take) by complete mistake after asking a teacher if I could be put into honors and I can't handle it. The class is just too difficult for me, especially when compared to the rest of my classes. I haven't been able to get much work done for my classes in general since it takes a lot of effort for me to want to get out of bed, and I dread having to do work for the class since most of the questions fly over my head like a plane. I really want to drop out of it but the period for that ended, and I'm too scared of opening up and telling my counselor about this or even the teacher. 

  The worst part of it all is if don't do both of these things I'm going to face a lot of backlash for it. My teachers are going to call my parents, they'll yell at me, I won't be able to get caught up because It's genuinely too hard for me to understand, and I'll get yelled at or even grounded for something that I'm too afraid to prevent. 

I know if I asked my parents would probably understand, and my teacher would probably understand as well, but it's that ""probably"" that scares me. I don't feel comfortable asking anyone right now, im just too 'scared'. I don't even know if that's the right word for it, I just get this horrible feeling in my gut about it.

 Sorry for the wall of text though and if you read it all the way through then thanks for your endurance. 

Also, the 'retard' thing was in private and I and my parents tend to be blunt to each other and not beat around the bush so it's not that he has any resentment to disabled people or anything. He just thought it'd be funny to say something offensive I guess.

  
TL;DR: I think I have anxiety and am too afraid to ask my parents to get me checked out,  but if I don't then nothing good can come out of it."

I don’t show up to school, I don’t go to the gym, I don’t clean my room, I don’t even brush my teeth if I’m home all day. I only do things if I HAVE to. I have had 2 jobs before though and I did great, I showed up on time every day, but actually getting there to the job was so difficult. 

I’m going to be 18 soon, and thinking of having to do taxes, having to apply and go to college, having bills, rent, having a job, possibly going into the military, all that shit on top of juggling family, friends, and possibly children seems so insurmountably, monstrously overwhelming that it makes me feel like my only option is to kill myself

I want you to know that it's okay to be angry, disappointed, and hurt that you've found yourself down here again. let yourself feel all of that. cry it out if that works. have compassion for the part of you that's tired of this.

and offer yourself forgiveness. because the other part of you, the one that knew you should have gone to bed early but didn't, the one that chose negative self talk knowing it only makes things worse, the one that just will not get up and do those dishes? that's also your self, and they're also in pain. they know they've let you down. you don't have to keep kicking them now.

forgive. make space for what hurts. do what you can, and love yourself through it. even if that means putting on a sad song to sweep the floor just a little, even if you eat something quick, easy, and processed, even if you manage a shower but plop right back onto your bed. it's okay. you still matter. you're still worthy. you're always, always loved.

Ten years ago I was diagnosed as bipolar and hospitalized. I was prescribed lithium and abilify. I stopped medication and seeking help for my mental health for 7 years. 

I have struggled with relocating bouts of depression lasting months where I have been suicidal and attempted. 


My paper work from my former doctor was lost and my current doctor has no info on my medical history and my struggle with mental health.

Will I likely be presided medication based off of a bipolar diagnosis or will I have to be re-evaluated before receiving treatment.

Some people are naturally more sociable and I wish I was one of them.

I don't have any major mental health issues.

1825,I think I fucked up my mental health by becoming addicted to shoplifting,"I started shoplifting about 3 years ago. It was mostly small stuff like art supplies and misc stuff from target. Once I realized how easy it is to steal, I went all out. My former proudest accomplishment was that I’ve stolen 20 pairs of airpods from Apple stores. I know I’ve stolen well over $5k worth of various products from groceries to video games and otc drugs. I can be charged with a felony with the amount of theft I’ve done. I’ve only been confronted by a worker once and I was easily able to escape. 

Shoplifting was stress relief for me. If I felt sad or anxious, I could just go and steal shit and I’d feel better. I got addicted. Sometimes I would take stuff I don’t even need just to feel the rush of stealing it. I’m so fucking lucky I’ve never gotten in legal trouble because of it. 

About a month ago, I took some nicotine gum from target, and a loss prevention officer followed me to the door and stopped once I left the store. I don’t know why, but that was my breaking point. After that, I’m too scared to even take something small. I keep getting dreams that I get caught and shown everything I’ve ever stolen, or I set off alarm towers at a store without taking anything and being unable to run away. The dreams feel traumatic. 

Now I’m constantly paranoid. I’m scared to buy groceries, I panic whenever I get a call from an unknown caller or someone knocks at my door. I really fucked up. This is nobody’s fault but my own, and now I’m paying the psychological consequences. I don’t know how I’ll ever feel normal or comfortable again while shopping. I constantly think about how stores are building cases and want to arrest me the next time I go in, or if the police are figuring out my info so they can arrest me. 

I’m sorry for this rant. I need to get it off my chest. I need help, but I’m afraid I’ll be turned in if I share what I’ve done. What do I do? I just want to feel normal."

1828,Been feeling sorta (not fully) detached from my emotions for so long and don't know how to fix it,"So for about  3 years now I've had some trouble with my mental health which I'm not surprised my lifestyle was sitting inside playing games all day eating junk food and drinking coke all day. I started to feel depressed after something happened in high school. After that little period I was sorta detached from my emotions and my way of thinking was terrible it was soo negative which just made me a negative person, since I started a new college last year I've started to feel a lot better and I've started looking after myself by going out for a walk almost everyday and I eat and drink a lot better I only drink one coke a day (if that sometimes its once every few days) and drink mainly water now I have also tried a lot of new foods to broaden my pallet and get more vitamins but it hasn't changed much, I still feel better than last year but it feels I've hit a wall and don't know how to progress further like this year I've only actually felt happy a handful of times and when I'm happy I think positive and I am confident and don't care what people think and come across better more how I want to be. But when I'm not happy (I've only been happy for about 10 days at most this year and still I think that's a bit high of a guess) and when I'm not feeling it I'm quiet and when I try to be social I either A: don't say anything, or B: force myself to say something to try and be social and throw myself in the deep end and it comes across rude like the way I say it like its almost all the time I'm like this now in conversations I am mainly not very talkative on call to my friends and try my best but don't know what to talk about. I'm sorry for the little rant just kind of needed to let it out"
1829,exhausted,"tw suicide mention 

i’m so fucking stupid. usually this wouldn’t bother me so much but i’m mentally on the brink and i keep thinking that there’s no point in me trying if i’m destined for nothing anyway. i can’t get anything right and i’m so spaced out all the time. i ask stupid questions and people get annoyed at me for it and then i feel worthless. i’m an idiot. my uncle killed himself a few months ago and we weren’t that close but when i think about it, it scares me that i could be 57 and still feel this way."

I  don't  even know if I have depression or other thing, I am just...tired  of all  this. I just want to be a functional member of the society and I  don't  understand why I can't."
1832,Confusing emotions.,I’ve posted many times in the past about a troublesome relationship I was in. I broke it off with her about 6 or so months ago. It was a rough breakup and we were on and off a little afterwards. We got in arguments after the final breakup a couple times and decided to stop talking. I began talking to new people and met someone and Began a relationship that started 3 months ago. Last month my ex gave me my clothes that I had let her have during the relationship and it tore me apart. But I quickly recovered. But starting yesterday all of my grief and regret has come back to me and I want to see her again. I also woke up feeling depressed and empty. I hate feeling like this and I question why these feelings have come back to me.
1833,Am I a psychopath?,[removed]
1834,How to tell someone that I might be suicidal?,"I've been living with depression for the last couple of months and it's now to the point where I just don't want to live anymore. I'm tired of living day in day out doing the same thing and being trapped in the routine that I'm in. I rarely feel joy anymore and think I'd be better off no longer existing. It's weird because I don't really want to die, I just want to stop feeling so miserable.

My girlfriend's said she's noticed a change in me recently and that she's worried about me, but has made it clear that if I don't want to talk about it I don't have to and she'll never judge me for any of it. I really want to tell her about it, or at least someone in my life, but I'm just worried because I know she'll get really concerned about me and I don't want her to be worrying about me more than she already is.

I've rarely told anyone in my life about feeling depressed before, I simply have issues with opening up, so how can I tell someone about this?"
1835,I feel like self harming even when I’m happy,"Recently things have gotten worse with my mental health, I’m getting suicidal thoughts for the first time in years and have started self harming again. 
Today I had a good day where nothing went wrong and I didn’t feel bad in the slightest. When I got home I suddenly felt like I needed to do it and when I stopped myself my anxiety got worse and worse until I felt so bad that it was all I could think about. 
I have people in my life that care but as someone who has had people overwhelm me with their issues I feel like I can’t approach them to talk about it, without my anxiety getting worse and it going in a cycle.
I don’t know what to do."
1836,I know I shouldn’t but I want to,"
For the past 6 months I have extremely down and the only thing I’ve been using to fix it is various substances. I have started using one that is particularly bad and is rampant in my county. It worries me so much bc I already have other addictions so I can see myself getting hooked on this. I’m scared for myself honestly. I feel so selfish bc I wouldn’t mind if it took my life over or just took my life completely bc I have secretly been wanting to do so myself. I try to talk about it with the only people around me and they don’t seem to know what to do with me. It’s my mom and my bf. I tell them and they just tell me I hve to get out of this, that I just need to sleep better or eat better or something. You know, “thanks I’m cured” kinda advice. But I try. I’ve been taking meds and they help to not make me so angry but the depression is heavier now. I don’t have any motivation and not even a lot of strength to get up and do things like take a walk or mop the house. I try to remind myself why I want to get better but then I think “it’s not even worth it I’m pathetic I might as well get fucked up or die” I have a therapy appointment but I’m terrified of doing it over the phone for some reason. And even in person it’s too much for me. I’m trying to get better with saying how I feel out loud to other people but it always ends in me having an intense crying fit and whoever I’m talking to getting really annoyed. Honestly I’d prefer to go to an inpatient facility. I want to detox from this world. No phones, no drugs, no triggers, no one begging me to just hurry up and get better. I just want to feel in a safe place with people around me who understand. I want to stay there until I get better and I’m able to be in society and not get triggered into doing more drugs or just done right SHing. But I’m scared. I’m scared my mom will be mad at me or ask if I’m really “one of those crazy people”. She worked in a mental health facility and always compares my crying or breakdowns to the patients. Or my sister will judge me for not growing up and being strong like her. She had a kid young and still managed to get a license by herself and support my mom and I for 5 years. And I’m scared my bf will be embarrassed to be with a girl who was in the hospital. He has depression too but he has a “shake it off” kinda thing. I was telling him how I felt today and he told me I had to “get out of that”. So I just started crying and he... fell asleep. Or that my dad will be ashamed because he thought I was done with “these games” And I’m scared that it’ll mess up my chances of getting a good job when I’m a bit older, or any job for that matter. But I feel like I’m really close to doing something to hurt myself really bad, intentionally or accidentally. I did too much drugs the other night and my brain was fried. I thru up a lot and my body couldn’t stop buzzing. I was out of it and according to the internet that happened bc I took too much and that could have lead to my death. I caught myself thinking that I wish it had."
1837,I do nothing with my life,"Currently I’m 23, I wake up, distract myself with video games, go to bed, and do it all over. I don’t do anything good, but nothing bad either. I’m not into drugs or drinking (sometimes I wish I was) I have no stories to tell, all I’ve really ever done with my life I’d be sad, angry, pity myself, avoid things and be afraid. Im beyond lost and afraid to change and take ahold of my life."
1838,I think my therapist works for Nike,"So for a few years now I’ve had a lot of trouble mentally with my PTSD and depression. I’ve had several trigger this year (thanks 2020) and started to get really bad again so I decided it was time to find a therapist. The therapist I had as a kid moved away (I live in a military town) and so I had to go search for another one. I waited six months to go to see a psychotherapist (I asked for this specifically when I made the appointment). The time finally came to go and see the lady, turns out they scheduled me to meet with a psychiatrist. Whatever, got some prozac and got some recommendations on people to see. Made an appointment that day for another doctor in two weeks. Great. I meet with her via zoom and the first session, I just explained my situation and background/diagnosis of mental disorders. The next appointment, she mostly talking about these other tests and therapy options but that we would have to meet more than once a month to do them. I’m financially pressed so I can’t do that and I tell her several times but she seems to just keep pressing it on me to try to get me to agree to come in more often. To be honest, I felt like she talked for than I did. The next appointment, I tell her that the main reason I wanted to go back to therapy was to be able to do the things I wanted/needed to do because I feel like I’ve lost the motivation to do it. She tells me to just “don’t think about it and force yourself to do it. Just do it”. Like what the fuck kind of advice is that?? I can barely convince myself to get out of bed in the morning... I know I need to and I know that I want to but I just can’t. So I guess the best advice that our trained professionals have for that is to “just do it”. Maybe she used to work for Nike? Is this real life?"

1846,I’ve fallen and need to change something,"I want it preface this by saying I’ve never seriously though about suicide before. It’s crossed my mind but was never truly an option for me. A few days ago I was at an obstacle course suspended about 20-50 feet above the ground. The only thing stopping you from falling was two hooks attached to a harness, that had to be hooked on at various point. Past the first course there was no supervision from the staff at all. I was at the back of my group, meaning I was on my own at various points (only one person was supposed to cross a section of the course at a time). On a few of these occasions I kept looking over the edge and just thinking about unhooking and jumping off. The worse part about it is that it was the thought of my friends and family being there and seeing my jump that stopped me. It was the fact that I was having a good day. The aforementioned though never even crossed my mind. I fear I’m falling to a place that I won’t be able to get back from."
1847,Do others go straight to suicidal thoughts when in a depressive slump?,"It recently occurred to me (22F) that this might not be an experience shared by most but I’m not sure. 

TLDR: Do others go straight to suicidal thoughts when in a depressive episode? 

Things are getting better for me, the constant apathy around my own life has lifted, and now I experience a range of emotions from joy and happiness right down to suicidal. I have a history of suicidal thoughts/tendencies, but these days, if I’m feeling depressed, I’m feeling suicidal.

I had a short period of feeling really depressed a few weeks back, and went straight to suicidal thoughts. It wasn’t until I was on the up that I remembered some people seem to be depressed without being suicidal. This seems like such a foreign concept to me. 

Do others experience what I do - having suicidal thoughts go hand in hand with depression, and are there people who feel depressed without feeling suicidal? 

Sorry if that’s a dumb question I’m just struggling to get my head around it"
